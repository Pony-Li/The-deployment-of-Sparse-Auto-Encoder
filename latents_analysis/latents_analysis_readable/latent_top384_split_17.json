  "latent_37": "Over the past five years the Chinese government has expanded its campaign to constrain foreign news outlets from casting China in a negative light, according to a report released today by the non-government organization Freedom House.\n\nThe report, entitled The Long Shadow of Chinese Censorship: How Chinese Media Restrictions Affect News Outlets around the World, notes that the Chinese Communist Party has tried to clamp down on free media for the past two decades. However, Sarah Cook, the report’s author, says that this campaign has grown increasingly intense over the past half-decade.\n\n“The Chinese government’s efforts to influence reporting by foreign and overseas Chinese news outlets have intensified and expanded over the past five years,” Cook writes.\n\nAlthough the CCP’s global war against a free media is multifaceted, Ms. Cook identifies four key strategies the government uses to prevent international media outlets from reporting on topics it considers sensitive. These include:\n\nDirect action by Chinese authorities inside and outside the country to obstruct newsgathering, prevent the publication of undesirable content, and punish overseas media outlets that fail to heed restrictions. Offering economic carrots and sticks to induce self-censorship among media outlets with a Chinese presence. “Indirect pressure applied via proxies–including advertisers, satellite firms, and foreign governments–who take action to prevent or punish the publication of content critical of Beijing.” Non-traceable cyberattacks and physical assaults against international media websites.\n\nMs. Cook goes on to explain that the CCP utilizes different tactics depending on the type of news organization that it is targeting. For example, it relies heavily on cyberattacks to target large international media outlets like CNN and The New York Times, as well as obstructing their ability to report from inside the country by harassing the reporters and their Chinese assistants and denying them visas.\n\nIn addition, at times Chinese diplomats have met directly with senior executives of large international media outlets to try and persuade them to not run or to remove stories that cast the CCP and its leaders in a negative light. In one notable incident, the president of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China, Peter Ford, claims that Chinese authorities threatened him and the organization with “serious consequences” for posting notes about media freedom conditions in China on its website.\n\nOn the other hand, in countries in South and Southeast Asia where China has enormous economic leverage, Beijing often uses local government officials to force their national newspapers to report on China in a positive light. Some countries, like Vietnam, have arrested citizens who have failed to heed that lesson. Elsewhere in Asia, as well as in Africa and Latin America, the CCP has mostly focused on expanding the presence of state-run Chinese media outlets rather than restricting local media organization’s reporting.\n\nThe CCP has also gone to greater lengths in recent years to control the editorial lines of media outlets in Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\n“Co-opting owners of media outlets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Chinese diaspora in order to marginalize dissenting reporting and commentary has been a key strategy,” the report states. “Outlets and owners whose reporting portrays Beijing positively are frequently rewarded with advertising, lucrative contracts for non-media enterprises, joint ventures, and even political appointments. When such tactics fail to reach their objectives, more heavy-handed approaches have been used.”\n\nIn Hong Kong, Cook notes, this increasingly extends into trying to frame reporting on internal Hong Kong politics in ways that are favorable to Beijing. In Taiwan, on the other hand, the CCP has stayed away from trying to shape reporting on subjects like Taiwanese independence. Instead, its efforts in the country are aimed at ensuring favorable coverage of mainland China itself.\n\nThe report notes that some of the CCP’s most aggressive efforts have been directed against overseas independent Chinese-language media outlets, which are widely read on the mainland and highly critical of the CCP. To counter these sources, the CCP has tried to undermine their financial viability and block their ability to access mainland audiences.\n\nMoreover, according to Cook, these websites “suffered advertising boycotts, debilitating cyberattacks, and harassment of contacts in China. In several cases, foreign companies and event organizers–ranging from Apple to Eutelsat to NASDAQ–have barred their access to newsworthy events outside China or assisted in Chinese government efforts to prevent their content from reaching mainland audiences.”\n\nCook notes that the number of subject matters that the CCP aims to control international media coverage of have grown in recent years. Nonetheless, five subjects continue to be the most important to the CCP: Tibet, Xinjiang, the Falun Gong, Chinese democracy activists, and Taiwanese independence. Other subjects that the CCP has targeted are AIDS in China and senior leaders’ personal wealth.\n\nThe report notes that this extensive campaign to stifle international media freedom has only had limited success as hard-hitting reporting on China has continued. Nonetheless, Cook notes that media outlets have had to pay a heavy price for these stories. For example, after The New York Times featured a huge expose on the wealth of former Premier Wen Jiabao, the CCP blocked the NYT’s English and newly launched Chinese-language websites in the mainland. This caused the company’s stock to drop by 20 percent overnight as the NYT had to renegotiate contracts with advertisers.\n\nThe biggest potential threat, then, is that media organizations will practice more self-censorship in order to remain in the CCP’s good graces, and therefore continue to have access to the enormous Chinese market. It’s worth noting that toeing to the CCP is already happening to a much greater extent in other industries such as the movie industry.",

  "latent_232": "Welcome to Atlanta. You guys are from Mons, Belgium, so why don’t you tell us about home?\n\nIt’s called Mons because it’s a hill. It’s an old medieval town, really old. It’s a little town of ten thousand people. It’s where we were born. Underground music there is not that big, not as big as a lot of other towns in Belgium like Brussels and Antwerp. We are in the south of Belgium where people speak in French. Underground music is way more hype in the north of Belgium.\n\nSo Atlanta is a huge city for music, which can lead to more opportunities, but also more competition. Sounds like you have the opposite problems.\n\nWe’ve never been famous at home. 90% of our fans are outside of Belgium.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nIt’s a really small country. It’s only 11 million people. They are making the biggest underground music party in Europe, called Rampage, but when you are an underground artist in Belgium, most of the artists are touring the US or sometimes the UK. The festivals in Belgium don’t really book local artists as much.\n\nI know you guys refer to yourselves as a band, not as DJs. Where do you see that difference?\n\nIt’s a live set. We have two computers and we are loading samples and stems. I play piano on top of it, and we are running effects and loops. We are for sure not DJs. I don’t know where you can put the difference actually between a DJ and a live act. For sure for us in a live act, you just play your own productions the whole set. You can edit them live and re-create some stuff live with the samples you have. We’ll never play other people’s tracks, only a collab we’ve done. DJs more entertain people with their knowledge of music.\n\nDo you think that because DJs are so popular these days, it’s harder for audiences to know what’s going on in a live performance and to appreciate the extra work you’re doing on stage?\n\nYeah, when you just play at a festival in front of thousands of people, for sure. They have no idea what you’re doing. For the fans who have been following us for years, they know. That’s the benefit that real fans can have. They can tell what we’re doing on stage, and they know if it’s not just the original track. Fans who listen to the album and then see us live, they can hear the difference.",
  "latent_425": "Rebuilding the Republic: 3 takeaways from the season-ending loss If Sacramento Republic FC wants to reach the heights of previous seasons, the club will have to address three key weaknesses.\n\nAs anyone who has followed the beautiful game long enough knows, the soccer gods can be quite cruel at times. Just ask this season’s number-one-seeded Real Monarchs or last year’s equally ranked Republic FC side, both of whom lost in dramatic fashion to teams that scraped into the playoffs by the skin of their teeth.\n\nBut on other occasions, the soccer gods can be perfectly reasonable. Though it may sting to hear, Republic FC’s defeat at the hands of Swope Park Rangers on Saturday was a fair result given the team’s play, not just at Children’s Mercy Park, but also throughout the 2017 season.\n\nUnlike the Kansas City side—which is now undefeated through five straight Western Conference playoff home games as the fourth seed—Sacramento failed to reach the level of consistency of years past. In a dynamic environment like USL, this isn’t surprising nor necessarily a mark of failure. Nonetheless, teams like the Rangers, Louisville City FC and Red Bulls II have shown it is possible to achieve constancy in results and make it something to strive for.\n\nThis offseason will no doubt give Republic Head Coach Paul Buckle and his technical staff much to analyze in order to progress toward this goal. Below are three areas they’ll need to address given what we saw against Swope Park Rangers on Saturday.\n\n1. Lack of a true playmaker.\n\nIt’s been a recurring theme since the club lost Danny Barrera to injury early in the season. In the captain’s absence, no one has been able to step into the midfield and add the creative spark this team sorely needs.\n\nAugustin Cazarez and Jeremy Hall have been tasked with manning the midfield without Barrera, but the two are better suited for defensive duties and getting the ball over to this proverbial playmaker(s), rather than orchestrating the offense themselves. In an ideal world, the two would anchor the midfield of a 4-2-3-1 or similar formation with defined defensive midfielder roles.\n\nAgainst the Rangers, Villyan Bijev was deployed in that “10” role behind strikers Sammy Ochoa and Wilson Kneeshaw and showed some promise in the position. The Bulgarian actually had three of Republic’s four best chances to score and had he put one of those away, we may not be having this conversation. Finishing aside, Bijev didn’t have the interplay with Ochoa and Kneeshaw that Buckle probably hoped for, and even if he’d like to build the offense around Bijev as the creative focal point, there’s no guarantee the midfielder will be around next season given that he is on loan.\n\n2. An over-reliance on fullbacks to generate chances.\n\nIn the right tactical scheme, fullbacks can be a phenomenal tool to stretch defenses and add another dimension to a team’s attack. Just ask Pep Guardiola. That said, if you’re going to rely on them to provide width for your team, then you also need a central midfield that contributes to the offense. Otherwise, as was the case for Republic FC on Saturday, you become very predictable moving forward. Swope Park Rangers recognized this and focused on shutting down the wings, knowing full well that the visitors were unable to generate much down the middle (see number 1 above).\n\nThe other obvious issue with relying too heavily on your fullbacks is that when they have an off day or face opposition that keeps them in their own half (see James Kiffe during the first 45 minutes on Saturday), you lose your main source of chances.\n\nOne final note: if fullbacks pushing forward is a big component of your offensive master plan, then their crosses really need to reach the intended targets. Republic FC put in 19 crosses against the Rangers and only three connected with a teammate (15.8% crossing accuracy).\n\n3. Bad finishing.\n\nDespite Sacramento’s insipid play for most of the match, the team had four clear-cut chances to score against the Rangers. One was literally served to them on a golden platter when Ochoa intercepted a bad back pass to Rangers goalkeeper Adrian Zendejas. Yet, as has been the case before, Republic FC was unable to capitalize on any of its opportunities. Against weaker opponents where there are chances aplenty, this can usually be peppered over. But when you’re evenly matched away from home with the season on the line, you need to convert the one chance you get (or in this case, four). This is a problem as old as time and one that isn’t unique to Republic FC, but one that needs to be addressed nonetheless. Outside of getting new players, the way to tackle this issue is by putting your players in better positions to score more often. Addressing the first two points above can go a long way toward accomplishing this.\n\nDo you agree with our analysis? What areas for improvement do you think Republic FC needs to focus during the offseason? Let us know in the comments below.",

From 2001 until taking office as Mayor, he served as the Councilmember representing the 13th District which includes Hollywood, Echo Park, Silver Lake, and Atwater Village.\n\nGarcetti’s early outreach efforts to the tech community + solid stance on the adoption of new / green technologies, as well as his efforts to strengthen the local education / business ecosystem has earned high marks by helping raise and maintain a strong local pool of tech grads, as well as attract outside businesses and techies looking to set up shop in Los Angeles.\n\nGarcetti was raised in the San Fernando Valley and earned his B.A. and M.A. from Columbia University. He studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and the London School of Economics and taught at Occidental College and USC. A fourth generation Angeleno, he and his wife, Amy Elaine Wakeland, have a young daughter. He is a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy reserve and is an avid jazz pianist and photographer.\n\nWe caught up with Mayor Garcetti at a recent citywide bicycling event (Ciclavia), and here is what he had to say about the future of Los Angeles:\n\nCan you shine a light on some of the more notable tech businesses big & small, that have set up shop in LA , and how they play into LA’s overall tech / entertainment ecosystem?\n\nLA is the best tech city in America now. We have more tech jobs here than any other county in America including Santa Clara county in the heart of Silicon Valley, more than New York, more than Boston / Cambridge.\n\nSo companies like Nasty Gal, big companies that are establishing and growing offices like Google here, or whether it’s some of the companies that are coming up inside LA, smaller companies that are beginning to grow large, Los Angeles is THE place to be.\n\nLA has the infrastructure, the ecosystem, and the people, and especially that collision between content and tech which I think LA does best.\n\nWhat is the city doing to attract & retain new businesses in the tech space?\n\nIf you’re a tech business, you’re going to pay the lowest tax rate of our city’s business tax, something that I authored to attract and to grow more tech businesses here.\n\nWe’re also going to help you get your tech company up & running really quickly, with greenlighting straight through the red tape all of the things you need to do.\n\nSo we’re gonna make sure that you as a tech company find other tech companies as part of that ecosystem, get great engineers which we’re graduating more here than even in northern California out of 3 top 25 universities and more, and then we’re gonna support you every step of the way.\n\nWhat technological advances has the city adopted to make life easier for its residents?\n\nOne of the things that I’m proudest of is that a year and a half ago we were the bottom of the barrel in the country for open data. Now we’re ranked 4th in the country.\n\nThis allows app developers, the media, and regular people to learn what their government is doing and develop things that improve their quality of life, from our 311 app that allows you to take a picture of a pothole and we get it fixed that day, or whether it’s looking at some of the more robust apps that we are going to take out of that open data.\n\nWe’ve got the best sensors, we’ve got the best data, now its time to apply them and to see commerce AND the quality of life improve.\n\nTell us about a few of the things that make Los Angeles a great place to live & work.\n\nThe best thing about LA’s tech scene, is our weather and our geography. We’re the gateway to Asia, the gateway to Latin America, western capitol of the United States, and every day is a sunny day, although we could use a little bit more rain, we guarantee at least about 350 a year.\n\nWhat do you see in store for the future of Los Angeles, 2015 and beyond?\n\n2015 and beyond in LA, we’re going to continue to see tech continue to be a faster growing and a bigger part of our local economy.\n\nAs I said, we’re already #1 in tech, but we’re also #1 in manufacturing, #1 in entertainment, #1 in tourism, and where tech is colliding with all these things, whether it’s tourism sites, whether it’s content that’s being created online, this is the place that not only you want to come to, you HAVE to be in.",
  "latent_633": "Misconceptions. Fiction. Myths. All of these surround Psychonauts 2 and FIG—the latest big crowdfunding attempt. Poring through the documents, we’ve gone over and also talked with noted Game Lawyer Zachary Strebeck regarding the crowdfunding situation on Psychonauts 2, investments, and FIG itself. Zachary has previously talked about Crowdfunding on his site extensively so reading his blog could help give you another view on a lot of gaming things in that area, beyond from a business perspective.\n\nLet’s start with a quick recap of what you probably already know. Psychonauts 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed and cult hit Psychonauts by Tim Schafer’s Double Fine. Double Fine was the first gaming company to really get a big cash in on Kickstarter crowdfunding raising over 3.3 million dollars for the Double Fine Adventure, which would later become known as Broken Age, presumably for the fact it was broken into two releases separated by an age.\n\nLast year, FIG was founded along with it’s parent company and set up a team of advisors that reads like a who’s who of big Kickstarter successes company-wise. You have Double Fine, Obsidian, InXile, Harmonix, and more, and all were key players in getting this new crowdfunding portal, designed to be about games and offer investment opportunities in addition to reward crowdfunding, off the ground.\n\nPsychonauts 2 asked for 3.3 million to get funded, the same amount Broken Age got and it recently passed that … So, now that we’ve got all that out of the way, let’s talk about specific points on FIG, investment stuff, and of course Psychonauts 2.\n\nFIG Just Handles Crowdfunding\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThis isn’t how FIG is working and we’re going to simplify a bit here so that we don’t end up in a giant chart of convolution because FIG is doing something a bit different. In essence, FIG is the co-publisher for the game via its subsidiary that the money for investments is put in and handles things like promotion, store access, and other traditional publisher duties. FIG will, in future projects, do this from its share of past sales as well as its cut from the crowdfunding.\n\nIn the case of Psychonauts 2, FIG is taking nothing from the campaign itself, and instead treating it as a chance to get exposure according to the documents. Their parent, Loose Tooth, will instead cover the publishing costs for Psychonauts 2 as they are subsidizing the first big offering. Also, there are some people who have wondered if the money is all going to FIG, and no. No it’s not. It gets paid out basically immediately as we’ll address later as a lump sum to Double Fine.\n\nBut That means FIG is just another evil publisher\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nFirst of all, not all publishers are evil. Second of all, FIG is operating on a very different model than most publishers and has clearly been designed from a developer perspective—unsurprising given its founders are all developers with some dissatisfaction with the traditional publishing model as can be seen in some past crowdfunding videos by Brian Fargo and Tim Schafer. FIG importantly doesn’t impose major conditions that normally are used by publishers as sureties that developers find irritating.\n\nFirst: There are no milestone payments. Instead, it’s given to the developer in a lump sum payment at the start and there is no need to meet arbitrary milestones that prove progress is being made.\n\nSecond: The Developer owns the IP. FIG does not own the IP or the rights to spinoffs, sequels, or anything else regardless of what happens with the project, and that is not held as a surety for the investors or backers.\n\nThird: There is no “advance against royalty” set up like many publishing deals have wherein the publisher gets paid back on the money invested before the developer sees any of the money. Most publishing deals rely on this type of set up. If, for example, EA was publishing a Double Fine game and after hitting the milestones and getting published the payment was 10 million with Double Fine making 45% of adjusted royalties, that 45% would only begin going to Double Fine once EA had gotten it’s 10 million back from that 45%.\n\nThese all mean that FIG is about providing the platform and service but has minimal checks actually on the developer. Whether that is a good thing or not is up in the air as giving creators free rein can end up with anything from spectacular success to spectacular failures.\n\nFIG’s Terms of Use Don’t Guarantee Rewards or Project\n\nStatus: Fact\n\nThis is absolutely true, although there is some nuance to the point to be discussed. Here we’re back to talking about the Reward’s funding—the Investment funding is in all the documents that FIG provided and everyone anticipates some. FIG’s terms of use specifically state in relation to Rewards Based Crowdfunding:\n\nRewards-based crowdfunding involves the creation of a Campaign by Fig for a game developer (the “Campaign Owner”) to raise funds for the Campaign Owner’s project through contributions from individuals or entities (“Contributors”) in exchange for rewards (“Rewards”). Contributions should be considered a gift or donation rather than a purchase, as Fig can make no assurances that the Campaign Owner will be able to produce the Rewards in a timely fashion or at all. Rewards are not refundable. Fig makes no representations about the quality, morality or legality of any Campaign, Campaign Owner or Reward.\n\nSo, FIG makes no claim that Tim Schafer is a decent person, that Psychonauts 2 will actually be finished, or that Psychonauts 2 won’t suck or is not actually propaganda in disguise. This is starkly different from Kickstarter and Indiegogo’s Terms of Use, which require a best faith effort and explanations if it’s not possible and returning any funds that remain. In particular, this brings to mind, just sticking with Double Fine here, the completely unfinished state of SpaceBase DF-9, the running out of funds part way through Broken Age and releasing it in two parts, or the fact that Broken Age still hasn’t sent out all their rewards yet almost a year past the release of Part 1.\n\nHowever, Terms of Use on the Internet are rather iffy things in general, as their legality is in a state of limbo in many cases. How binding they are is unknown, and according to Zachary Strebeck, a lawyer who specializes in games that we consulted on this piece, pledging on FIG may constitute a contractual arrangement:\n\nMy opinion may be, that regardless of those terms you may have an implied contract where you still owe the copy of the game, whether or not there is realistically any legal recourse there. I don’t think there is, it’s just not worth suing in those cases.\n\nHowever, one of the bigger issues is that legal action in the case of crowdfunding is difficult. Laws regarding reward based crowdfunding are lagging behind reality, and in general it will cost far, far more to take legal action than what you are due for backing a project. That leaves the only potential recourses to limited things, such as class-action or government ran cases like Washington State’s.\n\nFIG Changing the End Date Breaks their Agreements\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nAlright, this is one of the more contentious things surrounding Psychonauts 2 run: the changing of the end date from January 7th, to January 12th. There are several things to look at here.\n\nFirst: They have full right under the investment agreements to do this. This isn’t illegal or anything else, and under their Memorandum they can extend it again if they wish. If they decide to make it last a few more days, that is covered in their Private Offering Memorandum:\n\nIf the amount indicated onwww.fig.co (the “Fig Website”) in respect of the game(the “Running Campaign Total,” as further defined herein) does not reach or exceed $3,300,000 (the “Minimum Target”) within 180 days after execution of the Grasslands License Agreement(as defined below)(the “Minimum Target Date”), this offering will be cancelled and all funds raised will be returned to investors without deduction or interest earned.If the Minimum Target is reached or exceeded before January 7, 2016(which date may be extended in our sole discretion), at which time this offering shall close and shares will be delivered to investors. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Securities Being Offered.\n\nSecond: The fact that there was always this plan for January 12th is clearly bogus revealed there. At BEST they had a late change of heart and forgot to edit the documents. At worse, they decided when things were slower over the holiday than expected to without notice just extend the period. It’s not illegal but it isn’t good either.\n\nUpdate: FIG has further elaborated on their website, so I am including it here for everyone to see and help further explain what happened. What it appears to be according to Justin Bailey, the COO of FIG, is that the original pre-planned date was the 7th, then they discussed and agreed to move to the 12th, and they had a bug hit when Double Fine published it live with the change during the VGA. It is good to have some more clarity on this situation there and here is Bailey’s post from the Double Fine boards:\n\nProbably worth a little more transparency on this since it keeps coming up. Jan 7th was tentatively set as the end date to the campaign before it started. I actually reached out to DF prior to the campaign starting suggesting it was better to make it Jan 12th, because I didn’t want the campaign to get lost in the New Year shuffle. It was agree by DF and us, it was changed in the tool, but we had a refresh problem that over wrote it. I caught it 30 minutes prior to the campaign starting, but because it was right before the VGAs, I decided to leave it rather than take a chance right before 100,000+ people hit our site. DF updated the date during the campaign tool and pushed it live without Fig’s knowledge (this has since been locked down so devs can’t do this anymore). What should have happened is that DF and Fig issued a proactive statement before changing it rather than being reactive, so mistakes were made on both sides.\n\n@TimOfLegend Hi @patrikspacek, nope you can't change days on the fly it's fixed & this was a bug. Intended end date before launch was Jan 12 — Justin Bailey —— (@JUSTINBAILEY12D) December 7, 2015\n\nFIG is hiding its potential conflicts of Interest with Double Fine\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nAlright, so Tim Schafer could have done a better job communicating this in his main page, but there is no attempt to hide the fact that Schafer is in a position of power inside FIG (or more accurately its parent company Loose Teeth). The fact that he serves on the advisory board for FIG is not new information and is on the FIG site. I would also contend that it was pretty obvious all the advisory board members would be using FIG going forward given the fact they helped found it and are directing it down the path they want it to go.\n\nThe investment documents here are, again, very blunt on the risks and the existence of potential conflicts of interest. In fact, they outright state that Conflicts of Interest may exist and may not be resolved in the share holders favor, which is more of the cover your ass stuff that is mandatory here in these types of documents, but here’s one of the sections from there that is pretty representative of that tone:\n\nOur officers and our Director may have a conflict of interest or appear to have a conflict since our officers are also officers of our Parent and our Director is also a director of the Parent. Our director is also a director of our Parent and our officers are also officers of our Parent. Because our Parent holds all of our common stock, its interests are expected to conflict in certain respects with the interests of holders of our Game Shares. Furthermore, since our Parent is also required to provide services to our Company under the Master Services Agreement, as long as such agreement is in effect, certain of its interests pursuant to that agreement are directly adverse to our interests. These differing interests could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when our officers or directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Parent. We have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of shares of our Game Shares and our common stock, or among holders of different series of Game Shares. Rather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, our board of directors will exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best to: obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\n\ndetermine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n\ndetermine whether a special committee of our board of directors should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee;\n\nand assess what is in our best interests and the best interests of all of our shareholders\n\nThat said, Double Fine could have done a better job of addressing it out of the gate in their campaign pitch and made it so that I didn’t have to spend time addressing that point here.\n\nInvestors control a say in the way the game will work\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThe only investors who might are Double Fine themselves, and whoever the mysterious third party is that Double Fine refuses to elaborate on. Investors get a share of the profits but have no voting rights, and essentially nothing other than that dividend that will be paid once the game starts selling. In fact, they don’t get copies of the game, or any of the rewards unless they separately back it as a rewards backer.\n\nInvestors get Equity in Double Fine\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThis isn’t one I’ve heard tossed around here so much in particular but addresses something that Equity Crowdfunding was thought to deal with since when Oculus Rift was sold to Facebook, a lot of backers felt they should get a share of the 2 billion for helping the company take off. That doesn’t happen here, instead they own a very limited share. You have the right to a dividend from the publisher subscription that you decided to invest on, which your share will ideally track the performance of.\n\nLet’s take a moment here and break down how this all works so that everyone understands it a bit better.\n\nThe Parties involved: Loose Tooth (the parent), Fig Publishing (FIG), Grasslands (The Pub Sub, which is the term for the publishing subsidiary that FIG uses for a particular project—each one will have it’s own “pub sub”), Double Fine, Rewards Backers, and Investors. Each of these are different parties involved in it.\n\nLoose Tooth owns FIG publishing and it has on their board FIG’s lead as well as Tim Schaffer and others. Loose Tooth owns the common stock of FIG Publishing. Grasslands is a wholly owned subsidiary of FIG Publishing and enters into a license agreement with the developer, Double Fine, which sets the terms of the agreement regarding the project getting funded. That sets up the details on the offering, value of the Game Shares, terms like whether DLC is covered.\n\nThen we launch the crowdfunding campaign. Investors are investing in preferred tracking stock of FIG. That stock doesn’t have any rights beyond that of being paid a dividend, and importantly: you are not buying equity in either Grasslands or Double Fine. Equally important to note is that there is no way to trade these Game Shares at this time, and inside the documents FIG is doing its best to stop such a market from opening for one reason or another—likely not wanting to deal with the legal and tracking issues related to it.\n\nRewards-Based Crowdfunders are in their own little area and their money as far as I can tell goes almost directly to Double Fine without dealing with many of the steps above, just processing through FIG’s website.\n\nInvestors will earn a share of DLC and All Platform Sales\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThe agreement explicitly states that DLC is NOT included in the investors profit share, nor FIG’s. Double Fine gets all that money for itself to help support the post-launch development if it does decide to do so as well as it’s own business. Much like IP investors only own a share of the profits from the sale of the game, not anything else such as spinoffs, or in this case DLC.\n\nAlso: VR launches are not covered. It is possible this is due to the fact that much like the DLC it isn’t planned to be at launch but possible sometime down the road. There is also the fact that Double Fine is developing their first VR game with part of another team right now as an interquel and the costs and challenges for a VR launch are something they will be learning.\n\nFIG can use money from Backers and Investors on different projects\n\nStatus: Looks Fictionish\n\nThis is a concern raised by a section taking from the risks part of the investment documents but is being misread and taken out of context. So first of all let’s talk about context: the context here before I put this section down is that this is an investment document. That means it has to cover ALL the bases, even if it’s small things there. There is a section that basically references that if key people fall dead in either FIG, Loose Teet,h or Double Fine, the project will likely fail … so yes, there is actually a section that could be used to explain what happens if a vengeful deity strikes down Tim Schafer with a sock.\n\nThere is another piece of context here that is key as well. Earlier in the document, this is a key element to look at that explains part of FIG’s plan for their business model and how they handle funds:\n\nOur business model requires that most (or in some cases all)of the proceeds from the sale of Game Shares be used to make a substantial upfront payment to a developering exchange for publishing rights to receive future revenues from sales of the game. We intend to pay proceeds (net of any related Publisher Expenses) from the offering of Game Shares to a developer to finance the developer’s development of the game under the license agreement. We do not intend to use any of the proceeds from this offering to fund our operations. Our operations are funded under the Master Services Agreement with our Parent. Our business model requires Pub Subs to make substantial upfront payments to developers in exchange for co-publishing rights to receive future revenues based on sales of the games. We will be at risk if for any reason our Pub Subs do not receive those future revenues, or if they are less than we would need to sustain operations and pay dividends to holders of Game Shares. We have no history to demonstrate, and we can make no assurances, that our business model will be successful, or whether any of agreements with developers or licensed platforms ultimately generate revenues from sales of the games. Consequently, it will be difficult to predict our future success, performance or viability and the viability of our business model, and any such predictions may not be accurate or reliable.\n\nSo what this means is that their business model is based on the idea of paying out the funds to the developer right away, subtracting FIG’s take for their publishing fee (which in this case is 0.1%). So that money is not there to be taken—it’s paid out under their agreement to the developer within 30 days. There is a cap set in the agreement that can require discussion—but to give an example in Psychonauts 2’s case that was set at 15 million. What that number is based on, I think, is the number of shares that are sold via investment, thus any further amounts would require separate discussions and work.\n\nHere is the section that has raised concerns:\n\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one series of Game Shares to pay liabilities attributed to another series of Game Shares.\n\nThe assets attributed to one series of Game Shares are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to another series of Game Shares, even if those liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other series of Game Shares. No provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prevents us from satisfying liabilities of one series of Game Shares with assets of another series of Game Shares, and our creditors will not in any way be limited by our capital structure from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have any Game Shares. As a result, although we intend for the Game Shares to track the performance of our Pub Subs, we cannot provide any guarantee that the Game Shares will in fact track the performance of each such Pub Sub and that a particular series of Game Shares will not be subject to a disproportionate share of the burden of any non-performing Game Shares, whether or not included in the assets attributed to such series, and will not be attributed a disproportionate amount of our general liabilities, costs and expenses.\n\nSo what this means in practice is that the performance or sales of one Pub Sub may be used to cover for another depending on the situation. The agreements, such as the flat payments that have to be done after funding, are still there. You funding the next project on FIG isn’t going to be used to fund the next DJ Phil at Double Fine that happened because Tim somehow blew through 3 million in half the expected time.\n\nWhat it does mean is that the profits from Psychonauts 2 might be used to temporarily cover issues around another game’s income or if legal action of some sort happens utilizing that to cover it off. It is pretty clear they don’t want to do it, but without putting in a lot more legal work it’s not possible to get that type of security.\n\nI just want to repeat that is just my understanding of it, and Zachary agreed there, but it is possible that we are misunderstanding it—it comes down to the fact they clearly want to avoid that type of cross pollination, but situations may force their hand.\n\nFIG is Accepting Unaccredited Investors before the Rules are Finalized\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThis comes from an easy misconception around what sort of crowdfunding FIG is using for its unaccredited investors at this time. The finalized rules for unaccredited investors you are probably hearing talked about are the more famed Title 3 under the JOBS act in the CROWDFUND section. That isn’t what FIG is using or why they are only accepting reservations right now.\n\nInstead of using the more famed Title 3 parts, they are using the higher cost and disclosure laden Regulation A funding method that had its rules finalized in July. Many of the questions around things—such as how they are curating the platform, communication areas, or other Title 3 regulation rules—don’t apply here. For accredited investors, it falls under 506 C fundraising, which is what they’ve used for their past ones. Regulation A funding also requires that they get approval on the offering, which is why they are taking reservations for unaccredited investors at this time, not taking their money—as we’ll talk about in our next point.\n\nSo while I am wanting to avoid going too much into depth here, the lawyer we talked with, Zachary Strebeck, sent us a brief run down on the different types of investment that are relevant to the FIG and Psychonauts 2 situation to help clarify the misunderstandings:\n\nNote: they’re not all technically “crowdfunding.” Really, only Title III is specifically meant for\n\ncrowdfunding, though they can all do some de facto crowdfunding by reaching out to a crowd\n\nin order to fund something. Regulation D, 506(c) securities offerings – These are offerings of securities that can be generally advertised (before the JOBS Act they couldn’t be), but the securities can only be sold to Accredited Investors. So it’s like crowdfunding, in that you can advertise the investment opportunity over the Internet, but your “crowd” is limited to Accredited Investors. Doing an\n\noffering under this exemption allows you to avoid costly registration and ongoing regulatory\n\ncompliance. There is no limit to the amount that can be raised. Regulation A – These are offerings that allow you to raise up to $50 million from both Accredited and Unaccredited investors, but the Unaccredited investors are limited to 10% of the greater of annual income or net worth if they are an individual (not a company). This type of offering (which Fig is using) requires that the SEC approve your offering materials before the offering begins, provide financial statements and other potentially-costly regulatory compliance. http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/regulation-a-amendments-secg.shtml Title III of the JOBS Act – true equity crowdfunding – this section of the JOBS Act allows for crowdfunding from anyone, up to certain dollar amounts for individuals, through designated crowdfunding platforms. The amount of regulatory compliance here is lower than with Reg A, but not completely negligible (especially for the platform holders themselves). These rules go into effect first quarter 2016, I believe. See here for more details: http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html\n\nFIG is setting Reservations for Unaccredited Investors to screw them over\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nOkay we’re continuing our delve into the area of investment legal stuff here and some judgment calls. Note I’m not a trained lawyer here, I just talked with one about Crowdfunding, but if you are considering investing you should look at everything yourself as well.\n\nIn essence what’s going on here is that Regulation A offerings like FIG is doing for Psychonauts 2 have a higher overhead and are relatively new, with the rules just being finalized in July. There is less need for communication areas compared to Title 3 rules, but that means there needs to be more disclosures—look up above for more on that.\n\nHere’s the big part, though, the SCC has to approve the offering and it’s likely that FIG wouldn’t want to do the offering if it didn’t know it would have enough. So by setting it up like this, they can count it towards the goal but also waste less money if they fail to meet it. Here’s what Zachary had to say on it:\n\nThe Regulation A Offering, there’s a lot more overhead versus the Equity Crowdfunding from Title 3. The Website talks about waiting until Quarter 1 next, but that’s because they have to submit all those offering documents to the SCC and then the SCC has to approve their offering documents and say that it’s okay.\n\nFIG is a High Risk Investment\n\nStatus: Fact\n\nFIG is, by their own definition and everything around it, a risky venture. They are trying something really new with this crowdfunding plus publishing set up that may or may not be able to become a sustainable company. Now, while you’re not investing directly into FIG, you are investing in their ecosystem and ability to keep things going to get your money back over time if Psychonauts 2 sells well. FIG is, as the documents attest, presently in the red having ran only 2 campaigns—one of which was unsuccessful—and they are going to need multiple successful launches and judgments on projects to get out of it over time. This year is key to FIG as they need to prove they can attract and run projects on top-tier crowdfunding and prove the viability of the platform even as they likely run further into the red requiring more money from their parent company to keep going.\n\nThe investor documents (which include the FIG Company Bylaws, License Agreement with Double Fine, Certificate of Designation, The Private Offering Memoradum, the Grasslands Subscription Agreement, and Grasslands Certificate of Incorporation) fully go into this and the fact that it’s new territory with this odd set up they are doing here. It’s expected that in about one year, FIG and Loose Teeth (the parent) may need to seek additional funding to keep running. If they are unable to secure that, it is very possible that investments will become lost effectively as the developer does not have any responsibility to the Pub Subs if FIG goes under, although they may choose to—something that would from a PR perspective make a lot of sense. Getting that funding either from investors or financial services is going to be key on getting projects that they can expect to show money from in a couple years in addition to getting funds from their publisher service fees that other games will be paying them upon funding.\n\nThis is High Risk investments, and as Zachary Strebeck was prone to saying in our talk, you should make sure you aren’t putting up more then you can afford to easily lose.\n\nPsychonauts 2 is a Safe Bet\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nThis is something no one, not in FIG, Double Fine or anywhere else really knows. Psychonauts 2 and the FIG venture carry risks with them. Psychonauts 2, while a sequel to a cult hit and critically acclaimed game, is also a sequel to a game that sold very poorly at launch.\n\nIn the first 5 years of its life Psychonauts sold under 500k copies. It has sold over 1 million since, but it is important to understand where many of those copies were sold from and not get lost in the raw 1.69 million number.\n\nOver 730k of those were in Humble Bundle Sales, and it has been bundled there 3 times—once in a general indie one, once in a Double fine one, and one is the Summer Games Done Quickly. It was always in the lowest tier—meaning that it got maximum distribution—even to people who already owned the game.\n\nThe other copies of it, on Steam, the Humble Store, and other online retailers often were discounted—many times up to 90% or included in Double Fine bundles on those stores.\n\nDespite what many fans want to think, Psychonauts 2 is far from guaranteed to be a commercial success and it’s easy to forget how much a flop Psychonauts was for the original publisher before being digitally distributed by Double Fine at bargain basement prices.\n\nThis is, by the way, also part of the reason why I tend to shrug off some of the claims of saying that Brutal Legends 2 being dependent on success is a Phantom Riches scam. It’s more basic business; if Psychonauts 2 proves that their cult hits can be resurrected for sequels, it makes sense for them to do so again. If it ends up in the Red or barely breaking even for them, it will be an issue as beyond the potential funds they will have invested in FIG, there’s also the fact that they’ll be relying on other projects to cover their time and money investment in Psychonauts 2 making another similar risk unsustainable.\n\nDouble Fine is not putting any money into Psychonauts 2\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nDouble fine has shown that they are putting in money of their own in their campaign, though some people are missing that. Double Fine’s plan for Psychonauts 2 has basically the FIG crowdfunding and investing making up about one third of the budget they said they’ll need for Psychonauts 2. That estimate was 10-13.5m and will be made from Double Fine, the FIG campaign, and a third backer.\n\nWe have no idea who this mysterious Third Party Is\n\nStatus: Fact\n\nThis is one of the large concerns at this point if you are an investor. We don’t know who the third party here is, nor what the terms of that agreement are. This matters because where they get their money back, what the control the third party has if any (likely little to none), and who you are partnering with.\n\nThe Console Charge is Just to Milk more Money\n\nStatus: Fiction\n\nConsoles, unlike most of the PC distribution platforms, charge developers when they give codes beyond a small amount of codes at the start. Unlike Steam in particular, where a developer can just tell Valve they want any amount of codes and then retail them from their site or third party portals or give to backers, consoles want a cut from every sale. That is how they make their money even with the expense of creating and maintaining the consoles as well as certifying releases and updates.\n\nI don’t know the exact charge of it, but from what I’ve heard around, $18 sounds in the neighborhood one would expect there. This is a case of actually being smart there to make sure that a significant amount of funds aren’t forced to go from funding to reward delivery and appears to be a case of Tim Schafer learning from experience.\n\nThere’s more that can be asked, but at this point we’re getting pretty long, and so I’ll close it here as I think I’ve addressed many of the most common questions about the Psychonauts 2 campaign. If you have a question here, please do ask and I’ll do my best to answer with the information or where you should look for more. I’d like to once again thank Zachary Strebeck for talking with us about the situation and his contributions on a background level as well as several quotes that were invaluable.

(Photo11: Disney)\n\nIt's summer in the Frozen kingdom, and that posed some exciting challenges for the filmmakers behind the new Disney short Frozen Fever.\n\nOne big question for directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck: How do you adapt those universally beloved princess dresses to a new season?\n\nFrozen art director Michael Giaimo was tasked with designing the warm-weather frocks for the mini-movie, which will be seen in theaters before Cinderella (opening March 13).\n\n\"That was a lot of fun, to design a dress that Elsa would make in the summer, but still be true to herself being made of ice,\" says Lee.\n\nOnscreen, Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) magically makes her own full-length emerald gown and a playful birthday frock for sister Anna (Kristen Bell). \"All that wonderful art direction you saw from the feature is in the short. They really look spectacular,\" Lee adds.\n\nGiaimo had jokingly complained that the dramatic downshot seen in the original 2013 movie — when Elsa created her ice castle dress while singing the anthem Let It Go — didn't fully highlight his design.\n\n\"In this short, we let him have his way,' says Buck. \"We don't have a downshot. That allows you to have a really good look at the dress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the snowman Olaf manages to survive the rising temperatures, thanks to the magic winter cloud created at the end of Frozen. Josh Gad was excited to voice the feel-good character again.\n\n\"Olaf has that smile. He has that everything-is-good quality and is ever-optimistic,\" says Gad. \"It's a wonderfully delicious character to revisit.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DxzHUb",
  "latent_967": "Only a few weeks after Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's biggest change ever-the release of the Unity-based Ubuntu 11.04 Linux--the company's CTO, Matt Zimmerman is leaving the company.\n\nIn a blog posting, Zimmerman wrote, \"I joined Canonical in June of 2004 as a member of the founding team, before we even had a name for the company. In June 2011, after just over seven years as Ubuntu CTO, I will be leaving Canonical in search of new challenges.\"\n\nZimmerman is leaving on good terms. Indeed, he wrote, \"I intend to remain involved in the Ubuntu community, retaining my elected position on the governing Technical Board, and perhaps to make the occasional technical contribution as a volunteer.\" Gerry Carr, Canonical's product manager, told me, that \"We wish him all the best. Personally and professionally he has been inspirational for Ubuntu and for all of us.\"\n\nZimmerman added, \"It has been my privilege to have played a part in creating Ubuntu and Canonical. It has been a pleasure to work with so many talented, dedicated and fun people over the years. I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished together: bringing free software to people, places and organizations which have derived so much benefit from it.\"\n\nHe seems to have every faith that Ubuntu will continue to do well in the future. \"The Ubuntu engineering organization, which we call Platform, is a highly capable and motivated team, the best I've ever worked with in my career. Building and leading this team has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me. I have every confidence in their ability to support Canonical's mission in the years to come, and I'm excited to see how they will surprise me in the future.\"\n\nSo why is he leaving? Zimmerman wrote, \"Seven years on, the time is right for me to move on from this role, where I enjoy so much support from my colleagues, and take a risk on something new. I will take with me many fond memories, from all-night global hacking sessions driving toward a ship date, to casual singing and playing music at our many face-to-face events.\"\n\nIn fact, Zimmerman will be staying with the Canonical through next week's Ubuntu Developer Summit, in Budapest where he looks \"forward to celebrating with friends and colleagues, and beginning the transition to this new role in the project.\"\n\nUbuntu will miss his technical leadership. In Ubuntu's early days, Ubuntu was sometimes dismissed as being little more than just another Debian Linux clone. Over time, though, Ubuntu became the most popular end-user Linux of all, and started introducing its own new technologies. The latest of these, the radical shift to the Unity desktop interface, represents desktop Linux's biggest effort yet to reach a mass audience.

At that point there will be much more to say on how we must meet the challenge ahead.\n\n“This is a moment when Scottish Labour must and will change. It’s time for a new generation with a vision for the future of Scotland.\n\n“Labour lost badly in the General Election. Nothing we can say or do will disguise that fact. The job of our next leader isn’t to explain away that loss or find excuses - it’s to understand why people were so reluctant to vote for us and find a way of regaining the trust of the people of Scotland.\n\n“I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge Scottish Labour faces. But we’ve been the insurgent force before, pushing back against the political establishment and winning great victories and profound social change. We will be that force again. Our values are what we will carry forward with us - all the rest is baggage.\n\n“We have a mountain to climb, but I believe I offer a fresh start for Scottish Labour. The great social change we fight for is not a partisan cause. I can be a unifying figure across our party and our country.\n\n“As the daughter of two teachers I know the value of education. At its best it can transform the life chances of young people, no matter their background. The only way we can secure a fairer, brighter tomorrow for Scotland is by giving our young people a better start in life today. As Scottish Labour Leader that’s what I would work for every single day.”",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nAs I finish this article in the wee hours of the morning, I am completely envious of you. That’s because by the time you read this, my game has been out at least a few hours, and you potentially know the answer to a question I’ve wondered about for almost two years: did my game make it? Did anyone care about The First Tree? Am I ready to cast the burden of game dev into the fires of Mordor and move on?\n\nIronically, I should've been working on my game instead of making this gif.\n\nIf you haven’t heard about it, it’s a story-driven exploration game about a fox looking for her missing cubs and uncovering a parallel story about a son reconnecting with his father in Alaska. You’re probably saying it’s a bit premature to know if it will be successful just from the first day of release, but the more I research game marketing, the more I realize how crucial those first couple days are. Now with Steam Direct, there’s a few new points about the indie market that I think all devs should consider, namely:\n\nThe default state for all Steam releases is “buried.”\n\nMarketing and vying for visibility after launch is exponentially harder.\n\nYou’re going to need a hook (and a bit of luck).\n\nThis isn’t really an official post-mortem of The First Tree, but I would totally consider it a marketing post-mortem. That’s because most of the marketing that makes a difference happens well before launch day. It’s your big chance to push that snowball down the hill and hopefully turn it into something gigantic. I’ll share what’s helped me with my marketing efforts, and what didn’t help that much. The best part is you can check my SteamSpy owners and number of reviews and determine for yourself if it just wasn’t enough. Hopefully this will help other devs know where they need to be before launch so they can dig themselves out of the default buried state.\n\n(Note: Success as a game developer or any artist really is NOT dependent on money! Can’t stress this enough! For this article however, I’m eschewing the artistic and personal value of my game so I can focus on the mysterious world of indie marketing and share what I’ve learned.)\n\nBackground: My first game’s launch\n\nI feel like you can learn 80% of how to successfully launch through reading and studying, but that other 20% is gained by just trying it yourself and seeing where the wind takes you (the Leaving Lyndow postmortem is an excellent example of this). My first game’s launch taught me so much, because I did almost everything wrong. Fortunately there’s a fanbase for slow paced, poetic, exploration games like Home is Where One Starts… which gave me enough revenue to fund The First Tree, but I still get bummed thinking how different launch day could’ve gone. Here’s my list of bozo decisions:\n\nI launched at midnight… because that’s what movies do, right?!\n\nI changed my launch date last minute just because.\n\nPractically no journalists or streamers published anything on launch day, even though I sent emails and keys.\n\nI didn’t have an email list, and my only real social media community was Twitter with ~200 followers.\n\nI waited to release popular requested features like subtitles, trading cards, etc.\n\nFor The First Tree, my goal was to “fail faster” and speed up production by making it short and simple, taking advantage of the Unity Asset Store, and never having a 0% day (if it sounds familiar, it’s from my previous article So Many Projects, So Little Time). Launching any type of game has only gotten harder since 2015 (much, much harder), so this should be an indication that focused marketing is a completely, necessary effort if you want get out of the buried state. But what do you focus on exactly?\n\nMaking Steam Visibility Great Again\n\nPerhaps you’re familiar with the excellent postmortem of Airscape, where Daniel West talks about two spirals: the Death Spiral and the Life Spiral.\n\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of releases are relinquished to the Death Spiral, just because the amount of choices is so great. Gamers aren’t limited by their wallets anymore, they’re limited by their time. Indies like us pine for the day when being on Steam meant visibility, which usually came from front page treatment in the New Releases tab. That tab is essentially gone now, and the only chance you have for that stellar visibility is the New and Trending tab.\n\nOn the left, Steam New Releases tab in 2012. Right, 2017. Not pictured: lots of new games\n\nWe don’t know the specifics on how the New and Trending list picks its winners, but there is one, fantastic, wonderful talk that might help us. Matt Trobbiani talks about his launch of HackNet, his conversation with a Valve employee regarding the store page’s algorithms, how important conversion rates are, and why the first few hours of launch are do-or-die. Seriously, it’s worth every second of your time and might be my favorite game dev talk ever.\n\nYou might be asking “what about the Discovery/Recommended algorithms that are supposed to fix all of this visibility junk?” Well, the caveat there is it typically recommends the most successful titles in that niche. For me personally, Steam has tons of data to work with for my account, but it typically only recommends what’s been doing well sales-wise. Which is funny because I've already heard of it before—because it's popular! So to even benefit from that bit of Steam handiwork, you need to knock it out of the park on day one, nay, the first few hours of launch. The Death Spiral is the default state which leads to being buried, but my theory is that The Life Spiral always begins in the Popular New Releases tab. Getting there first will kickstart every other marketing aspiration, including Discovery Queue, prominent page placement during sales, recommended titles, etc.\n\nIt’s a lot like that joke about outrunning a bear: if a bear is chasing you in a campsite, you don’t have to outrun the bear, only your fellow campers. In this case, the bear is the Death Spiral, and the campers are other game releases. You can’t hope to be the most popular game release of the day, but that’s not necessary, you only need to beat the pack just enough to get on Steam’s radar. So that’s my minimum goal: get on the New and Trending list.\n\nThe Plan\n\nI believe these algorithmic black boxes for delivering personalized recommendations need to pass a certain threshold to do any good (at least with my teaser trailer on YouTube, it wasn’t until 80k views that my traffic shot up due to new Recommended For You links popping up). My plan is to pull out every attention-grabbing trick I have for day one. Gamers love Steam trading cards and achievements, so put them in there. An international audience wants English subtitles at the very least, so put them in there. Localization is a pain for a solo-dev, but translating the interface and the store page at least will help so just do it. Trailers might be your biggest weapon for the fight against obscurity, so I spent a ton of time polishing mine. I showed my game at PAX West, so I waited to launch until after for maximum exposure. The First Tree is a short game, so I’m pricing it accordingly and going with my gut (which also might increase impulse buys). I’m not going to focus on other platforms yet so the Steam release gets all the attention. Daniel West is right, being a good game isn’t enough anymore, and everything has to be perfect for a gamer to even consider spending money on your game.\n\nI made a lot of gifs. Arguably too many.\n\nI also took a page from the Ooblets dev’s book and built an audience with visuals-first development. I can’t tell how you much gifs have helped The First Tree’s marketing. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a direct correlation between the amount of gifs shared and a game’s financial success. Even beautiful still screenshots don’t hold a candle to them. It certainly wasn’t an avalanche of attention every time I posted something, but it added up over the past two years. I know everyone’s development style is different, and that white boxing and prototyping is important―but share visually appealing gifs ASAP! And do it consistently!\n\nMost Helpful Social Media Sites\n\nI posted quite a few gifs on a variety of sites, and here’s what helped most:\n\nReddit\n\nA lot of devs say Reddit sucks for marketing, and while I don’t totally disagree with that, everything else is a tiny blip on the radar compared to its impact (more specifically, two gifs on r/gaming). Maybe it helps that I’m woefully addicted to the site, but if you know a subreddit’s rules and try to keep your posts to 10% self-promotion, you’ll be fine. Don’t think I haven’t been irreversibly screwed though! The dream happened in December 2016 when a gif of my game’s footstep system made the #1 spot on r/all with 30k+ upvotes. It was insane, glorious, and overwhelming… and then it was gone. The mods had delisted it since they thought I posted too much about my game (hence my venting here). Even though it wasn’t up for long, just look at its impact on the graph below (and remember, this includes every other instance of a gif going viral on every other site). It resulted in 10k site views and 1000 email signups from that day alone.\n\nImgur\n\nReddit and Imgur are pretty interconnected, but Imgur actually has a thriving gaming community all its own. Over the past two years I had 9 gifs make it to Most Viral, and that’s where the majority of my email signups came from. I would say about each viral gif landed me about 200 signups, with the lesser known gifs making me around 40 each. Unfortunately I lost the view counts on all my images, but (combined with reddit’s views) it was somewhere around 8 million total (about 4 million were from that one viral reddit post mentioned above). I got tons of useful feedback and comments from Imgur as well, so I heartily recommend sharing your stuff there!\n\nFacebook\n\nThere are two groups that have been great for sharing my game’s progress, and that’s Indie Game Developers and Indie Game Promo. They both reach a more international audience than the other platforms. I usually only posted during #screenshotsaturday on the Dev group, but the Promo group is usually fair game everyday. They also appreciate interesting game dev blog posts and articles, so give it a shot!\n\nTumblr\n\nI thought my game’s visuals and premise lended itself well to Tumblr, so I set an account up pretty late in the game, and I’m glad I eventually did! The most successful posts were actually from different posters like Screenshot Daily, so I’m glad I had something there for people to refer back to. I probably would’ve done better if I posted way more; social media is not a lurking man’s game (and I am a huge lurker).\n\n9gag\n\nThis may come as a shock, but I got a decent amount of traffic from 9gag. I threw one of my gifs on there on a whim, and it got about 6000 upvotes (no idea how that converts to traffic. It bumped up my daily visits by 100-200, and went back to normal three days later). Unfortunately URLs in the comments are automatically blocked, so actually communicating or sending someone a link is almost impossible. I did get a list of people to tag via comments on launch day (about 100 people), so there’s that. Can’t totally recommend it, and it’s hard to track the traffic, but it’s something to consider.\n\nTwitter\n\nAs a dev, you practically need a Twitter account to stay in touch with everyone, but as a marketing tool I rate it below the other options. I had one gif go viral (over 2.5k retweets), and that did help in catching journalists’ attention and gathering an extra 300 followers in one go, but usually Twitter is a drop-by-drop kind of accumulation. By far the biggest help was sharing gifs on Friday with the hashtag #madewithunity. I was retweeted by Unity several times to their 200k followers (which is also why most of my followers are fellow devs instead of interested customers). Twitter also allowed websites I had never thought of to find my game (two tweets from a Japanese gaming site have a combined 11k retweets. It turns out Japanese gamers love nature and foxes!).\n\nHopefully info like this can help all devs, but before you get too excited, please consider this: your game probably needs striking visuals and/or that mysterious “hook” factor to gain traction organically. I think The First Tree has gotten this far due to the colorful/cinematic graphics and how you play as a fox. Little did I know before starting my game that making a “fox game” comes bundled with legions of fox fans who are already interested in your product. My first game was much more abstract which naturally led to less attention and less of a hook. I think several devs have figured out this hook thing… Dream Daddy, West of Loathing, and Emily is Away Too had great hooks: they piqued your attention just because they were so unusual, and they had great financial success because of it.\n\nThe Results\n\nAt the end of this long tired road, here’s what I have to show for it (approx.):\n\n12000 Steam wishlists\n\n4700 Twitter followers\n\n4400 mailing list subscribers (for a one-time launch email)\n\n1300 Tumblr followers\n\nI think this is enough to get on the New and Trending tab, and honestly, even if it isn’t, that’s OK, I’ve done my best and I’ve expended all of my energy making/marketing this game while working a busy full-time job, becoming a parent for the first time, and everything going wrong right before launch (did I mention my little girl got bit in the face by a dog, my car broke down, and my wife signed on to an urgent art gallery deal?). I guess what I’m saying is don’t kill yourself or neglect your family please. Seems like a reasonable request, but, you know, some people are addicted to crunch, even if they hate it.\n\nConclusion\n\nI feel like the “resting face” for my brain the past two years has been daydreaming about The First Tree and imagining what launch day would be like. Whenever I would get my infant daughter in the middle of the night and rock her to sleep, my half-asleep brain would automatically go to my game. I regularly pour over SteamSpy like how an old guy checks the Wall Street Journal to look at stocks. I wish I could get out of the habit of counting imaginary sales I haven’t made yet, but I suppose that’s the life of an indie dev or any creative really. I think managing expectations is a good way to embrace launch day without going insane, but on the other hand I always liked what Paulo Coelho said about dreams: “It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”\n\nIf you’d like to make my day and check out my game, please visit the Steam page or my website at http://www.TheFirstTree.com.

For our third annual Lifehacker Pack for iPhone, we're highlighting the apps that help you stay productive, connected, informed and entertained.\n\nNOTE: This post is outdated. Check out the most recent Lifehacker Pack for a more up-to-date list of essential iPhone apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking for an app in a specific category? Use the links below to jump around.\n\nProductivity\n\nSparrow may be the best app released for the iPhone this year. While Apple's built-in mail client is completely serviceable, Sparrow demonstrates what it could. It's almost indispensable for Gmail users, but Sparrow works with pretty much any other type of account, too. It's fast, easy to navigate, simple to move mail around, and just generally a pleasure to use. It comes with one caveat, however: it doesn't support push notifications. This won't be a bother if you don't enjoy finding out the very second an email arrives. If you do, you can always jailbreak and install Sparrow+. That'll get you push notifications and all you to set it as the default client.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nSimplenote is a key component in the holy grail of ubiquitous text capture, and rightfully so. It allows for speedy note entry on your iPhone, plus it syncs with the also free Simplenote service so your notes are always available wherever you want them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nCue is a handy app that provides you with a rundown of your day without any input on your part. It scans your email accounts, calendars, and several other web services to get an idea of what's going on in your life. It then repackages all that data into a more digestible, concise format that you can load up on your iPhone anytime. You can check the weather, see appointments (with contact information for people involved), let you know about birthdays, and more. It's not an app that necessarily helps you do anything, or involves doing much, but it's an app that'll keep you on task and avoid forgetting the things that are important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nOrchestra is a wonderful, simple, to-do management app that you can use by yourself or with virtually anyone else with an email account. When you need to collaborate, you can just add people you know to a task whether they have Orchestra or not. Additionally, you can add tasks with voice recognition if you don't feel like typing. You can send them in via email, too. Orchestra has lots of great features but it's also very simple to understand and use. That's a tough thing to pull off, but Orchestra does it admirably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstapaper and Pocket\n\nInstapaper and Pocket both serve the purpose of saving web content for later reading, but both have their differences.

Aside from a simple user interface and the wonderful omnibar, if you're already a Chrome user on the desktop you'll undoubtedly appreciate its ability to sync all your data. If you're not a Chrome user or you don't feel the app is quite ready to become your primary mobile browser, check out Dolphin instead. It's pretty great all-around and offers a wider number of features.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nSkype isn't perfect, but it's still one of the best ways to make VOIP calls and video chat on a mobile phone, regardless of whether you're on Wi-Fi or cellular data. Even the pretty video quality is pretty good in either case. While there are plenty of calling alternatives, Skype is the most solid and versatile option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nIf you're a member of Google Voice, the official app will let you tap into your account to check your voicemail and text messages. Additionally, you can send messages and make calls from your Google Voice number. Because the iPhone is pretty much locked down, you can't use Google Voice as your default dialer. That said, jailbroken iPhones can add the SMS GV Extension and the Phone GV Extension for full integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nInstant messaging on your phone can get a little bit overwhelming, as a touchscreen phone isn't made for rapid text-based communication with many people.

If your address book is missing a number, just find your friend in the Facebook app and click the call button. You can also keep track of events, check your news feed, and edit your profile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nTweetbot is an excellent Twitter client. It provides many of the features you'd expect and can get for free with the official Twitter app but with a smarter interface and some added functionality. Tweetbot has its own handy gestures for better navigation, customization options, push notifications with Boxcar (also part of this pack), and a lot more. It might be a little pricey for some at $3, but if you're a Twitter addict you probably won't mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nAlthough Google+ hasn't attracted a remarkable number of users, it's still a popular social network.

Even though we're excited to use the new Maps in iOS 6, which will offer up some serious competition, Waze is already ahead of the game in several areas. Because of its large community, you can find out about were police cars are stationed and be warned about accidents and closures. That's already on top of general traffic reporting. Additionally, the latest version of Waze will help you find a cheap gas station wherever you are and even get you a discount in some cases.

As a result, sending files to and from your device isn't the easiest thing in the world. Air Sharing makes it pretty simple, offering a variety of ways to get movies, PDFs, music, and other documents from your computer to your iPhone. It also happens to be a pretty good document reader as well. It's a must for anyone who has a lot of stuff they want to take on their mobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nMusic, Photos, and Video\n\nPanamp is an alternative music player for your iPhone that uses a tree-based structure for your content. This makes it really easy to quickly navigate through all your songs and queue them up on the fly. If you like creating playlists on the go, Panamp is the music player you've always wanted. If you like a more traditional structure, however, the built-in iPod app will still do the trick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nIf you listen to a lot of podcasts, you should be listening with Downcast. It does just about everything that's missing from Apple's iPod app. For starters, it downloads everything directly from within the app. It'll work over 3G and Wi-Fi, plus you can set rules for when it uses the 3G connection to download and when it doesn't. You don't even have to download the files—you can stream them instead. There are plenty more features and you can read about them here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nPandora's always been a favorite on the iPhone, but it was kind of useless before multitasking support came around. Not much has changed since the release allowing it to play in the background, but nothing was really necessary. It's still the same great Pandora, offering personalized radio stations free of charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nWhen it comes to remotely accessing your iTunes library and streaming music via AirPlay, the Remote app is the best there is. It's basically like using the built-in Music app, but you're controlling a remote library instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nStreamToMe and Air Video are both apps that help you stream video from your computer to your iPhone, no matter where you are. They're especially compelling when you want to watch something at, say, the gym and you didn't have time to transcode and sync it to your device first. Whether you're connected to Wi-Fi or 3G, you can stream video directly to your phone from anywhere you are (the quality of your connection permitting, of course). Both apps have some subtle differences, such as StreamToMe's ability to stream more than just video and Air Video's option to pre-encode content for easier streaming, and either are worth the price of admission: $2.99.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload StreamToMe or Air Video\n\nAlthough Air Video and StreamToMe offer remote media streaming just like Plex, neither are as easy to set up. With Plex you just set your media folders, create an account, and log in with that account on any device. From there you can stream without any network configuration, plus you get the great home theater experience Plex provides for televisions. While you may prefer just streaming files and not worrying about a fancy interface, if you like what Plex has to offer it's a must-download. One of my favorite bonuses that the app provides is the ability to watch something at home and then pick up right where you left off on your mobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload Page\n\nIf you'd like to keep your videos in their native format rather than use Air Video or StreamToMe to stream iOS-friendly versions, GoodPlayer can handle the task—if your hardware's up to it.

  "latent_1739": "26.04.2014\n\nАвтор: А.К.\n\nВидосмесители против видодробителей: споры о таксономическом статусе черепов из Дманиси\n\nИнтересная полемика по поводу черепов из Дманиси развернулась на страницах “Science” от 25 апреля 2014 г. Спорность таксономического статуса этой группы обозначилась уже в публикации пятого, наиболее полного черепа D-4500 [Lordkipanidze et al., 2013].\n\nИзменчивость в пределах предполагаемого вида Homo erectus. Три черепа в нижнем ряду справа – из Дманиси. Изменчивость у шимпанзе. А и С – самки, В и D – самцы.\n\nЛидеры исследовательской группы – Дж.Ф. Райтмайр, Х. Цолликоффер и Й. Рак –решили свести выделенный грузинскими антропологами таксон Homo georgicus до уровня даже ниже подвидового в пределах вида Homo erectus, то есть фактически упразднить его. Различия между дманисскими черепами следует, по их мнению, считать внутрипопуляционными. Это вызвало несогласие Ф. Споора [Spoor, 2013], к которому теперь присоединились Дж. Шварц, И. Таттерсол и Чжан Чи [Schwartz et al., 2014]. Как они полагают, совокупность данных указывает на оправданность таксона Homo georgicus. Проведенный авторами первой публикации морфометрический анализ, по мнению критиков, формален и не выявляет существенных различий между черепами, исключающих принадлежность дманисцев к одной популяции. Изменчивость внутри предполагаемого «макровида» Homo erectus, по их мнению, также слишком велика и заставляет разбить этот таксон на несколько видов (рис. 1).\n\nВ своем ответе [Zollikofer et al., 2014] авторы первоначальной публикации возражают, что Дж. Шварц и соавторы не учитывают значительную индивидуальную изменчивость у приматов, в частности, шимпанзе (рис. 2). Существование нескольких видов гомининов на одной территории (все дманисские черепа найдены на площади всего 40 м2) в пределах небольшого временного промежутка, а возможно, даже одновременно, кажется авторам невероятным.\n\nИнтересна расстановка сил в этой дискуссии. Под первой публикацией, большинство авторов которой – западные «видосмесители», которые упразднили таксон Homo georgicus, стоит и подпись Давида Лордкипанидзе. Но, оказавшись по воле обстоятельств в меньшинстве в пределах собственного авторского коллектива, он получил неожиданную поддержку со стороны западных же «видодробителей». Спор продолжается!\n\nКомментарий Научного редактора АНТРОПОГЕНЕЗ.РУ Станислава Дробышевского:\n\nСпоры о систематике не закончатся, пока на свете не останется меньше двух систематиков. Даже введение молекулярной систематики, казалось бы – супермегаобъективной и математически проверяемой, не избавило научный мир от споров, а разожгло их лишь с новой силой. Что уж говорить о систематике ископаемых гоминид, от которых остались окаменевшие кости. Главной проблемой любой из спорящих сторон является отсутствие универсального критерия выделения вида. Что, собственно, понимается под палеонтологическим видом? Единство морфологии? Способность к скрещиванию? Вечна проблема масштаба. И никто не победит в этом споре. В некоторых же случаях, как кажется, спор разгорается скорее из спортивного интереса, чем из необходимости. И случай с Дманиси, вероятно, именно таков. На пятачке с небольшую квартиру найдены останки пяти гоминид. Попали они сюда едва позже двух миллионов лет назад и являются древнейшими за пределами Африки. В самой Африке в это время достоверно жили лишь два вида гоминид – Paranthropus robustus и какой-то из \"ранних Homo\". В зависимости от предпочтений конкретного антрополога можно называть его Homo rudolfensis, Homo habilis, Homo ergaster или даже Homo erectus, однако ж достоверное сосуществование двух хороших, надёжных видов Homo в Африке не доказано никем ни для одного местонахождения. Про отнесение дманисцев к парантропам речь не идёт. Остаётся два варианта: либо дманисцы принадлежат к синхронному африканскому виду, либо по пути успели дифференцироваться в свой особенный. Третий же вариант – что в Дманиси мы имеем представителей ДВУХ видов – выглядит довольно таки фантастично. Просто из хронологических и экологических соображений. Нет, он не вовсе невероятен, но ежели даже в благословенной Африке во множестве местонахождений нет доказанных случаев сосуществования двух видов Homo, то появление их в однокомнатной квартире в уединённой Грузии, мягко говоря, странновато... Вопрос о названии грузинских людей многим может казаться каким-то очень принципиальным, но так ли это? Объективно мы не можем проверить – могли ли дманисцы скрещиваться с африканскими современниками. Учитывая пластичность, типичную для приматов, наверняка могли, но доказать мы не можем ни \"да\", ни \"нет\". Остаётся морфологический критерий: насколько сильно дманисцы отличаются от африканцев? А тут всё зависит от того, какие признаки мы возьмём, каким анализом обработаем и как результаты проинтерпретируем. То есть, в отсутствие надёжной универсальной методики, можно переливать из пустого в порожнее сколько угодно. С этого места начинается спор о словах. Эти размеры совпадают – значит, один вид. Нет, в этом признаке видим расхождение – разные виды. Но кто сказал, что отличие именно по вот этому показателю не давало возможности дманисцам скрещиваться с африканцами? Да никто! А то ведь недолго по пяти черепам описать и шесть видов... А ещё ведь есть кости скелетов – уже и десяток видов обеспечен! Здравствуй, типологизм XIX века! Кстати, абсолютно аналогичный спор разгорелся в последнее время по поводу малапских Australopithecus sediba: кое-кто предположил, что челюсти и скелеты относятся к разным видам, даже несмотря на то, что скелеты артикулированные! Нельзя забывать, что систематика создана людьми и призвана помочь нам в упорядочивании информации о живых организмах, а не создавать сложности. Должно быть удобство, а ВЕЛИКОЙ ИСТИНЫ в названиях древних организмов, в общем-то, нет. Систематика – это инструмент, а не цель. Из всего вышеизложенного кто-то может сделать вывод, что все эти изыскания – сплошная демагогия, лишённая смысла. Но это, как ни странно, не так. Во-первых, такие споры активизируют разработку новых подходов и более детальное изучение окаменелостей. Во-вторых, проблема принципиально всё же решаема. Надо только лучше и больше использовать материалы по современным людям и обезьянам. Ведь у нас есть универсальный масштаб внутривидовой, видовой, родовой и семейственной изменчивости человекообразных: два вида шимпанзе, гориллы, орангутаны, десяток гиббонов (все обезьяны – с подвидами), куча рас современных людей. Все карты на руках, надо только ими пользоваться. Карту рас западные антропологи разыграть не способны в силу политкорректности, но обезьян-то пока никто исследовать не запрещает! Важно, что находки в Дманиси позволяют с новой стороны взглянуть на становление рода Homo, дают новые уникальные данные, будят научную мысль, провоцируют дальнейшие исследования.

  "latent_1952": "Just after House Speaker John Boehner affirmed the eventual need for Republicans to embrace immigration reform, a commercial for a carbonated beverage, of all things, demonstrated how difficult that process is likely to be.\n\nCoca-Cola’s Super Bowl ad featured a series of multicultural images set to “America the Beautiful,” sung in seven languages. It turned out to be a national Rorschach test. The immediate reaction of some — myself included — was a lump in the throat. There is something moving about hearing American ideals of brotherhood, reverence and sacrifice praised in other tongues. It is the universality of these longings that makes them powerful. For the same reason, I get misty when I hear “Amazing Grace” sung in Tsonga, Swahili or Kituba. Some hopes belong to everyone.\n\nThe immediate reaction of others — measured by Twitter and talk radio — was that the ad represented an aggressive and divisive multiculturalism and that American national songs should be sung in English (though conservative blogger Erick Erickson smartly noted that “E Pluribus Unum isn’t in English either”). Fox News radio host Todd Sarnes called Coca-Cola “the official soft drink of illegals crossing the border.” Former congressman Allen West (R-Fla.) declared America “on the road to perdition.”\n\nThis is already making too much of a Twitter tempest. But it does illustrate a vivid difference in disposition. Some looked at those images and saw an affirmation of the universality of American ideals; others saw a violation of the particularities of American culture, such as the use of English. Some saw exceptionalism and strength; others adulteration and threat. It doesn’t take the application of electrodes in a psych lab experiment to understand that these are deep, preconscious responses.\n\nAs a policy issue, immigration reform is complex, with serious arguments about the economic effects of migrants on the native-born working class and serious questions about more adversarial forms of multiculturalism. But it is this immediate reaction, this habit of mind, that has large political implications.\n\n1 of 12 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Latina movers and shakers View Photos Women and Latino voters are two of the most sought-after demographics for both of the major political parties, but Hispanic women account for only 1 percent of elected officials nationwide.

Steve Petteway/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nAfter decades of participation and reflection, here is my proposal for the most basic truth of politics: Human beings know if they are welcome at a party or not. I imagine there are good evolutionary reasons for this — an offered mastodon steak or an offered Cosmopolitan cocktail might easily be an ambush. For this reason, effective ethnic politics (and not just ethnic politics) is actually a form of hospitality: Please make yourself at home. “People don’t care how much you know,” said my old boss, the late Jack Kemp, “until they know how much you care.”\n\nSometimes politics really is this simple. After all the arguments about economics and assimilation, people understand if they are viewed as a threat to the predominant culture. They know if their voice is not welcome in the national chorus. And this does have implications for political philosophy. Kemp — the GOP congressman and vice presidential candidate who described himself as a “bleeding-heart conservative” — passionately believed that human beings, as a rule, are economic and social advantages, the ultimate sources of energy, creativity and wealth. This included anyone, of any background, who happened to be in front of him and smothered by his enthusiastic attentions. Kemp strongly rejected the notion — common in every generation — that the current cohort of immigrants are somehow inferior to immigrants past.\n\nI’m sorry to wax nostalgic — but not really. I saw how a Republican politician could treat immigrants and minorities as if they were valued national possessions. And I saw Kemp’s frustration with the direction of his party. “We sound like we don’t want immigration,” he said. “We sound like we don’t want black people to vote for us. What are we going to do — meet in a country club in the suburbs one day?”\n\nThe shift to a more welcoming GOP message toward immigrants won’t happen in a single rush. It is not reasonable to expect Boehner to buck much of his conference without broader reinforcement. This will take donors and business groups willing to support pro-reform House and Senate candidates against tea party challenges — reducing the political risks of rationality. And it will require a presidential candidate in 2016 who offers something more than walls topped in barbed wire and self-deportation. Some optimistic, inclusive, Kemp-like leadership would be helpful cover for many Republicans who wish to do the right thing, the politically smart thing, on immigration reform.\n\nBut the most important change that is needed is the hardest to achieve: A genuine welcome to the party. And an honest prayer: Dios derramó su gracia sobre ti.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .",
  "latent_2058": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian state security prosecutors are questioning the makers of a commercial for Vodafone Egypt after a little-known rap singer alleged the ad included coded signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nVodafone branding is seen outside a retail store in London November 12, 2013. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe Egyptian unit of Vodafone, the world’s biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions.\n\nIn a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday, it said the ad posted on YouTube and social media channels and featuring a well-known puppet character was meant to promote a special offer for customers to re-activate their old SIM cards and had no hidden meaning.\n\nAny other explanations “are pure fiction and personal opinions” for which the company is not responsible, it added, suggesting it might take legal action “against whomever (is) trying to distort the company’s reputation”.\n\nThe preliminary investigation was launched following a complaint by 25 year-old rapper Ahmed Spider, security and judiciary sources said.\n\nSpider told the private Al-Tahrir TV channel in an interview that baubles on a Christmas tree featured in the commercial represented bombs.\n\nHe said the tree’s branches mimicked the four-finger gesture used to symbolize the raid by security forces on August 14 last year that killed hundreds of supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi who were camped out in Cairo.\n\nSecurity sources said the singer was known to be an anti-Islamist and a supporter of the army that last July removed elected president Mursi after protests against his rule.\n\nThe government has designated Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and accused it of carrying out a suicide bomb attack last week on a police compound in Nile Delta in which 16 people were killed. The Brotherhood, long Egypt’s main political opposition force, has denied any links to the attack.\n\nThe ad shows Egyptian puppet character Abla Fahita and her daughter Karkoura desperately searching for her deceased father’s SIM card. Speaking on the phone with a friend called “Mama Touta”, Fahita says she asked for the sniffer dog of a shopping mall to search for the missing card.\n\nSpider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack.\n\n“Abla Fahita is a comic character, used in this ad as a tool to clarify the offer to viewers/customers, in a comic and sarcastic context,” Vodafone said in its statement.\n\n“The ad is only a marketing communication tool. It does not carry any hidden messages or meanings other than what has been mentioned above.”\n\nCompany spokesman Khaled Hegazy had earlier said that employees from Vodafone Egypt’s marketing and legal departments had been asked about who made the commercial.\n\n“We are very sad that there are people who think in this way in Egypt,” said Hegazy, voicing concern that a top state prosecutor had taken seriously the suggestion that a phone company’s ad was promoting terrorism.\n\nVodafone Egypt, one of three mobile network operators in the country, is about 55 percent owned by Britain’s Vodafone and around 45 percent by state-owned landline monopoly Telecom Egypt.\n\nThe case triggered satirical comment on social media.\n\n“Egypt security: If somebody sees or knows where Abla Fahita, the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist puppet, is hiding contact our Muslim Brotherhood hotline,” a tweet under the name of arab resistance read.\n\nAnother tweet by Iyad El-Baghdadi said: “Forget the four-finger sign, Abla Fahita should become the symbol of resistance to Egypt’s new regime.”",

Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nIsrael needs to reach peace with the Palestinians to avoid becoming a binational state, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday.\n\nHe stressed, however, that the core of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians was not territory, but rather a Palestinian unwillingness to recognize Israel’s legitimacy within any boundaries.\n\nNetanyahu’s comments at a meeting with top Foreign Ministry officials came amid signs of revived motion on the Palestinian track . He made similar comments during a meeting later in the day with five US congressmen, giving the impression that he was staking out a pre-negotiation position.“We’re engaged right now in an effort that we appreciate, led by [US] President [Barack] Obama and Secretary [of State John] Kerry to restart the peace negotiations between us and the Palestinians,” Netanyahu told the delegation headed by Rep. Ed Royce (R-California).“We’re eager to do it; we have no preconditions and we think there shouldn’t be any preconditions to restart negotiations,” he said.He added, however, that for the negotiations to succeed, they have to rest on two basic pillars: “One is that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state, and second that Israel has solid security arrangements.”At the Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, Netanyahu said the root of the conflict was not territorial.“It started long before 1967.You saw what happened when we left Gaza. We uprooted the last settler, and what did we get in return? Missiles,” he said.“The unwillingness of the Palestinians to recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people is the root of the conflict,” he said. “If we reach an agreement, I want to know that the conflict does not continue, and that there are no other Palestinian claims afterward.”Explaining the context of Netanyahu’s remarks, one government official said that there was “currently a great deal of effort to get the process back on track, and we might be getting close to talks.”As a result, he said, these issues are “more relevant again.”Netanyahu’s comments came two days after an Arab League delegation in Washington, following meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and Kerry, indicated it would accept in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative a slight modification to the pre- 1967 lines as part of an Israel- Palestinian peace accord.Kerry on Tuesday afternoon in Washington heaped praise on the Arab League delegation for what he said was essentially the relaunching of their initiative. He said that initiative will ensure that if Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement, the 22- member Arab League, as well as the 57 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, would consider the conflict over, normalize relations with Israel, sign peace agreements with Israel and provide security for all regional states.“I don’t underestimate the significance of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, [United] Arab Emirates, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, and others coming to the table and saying, “We are prepared to make peace now in 2013,” he said.Netanyahu, meanwhile, urged the Foreign Ministry staff to stress over and over in their messaging that the root of the conflict was not Yitzhar in Samaria but rather Acre, Jaffa and Ashkelon.“You need to say that,” he said. “There is no need to apologize, you need to tell the truth.”He did not directly address the Arab League move.“The root of the conflict is not territorial,” he said at the meeting, his first with the Foreign Ministry since the elections and his taking over as foreign minister until the fate of Avigdor Liberman is determined in court.In addition to discussing the diplomatic situation, he also heard complaints about budgetary constraints facing the ministry and the fact that some of its traditional duties had been parceled off to other ministries.One participant at the meeting said that when asked about the ministry’s budgetary problems, Netanyahu replied simply, “Lousy strategy and big money get no results. Good strategy, little money, get good results.” He made no promises of a bigger budget.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

The reports suggested one or more arrests could take place as early as Monday.\n\nThat would take the broad investigation into Russia’s role in the election, which has hung over Donald Trump’s presidency since it began, to a new level, raising questions over how the White House and its allies would respond. Trump and his supporters have disparaged Mueller and tried to portray him as a sympathiser of Hillary Clinton and James Comey, the FBI chief fired by Trump.\n\nSome Republicans called on Friday for Mueller to step down. A former Trump adviser, Sebastian Gorka, who has frequently been a mouthpiece for the president on television, tweeted: “If this man’s team executes warrants this weekend he should stripped of his authority … Then HE should be investigated.”\n\nAny attempt by Trump to have Mueller fired would trigger a severe political crisis. There are also mounting concerns among US allies over how the president, besieged at home, would act on the world stage, especially in the western Pacific where there is a worsening nuclear standoff with North Korea.\n\nUS intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media.\n\nMueller, a former FBI director, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts, and whether they sought to obstruct justice by covering up such collusion. The investigation has also widened to examine issues of money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager in the summer of 2016, is known to be one of the targets of the Mueller investigation. His house was searched in a pre-dawn raid in July. There was no reply from his spokesman to a request for comment on the reports that charges had been approved by a grand jury.\n\nConservative site initially hired firm that produced Trump-Russia dossier Read more\n\nCarter Page, who temporarily served as a Trump foreign policy adviser, and Michael Flynn, who was national security adviser in the early weeks of the administration, have also been under close scrutiny. The investigation has been inching closer to Trump himself. Earlier this month the president’s former spokesman, Sean Spicer, and chief of staff, Reince Priebus, were questioned by Mueller’s team.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment to Reuters or CNN on Friday.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied the allegations.\n\nMueller was appointed by the justice department to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired Comey, who was leading a federal investigation into possible collusion with Russia.\n\nTrump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale. In a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.",

  "latent_2614": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is filing a class action lawsuit against President Obama over the NSA's collection of phone data. (The Washington Post)\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R) and Matt Kibbe, president of the conservative organizing group FreedomWorks, are filing a class action lawsuit against President Obama and other members of his administration over the National Security Agency's collection of phone metadata, a practice they believe violates the Fourth Amendment. In a YouTube video released Tuesday, Paul compared the government surveillance to the warrantless searches practiced by the British military prior to American independence.\n\n\"The lesson of the American Revolution was that this should never happen again, and yet the NSA's data collection program is the modern equivalent of this practice,\" Paul says. He later adds, \"Paul Revere rode through the streets to tell us the British were coming, not the Americans are coming.\"\n\nThe lawsuit includes Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Director of National Security Agency Keith Alexander and FBI Director James Comey, as well as Obama, as defendants. Ken Cuccinelli, a former attorney general of Virginia who lost a gubernatorial bid in the state in the fall, is the lawsuit's lead counsel. In a statement released by RandPac, the main super PAC supporting the senator and his top issues, he said, \"We have assembled a legal team and we expect to be opposed by the vast resources of the federal government, yet I am optimistic that we will prevail, because we are seeking to protect a cornerstone of the Constitution.”\n\nPaul filed the lawsuit at 11 a.m. Wednesday as a private citizen at the D.C. District Court. At a news conference immediately after the filing, Paul, Cuccinelli and Kibbe took questions about the lawsuit, with Cuccinelli addressing the legal details of the case, and Paul framing the targeted legal question posed by the lawsuit -- what does the Fourth Amendment mean in 2014 -- with his larger policy concerns about the NSA, the Patriot Act, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Paul and Cuccinelli reiterated that the court case only sought to clarify the constitutional meaning of the Fourth Amendment -- a question they hope reaches the Supreme Court. As Paul said, \"Ultimately,the Supreme Court will be arbiter of what the Fourth Amendment means.\" If larger questions about civil liberties emerge over the course of the case, despite its limited scope, however, Paul wouldn't object to that. \"We need to be asking these questions ... whether we get to that in the court case I don’t know,\" he said.\n\nDuring his political career as one of the most prominent libertarian politicians in office, Paul has made civil liberties one of his chief policy concerns. He is on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, as well as the Foreign Relations committee. FreedomWorks gave Paul a $5,ooo donation in 2012.\n\nThe lawsuit will also likely help Paul's reelection bid in 2016 — or a presidential bid if he decided to aim higher. All supporters who sign a petition supporting the NSA lawsuit will go to Paul's campaign database, as shown by reporting from Politico last month. When Paul was asked a question about 2016 during the news conference, he quickly brushed it off. \"We’re talking about the court case, not politics,\" he said.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is also engaging the NSA through the courts.\n\n“We agree that the NSA’s phone-records program is unconstitutional,\" said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director, in a statement. \"Mass surveillance of this kind infringes not just on privacy rights but on the freedoms of speech and association as well. We’ve advanced these arguments in our own lawsuit against the NSA, and over the next few weeks we’ll make them to a federal appeals court.”",

Apple is set to release its latest version, called Snow Leopard, on Friday, ahead of its previously announced September availability.\n\nThe Apple release, officially Mac OS X 10.6, also precedes Microsoft's Windows 7, scheduled to debut Oct. 22. In a press release announcing the update, Bertrand Serlet, senior vice president of Software Engineering at Apple, said, \"Snow Leopard builds on our most successful operating system ever and we're happy to get it to users earlier than expected.\"\n\nUnlike new versions of most operating systems (including earlier Apple versions), the changes in Snow Leopard focus on improving core technologies and performance instead of introducing a slew of new features.\n\nThe top-tier enhancements in version 10.6 include greatly expanded 64-bit support, which enables software to access more memory and speed up some computationally intensive operations; Grand Central Dispatch, which makes it easier for software to take advantage of multicore processors; and OpenCL, a technology for tapping the significant processing power found in graphics cards.\n\nKen Case, CEO and founder of Mac development shop The Omni Group, said, \"From our point of view, Snow Leopard is one of the best releases of Mac OS X, because it deals so much with the underlying technologies.\"\n\nCase noted that the next major revisions of its Mac applications will require Mac OS X 10.6 or later. (Snow Leopard compatible updates to existing versions will be ready shortly after the operating system ships.)\n\nQuickTime X, the latest version of Apple's multimedia technology, has been reworked with a simplified QuickTime Player that's capable of trimming video clips and uploading them to YouTube or Apple's MobileMe service. It can also now record movies of what happens on your screen. Professionals who rely on the pro features of the current QuickTime 7 can include the QuickTime Player 7 as an installation option.\n\nBuilt-in support for Microsoft Exchange, the widely used e-mail and communications server software, enables Snow Leopard to easily connect the built-in Mail, Address Book, and iCal programs to Exchange Server 2007, an option, Apple notes, that requires an additional fee under Microsoft Windows.\n\nApple refers to other changes in the operating system as \"refinements.\" Many focus on performance: 64-bit versions of the Finder and most core applications speed up the system in general, Time Machine backups are faster, and Safari 4 (already available) gains speed boosts and reliability under Snow Leopard. Snow Leopard is also significant in that it only runs on Macs powered by Intel processors; older PowerPC-based Macs are no longer supported.\n\nSnow Leopard is a $29 update to the company's Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, which powers recent Mac computers. A five-license family pack costs $49. Owners of the earlier Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger can upgrade by purchasing the Mac Box Set for $169, which includes Snow Leopard, iLife '09, and iWork '09, these most-recent versions of iLife and iWork require at least Mac OS X 10.5 to run.\n\nIf you purchased a new Mac after June 8, you can upgrade for $9.95 through Apple's Snow Leopard Up-to-Date program.\n\nJeff Carlson is one of the contributors to the Practical Mac column in Personal Technology.",
  "latent_2847": "There is a lot of chatter in legal circles, particularly on the conservative side of the political fence, about the indictment handed down on Thursday of Imran Awan, the Pakistani-born computer technician working for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida) whose little congressional empire came crashing down amid a Capitol Police investigation into missing computer equipment, the potential for theft of sensitive government information and suspected blackmail of members of Congress.\n\nAwan wasn’t indicted on Thursday for any of the things he’s been in the news for since February. That in and of itself isn’t particularly suspicious; one would get the impression that investigation would be long-lasting and would need to include Awan’s brothers and a handful of other members of his clan, all of whom got jobs as IT workers for Democrat congressmen (including Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, who has yet to be asked a single question about his role in this scandal so far as we’ve seen), and would be expected to last a bit longer.\n\nNevertheless, there are some alarm bells going off about the indictment, and for good reason. It’s not an unreasonable suspicion that the US Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, which brought the indictment, could be intentionally blowing the case.\n\nAwan and his wife Hina Alvi were indicted on bank fraud, a charge stemming from the fact they borrowed nearly $300,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union under dubious circumstances and then wired the money to Pakistan. Alvi then fled to that country, carrying on her person some $12,000; that is illegal in and of itself, as federal law says any amount more than $10,000 has to carry with it a federal form containing information on things like the provenance of that cash, its intended use and so forth. She was detained at the airport on her way out but for some reason let out of the country and the feds don’t expect her ever to return. Now that she’s been indicted and so has her husband, it’s more of less obvious she won’t be back.\n\nNational Review’s Andrew McCarthy took a deep dive into the indictment and was perplexed, to put it mildly, by the failure of the indictment to include this information and the fact Awan was also detained at the airport as he attempted to flee to Pakistan.\n\nWell, here’s a peculiar thing about the Justice Department’s indictment of Imran Awan and Hina Alvi, the alleged fraudster couple who doubled as IT wizzes for Debbie Wasserman Schultz and many other congressional Democrats: There’s not a word in it about flight to Pakistan. The indictment undertakes to describe in detail four counts of bank-fraud conspiracy, false statements on credit applications, and unlawful monetary transactions, yet leaves out the most damning evidence of guilt. In fact, the indictment appears to go out of its way not to mention it.\n\nMcCarthy is bothered by more flaws in the indictment than just the omission of the attempt to flee.\n\nIt is common Justice Department practice, in pleading a conspiracy indictment, to allege that the scheme began “on or about” its starting date and continued “up to and including the date of the filing of this indictment.” Strictly speaking, a conspiracy ends when the crime that is its objective has been completed. But there is no requirement that a specific end date be set forth in the indictment. Therefore, prosecutors go as long as they can — i.e., right up to the date the grand jury voted to indict — to give themselves the widest berth possible to argue that evidence damaging to the defense is relevant and admissible. But that is not what happened in the Awan indictment. The Justice Department alleges that the conspiracy took place “from on or about December 12, 2016 through on or about February 27, 2017.” February 27 was six days before Alvi fled and five months before Awan was arrested trying to leave the country. This makes no sense. Indeed, it does not even make sense in the context of the narrow scheme prosecutors have charged: Although the indictment says the conspiracy ended on February 27, it alleges a relevant $83,000 interbank transfer occurred on February 28 (see indictment, paragraphs 8 and 22). That is, prosecutors assert that a money transfer supposedly in furtherance of the conspiracy happened a day after the conspiracy was already over.\n\nThe effect of this, McCarthy surmises, could be that Awan’s defense attorney – a former Clinton campaign flunky named Christopher Bowen – could get all evidence of Alvi’s flight out of the country, and Awan’s attempted flight as well, tossed as inadmissible since it’s not in the indictment and therefore kill the bank fraud case against the Awans. If the jury doesn’t get to know that these people had attempted to follow the money they took from the credit union out of the country, it’s a lot more plausible that they’re working on paying it back and thus there is no bank fraud.\n\nAnd if there is no bank fraud and the Awans aren’t in legal jeopardy from this indictment, the chances of getting them to confess to the other things they’ve been investigated for get a lot smaller.\n\nMaybe that’s by design. Bowen’s statement after Awan was picked up in late July attempting to flee the country read like a political campaign press release, full of partisan charges and vitriol about how his client is the victim of an Islamophobic witch hunt and so forth. It was so overheated that one couldn’t help but think the speculation Awan may have stolen a great deal of sensitive information from clients on the House intelligence, foreign relations and homeland security committees, and perhaps bribed some of his clients as well, had some meat on its bones.\n\nAnd one wouldn’t be off base in thinking that if these things were true a large number of Awan’s clients would really like to see this whole thing just go away. Particularly given how far down the rabbit hole something like this could lead. Wasserman Schultz was the chair of the Democrat National Committee, after all, and the DNC’s e-mails were leaked to Wikileaks, after all, something the party has gone to great lengths to blame on Russia without as much evidence as one might have expected for so serious a charge.\n\nAnd why would the Justice Department go along with throwing a case like this and setting the stage for the whole thing to be covered up?\n\nWell, the Trump administration has a nominee for the US Attorney job in DC. His name is Jesse Liu and he was nominated in June. But Liu doesn’t have the job yet because Democrats in the Senate are holding up his confirmation. In the meantime the acting US Attorney whose office generated the Awan indictment is Channing D. Phillips, who was appointed to that position in October of 2015. Phillips’ background, from his official bio, would make one believe he’s a pretty loyal Democrat…\n\nMr. Phillips has been serving as the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia since October 19, 2015 pursuant to the Attorney General’s appointment authority and subsequently by an Order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Mr. Phillips’ confirmation is pending with the United States Senate. Mr. Phillips formerly served as counselor to the Attorney General, and also served as the Executive Director for the Attorney General’s Diversity Management Advisory Council and was the day-to-day coordinator for diversity-management issues within the Department and the Department’s primary contact for external agencies on these issues.\n\nIf you noticed that Phillips has never undergone a Senate confirmation, you win a prize. Why he wasn’t asked to resign along with the rest of the Obama US Attorneys is a hell of a question; our guess is that was a political fight Trump decided not to have.\n\nAnd if the name Channing Phillips rings a bell, it’s because his father was placed in nomination for president at the 1968 Democrat National Convention and received 68 votes, making him the first black American ever to have been in the presidential nomination game at a major party convention.\n\nYou’ll forgive us for being suspicious that the US Attorney’s office in DC, on the roster of which sits one Steven Wasserman, the brother of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and which is headed by a never-confirmed Obama appointee who looks an awful lot like Mr. Democrat Party, would put out an indictment this sloppy in the Awan case. We’re becoming jaded and suspicious in our old age.\n\nExperience, especially when it comes to Democrat corruption, has had that effect on us.",

  "latent_3315": "PITTSBURGH -- Sean Spence will add another chapter to his inspirational story on Sunday when the Pittsburgh Steelers inside linebacker makes his first NFL start.\n\nSteelers linebackers coach Keith Butler told Spence Wednesday morning that the 5-foot-11, 231-pounder will start in place of Ryan Shazier, who is nursing a sprained knee, against the visiting Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nIt had to be particularly gratifying for Butler to deliver that news to Spence.\n\nIt was Butler, after all, who said in April of 2013 that it would be a “miracle” if Spence ever played again.\n\n“The tunnel was dark for me for a long time, but I stayed positive and Steelers Nation stayed behind me,” said Spence, who shredded his left knee in a 2012 preseason game and dislocated his knee cap while also sustaining nerve damage. “I finally get to get some good quality reps on defense.”\n\nSpence actually got those last Sunday night when he replaced the injured Shazier in the third quarter of the Steelers' 37-19 win over the Carolina Panthers.\n\nAnd the 2012 third-round pick played well enough to earn the start this week with Shazier already declared out against the Buccaneers.\n\nSpence recorded three tackles against Carolina, including one when he tripped up Cam Newton after the Panthers quarterback had escaped a collapsing pocket. Newton had a lot of grass in front of him when he started to scramble, but Spence limited him to a 5-yard gain.\n\nSpence, who logged a career-high 35 snaps last Sunday night, said his play in Carolina proved “that I can play in the National Football League. I hadn’t done it in two years, and the preseason doesn’t really count and Sunday night counted. I think I held up pretty well.”\n\nSpence will probably make more than a few calls after his work day is finished.\n\nHis parents are at the top of the list of people with whom he wants to share his latest good news. Spence will also call former Steelers linebacker Larry Foote, who is now playing for the Arizona Cardinals, at some point.\n\n“I talk to Larry every week. He’s like a big brother to me,” Spence said. “He mentored me when he was here, not only in football but life.”",
  "latent_3329": "Today (21st April) is the traditional date given for the founding of Rome. According to Roman mythology, the founders were Romulus and Remus, twin brothers and supposed sons of the god Mars and the priestess Rhea Silvia. The twins were then abandoned by their parents as babies (because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle Amulius), but were saved by a she-wolf who nursed them. Romulus killed his brother after a vicious quarrel and went on to establish a city which he named after himself.\n\nAlthough the original date given by Roman historians for the founding of Rome varied between 758 and 728 BC, the official date was set as 753 BC. Archaeologists have traced evidences of villages on the Palatine Hill dating back to around the 9th century BC.\n\nThe ancient Romans celebrated the founding of their city every April 21st in the festival of Palilia. This festival was originally aimed at cleansing both sheep and shepherds in honour of Pales, the goddess of shepherds, but was later associated with the founding or Rome. The connection between these two characters of the festival is evident as the founders of the city, Romulus and Remus, grew up to be shepherds like their adoptive father.\n\nThis panel comes from a sacrificial altar dedicated to the divine couple of Mars and Venus found at Ostia (Italy). This side of the altar shows a scene with the she-wolf nursing Romulus and Remus, a personification of the river Tiber, and two fleeing shepherds, probably Faustulus, adoptive father of the twins and his brother Faustinus. On the left is the personification of the Palatine, also dressed as a shepherd. The eagle of Jupiter, symbolically hovering over the sacred grotto of the Lupercal, indicates that the events are unfolding under divine auspices.\n\nThe altar carries various inscriptions. One of the inscription tells us that the altar was later used as a pedestal for a bronze statue of the god Silvanus. The consuls mentioned in the text inscribed securely date the inscription to October 1st, 124 AD. In this period Hadrian promoted renewed interest in themes related to the origins of Rome.\n\nThis aureus of Hadrian was struck in 121 AD to commemorate the circus games that marked the 874th birthday of the city of Rome. The reverse of the coin depicts the Genius of the Circus Maximus with the legend “ANN. DCCCLXXIIII NAT. VRB. P. CIR. CON.” meaning that in the 874th year, circus games were for the first time instituted (Circenses constituta) for the natalis urbis romae (birthday of the city).\n\nIn the same year, while celebrating the Parilia festival, Hadrian founded a new temple dedicated to Venus, the divine ancestress of the Roman people, and to Roma herself. The temple was to stand on the north side of the Sacred Way on a great podium, stretching from just beyond the Arch of Titus and almost as far as the Colosseum. The two goddesses would be placed back to back with one cella facing toward the Colosseum, the other facing towards the Forum. As Dio Cassius tells us, Hadrian himself seems to have personally designed the temple. However, construction of the temple did not begin until 125 AD.\n\nHaving dedicated the temple, Hadrian changed the name of the Parilia festival to Romaia (the Natalis Urbis Romae) and associated the new Temple to the celebrations of the birthday of Rome. In addition Hadrian retraced the sacred boundary of the pomerium, the original line ploughed by Romulus around the walls of the original city. In doing so, Hadrian renewed the festival of Parilia in associating himself with Romulus.\n\nOne other coin minted in Rome in the year 121 proclaimed a new Golden Age (saeculum aureum).\n\nThis gold aureus featured on the reverse the Genius of the golden age “Saeculum Aureum” holding the zodiac and the phoenix on a globe, suggesting rebirth and renewal. Through this type of coin, Hadrian aimed at bringing the empire to its pinnacle while emphasising the power of Rome within the vast empire.\n\nLinks and further reading:\n\nSources:\n\nBoatwright, M.T.

The arrogance of the British royals is staggering, absolutely staggering. And why it's allowed to be I really don't know,'' Morrissey said.\n\nAs soon as news of the suicide broke, both Prince William and Middleton released a statement expressing their sorrow at Saldanha's death.\n\nHyperemesis Gravidarum can be life-threatening if left untreated, and causes severe dehydration.\n\nMorrissey however remained unconvinced Middleton's condition was a real one.\n\n''Does she have a health condition...? What is the health condition? I mean morning sickness already? So much hoo haw and then suddenly as bright as a button as soon as this poor woman dies she's out of hospital? It doesn't ring true.\n\n''And I'm sure the Palace and Clarence House put maximum pressure on this poor receptionist and nurse, and of course that's kept away from the press.\n\n\"I'm sure the British press hounded this poor woman to her death, that's kept away.\n\n''And by this time next week she'll be forgotten.

  "latent_3665": "Why I and other top players didn't enter Genesis Red & my Summer Schedule.\n\nSo some (admittedly short sighted and stupid) people are really upset that I didn't enter singles at Genesis Red, stating various absurd reasons so I thought that I'd explain a few reasons why I chose to focus on Doubles.\n\n1. Armada didn't enter (main person I wanted to beat) & Ice dropped out to focus on Doubles. Their full reasons might be different but I think a lot of their reasons will be similar.\n\n2. I didn't actually sign up for singles. The Genesis account DMd me a few days ago \"Hey Leffen, were you still interested in attending Genesis Red?\" and I answered \"Yeah I think I'm going\". That's it.\n\nI have stated several times on stream that I was most likely going to focus on doubles since I haven't really played any since Royal Flush and Fuse Finals are coming up. Genesis crew signed me up for singles without asking (I was planning to reg later).\n\n3. Practice: Entering a tournament is not the most efficient way to practice in the majority of cases. I know a lot of people simply do not understand this way of thinking, so I'll try to explain it.\n\nSeveral hours of Friendlies where you can freely choose opponent, stop to test things out, can focus on learning over winning, stop when you want to, food breaks etc vs:\n\n3-4 \"hard\" sets after starting tournament at 10am ending at 10PM (12 hours total)\n\n4. Burnout/Rest. First of, Singles started for me and Ice at 10am, and we are staying in San Jose which is an hour+ away. I've been sleeping really badly for some reason the last couple of days and cutting it short again wasn't really a sound option long term, and short term it's really hard to practice and learn properly when you're sleep deprived.\n\nSecondly, unlike some people who are taking a break after EVO (Armada is taking a 2month USA break iirc) I am going to a lot of tournaments after EVO.\n\nAfter EVO there's the HyperX event right after, so I don't get back until the 20th (Thurs) and then I fly to GOML the 25th (Tues). I get back next Tues, have one week off, then go to Smashcon, fly back to Sweden, fly to Heir (UK), back to Sweden, fly to Shine same week, stay there until Red Bull's Gods n Gatekeepers, get back 5-6th September.\n\nAfter that, I have bit off, but before end of September I'm going to Gametyrant Expo and then staying until The Big House. Oh and I am also hosting a tournament in Stockholm mid September.\n\nSo yeah, hopefully you see why entering Genesis Red isn't exactly viable, and if you still think its because \"I only wanna compete in perfect conditions\" or that I'm \"scared to lose\" then well, there's no saving you LUL.\n\nI'm sorry for the people that understood but just wanted to see me play, and I'm sorry for pulling a Mango and fucked up the seeding, but then again, Genesis Red's seeding was already trash ;)\n\nReply · Report Post",
  "latent_3727": "With 64 days to the election, the Republican nominee’s attack on the senator from the swing state of Arizona is a risky strategy\n\nDonald Trump entered a bitter war of words with Senator Jeff Flake on Sunday as the Republican nominee reverted to his behavior in the primary where he constantly attacked elected GOP officials.\n\nTrump used Twitter to attack Flake, a first-term senator from Arizona who has yet to commit to supporting Trump in November, as “very weak and ineffective” on the issue of immigration.\n\nTrump also tweeted: “The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration,” after Flake criticized Trump in an interview Sunday with CBS’s John Dickerson.\n\nIn the interview, Flake said Trump’s habit of changing his message on immigration was confusing for voters.\n\n“It’s kind of a 360-degree pivot at times. That’s not clear at all. Some people said it was hardening, some said softening. I say it was just confusing.”\n\nThe result left Flake feeling that it was unlikely that he would be able to support the Republican nominee in the election. “It becomes increasingly difficult to see that he’s going to change, so I don’t expect that I’ll be able to support him in November,” said Flake.\n\nTrump had spent the two weeks leading up to his major immigration speech on Wednesday hinting at support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants before reversing course. This culminated when Trump made a surprise visit to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto where he described illegal immigration as a “humanitarian crisis”. Only few hours later, while speaking to crowd of supporters in Phoenix, Trump announced “there will be no amnesty” and insisted “anyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don’t have a country.”\n\nTrump has tangled with Flake before. In July, the Arizona senator confronted Trump in a closed door meeting with other Republican elected officials in Washington DC. Flake has since called on the RNC to shift resources away from Trump and towards downballot races.\n\nTrump’s war of words with Flake comes 64 days before the election and with polls in Flake’s home state of Arizona looking increasing close. Hillary Clinton has recently begun advertising in the once deep red state and recent polls show Arizona to be a toss-up in November as the state’s growing Hispanic population has been alienated by Trump’s immigration rhetoric.\n\nIn addition, the attack on Flake, who is one of the most prominent Mormon politicians in the United States, risks further alienating that traditionally conservative demographic. Mormons have long viewed the Republican nominee unfavorably and their discontent has contributed to Trump’s weak poll numbers in states like Arizona as well as Utah.\n\nFlake is not the only Republican senator who is not voting for the party’s nominee. At least half a dozen others are refusing to back Trump’s candidacy, ranging from arch-conservative Ben Sasse of Nebraska to moderate Susan Collins of Maine.",

  "latent_3796": "Durban, South Africa\n\nAs long as technology is seen as a separate industry, rather than a tool to industrialize, innovation in Africa won’t reach its full potential.\n\nThat’s the experience of several innovators on the continent, who said on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Durban that technology continues to be siloed or isolated from many of Africa’s economies.\n\nInnovators who have been featured on the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Quartz Africa Innovators’ list voiced their frustrations during a discussion on creating Africa’s unicorn companies.\n\n“The biggest problem is that ministers of state, leaders, even business leaders, don’t understand that fundamental and integral nature that technology will play,” said Bright Simons, a tech entrepreneur and a 2015 honoree.\n\nWorld Economic Forum/Greg Beadle The Quartz Africa panel at the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfrican governments have created many buzzwords to describe the visions of progress they want on the continent, like “the fourth industrial revolution,” or “radical economic transformation,” said Simons, but they have failed to recognize how technology could bring these visions to life.\n\nIn Kenya, 2016 honoree Ciiru Waweru Waithaka has created a revolutionary flatpack range of children’s furniture that is playful and safe. Her company is going beyond being the Ikea of Africa, and yet finds itself frustrated by Kenya’s business environment.\n\nFunKidz is frustratingly considered as a small to medium enterprise that is locally categorized as “jua kali”—Swahili for working in the sun, or in the informal sector—said Waweru Waithaka. That means any engagement on expansion or regulation happens within these constraints.\n\n“They put us in a bracket,” she said on stage. “They say ‘you creative types,’ and they dismiss us.”\n\nPerhaps it is up to innovators to explain to policymakers the practicalities of what their industries need to succeed and meaningfully contribute to the economy, said Rapelang Rabana, the founder of the Rekindle Learning platform and a 2017 honoree.\n\n“We need to be translating what a 5% increase in bandwidth translates into in these industries and what kind of opportunities manifest,” said Rabana.\n\nThis challenge, said Simons, should encourage innovators to build industrial innovations to show just how an economy should be built on the tech industry, not beside it.",
  "latent_3832": "In a statement, the company said it had a “serious negative operating cash flow” which raised “serious doubts” about its ability to continue as a going concern, and said it was taking steps, including pay cuts, voluntary redundancies and asset sales, to generate cash flow.\n\nWhile Sharp is in the most serious trouble, the three companies’ woes are similar at the core.\n\nAll three make good quality, even cutting-edge products — but so do their overseas competitors, usually at lower prices. None of the three have managed to generate the brand pizazz of Apple, or the marketing muscle of Samsung Electronics. In addition, a stubbornly strong yen continues to sap their competitiveness, while Japan’s territorial dispute with China has hurt sales there.\n\nThe scale of the losses is the result of specific missteps, from huge investments in the wrong technologies to a reluctance to exit loss-making businesses. A manufacturing bubble here in the mid-2000s — fed partly by an unusually weak currency and Americans flush with cash from rising home prices — masked continued weaknesses in their business models and spurred the companies to take big bets that backfired.\n\nWhen the global financial crisis brought that boom to an end in 2008, the three were saddled with excess capacity, bloated work forces and investments that they could hardly hope to recoup. And their refusal to make a big enough departure from the ways of their glory years is now making a comeback difficult.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Many investors are longing for reforms that will let all of the pus out,” Yuji Fujimori, technology analyst at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, said in a recent note to clients.\n\nSharp’s stumble, in many ways, has been the most humbling. It was the biggest beneficiary of the manufacturing bubble: from 2000 to 2007, its profits jumped 150 percent. Sharp’s high-end Aquos liquid-crystal display televisions — which it manufactured at state-of-the-art factories in Kameyama, in western Japan — were a runaway hit in the nascent flat-panel market. The spinoff Aquos cellphone topped Japanese sales rankings. Sharp’s solar batteries also sold briskly, helped by a bubble in green technologies.\n\nThe company’s success during this period seemed to validate Japan’s penchant for manufacturing their most important products in-house. In advertisements, Sharp showed off its cutting-edge factories.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

In 2008, the iPhone made its debut in Japan, the end of an era for Japanese-style cellphones. Chinese upstarts were starting to flood global markets with cheap solar panels and batteries. In consumer electronics, outsourced manufacturing became the norm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Sharp did not change course. It built a new factory in Sakai, Japan, which could make 6 million large LCD panels a year — more than the size of the global market at the time. Sharp missed the smartphone wave, and its cellphone sales in Japan halved from 2007 to 2012. And in late 2011, the solar bubble burst, driving many solar power companies into bankruptcy and Sharp’s solar batteries business into the red. The unit has not turned a profit since.\n\nNow, the Kameyama factories no longer make televisions but panels for Apple’s iPhones and iPads.\n\nPanasonic, for its part, also bet heavily on plasma televisions in 2003, pouring some 600 billion yen into a series of factories in Amagasaki, not far from Sharp’s own plant. It also bet on solar panels and rechargeable batteries, buying Sanyo in 2009.\n\nBut with plasma now a fading technology and solar power struggling, Panasonic is saddled with major losses. Last year, it announced that a factory in Amagasaki was closing, less than two years after it opened.\n\nKazuhiro Tsuga, who took the helm at Panasonic this year, was blunt in describing his company’s predicament. “We are among the losers in consumer electronics,\" he told a news conference on Wednesday. He now promises to shift the company away from money-losing televisions and gadgets.\n\nOf the three, Sony now seems the most prescient. Its executives have preached the power of networks and content since the 1990s, building up a vast catalog of music and movies to lure users to their devices. Sony has also moved to slash costs and jobs and sell off some unprofitable businesses, refocusing the company on digital cameras and imaging technology, video games and mobile devices. This quarter, the sale of its chemical products business, which made materials for LCDs and optical discs, helped alleviate losses. Sony is now making a push into the medical field with an investment in the endoscope maker Olympus.\n\nInternal squabbling has quashed its efforts to marry its hardware and software, however, and it refuses to abandon one of its biggest money-losers, its television business, which has bled red ink for eight consecutive years.\n\n“We intend to hunker down and build a profitable business,” Masaru Kato, Sony’s chief financial officer, told a news conference Thursday. “And where we can, we will chase new markets.”",

  "latent_3858": "Totally casual, but we spent last week on Broadway. Yep. The bad news is it was nowhere NEAR long enough but the good news is we saw some AMAZING shows. For theatre lovers like us the experience was a true dream! Below are our show by show reviews of what we saw! Enjoy!\n\nKinky Boots Review\n\nKinky Boots is the Broadway sensation by Harvey Fierstein and popstar Cyndi Lauper, based on a true story about a man who takes over his fathers shoe factory and is inspired by a group of transgendered performers.\n\nWhen I sat down in the exceptionally fabulous Orchestra Stalls of the Al Hirschfield Theatre on 45th and 8th I was very aware that I was about to take in my first ever Broadway show. Whilst I see three or more shows a week back home in London, this was my first experience of the Great White Way. I had dreamt of this day for the past 7 or so years and I was finally here! And what better a show to break me in than Kinky Boots!\n\nI am a lover of all things sassy and this show is certainly that! As a theatre enthusiast I am no stranger to the music and story-line of this show and was actively in awe whilst watching the Kinky team perform in the Macy’s Thanksgiving day parade last year. So the music strikes up and I am immediately sold! Over the next couple of hours I was hit with an endearingly vivacious storyline (based on actual events!) peppered with jaunty song and dance numbers!\n\nOkay so let me get my one actual complaint out of the way right now. The show is set in Britain. The characters are supposed to be British. I AM, however, British and can spot a phoney accent a mile off. God love some of the cast for trying (and I can only imagine my New Yorker accent would be just as good!) but as a Brit it was hard not to be distracted by half cockney, half Australian attempts at the Northampton accent. That said, the marvellous Jeanna De Waal and Timothy Ware were almost convincing.\n\nPhew. Glad that is out of the way…now let’s get back to the praise!\n\nWare is a fierce and fabulous Lola, so much so that I forgot I was watching an understudy (the role is usually played by Tony Award Winning Billy Porter.) The sex was not only in Ware’s heel but just about every damn inch of him during his turn as Lola. Conversely, he presented a shy and vulnerable Simon (Lola without the drag) which rendered a real sense of three dimensional feeling to his character which I really felt touched the audience.\n\nSimilarly stand out was De Waal, who hit the nail on the head when presenting the somewhat overlooked factory worker, Lauren. De Waal brought the character to life with true pizzazz throughout the show but the moment that really got me cackling with laughter was her presentation of “The History of Wrong Guys.” I feel ya honey!\n\nAside from the super sensational costumes for the super sassy Lola and her Angels, my favourite element to Kinky Boots has to be Cyndi Lauper’s music and lyrics. Rarely do I really leave a theatre singing several of the productions show tunes, but here this was absolutely the case. Lauper proves herself more than just a popstar (as if we were in any real doubt!) and I do hope she pens a few more musicals with the perfect blend of fun and punch, as in Kinky Boots.\n\nI have a great deal of praise for everyone involved in the show, including director and choreographer Jerry Mitchell who I hope stays true to his word and brings this show to London. We would bloomin’ love it over here!\n\nBeautiful Review\n\nBeautiful is the new jukebox musical about the life and music of Carole King and her closest friends. The show transfers to London’s West End in early 2015!\n\nAll I have heard from across the pond from the eternally fabulous Great White Way is “Beautiful.” “Beautiful” this and “Beautiful” that, “you MUST SEE Beautiful!” OKAY ALREADY. Not satisfied with having to wait until 2015 like every other Londoner, I decided to make the trip to the Stephen Sondheim Theatre to see this show in its home on Broadway. I am pleased to report what New York has been saying for a long time: Beautiful is the next great jukebox musical and it will certainly enrich the West End when it arrives in the Spring.\n\nUnlike some Jukebox’s, Beautiful brings a new level of class to both its content and look; a well written book is offset by some simple but effective choreography and a stylish set that perfectly evokes the 60’s era.\n\nBeautiful again sets itself apart from it’s jukebox counterparts and the shows structure really allows for character development. Rather than actress Jessie Mueller, who depicts King, breaking into song at every available opportunity, her songs are performed by those much showier than herself and over the course of the two acts we slowly see her transform into a performer. It is an engaging journey to watch and one that Mueller performs flawlessly and enviably. I hope that our British Carole, Katie Brayben can perform the role with such blossoming colour.\n\nSimilarly I hope the still to be announced London cast can fulfil the roles of Gerry, played by Scott J Campbell, and rivals turned friends Cynthia Weil played by Anika Larsen and Barry Mann performed by Jarrod Spector. It is rare that secondary characters are just as interesting as the principles, but here this was most definitely the case.\n\nEven if you are unaware of the name “Carole King” (she did do a good job of hiding behind her musical writing in her early years) you will undoubtedly know her music. Tunes such as “Take Good Care of My Baby,” “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” “The Locomotion,” and “You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman” are all round crowd pleasers. Whilst the audience did seem to be made up of 50 something year olds who owned the Tapestry album, all generations alike gave rapturous applauses to the music.\n\nOkay so I am not sure that the show will have exactly the same effect as it does in Manhattan; the show is largely set in the city and focuses on Brooklyn born Carole King who spent her married life with Gerry living and working in the city. There is a certain vibe one gets from actually being THERE – where it all began on this journey to stardom for Carole, but it is of course still a relevant tale in any city and I think it will light up London’s Aldwych Theatre just as bright as Broadway’s Stephen Sondheim.\n\nYes, this show IS a jukebox musical so there is obviously a huge song and dance number to dramatic scene ratio, which is my least favourite thing about the genre. However Beautiful manages to also generate a true, meaningful and touching tale of personal success in the face of misery, which is something we can all draw inspiration from. I for one am very excited to see this show make its move to London, where I can only imagine it will attract similar success.\n\nYou can book tickets to see Beautiful in London NOW!\n\nThe Last Ship Review\n\nThe Last Ship is Sting’s new musical, with a book by John Logan and Brian Yorkey with direction by Joe Mantello. The story focuses on the lives of those living in Wallsend, North East England, in particular that of young lovers Gideon and Meg.\n\nEvery so often, now I am not talking once a week, once a month or even necessarily once a year, but once in a blue moon, a show comes along that truly takes your breath away. You sit there before the show having absolutely no idea what to expect and then: WHAM BAM! Pure and utter awesomeness hits you in the face leaving you irrevocably altered. So yep, as you may have guessed, this is what happened with The Last Ship.\n\nIt seems I like a bit of bleak, nitty gritty economical hardship in a production (who knew!) and this is certainly the case in The Last Ship. Maybe it is because those low on their luck tend to frequent the pub (it works in Once!) and love a good knees up?! I don’t know. Whatever it is I loved the aesthetic of this show. From its coral singing, to its bleak weather to its hard graft, I never wanted The Last Ship to stop sailing. Ever.\n\nI have never paid a great deal of attention to Sting. Yeah, like most, I like a bit of “Roxanne,” “English Man in New York” and “That’s Not The Shape of My Heart” but I would never have proclaimed to be a huge Sting fan. Well I’ll tell you what, I am now! There is no word to describe the music he has written for The Last Ship other than “perfect.” From opener “Island of Souls,” to the haunting “Autumn Winds,” to the super sassy “If You Ever See Me Talking To a Sailor,” to the powerful “The Last Ship” I was in awe. The music is gorgeous, and for a musical this is pretty much the battle won.\n\nAs both a performer and also a genuinely lovely lady, I have such a great deal of respect for Rachel Tucker. Tucker more than proved her worth on the West End after several years in the role of Elphaba in the West End and now she stakes her claim on Broadway in her cross Atlantic debut as the jilted Meg Dawson. Tucker begs to be watched from start to finish. She is vulnerable, lonely, crowded, sassy and self sufficient all in one. Tucker is perfect in the role, her singing voice is to be marvelled at and so is her successful Geordie accent! I can only aspire to be as sassy as Tucker makes Meg in “If You Ever See Me Talking To a Sailor.” Bravo!\n\nThe rest of the cast are similarly fantastic, including the stand out Jimmy Nail and Michael Esper. Colin Kelly-Sordelet is also delivers a truly tear jerking performance at times. Best of all are the whole cast when they come together to sing powerful choral-like chants such as “The Last Ship.” I think the word “rousing” would probably be an understatement.\n\nStephen Hoggett strikes again with his faultless movement choreography which perfectly compliments Sting’s truly fine music. Moreover, Hoggett manages to bring to life the onstage characters in a innovative and addictively watchable way. His work during “If You Ever See Me Talking To a Sailor” is worth a Tony on it’s own.\n\nDavid Zinn’s scenic design is the icing on a perfectly cooked cake, making the experience seem very much like a total piece of theatre. Together set, costume, sound and movement work in a blissful, blissful harmony. Oh god I need to see this show again.\n\nI can’t sing the praises of this show more. It was everything I wanted but never thought to expect. If you live anywhere even remotely in the vicinity of Manhattan you are lucky and should support this fantastic new piece of theatre. If, like me, you live in or near London, we can only pray for a transfer. Other than that, I’d start checking out airfare to the states…\n\nIf only I had a time machine and I could go back in time and experience this show again. Although I guess if I did, I would let young Gideon borrow it.\n\nSleep No More Review\n\nPunchdrunk’s immersive, promenade performance, Sleep No More, is adapted from their original 2003 production. The show is loosely based on Shakespeare’s Macbeth.\n\nOkay so it nay be somewhere near impossible to “review” Sleep No More as any real words spent describing or even referencing the plot are sure to ruin the experience for the next participant (yes, participant as that really is what you are) but..okay…here goes.\n\nSo I arrived at the McKittrick Hotel ready to take up my “reservation,” and was promptly handed my “room key.” To say I didn’t know what to expect would probably be a bit of a lie as, well, I went to Goldsmiths College in London, famed for its avant-garde, boundary pushing taking on theatre. I knew of Punchdrunk and had seen similar immersive pieces of what I liked to call “adventure theatre” by Shunt in the past. However, having missed The Drowned Man in London, I was keen to experience (yep, “experience”) Sleep No More in New York. And wow. What an experience.\n\nSleep No More is a three hour long theatrical journey loosely based on the story of Macbeth. “Audience” members become masked voyeurs and explorers who give up their ability to speak as they enter the performance – a 1920’s style series of locations ripe for discovery.\n\nThe only way I can really describe the show without revealing too much is by saying it is a strange cross between a real life film noir, a perverse video game and a nightmare. A fabulous, fabulous nightmare.\n\nAs I ventured around solo, as advised, I really found myself letting go of my social norms. In fact I think I became a bit weird…no, finding myself lying in a coffin and later praying at an alter, I realised I had absolutely gone a bit weird and to me this was a revelation. A performance that directly had the power to alter my behaviour as a usually reasonable and responsible human being…now that is something!\n\nAlthough spread over a vast playing area with hours and hours of individual performance (you couldn’t even begin to try and see it all in one sitting) the show manages to guide its audience to a harrowing climax…\n\nYou could see this show a hundred times and have a different experience. Three hours without break is a considerable amount of time, but I really don’t think I saw it all…or touched it all…or smelt it all, or ate it all. Because each audience members experience is so personal, so fully tailored to what choices they make, this production feels like a totally exclusive experience for each individual adventurer.\n\nGo. Seriously. Just go. You won’t have experienced anything like it. Also after the show you can enjoy a couple of hours of fabulous performance in the super stylish bar. Win win.",

  "latent_4163": "100 posts! I can't believe it! I knew that the mani for this post had to be an awesome one so I was saving a lemming that I recently acquired in a giveaway just for this occasion, Max Factor Fantasy Fire. However, while I was waiting ever so patiently for 100 to hit, I received the most awesome package full of great goodies to review and one of those goodies just so happened to be a dupe for the hard to find Fantasy Fire and even harder to find Clarins 230 aka Unicorn Pee! So of course I had to do a comparison for you all.\n\nI now present to you Nail Pattern Boldness Boop-Oop-a-Dupe! Oh! Be forewarned this is a picture heavy post, but it is totally worth it! So I will keep my jibber jabber to a minimum until the end. ;)\n\nI swatched these over 2 different undies to show you the range of colors you can get.\n\nThe first set of pictures are shown with Revlon Royal for undies.\n\n*Note- I know everyone loves Revlon Royal, and while I tried to as well, it's a pain in the @** to apply! I haven't had that much flooding of my cuticles since I first started blogging! LOL So if there are any blue cuticles, I apologize!*\n\nAll pictures are Boop-Oop-a-Dupe on my thumb, index and middle fingers and Fantasy Fire on my ring and pinkie.\n\nNotice how the Fantasy Fire isn't a brilliant as BOaD\n\nThe next 2 pictures are poor quality but I needed the harsh lighting to give me the shift in color.\n\nThe next set of pictures show Finger Paints Black Expressionism as the undies.\n\nOutdoor direct sun\n\nI love how it looks kinda chocolate brown over the black.\n\nIndoor\n\nI was actually able to capture the color shift better on the black than I could the blue in my light box.\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to capture just how red it still is on top of the black. This is one of the hardest polishes to photograph because of how much it shifts, but it is absolutely stunning in real life!\n\n(Multi Chrome shifts: Red-Orange-Amber-Light Green-Dark Green)\n\nHere is my opinion on how they compare:\n\nFF and BOaD are so similar that if you don't really look hard you can't tell them apart unless it is put over a lighter color. Over a lighter purple or pink the purple base of FF changes the look all together. BOaD's application was perfect, silky smooth, no flooding no dragging, plus it dries quickly. Also the multi chrome seems stronger (more pigment?) in BOaD. FF's application was good but since it is a mini the brush is tiny, so you have to dip it several times before getting full coverage which caused a bit of dragging towards the tips, but nothing to major.\n\nBOaD is available on Llarowe only (FF, which again is only a mini, for the same price, if your lucky, but it's usually closer to $13-$15+ on eBay. BOaD gives you more BANG for your buck! So if you have been lemming FF or the infamous Unicorn Pee (Clarins 230) this is definitely the way to go! is available on Llarowe only ( here ), as it is a Llarrowe exclusive, which is great news for all you International NPB lovers! A full sized bottle is only $9! Compared towhich again is only a mini, for the same price, if your lucky, but it's usually closer to $13-$15+ on eBay.gives you more BANG for your buck! So if you have been lemmingor the infamous(Clarins 230) this is definitely the way to go!\n\n(You can see swatches of Clarins 230 on Chalkboard Nails for comparison if you would like.)\n\nPlease don't forget to Like NPB on Facebook , follow her Blog and favorite her Etsy shop if you haven't already, so you can see all of Allison's sneak peeks and restock info.\n\nNow, what are your opinions on this dupe? Is it something you have to have? Let me know what you think!\n\n(This product was sent to me for review. All opinions are my own and are not influenced by Nail Pattern Boldness in anyway.)",

  "latent_4337": "For the first time, researchers have combined gene therapy and stem cell transplantation to successfully reverse the severe, crippling bleeding disorder hemophilia A in large animals, opening the door to the development of new therapies for human patients.\n\nResearchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine, collaborating with other institutions, report in Experimental Hematology that a single injection of genetically-modified adult stem cells in two sheep converted the severe disorder to a milder form. The journal is a publication of the Society for Hematology and Stem Cells\n\n\"A new approach to treating severe hemophilia is desperately needed,\" said lead author Christopher D. Porada, Ph.D., associate professor of regenerative medicine at Wake Forest Baptist. \"About 75 percent of the world doesn't have access to the current treatment -- therapy to replace missing clotting factors. This puts patients in most of the world at risk of severe and permanent disabilities.\"\n\nPorada cautioned that challenges will need to be overcome before the treatment can be applied to humans, including that the sheep developed an immune response to the therapy that could decrease its effectiveness and duration.\n\nThere is currently no cure for the rare bleeding disorder hemophilia. People with this genetic disorder lack a protein, known as a clotting factor, needed for normal blood clotting. As a result, they may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury, as well as bleed internally, especially in joints such as the knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage the organs and tissues and be life threatening. Even when life-threatening bleeds are prevented with replacement therapy, it doesn't prevent smaller bleeds within the joints that can cause pain and decreased mobility.\n\nPeople with hemophilia A, the most common type, are missing clotting factor VIII. For the study, the researchers used a combined stem cell/gene therapy approach to increase levels of factor VIII produced by the animals.\n\nThe scientists first inserted a gene for factor VIII into engineered mesenchymal stem cells, a type of adult stem cell. The cells -- acting as a carrier for the gene -- were then injected into the abdominal cavity of the sheep. The scientists selected mesenchymal stem cells to carry the gene because they have the ability to migrate to sites of injury or inflammation.\n\nIn the treated animals, the cells migrated to the joints and stopped ongoing bleeding.In addition, all spontaneous bleeding events ceased, and the existing joint damage was completely reversed, restoring normal posture and gait to these crippled animals, and enabling them to resume a normal activity level.\n\nHowever, a paradox of the treatment was that while the symptoms were eliminated, the sheep developed an immune response to factor VIII, suggesting that the treatment's effects would be reduced or shorter in duration. The scientists are currently working to learn why the immune response occurred and to develop strategies to prevent it.\n\n\"While preliminary, these findings could pave the way for a new therapy for hemophilia patients who experience debilitating bleeding in their joints,\" Porada said.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCo-authors were Graça Almeida-Porada (senior author) and Chung-Jung Kuo , both with Wake Forest Baptist; Chad Sanada, Evan Colletti, Esmail D. Zanjani, Walter Mandeville and John Hasenau, all with the University of Nevada at Reno; Robert Moot, Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service; Christopher Doering, Emory Children's Center Pediatrics; and H.

  "latent_4549": "Two years after leaving the club, one of the most prized prospects in the history of the Real Salt Lake academy is back home – and he’s already paying major dividends.\n\nNineteen-year-old Brooks Lennon, acquired by RSL this preseason on a year-long loan from English Premier League giant Liverpool, has emerged as one of the top young players in MLS over the last month. After starring for the US Under-20s in their run to the CONCACAF U-20 Championship in February and March, Lennon returned to Utah on the eve of the season and quickly carved out a place for himself in the RSL XI, earning his first start in Salt Lake’s third game of the year, a 2-1 loss to LA that prompted the firing of ex-head coach Jeff Cassar.\n\nHe’s kept his place in the lineup since the coaching change, starting a pair of matches under caretaker manager Daryl Shore before going the full 90 in both games since Mike Petke officially took the helm. Lennon has been consistently solid throughout the season – it’s not a stretch to say he’s been one of RSL’s best players this year – but his true coming out party came in the 88th minute of last week’s game at Colorado, when he scored a fantastic goal to give RSL an important, come-from-behind 2-1 victory.\n\nThat’s a great goal, and – as Will Parchman wrote earlier this week – an excellent example of what it looks like when an inverted winger is really doing his thing. It’s also a tantalizing few seconds for RSL and their supporters, who could have a big star on their hands – if they manage to acquire him permanently.\n\n“The best thing Brooks has done is fit in,” Waibel told me on Thursday. “He’s come, he’s been a part of the locker room, a part of the work, he’s done very well in the sessions to contribute not only with his attitude, but with the way he’s approaching the game.\n\n“The simplest form of the reward for his play was the goal in Colorado, but we’re still trying to make sure he’s a game in, game out professional. That’s our No. 1 goal, is to have him be a consistent contributor – it’s really only been three weeks of that contribution that culminated with the late goal. So we’re excited, we’re excited for what he can be, but we also understand that he’s quite a ways away from getting to that final product.”\n\nWaibel wouldn’t say if Salt Lake have approached Lennon or Liverpool about a transfer, but, given his play this year, obvious talent and ties to the club, it’s a safe bet that they’ll at least try to land him.\n\nFinal product or not, RSL would be smart to try to get a deal done before the MLS Primary Transfer Window closes on May 8. The reason they should move so quickly? The impending U-20 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament, which kicks off on May 20 in South Korea, is the biggest showcase for young players in the entire sport. Every club from every major league will have eyes on Korea, and a strong showing for Lennon – the US’s top scorer at the CONCACAF U-20 Championship and a sure U-20 World Cup starter – would drive up his price and likely create interest from other clubs. RSL don’t want either of those things.\n\nBut what do Lennon and Liverpool want? Does the Arizona native, whose Liverpool contract expires in May 2018, want to sign a permanent deal with RSL? Would Liverpool entertain selling him before the U-20 World Cup?\n\nThose are questions that, for now, don’t have answers. One thing we do know: If a deal doesn’t get done before the May 8 deadline, RSL wouldn’t be able to complete a move until after the Secondary Transfer Window opens on July 10, nearly a month after the U-20 World Cup ends. Who knows what the market for Lennon will look like then?\n\nRSL don’t need that uncertainty, and they don’t need any extra competition. They have a leg up with Lennon now – they should try to take advantage of that to land him, even if requires paying Liverpool a pre-World Cup premium.\n\nDiaz returns to field, targeting summer return\n\nFC Dallas playmaker Mauro Diaz returned to the training field on Tuesday for the first time since tearing his Achilles last October, jogging, sprinting and doing some individual work with the ball on the sidelines as the full FCD squad practiced nearby.\n\nA club spokesman told me on Thursday that Dallas are now expecting Diaz, who had five goals and 13 assists to lead FCD to the Supporters’ Shield last year, to make a full return in “July or August.” Head coach Oscar Pareja said in January that he was “not counting on having Mauro until June.”\n\nDallas certainly could’ve used Diaz during their CONCACAF Champions League semifinal loss to Pachuca, but they haven’t seemed to miss the 26-year-old much during their first five matches of the MLS season. They’re currently second in MLS with 2.2 points per game and are one of just two remaining unbeaten teams in the league. They’ll host the other unbeaten, Sporting Kansas City, at Toyota Stadium on Saturday night (8 pm ET; MLS LIVE).",
  "latent_4558": "This is what you’d call an unorthodox indie game . Galactic Council is a sci-fi card game based around its website, where the game is played online, player vs. player. I was interested so I contacted the creator of the game to learn more.\n\nDo you mind telling us about yourself, Sam (Minnis)?\n\nSure thing. I’m a freelance web developer living in Virginia Beach, VA. I have a passion for gaming; games bring people together, give them goals to work towards competitively and/or cooperatively, and keeps folks learning. I’ve always wanted to make a game; the game development community has given me so much and I feel it’s now my turn to contribute back.\n\nI’ve been learning all kinds of aspects of software development off-and-on during the past 12 years, I suppose waiting for this very opportunity that I carved out for myself in the past year. With the advent of HTML5/other accessible web technologies, a game concept I can get behind 110%, and the professional freedom to pursue the project, the Galactic Council website was born. All you really need to know about me is inherent to the project. My love for science fiction stories, collectible card games, data-driven solutions, games with absurd replayability, awe-inspiring fantastical art, reverence for adaptability, and well… a functioning democracy are all represented in the Galactic Council system. What’s missing from that list is my love for music and I cannot WAIT for the day when I get to work on the Galactic Council “soundtrack.”\n\nWhat can you tell us about Galactic Council?\n\nGalactic Council is my passion project, a culmination of all my education over the past 12 years. There are facets of statistics, psychology, programming/web design and, of course, game design intricately laced together to form a concept that just doesn’t exist out there yet. The “end goals” of the project are to foster my “3 C’s” – Creativity, Community, and Content. Starting there and working my way back has allowed me to structure the entire project around these 3 central pillars.\n\nI want Galactic Council packed to the brim with content. To me, each card in a card game represents an opportunity to tell a story. A card is a “meme” of sorts, a boiled-down single-serving aspect of the game universe you’re romping about in – the smallest building block that players then recombine to form the narrative of a typical game. From that standpoint, more cards means more opportunities for a rich, deliciously complex lore that dictates the skeletal game experience. One of the questions I asked myself while developing Galactic Council was, “Why limit the number of cards?” I came up with a few good reasons, mostly organization, balance, and parsimony, but for each problem I came up with I could envision a reasonable technical solution. So I decided to keep the available card pool “unlimited” by allowing players to experiment with card and game rules, ensuring that my goal of near-endless content was a possibility.\n\nA game’s community can make or break it. Good games take this into account and work at supporting the game’s community, great games push the existing boundaries of community interaction. I want to leverage web technology to build a much more community-driven game. What I’m aiming for is to give each community member the feeling that they are truly a co-creator of the Galactic Council experience. Each member will be encouraged to add their own “stamp” to the game in a myriad of ways. Since the game belongs to the community, I’m counting on each member to pitch in as much as they’d like. But don’t worry – I’m going to make this “pitch in” process easy, fun, and rewarding (both in game and out.)\n\nOne of my major reasons for developing this game is to give players a “creative workspace.” A portion of the Galactic Council experience is, by its very nature, an experimental space where players and content-developers can test out what works and what doesn’t. Before I began development on this project, I had an itch to write some science fiction short stories. I shopped around for an online space that would make the “growth” process easier – by granting a diverse readership who’s willing and able to provide constructive criticism. While those sites exist, none of those sites really “put the content in motion” by attaching the work to some greater lore. Galactic Council is my answer to that need. Community members can and will be able to hone their creative talents through performance, feedback and revision (hooray for the processes of science!) all within the Galactic Council game system. Again, each card is an opportunity for the creator to write, draw, and design content for other members to experience and critique.\n\nThere’s an intersection between these three design philosophies; they form a symbiotic (dare I say, “triforce”) relationship that allows for something quite special. Through forming a robust and supportive community, by allowing endless user generated content, and by designing creativity-engendering software components, what emerges is a game environment like no other. An adaptive, organic, badass experience that will forever change our expectations of gaming systems and the player’s role within them.\n\nHow do the rules work?\n\nFor now, the rules follow a typical deck-building game type. For those unfamiliar with the genre, it is a card game where both players start the game with identical decks of cards. Players then augment their deck with additional cards they purchase with in-game currency, choosing certain strategies and card combinations to reach one of two victory conditions. There is a working prototype available on the game’s website ready to play right now, no download required (just an up to date browser): http://www.samthewebsiteguy.com/galacticcouncil/onepage/ Also at the site is a tutorial section with a text-driven tutorial and a solo solitare-type game. You can also see a video of me playing and explaining the game rules here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt0SSv4oG-s (It’s also pre-icon days, so you can see a bit of the project’s progress.)\n\nThe deck-building format is a relatively new player on the CCG scene – and I love it. Making the deck in any CCG was one of my favourite parts of the game experience. Deck-building games take that aspect and crams it into the actual game itself – you have to balance your deck while directly dealing with your opponent’s choices and strategies. You have to decide, “do I want to pad my deck out with cards that slow my opponent, or do I want to take actions that get me closer to victory?” The format is ripe with opportunity; early strategies, mid-game transitions, and punishing late-game card combos.\n\nLastly here, I’d like to point out that what I have available right now at my site is simply a starting point. I have tons of ideas in motion to make Galactic Council your one-stop card-game spot. I am really excited to begin “hybridizing” the rules, where I add something like a hex-board component or a pre-built deck component. The “experimental” aspect of user card-creation extends to rule tinkering as well. Players will be able to decide the exact kind of card game they’d like to play by selecting their “rule loadout.” I personally can’t wait to see a hex-board/pre-built deck/deck-building variant.\n\nWhat can you say about the user-generated aspect? How is it run?\n\nI think this question is best answered with some universe lore. In this universe, an ancient race died off and left behind its crowning technological achievement: Nanons. Nanons are sentient Nanomachines, tiny molecular builders that roam around the universe in colonies looking for organic “hosts” to form a symbiotic relationship with. They give their hosts unparalleled ability to alter the very fabric of reality, and each player represents one of these Nanon hosts. All hosts are expected to join the Galactic Council, a ruling body responsible for policing its own almost-too-powerful members. Council members are about one thing above all else: collecting more Nanons to enhance their already considerable abilities.\n\nWhen two members are fighting over contested Nanon colonies, their power struggle is refereed by the Galactic Council. By sending off portions of the harvested Nanons to the Council, members gain influence through which equipment and contracts are “purchased.” This list of available equipment and contracts is compiled by the Council, each item having an influence cost that’s voted on by the Council members.\n\nNow, to actually answer the question, each card represents a contract or piece of equipment that players can request from the Galactic Council during their battle against other players. So, when a player participates in one of several user-generated features, in game-lore terms they are performing one of their Council duties – participating in setting the parameters and conditions of combat over Nanons.\n\nI have a quick short story that I wrote here: http://www.samthewebsiteguy.com/galacticcouncil/promo_content/story1.php, where I introduce a few of these concepts in a more story-like setting.\n\nWhere did the idea come from?\n\nI was showing an online deck-building game to a friend, and he asked, “you could make something like that, right?” He knew that I was a fairly capable web developer and gaming enthusiast, and as soon as he said it I began to envision how I would go about constructing a deck-building game/website. My answer was “Yeah, I could make something like that”, but the thought exercise didn’t stop there. I gave myself full permission to come up with my “dream game experience”: a web space where I could see myself hunkering down and playing for a long time – without getting bored. I wanted a site that I felt some measure of ownership over, like if there was some card or card-combo that I loathed playing against, I could take steps to address the perceived imbalance. Steps like coming up with a more balanced solution that I debate with the game’s community, coming up with a new counter-combo, or even avoiding games with that card altogether. (OK – I have to throw out here that the specific card I’m thinking of is the Umezawa’s Jitte from M:tG) If I got bored with the game, I could experiment with adding in and/or subtracting out rules to breathe new life into the format. Even better – I could suggest some of my own rules and have the development team implement them if I could get enough votes/support from my fellow community members. New rules that add a twist to the familiar, like a Texas Hold ‘em variant game type.\n\nThe vision in my head just kept building steam. I brought in the sentient Nanomachine concept from some short story work I had done earlier, then tied the game’s content generation features to this Nanon mechanic (and the political body that exists to check this power.) Not only would all this content-generation freedom be available to players, it would be available as a fundamental part of the universe’s lore. When I had about 5 years worth of development work virtually planned out in my head, I knew that the idea was too big to ignore. I didn’t want to wait for another company to develop a product like this, I wanted it as soon as possible. I also didn’t want some watered-down half-assed attempt either; I wanted it exactly as I envisioned it – the game belongs to its community.\n\nWhat is involved in creating a browser-based online card-based game like this?\n\nIt has been tough but very rewarding. The process requires a great deal of guess-and-test programming, learning and creativity. I’ve done everything on my own (except for the game art – thanks, Brian Christensen, Chris Cold and Adrian Gillespie) for the explicit reason of “knowing” the guts of my code backwards and forward. A web-based game is very exploitable if you don’t know what you’re doing, I know this because the very first build of GC was horribly exploitable. Over time I’ve grown to be a much more capable, solutions-driven designer who just won’t take no for an answer. I treat myself like my own client in that regard – the demanding game customer in my head insists upon various features, and the designer in me makes it happen no matter how challenging. It’s a nice partnership that makes me sound a little crazy. 🙂\n\nAny tips to anybody that wants to make their own card games?\n\nPractice, practice, practice. Rome wasn’t built in a day and your game won’t be, either. It’s a steep learning curve and the only way to get to the top is one lesson at a time. Making a game is a laborious and challenging process. Some days the only thing that will get you through is how much YOU want to see it finished and/or play a round or two with a friend. Make tons of mistakes and learn from them. Have fun – if you’re not having fun making your game, chances are neither will your players.\n\nFinally, if you don’t think you’re ready to start making your own game just yet but you have an interest in game development, just get involved. There are products out there that grant certain aspects of game development and are usually a great place to “cut your teeth.” Do the early learning on another developer’s dime rather than your own. I’ve heard of an upcoming sci-fi deck-building game that would be a great place for you to try your hand at game design. 🙂 Seriously though – follow this project. Join the community and leverage the features I’m designing to learn, test, or enhance your game development skills.\n\nAny favorite tabletop games?\n\nYeah I love me some tabletop action. I really enjoy Dominant Species, a board game about evolving creatures. The concept is pure nerd-joy, and the implementation is amazing. The game is simple when it needs to be, complex in the right places, and highly replayable. I especially enjoy the top-down design of the turn-execution, where players put out their markers at the start of a turn, and the turn sequence is then determined by the logical flow of a “turn-order chart” on the board. It keeps players on track when they show up to your house ½ way drunk already 🙂\n\nI love Twilight Imperium because the political mechanics in that game kick ass. The idea that laws dramatically change the way the game is played and just about every turn has a law come up to vote on…it was a heavy influence on the GC system. Good luck playing the same game twice in TI.\n\nA newer one I picked up is A Few Acres of Snow, a deck-building/board game hybrid that I’m enjoying quite thoroughly. The high replayability factor is there, and I appreciated the seamless blend of the card/board aspects. I really like how the deck-building component fits the theme because the specific war was apparently “fought at the end of a supply line.”\n\nAnything else you wish to say?\n\nI’ve said quite enough already (there’s a lot to say!) – but I would like to take the opportunity to inform interested individuals that the Galactic Council system is not something you have to wait for. The current site is in its infancy, but the primary aspects of the project are represented.\n\nThe Nanon collection mechanic is in place, earned after each game against an opponent and modified by a few factors like your number of “content assists” (hint – make some cards!) Players can currently create their own card by recombining card abilities, selecting from a pool of available art, and naming it of course. This card can then be used in every game you play, or you can scrap your card and totally rebuild it after each game. If I see something I like, you’re going to enjoy what happens next. I take your card, make it “canon”, add it to the primary card pool for game rotation (with your name on it as the creator for other players to see), and give your player account in-game goodies for your creation. There’s still a long way to go, but I would definitely say that the game is ready for its community.\n\nThanks guys! See you all in game 😉\n\nThank you, and good luck!\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.samthewebsiteguy.com/galacticcouncil/",

Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Friday, July 10, 2015 in San Francisco, Calif. Photo: Lea Suzuki, The Chronicle Buy photo Photo: Lea Suzuki, The Chronicle Image 1 of / 68 Caption Close S.F. deputies union ties pier killing to sheriff’s order 1 / 68 Back to Gallery\n\nThe union representing San Francisco sheriff’s deputies filed a formal complaint against Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, linking the Pier 14 killing of Kathryn Steinle to a March order that barred them from communicating with federal immigration agents, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle.\n\nThe murder arrest of a man whom deputies had freed from jail despite a felony record and a history of deportations showed that Mirkarimi’s policy “recklessly compromises the safety of sworn personnel, citizens, and those who merely come to visit the San Francisco area,” the deputies wrote in the grievance.\n\nThe San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs’ Association called for Mirkarimi to correct his “flawed philosophy” and rescind the March 13 memo prohibiting his staff from giving immigration agents information about detainees — including their citizenship status, their booking and arrest documents, and their release dates.\n\nSanctuary-city debate\n\nThe grievance, filed by union attorneys and sent to the sheriff Monday, adds a new layer to a national debate about sanctuary-city laws that limit cooperation between local agencies and immigration authorities.\n\nMirkarimi has said his policy reflected the spirit of a 2013 city ordinance intended to protect immigrants — and that city leaders should get together and change the ordinance if they see fit.\n\nThe grievance also underscored deep divisions within the Sheriff’s Department. The union has long been at odds with Mirkarimi and has endorsed his opponent, Vicki Hennessy, in this fall’s election. Freya Horne, a department attorney, called the grievance “political posturing.”\n\nPeter Hoffmann, an attorney for the union, countered that it was a matter of public safety. “Clearly, this was a bad policy,” he said. “Rescind it, and let’s try to do something positive going forward.”\n\nThe Sheriff’s Department came under fire when San Francisco authorities arrested and charged Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican national, in Steinle’s July 1 slaying along the Embarcadero.\n\nLopez-Sanchez had been convicted of several drug offenses since 2001, and federal immigration authorities wanted to deport him a sixth time. He came to San Francisco, though, after the Sheriff’s Department requested that he be transported from a federal prison in San Bernardino County to face a 20-year-old drug charge for marijuana sale.\n\nMirkarimi released him in April after the district attorney declined to prosecute.\n\nSan Francisco’s “Due Process for All” ordinance, passed in 2013 and signed by Mayor Ed Lee, holds that only individuals who have been convicted of a violent felony in the past seven years, and who are facing another violent felony charge, can be held for deportation after their release from jail.\n\nLee: ‘Pick up the phone’\n\nLee has said the Sheriff’s Department could have, under the ordinance, simply notified immigration agents before Lopez-Sanchez’s release. He railed against Mirkarimi’s reading of the law, stating that “nothing in this sanctuary-city law prohibits the officials of the city and county of San Francisco to communicate, to engage in discussion.”\n\n“Do we need to educate somebody on how to pick up the phone?” he said.\n\nMirkarimi’s March memo went further than the ordinance, mandating “limited contact and communication” with immigration agents. He said that the policy was a direct reflection of the ordinance and that Lee was “throwing his own law under the bus.”\n\nBefore the policy change, some deputies had informally called immigration agents about inmates who might be deportable before their release from County Jail. Mirkarimi said such freelancing by deputies could bring a dangerous subjectivity into play.\n\nMirkarimi responded to Lee on Thursday, saying that a letter the mayor sent to him on Tuesday “does not provide legal clarity regarding my department’s duty under city law.”\n\n“The only reason to now notify federal immigration officials of an individual’s release would be to facilitate the release of the individual to the federal immigration officials,” he said. He recommended having “an immediate open discussion” about the city’s policy in front of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nMirkarimi did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the grievance, nor did Eugene Cerbone, the union president.\n\nIn the grievance, attorney Hoffmann said the sheriff improperly implemented the policy change without first meeting with the union.\n\nWhile a grievance can in some cases end with a decision by an arbitrator, Horne, the department attorney, said the union’s grievance is not legitimate.\n\n‘Political posturing’\n\n“Generally, grievances are something that could result in a change in working conditions, and this is not, and therefore it is not subject to a meet and confer,” she said. “It’s political posturing in an election year. It’s the kind of thing that’s been done by the DSA in the past, to oppose (former sheriff) Michael Hennessey.”\n\nBut Hoffmann said the deputies were upset about “a pretty significant working condition issue. ... It’s an order not to cooperate with fellow law enforcement. In this case, it is on a federal level, but you can imagine the chaos that would occur if the order was to no longer cooperate with the San Francisco Police Department.”\n\nVivian Ho is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

  "latent_4652": "Blackstone Group LP co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman collected about $690 million in dividends, compensation and fund payouts for 2014, according to a Friday regulatory filing, representing the highest annual payout ever notched by a founder of a publicly traded private-equity firm.\n\nThe amount represents a nearly 50% increase over Mr. Schwarzman's 2013 payout and also tops the $546 million received last year by Leon Black, who co-founded Apollo Global Management LLC, according to an analysis of securities filings by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBlackstone is the world's largest private-equity firm with $290 billion under management in businesses that include corporate buyouts, credit investing, real estate and hedge funds. Mr. Schwarzman, 68, started Blackstone in 1985 with former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. chairman Peter Peterson as a merger-advisory firm.\n\nMr. Schwarzman, who took Blackstone public in a 2007 stock offering, derives much of his annual take home from his roughly 20% ownership of the firm's stock. That stock pile paid Mr. Schwarzman $570.5 million in dividends during the year as the firm set numerous records for profitability during 2014.\n\nBlackstone's shares rose 8.2% in 2014, the only of its U.S. publicly traded rivals to see a rise in the value of its shares during the year.\n\nThe firm paid a record dividend of $2.09 per common share as it cashed out of investments into the rising stock market and renewed market for corporate mergers. Among its big divestitures were stakes in Texas oil fields that the firm helped closely held GeoSouthern Energy Corp. drill, and blocks of stock in hotelier Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.\n\nMr. Schwarzman and other Blackstone employees hold a special class of shares that paid out an even richer dividend of $2.46 a share.\n\nMr. Schwarzman also collected $84.8 million of so-called carried interest, which is a portion of the firm's cut of deal profits, and $33.5 million in profits and returned capital from his investments in and alongside Blackstone's funds.\n\nLike his rivals at Apollo, KKR & Co. and Carlyle Group LP, which Thursday night said its three founders together reaped more than $800 million last year, Mr. Schwarzman's annual salary is relatively modest. As it has been every year since Blackstone went public, Mr. Schwarzman was paid $350,000.\n\nThe firm said it also paid $8,842 for security for its CEO and reimbursed him $2.9 million for use of his airplane. Mr. Schwarzman was also awarded shares of Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc., a real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of Blackstone, valued at $61.4 million.\n\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for The Blackstone Group LP\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US09253U1088\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US09257W1009\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires",

  "latent_4754": "Just in time for the Halloween season comes the trade paperback volume for Brandon Seifert and menton3’s The Fly: Outbreak from IDW Publishing.\n\nI’m sure many horror fans will agree that David Cronenberg’s 1986 remake of the original classic with Jeff Goldblum is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and certainly one of the master of visceral body horror’s finest moments. 1989’s The Fly II was not nearly as terrific a film but it had its moments and benefited from the always soulful presence of actor Eric Stoltz.\n\nThe Fly: Outbreak’s narrative begins sometime after the events of The Fly II, which is in some ways unfortunate given that the sequel was greatly inferior to the first movie, but it was also necessary in terms of continuity (as those who’ve seen both films would understand). It was either continue off of The Fly II or break off from the established narrative and start anew with new characters. While it’s easy to speculate what might have been the better choice, for better or worse the creators and IDW chose to continue off of The Fly II.\n\nSo is it scary? Well, not really, but “scary” isn’t really the appeal of the Fly franchise, at least not for veteran horror fans. “Creepy” would be the more accurate word and in terms of the creepy factor, The Fly: Outbreak outdoes The Fly II – largely, as I’ll be arguing in this review, thanks to artist menton3.\n\nmenton3’s detailed, lifelike art and writer Brandon Seifert’s decision to use the character of Martin Brundle, the son of Jeff Goldblum’s Seth Brundle, makes The Fly: Outbreak at times feel like The Fly III, the movie. I know, there is no movie which is partly my point: the book, at least on the visual level, is a quasi-cinematic experience that, barring a Hollywood reboot, is probably as close to a direct sequel that we’ll get.\n\nIt’s not common to find comics in which you like the writing and the art equally, even in books that you may happen to love. For me, more often than not it happens that I like a comic’s story but am not too crazy about the art. The Fly: Outbreak, however, is the reverse instance: I wanted to read it primarily for the art. You see, to view a book by menton3 is to have a unique comic experience like no other comic by no other artist can provide. His art is exquisitely dark, brooding and gothic.\n\nThe Fly: Outbreak is no different: like the titular insectoid monsters and their bodily excretions, the art here practically drips and oozes with atmosphere. In an interview, menton3 has stated that much of his work is inspired by imagery and visions that he gets while in a hypnagogic state, and to me that explains a lot because staring at his art alone is enough to take you to a semi-hypnagogic state. In fact, The Fly: Outbreak is the rare book for which I actually recommend the e-comic over the paper version (I have both so I was able to compare). menton3 uses color, lighting and contrast to extraordinarily eerie, otherworldly effect and I find that this is enhanced when you view the e-comic version of Outbreak in bed with the lights out. When viewed this way, the panels practically pulse with a spectral glow. Don’t let your reading pace dictate the speed with which you make your way through the book. Rather, go slow and stare at the panels, letting the dreamy, nightmarish atmosphere soak into you.\n\nThe surreal beauty of menton3’s art is somewhat offset but a lack of kinetic flow between panels. Often, the illusion of dynamic motion that comics, especially superhero titles, typically strive to achieve isn’t there and you get the sense that you’re looking at a series of static paintings. However, I wouldn’t necessarily consider this a weakness when it comes to this title because it adds to that surreal dreaminess I’ve been talking about.\n\nThe gore factor in Outbreak is also surprisingly toned down considering that this is The Fly franchise we’re talking about. But, personally, if you ask me, kinetic action and gore are both things that are not lacking in today’s horror. What I do often find lacking are the kind of rich mood and atmosphere that classic works of horror like The Exorcist and Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining adaptation excelled in. Therefore it’s a trade-off in The Fly: Outbreak that I’m happy to make.\n\nAlso, while I personally enjoyed menton3’s creature design here, it might become a point of contention among Fly fans. Different characters become afflicted with the same infection but their physical transformations manifest differently. The grotesque monsters from The Fly and The Fly II are both given homage to, but other “flies” have a more antiseptic, alien-like look. I didn’t really have a problem with this but I point it out for those purists who might take their details of the Fly mythos very seriously. I do have to say that when it comes to a certain character’s transformation, menton3 doesn’t adhere to any established canon but comes up with a design that is uniquely his own. And it is a triumph in visual malevolence that’s somehow horrific and sexy at the same time. Unfortunately, the character isn’t given enough time to spread its wings, so to speak, but it is beautiful nonetheless.\n\nMoving on now to the writing. When the monthly issues of this comic were being released, a number of reviewers on the Web criticized the sex in it, which struck me as a bit odd because I honestly don’t see what the problem is. It’s not overly gratuitous, at least not any more than the sex scenes in the movies were, and given that hypersexuality is one of the early symptoms of being infected with the transgenic fly infection, it seems like a natural part of the story’s world. The few sexual moments between lead characters Martin Brundle and his now wife Beth also serve to show how physical intimacy is an important component of relationships and how, when it is impeded for medical reasons as it is here, it can become a source of strain between lovers.\n\nRather, if I were to complain about any element of The Fly: Outbreak it would be the somewhat clipped feel of the narrative at times and how in certain key moments, particularly the climax, events feel rushed. In the first few issues, the way writer Brandon Seifert spreads things out over successive days of the infected characters’ quarantine is a great idea, but some developments occur a bit too abruptly. On the same day, for instance, one character goes from placid and accepting of her situation to suddenly upset and accusatory. Her physical features also go from beautiful to grotesque on the same day. It was almost as if Seifert forgot to demarcate the passing of additional days in the script for these scenes.\n\nAnd while I am not one who usually quibbles too much over plot holes (because if you try hard enough you can find plot holes in nearly any story), I did find a rather big logical oddity in one of the later issues. I won’t reveal what it is precisely, but it struck me as being used for convenience, to prevent the titular outbreak from leaving the quarantine setting and thus too big to be contained, so to speak, in a single volume. A Fly story on a more epic scale, albeit more difficult to do, is almost guaranteed to get fans excited whereas here some readers are bound to be a bit disappointed.\n\nIn any event, Outbreak is a welcome addition to this year’s output of horror titles, which always get a big spike during the Halloween season. Lots of gratuitous blood, gore and nudity will surely abound in other works, but if you want something that relies more on atmosphere and genuinely transports you to a place between waking and sleep, between dreams and nightmares, then go pick up The Fly: Outbreak.",

They’re against all of you,” Trump told cheering supporters in St. Augustine. “They’re against what we represent.”\n\n“I believe we’re actually winning,” he said.\n\nBut even as Trump publicly displayed his trademark bravado, his team conceded publicly as well as privately that he was trailing — and that crucial Pennsylvania may be slipping away to Democrat Hillary Clinton. That would leave him only a razor-thin pathway to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House on Nov. 8.",
  "latent_4931": "Nexrad Doppler Radars and Cooling Towers are altering the Weather, Too\n\nWe’ve already explained how the HAARP and mobile radar platforms are capable of altering the weather to produce storms and hurricanes wherever the operators need them to be. In fact, the superpower countries have also bind themselves into the UN treaty against weather warfare, a long time ago.\n\nThis century old technology has been extensively distributed across the US, some 40 years ago and in other US controlled territories outside the mainland, in recent years.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1976, the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), yeah that’s the name of the agency which conducted a study about “the usefulness of using Doppler radar to identify severe and tornadic thunderstorms” just to put your tax dollars to good use.\n\nThe tests went over in the next 3 years via the National Weather Service and the Air Weather Service agency of the U.S. Air Force, and they found out that the “Doppler radar provided much improved early detection of severe thunderstorms.”\n\nA working group that included the Joint Doppler Operational Project [JDOP] then published a paper providing the concepts for the development and operation of a national weather radar network.\n\nIn 1979, the NEXRAD Joint System Program Office (JSPO) was formed to move forward with the development and deployment of the proposed NEXRAD radar network. That year, the NSSL completed a formal report on developing the NEXRAD system.\n\nThe proposal was presented to the Reagan administration, which incidentally at the time was busy promoting the Star Wars weaponization of space program, as complementary to the parallel terrestrial armament upgrades.\n\nThe NEXRAD system installation was awarded to Unisys, which is one of the known pillars of the US military industrial complex. To date, there are “159 high-resolution S-band Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the United States Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Air Force within the Department of Defense. Its technical name is WSR-88D, which stands for Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988, Doppler,” according to Wikipedia.\n\nThe distribution of these Doppler radars will give you a hint why the entire system doesn’t need as much power as HAARP to produce the same effects.\n\nYes, they are strategically scattered all over America, and if these radars are just used to detect weather patterns, you don’t need this much number, unless you want to micromanage the weather.\n\nHow weather manipulation is accomplished through the NEXRAD?\n\nHotter and therefore higher pressure gas moves towards the cooler and low pressure gas. That’s because hot gases need to expand. If hot gases from three points converged in one common center, that would be the eye of the weather disturbance.\n\nIn the case of Harvey and Irma, where both released a very high volume of rain in a sustained way, an extensive body of clouds must first be formed through rapid vaporization. This is readily accomplished via industrial and nuclear cooling towers, oil rig platforms, and of course, the Dopplers within the NEXRAD System via microwave heating.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its egg shaped shell. What’s inside is still a directable radar antenna, and is able to send electromagnetic signals to any position possible by its electromechanical base.\n\nOnce the needed volume of clouds are in place, the next task would be to steer them towards a specific landfall target, through the automated application of the basic science on gas flow, using these radars.\n\nHere’s a good illustration of how microwave signals are transmitted to “detect” weather patterns.\n\n“WSR-88D sites across the nation have been upgraded to polarimetric radar, which adds vertical polarization to the horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern what is reflecting the signal.” – Wikipedia\n\nAgain, in order to produce heat on its target gas, or body of water, all the operator needs to do is to turn the frequency knob to microwave oven frequency and the weather is “ready to cook.”\n\n“AVERAGED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH, EVAPORATION EQUALS PRECIPITATION: The only thing that keeps all of this evaporation from filling up the atmosphere with water vapor is precipitation. Rain and snow are continually forming within clouds and falling back to the surface, completing one element of the Earth’s hydrologic cycle. The latent heat of condensation, absorbed when the water evaporated, is released to the atmosphere when the water vapor condenses back into cloud water (or cloud ice). This source of heat helps to drive clouds and most other weather systems. For instance, evaporation from the ocean surface is the primary source of energy for hurricanes.” – Weather Questions\n\nMotivations\n\nIf the technology and actual installations are there to modify the weather on demand, what is the motivation behind such measure in today’s context?\n\nAt the onset of Trump’s inauguration, the US government withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord signed in 2015. That’s unacceptable for the Deep State. The climate change hoax is paramount to the realization of the New World Order which support their perennial desire to stay above the pyramid.\n\nIf someone holding a position of authority exercises his common sense and do what is right as demanded by the public he has sworn to serve, the real power behind that authority is under threat of losing it.\n\nAnother useful option for the social engineers is to use the Doppler radars for social engineering purposes via mass psychosis.\n\nAccording to Robert Becker’s The Body Electric,\n\nThe Electromagnetic Brain If the current controlled the way nerves worked in the brain as well as in the rest of the body, then it must regulate consciousness to some extent. Certainly the falling voltages in anesthetized salamanders supported this idea. The question was: Did the change in the current produce anesthesia? Apparently it did, for when I passed a minute current front to back through a salamander’s head so as to cancel out its internal current, it fell unconscious. How this state compared with normal sleep was impossible to tell, but at least the animal was clinically anesthetized. As long as the current was on, the salamander was motionless and unresponsive to painful stimuli. … The relationship has been conclusively proven by recent studies of the pineal gland. This tiny organ in the center of the cranium has turned out to be more than the vaguely defined “third eye” of the mystics. It produces melatonin and serotonin, two neurohormones that, among many other functions, directly control all of the biocycles. … very small magnetic fields influence the pineal gland. Several research groups have shown that applying a magnetic field of half a gauss or less, oriented so as to add to or subtract from the earth’s normal field, will increase or decrease production of pineal melatonin and serotonin.”\n\nIn short, the high possibility of misuse of this high-powered broadcast technology could result to the total control of the population, and will never be eliminated unless outside help is accepted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
  "latent_4940": "Give Me My Remote Bones BONES’ Tamara Taylor Teases Booth’s Premiere Disappearance: ‘It’s Not Looking Good’\n\nBONES’ Tamara Taylor Teases Booth’s Premiere Disappearance: ‘It’s Not Looking Good’\n\nWhen BONES returns for its eleventh season premiere in five weeks, one key member of the team will be MIA: Booth — who, along with Brennan, left DC to get a fresh start at the end of season 10 — has completely vanished.\n\n“The season opener hits pretty hard; [Booth]’s disappeared,” BONES star Tamara Taylor (Cam) teased. “The entire gang is besides themselves. Needless to say Dr. Brennan is a mess. It’s all about finding out what happened to him, where he is, and what he’s into. It’s not looking good.”\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that Booth had a gambling relapse before he left DC.\n\n“We don’t know [the reasoning for his disappearance],” Taylor acknowledged. “Is it the gambling that got him in trouble? It’s looking not good, and it’s looking like it’s a part of a seedy underground [operation]; it’s looking like it has something to do with bad people, but we don’t know what. And we can’t figure it out. It starts out pretty wild.”\n\nAs the team tries to find Booth, they’ll get help from Agent Grace Miller (played by guest star Kim Raver)…though Agent Miller doesn’t exactly see eye-to-eye with the Jeffersonian workers.\n\n“[Miller]’s immediately stepping on toes; ruining evidence, bucking our protocol,” Taylor laughed. “She’s flying into the breeze, and messing people up.”\n\nThankfully, the actors are having a much better time working with Raver off-screen.\n\n“First of all, she is so funny. Amazing,” Taylor gushed. “She plays a pretty tough character, because nobody likes her. And she’s infinitely likable in-person, so it’s funny.”\n\nBut outside of Booth’s disappearance, life has moved on for the BONES characters in the six months that passed by between the end of season 10 and start of season 11.\n\n“Six months later, [Cam’s] definitely trying to find a replacement for Brennan,” Taylor previewed. “Nobody’s good enough. And she decides she might want to throw Arastoo’s name in the ring, because Arastoo has been taking over for Brennan, and he’s been doing a pretty good job.”\n\nBut given Arastoo and Cam’s long-term romance, Taylor acknowledged that promoting him at work could prove “very complicated, because it could get pretty sticky.”\n\nOutside of work, things are still gelling for Cam and Arastoo: “I think he’s certainly getting closer to wanting to take that next step,” Taylor shared.\n\nThough Cam and Arastoo have been together for several years, Taylor shared that she didn’t think Cam would need a wedding to be content with their relationship.\n\n“I think [a commitment] would be good enough for Cam,” she said. “She’s a little skittish about the marriage thing. So I think Cam would be happy to live with him, in sin, for her the rest of her natural born life. But he’s more traditional. I think he’s more gunning for the officialness than I am.”\n\nAnd looking ahead, BONES will cross over with SLEEPY HOLLOW this fall.\n\n“It’s going to be interesting. From what I hear, it’ll be the Halloween episode which makes sense,” Taylor said. “We can suspend reality and have that mash-up work. Otherwise, I think it’s two different worlds. I was surprised when I first read [it was in the works], but knowing it’s the Halloween episode, that makes a little more sense.”",
  "latent_5161": "Ted Cruz is off to a fast start. After just six weeks in the Senate, he’s already managed to earn a rare bipartisan condemnation for stealing the show at Chuck Hagel’s confirmation hearings in a performance that got him compared to Joseph McCarthy and profiled by half the major media organizations the country.\n\nAll in a day’s work for the Tea Party movement’s new darling, who's stepped into a newly created void. Jim DeMint, Allen West and Joe Walsh are out. Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin have lost their luster. And Marco Rubio is getting a taste for compromising on immigration. Cruz is only too happy to step up and take their place.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe National Review notes that “Cruz is rapidly becoming one of the most public faces of the [Tea Party] movement,” a status he had earned even before getting elected. Last summer, he was feted in a massive arena-filling, Glenn Beck-headlined, FreedomWorks-sponsored rally for his election in Dallas. “There is a great awakening that is sweeping this state, that is sweeping this country,” Cruz told the assembled masses. “New leaders who will stand and fight for liberty.”\n\nNew leaders like Cruz, perhaps. The Harvard-educated Hispanic lawyer has already earned plenty of calls to follow the Obama playbook and run for the presidency in 2016. And, also like Obama, questions have been raised about his eligibility for the White House (Cruz was born in Canada to American parents).\n\nEven as the Tea Party movement, per se, may be waning, the activists remain and they will need a voice in Washington. The rapid ascent of the well-spoken Cruz has pleased many conservative activists hungry for more. “We salute you, Senator Cruz, and we’re calling for backup,” a much-shared RedState post read.\n\nBut it may not put any smiles on the face of Sen. Rand Paul, who is himself trying to become the de-facto leader of the very same movement and who helped get Cruz where he is today.\n\nEndorsements from the Kentucky senator and his congressman father, Ron Paul, were critical in a primary race where the GOP establishment lined up against Cruz and behind Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, an arch-conservative whom the Tea Party nonetheless made out to be a moderate. But Cruz didn’t return the favor by endorsing the elder Paul’s presidential bid.\n\nRand Paul has been called Cruz’s “role model,” but the Texan is in many ways more accomplished and worldly than the Kentuckian. While Paul, an ophthalmologist with atypical credentials, had never held public office before his successful 2010 bid, Cruz was on track for this job since adolescence. At Princeton, he was a champion debater. After Harvard Law, he clerked for William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, where he would return years later to argue cases as Texas’ solicitor general.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAnd while other Paul-endorsed candidates like Utah Sen. Mike Lee have kept a fairly low profile after getting to Washington, Cruz has been eager to upset the apple cart, threatening to upstage or even supplant the man who helped bring him there. He’s been called the Ivy League Marco Rubio and the Republican Barack Obama, but perhaps a better epitaph would be the Purer Rand Paul.\n\nPaul has been openly considering a run for the presidency in four years, following in the footsteps of his father, and has set a reasonably cautious course to get there. “I would absolutely not run unless it were to win,” he told Fox News host Chris Wallace Sunday. “You know, points have been made and we'll continue to make points, but I think the country really is ready for the narrative coming, libertarian Republican narrative.”\n\nWhile a win for Paul seems impossible, he could still put up a solid showing to solidify himself as a national movement leader, just as his father did.\n\nThe establishment-backed candidate -- perhaps Rubio or Christie or any other number of “serious” hopefuls -- is most likely to finish on top, but there’s plenty of room for others to make waves, even in defeat. Someone like Rick Santorum, who is also reportedly considering a bid, would galvanize the social conservative base. That leaves an opening for a fiscally conservative libertarian-leaning figure who can appeal to the Tea party.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nPaul is hoping it will be him, but it could just as easily be Cruz, assuming he wants it.\n\nAnd if you judge someone by the enemies he's made, Cruz is a shoo-in. “He’s a great rallying point for us. Any time we put his name on anything, it just goes viral in like four minutes,” said Matt Glazer, the executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal group in the state that has followed Cruz for years.\n\n“I think he definitely has ambitions, it’s just a question of where they lead,” Glazer added. “If his goal is to get 30 percent of the entire electorate and win them over and evangelize them under the Cruz platform, he’s doing it exactly right. There’s nothing that party insiders or the White House can say that Ted Cruz is not opposed to.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nEven Paul, with a reputation for belligerence, took a much softer approach than Cruz when he entered the Senate in 2011. He put forward ambitious policy proposals, but largely respected the institution and avoided controversy.\n\nIn May of the previous year, he had become the center of a media firestorm over his apparent opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But he immediately backtracked and worked hard to smooth it over, following the standard crisis clean-up playbook. The experience may have tempered him going forward and made him more cautious when he actually got to the Senate.\n\nSince then, Paul has done what any ambitious senator might. He wrote a book about his campaign called \"The Tea Party Goes to Washington\" (Rand Paul is apparently the Tea Party). He’s been outspoken, but not obnoxiously so, and generally in service of clear policy goals. And he’s made amends with former rivals like Mitch McConnell, and worked with unusual partners where he can. Even his most outlandish proposals are mostly small ball, like ending foreign aid to Egypt.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRand could probably outperform his father in a presidential bid, as he’s been more willing to sand off the rough edges of his libertarian beliefs to appeal to a wider range of conservatives, but that also makes him somewhat less pure.\n\nCruz, on the other hand, seems to relish tearing up the conventional playbook and throwing the decorum of the Senate out the window. “What’s the opposite of a charm offensive?” the Austin American Statesman editorial board asked yesterday. “Texas’ newest U.S. senator, Republican Ted Cruz, appears fully committed to finding out.”\n\nFor a movement that despises Washington and its chummy rules, Cruz is a breath of fresh air.\n\nHe led the charge against Hagel in a way that many of his own colleagues found uncouth; he was one of only three senators to vote against John Kerry’s ascension to secretary of state; he spearheaded the opposition to the Violence Against Women Act (his explanation for the vote was pathetically thin); and he’s already said he’s not interested in even negotiating about comprehensive immigration reform and “amnesty.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe last point is perhaps what separates him most from Rubio, the GOP point man on immigration, and Paul, who wants something to the left of many Democrats in the space. Cruz supports erecting a fence across the entire U.S.-Mexico border, opposes the DREAM Act, and rejects any kind of guest-worker program.\n\nIn that way, Cruz has staked his wagon not to the immigration reform train, but the cliff he hopes to drive it off in coming months. On other issues, from taxes to spending to gun control to healthcare, Paul and Cruz largely agree. That gap reflects a wider schism among the type of conservative activists inclined to support either senator, with the libertarian free-market faction on one side, and the Nativist conservatives on the other. Despite all they have in common, this issue divides them, as it does Paul and Cruz.\n\nIt’s too soon to see any overt tension between Paul and Cruz, as the latter just got there a few minutes ago, but stay tuned as the Senate takes up immigration reform.\n\nIf the chamber or 2016 has only enough room for one major Tea Party conservative leader, the fight for that crown may be decided by the fate, ironically, of President Obama’s signature second-term agenda item.",
  "latent_5164": "Joe Williams, the White House correspondent whom Politico suspended last week after he made racially insensitive remarks about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, tweeted about his employer on the evening of March 30 that “what’s most irritating is the overlay of blatant racism. that’s the secret sauce in the Politico shitburger.”\n\nThe Daily Caller has obtained an archive covering several months of Williams’ Twitter activity.\n\nIn a tweet nine minutes before that comment, Williams wrote that “we’re supposed to be about justice and the truth, but we’re mostly about posturing, arcane rules and CYA [Cover Your Ass]. annoying.”\n\nThe two messages seem out of place in the context of Williams’ other tweets that day, most of which involved mocking Romney for being wealthy. “We get to talk about [Romney’s] car elevator for another day?” he tweeted. “#Awesome.” It’s possible the comments critical of Politico were meant to be “direct messages” — private notes intended for a single person to read — and broadcast publicly by mistake.\n\nBut when asked about his March 30 tweets, Williams would only say, “I was having a bad day,” before referring TheDC to attorney Jeff Jacobovitz for comment.\n\nThree hours later, Williams’ Twitter account was deleted. He had “protected” it after his Politico suspension went into effect, making its contents unavailable to all but a small group of Twitter followers whom he had approved.\n\nWilliams, a former deputy Washington bureau chief at the Boston Globe, began reporting for Politico in April 2011. His presence in the newsroom came to a crashing halt, however, after he told MSNBC’s Martin Bashir during a June 21 broadcast that Romney “is very, very comfortable, it seems, with people who are like him. … [W]hen he comes on ‘Fox and Friends,’ they’re like him, they’re white folks who are very much relaxed in their own company.”\n\nPolitico suspended Williams for that comment, noting “an unacceptable number of Joe Williams’s public statements on cable and Twitter” that “cumulatively, require us to make clear that our standards are serious, and so are the consequences for disregarding them.”\n\nIn one tweet first reported by Breitbart.com, Williams responded to an observation by Romney’s wife Ann, who said his political handlers should “unzip him and let the real Mitt Romney out” so Americans could see his humorous side.\n\n“Either Ann Romney meant Mitt is flaccid or that when we ‘unzip him’ we’ll find he’s a d–k,” Williams tweeted.\n\nThe tweets from March 30 show a racial prism over Williams’ perception of how Politico assembles its reporting. Racial issues have made frequent appearances in Williams’ tweets.\n\nOn April 2, responding to reports that conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said reactions to the Trayvon Martin shooting were “doing more harm to the black community,” Williams tweeted that the statement was “mighty white of him.”\n\nOn April 11, after National Review fired long-time columnist John Derbyshire in response to racist arguments he made in another publication, Williams wrote that the conservative journal as a whole was a racist institution. National Review “sets up ‘remedial racism’ course,” he mock-reported in a tweet.\n\nAnd responding to questions raised in an April 10 Washington Post column about why Republicans had not promoted Florida Rep. Allen West as a possible vice presidential nominee, Williams tweeted an answer: They “found out he’s black.”\n\nWilliams’ March 30 tweet complaining about “blatant racism” at Politico may refer to the news outlet’s choice of assignments for him: During the weeks leading up to that date, most of Williams’ non-White House reporting focused on the Trayvon Martin shooting, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, and the disgraced “green jobs czar” Van Jones.\n\nPolitico published Williams’ story about Jones — a positive review of the black community organizer’s book, “Rebuild the Dream” — less than two hours before he sent the two tweets about his employer.\n\nThat context may be important, and Jacobovitz complained to TheDC that other news organizations had made his client “the victim of … articles that have mischaracterized and taken out of context various tweets or TV statements.”\n\nBut Jacobovitz, speaking for Williams, declined to answer when TheDC asked him to provide a meaningful context for the March 30 tweets.\n\nReached for comment, Politico editor-in-chief John Harris told TheDC that he was largely unfamiliar with the mechanics of Twitter archives, and that “it would be irresponsible for me to comment at this point.”\n\nAlthough Jacobovitz said that he “represent[s]” Williams “with respect to negotiations with Politico,” Harris said he wasn’t aware of who Jacobovitz was.\n\nThis story was updated after publication.\n\nFollow David on Twitter",

  "latent_5372": "Columnist\n\nI am going to argue for the unpopular, nay, shocking view that Alabama voters should consider eating baby Democrats. No, this isn’t satire. Satire is dead.\n\nEven if Roy Moore did what he is accused of doing, and we often can agree he did, I still think voting for him would be appropriate — no, just. What he did had a certain merit to it, when you consider that he was born centuries ago, in biblical times, before we had laws or limits to consent. At least, I think he was. That is certainly the vibe he gives off. But after coming to that decision, we reach the real problem: As long as there are Democrats in Alabama, some of them will vote against Moore or run for office against him, which seems a great shame now that we have decreed he is morally acceptable. What alternative remains?\n\nSimple: Eat the Democrats’ young.\n\nMany in recent weeks have written essays at which I have sneered. They argue, “You cannot advocate doing evil in the name of good!” To them I say, “Politics has always been the choice of the lesser of two evils.” Now, would you rather see a Democrat in the Senate, or eat all baby Democrats as soon as their political leanings become clear (a bib with Elizabeth Warren on it, say, or a romper that says “WOMEN’S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE … AND SENATE”)? Both options are unpalatable. In one scenario, there will be a Democrat in office. In the other, you will probably have a sticky mess in your saucepan.\n\nLet’s get one thing straight. I have a baby, and when I look down at him and see his big eyes and little feet, I just want to gobble him up — metaphorically only. I, personally, would murder anyone who actually tried to eat my baby. But my baby is bound to grow up and become a good Republican, unless something disastrous happens at college. Democrat babies are another story. They look, as a class, edible. And when I consider that they might grow up to support a candidate like Doug Jones, my resolve stiffens. If we cannot convince them to be absorbed into our party voluntarily, let us forcibly absorb them in the form of nourishment.\n\nThis practice is not without historical precedent. Yes, eating children is, today, considered taboo, but you have to remember that the Democrat is our enemy, and devouring the progeny of enemies is an ancient and time-honored tradition. If you are trying to feed your own growing family, you could not do better. Democrats are grass-fed, I think. Eat them now and grow strong on their meat, or watch them wither and die without a safety net later. Once they age and fail to receive health care, they will become stringy and unpalatable.\n\nMost importantly, we must remember: Many Democrats support a right to abortion. I can think of nothing more inhuman than terminating the life of a fetus. That is why we ought to eat them as infants. Once they are outside the womb, they are threats to the only true people: those still inside it.\n\nWe can agree that pursuing 14-year-olds as a 30-something is a sound and advisable practice, with biblical precedent. And if we are arguing for that, we should be just as able to argue for smashing an infant’s head in with a rock and roasting it over a low fire. I bet that happened in the Bible somewhere.\n\nWhat is so sacred about babies anyway? Either we are in favor of letting something bad happen to them now, or in favor of something bad happening to them in 14 years. And if I can convince myself of the second thing, the first one seems increasingly… palatable.\n\nHappy 350th birthday, Jonathan Swift. I am so glad you did not live to see today!",

  "latent_5697": "CHICAGO – Carrying furniture from a foreclosed home through the streets, protesters marched on Citibank and the Cook County Sheriff May 16 to demand a moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions.\n\nThe Anti-Eviction Campaign, Occupy Chicago and Coalition for the Homeless organized the action. It’s part of a week of actions leading up to the NATO Summit May 20-21.\n\nShortly after the rally, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart agreed to hold a public meeting on the foreclosure crisis. Dart had previously announced a foreclosure moratorium, only to be stymied by the courts.\n\nThe protesters attempted to deposit the furniture at Citibank to highlight refusal of the banks, despite an enormous government bailout, to modify mortgage loans and keep people in their homes.\n\nProtesters also blasted Citibank and the fraudulent role Wall Street played in creating the housing crisis, which caused the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Nearly 3 million homeowners were foreclosed in 2011 and millions more are now “under water,” owing more to the banks than the homes are worth.\n\nThe banks, including Citi, have made billions in profits while people are still being thrown out of their homes.\n\n“There are 100,000 abandoned properties in Chicago and it makes no sense that people are still being evicted,” said Loren Taylor of the Anti-Eviction Campaign. “Housing is a human right.”\n\nWith furniture piled on the sidewalk in front of Citibank, victims of foreclosure blasted the bank for its refusal to work with them to stay in their homes.\n\nVirginia Morales said her parents refinanced their home in 2007. They asked for a modification of the loan agreement from Citibank in 2009. They were granted a trial period to make payments, which they did.\n\nBut then Citi refused to give Morales’s parents the modification based on some missing documents. The parents faxed the documents but the bank kept finding new reasons to reject the modification.\n\nNow the home is “under water” and the family faces foreclosure.\n\nMorales said it’s unjust because Citibank received more bailout money during the financial crisis than any bank.\n\n“Banks are not losing anything. People are losing their homes. No more vacant homes, no more vacant communities. We need to stop this,” she said.\n\nMorales works with Communities United Against Foreclosure and Evictions.\n\n“When people join together they can make a difference. Houses are for people, not for banks!” she declared.\n\nCitibank is also foreclosing on Justina Winfrey. Just three weeks ago six sheriffs showed up at her door to evict her and her family. But Winfrey is refusing to move.\n\n“We followed the process to save our home beginning in 2009,” she said. “But they cancelled our fourth payment leading to the modification. “\n\n“We entered into a second forbearance plan with Citi and they gave us the bait-and-switch which is what they are doing to families nationwide,” said Winfrey angrily.\n\nWinfrey said the courts annulled the foreclosure order but Citi is still pursuing it. The bank refuses to respond to calls by Winfrey for an explanation or to her desire to stay in her home.\n\n“The process is flawed,” said Winfrey.\n\nProtesters marched to Daley Plaza where they engaged in some street theater recreating the eviction of a family from their foreclosed home:\n\nThe family fights back and calls the media and the anti-eviction campaign. Neighbors and protesters blockade the house and shout, “Fight, fight, fight! Housing is a human right.” The bank official and authorities flee.\n\nThe Anti-Eviction Campaign announced an “Occupy Homes Chicago” campaign to take over and rehab 100 homes this summer and occupy them with homeless families.\n\nAsked why the protest was taking place this week during anti-NATO protests, Micah Philbrook of Occupy Chicago said, “NATO is an organization that we spend a lot of tax dollars on. The United States has given over $800 million to NATO, and we think that money could be better spent in our own communities, such as keeping people in their homes.”\n\nPhoto: Victims of foreclosure engage in street threater.

  "latent_5957": "Interim Supt. Eddie Johnson (from l.), Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and Lt. Nakia Fenner at Chicago Police Department headquarters on March 28 View Full Caption Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images\n\nTHE LOOP — Mayor Rahm Emanuel's newly appointed interim top cop Eddie Johnson's fiancee is a Chicago Police lieutenant named in an investigation into alleged cheating on the department's lieutenant's exam, DNAinfo Chicago has learned.\n\nIt's the same cheating probe that sources said helped derail Deputy Chief Eugene Williams' chances of being promoted to police superintendent. Now the allegations are part of a separate probe, this one by the city's Inspector General Joe Ferguson, sources said.\n\nWilliams, one of the Chicago Police Board's three superintendent finalists passed over by Emanuel, was a \"senior subject matter expert\" who helped create the most recent lieutenant's exam. And he was the \"final reviewer of potential exam content,\" according to the Police Department's Feb. 17 response to a Freedom of Information Act request obtained by DNAinfo Chicago.\n\nThe probe into the alleged cheating began in November 2014, more than nine months before the written portion of the lieutenant's exam was administered, after a police Internal Affairs investigator filed a complaint based on a tip from an anonymous officer.\n\nMark Konkol talks about the latest twist in the Top Cop job drama.\n\nThat complaint questioned whether Williams shared \"information that was privileged\" about the exam to sergeants in a study group that met at police headquarters. The information would give the sergeants an unfair advantage on the test, according to a confidential police Internal Affairs report obtained by DNAinfo.\n\nThe study group included Johnson's fiancee, Lt. Nakia Fenner, as well as Lt. Maryet Hall, who is married to former First Deputy Police Supt. Al Wysinger, who retired last year, and Internal Affairs Lt. Davina Ward, multiple sources told DNAinfo Chicago.\n\nThe whistleblower claimed to have witnessed Williams hosting the exam study group — that included Fenner, Hall and Ward and at least three other unnamed African-American officers — at 6 p.m. Tuesdays in an executive conference room at police headquarters.\n\n\"I work at HQ and have personally confirmed the existence of these weekly meetings. Come see for yourself,\" said the whistleblower's typewritten allegations included in the Internal Affairs report.\n\n“What information is he sharing with them that is not being made available to all sergeants regardless of race?\" the whistleblower asked.\n\nFenner, who declined in an interview with DNAinfo Chicago to characterize her relationship with Johnson, was part of a small group of family members who celebrated Johnson's promotion to interim police superintendent at the news conference where Emanuel revealed him as his pick.\n\nOn Monday, Johnson confirmed his engagement to Fenner.\n\nThe interim police superintendent told DNAinfo Chicago that he was not aware of the ongoing probe into whether Williams used his knowledge of the test to give Fenner and others an unfair advantage on the promotion exam.\n\nJohnson said he had not been briefed about any investigation, telling a reporter, \"I've never been informed of any formal investigation. You're telling me more than I knew.\"\n\n\"Right now all I know is it to be rumor. I don't know if there is an actual official investigation. … Whether or not it's an actual subject of investigation I really can't tell you right now,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe interim top cop said he had heard that allegations leveled against Williams and members of the study group came from an anonymous source.\n\n\"I can tell you that Internal Affairs for CPD, we don't routinely handle anonymous complaints. I don't know how the [city] inspector general reacts or responds to that kind of thing,\" Johnson said. \"So it's very difficult for me to respond.\"\n\nWilliams did not return phone messages Monday evening seeking a response to the allegations.\n\nJohnson said he doubts that the allegations against Williams are true.\n\n\"I didn't know that Eugene Williams had a study group,\" the interim superintendent said. \"I don't think he did, to be honest.\"\n\nJohnson said he was aware that his fiancee belonged to multiple study groups, which he said is customary when people prepare for promotional exams.\n\nFenner, however, told DNAinfo Chicago she \"did not participate in any study groups.\"\n\nFenner, a Deering District lieutenant, denied knowledge of any investigation into cheating allegations.\n\n\"I haven't seen the complaint or been questioned by anybody,\" Fenner said.\n\n'Stonewalled at every turn'\n\nIndeed, there is no evidence that Internal Affairs conducted an investigation into the cheating allegations in the year and 4 months since the Internal Affairs complaint was filed.\n\nIn February, a Police Department employee familiar with the allegations who was worried that Williams — a favorite of the City Council's Black Caucus who had the support of influential ministers — might become a finalist for the superintendent job sent a mass email to the entire Police Department.\n\nThe email was sent Feb. 23 — six days before Williams was named a superintendent finalist. The email, according to the department employee, was to warn other officers the department's \"Thin Blue Line\" — the code of silence that protects officers who lie to cover for each other — had protected Williams and allowed \"tainted\" promotions.\n\n\"The process is fixed,\" the employee wrote.\n\nThe Police Department employee also contacted the city's Inspector General's Office, filed a formal complaint and has been interviewed three times by city investigators.\n\nThe author of the email also provided the inspector general with the Freedom of Information Act request that confirmed Williams was integral in developing the lieutenant's exam and knew what would be on the test.\n\n\"After months of pressing the police department for information on the subject, and being stonewalled at every turn I was forced to press the mayor's office for a final 'YES' or 'NO' on whether Gene [Williams] had access to the test,\" according to the email.\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act response obtained by DNAinfo Chicago confirmed that Williams in his role as \"senior subject matter expert was the final reviewer for the Chicago Police Department of potential exam content for the most recent sergeant and lieutenant promotional exams before they were administered.\"\n\nThe Police Department employee said his mass email aimed to put his colleagues on notice.\n\n\"I hope you all take this as a warning to all those taking future examinations that the process is fixed, and as evidence to all officers and sergeants receiving the tainted group of new 'lieutenants' to watch your back, and finally, to hopefully shame whoever the new superintendent is to revamping the entire promotional process to bring integrity to it,\" he wrote.\n\nThe 'Thin Blue Line' code of silence\n\nLast week, Emanuel introduced Johnson as \"the right man at the right time\" to lead the Police Department through a very difficult time.\n\nIn addition to skyrocketing shootings and murders, some very serious issues related to the code of silence within the Police Department will have to be tackled by Johnson.\n\nA U.S. Justice Department investigation of the department's policies and practices could make that work even more daunting.\n\nUpon his appointment as interim top cop, Johnson said his success leading the department will hinge on one word: \"Trust.\"\n\n\"I know that trust has been broken too often, not just in Chicago but across America, where abusive police practices have occurred,\" Johnson said.\n\nChicago's new interim police boss told reporters that broken trust and \"the few examples of excessive force\" have overshadowed \"incidents of courage and professionalism\" and \"undermine our department and our relationship with the community.\"\n\n\"We have to own it, and we have to end it,\" Johnson said. \"Let me say that again. We have to own it, and we have to end it.\"\n\nHe thanked the man he replaced, interim Supt. John Escalante, and his command staff, which includes Williams, saying their \"experience and support is critical as we move forward.\"\n\nNow the investigation into Williams' alleged involvement in a cheating scandal that ultimately led to Emanuel's appointment of Johnson, who did not apply for the job, raises questions about whether the deputy chief — and the new interim top cop's judgment — can be trusted.\n\nIn an interview with DNAinfo at police headquarters on Monday, Johnson said, \"I've staked my whole career on being honest, fair with people, and integrity means a lot to me.\"\n\n\"When investigations occur, whoever is involved in that investigation, they deserve due process,\" Johnson said. \"Let's let the investigation play out.\"\n\nJohnson said in the interview he won't tolerate \"intentional misconduct\" by anyone in his department.\n\n“One of the byproducts of that is one bad cop makes it difficult for all the good cops on this job. One bad act will paint us all in that broad brush. Misconduct just simply can’t be tolerated,\" he said.\n\n“We are only as strong as the trust that the community believes in us. If they believe in us, they will partner with us and help to reduce some of this crime. The accountability issue has to be there.\"\n\nIf the lieutenant exam cheating allegations are proven true, Johnson could be in a tough position that could require him to punish his future wife as well as some of his closest allies in the department and fellow board members of the Chicago metropolitan chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement — NOBLE for short.\n\nWilliams is the organization's chapter president, and Johnson serves as its parliamentarian. Ward is the recording secretary on the group's board, according to a source within the department.\n\nAll of the sergeants in the study group named by the whistleblower were promoted based on their test scores.\n\nOn Monday, Johnson promised that if the Police Department's Internal Affairs investigation, initiated one year and four months ago, or the more recent city's inspector general's probe, concludes with findings of wrongdoing he would \"deal with it accordingly.\"\n\n\"Look, one thing that I have prided myself in over the years is not being a hypocrite. … If something comes back negative, and it needs to be handled then I will handle it,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson's personal connection to a subject of the cheating allegations also casts a shadow on Emanuel's decision to circumvent the Police Board selection process and install Johnson, whom the mayor publicly has said he has great confidence in as the department works to reduce violent crime and boost morale among the rank and file.\n\nEmanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said in a statement: \"There are unsubstantiated questions that have been raised and those questions are being looked into, as they should be.\"\n\nQuinn added that the Emanuel administration \"has been aware of the unsubstantiated questions raised about the lieutenants' exam for weeks.\"\n\n\"Interim Supt. Johnson made it clear from his first day that building trust is his top priority, and he already said he will take action should any wrongdoing be found,\" she said.\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:",
  "latent_6048": "Earlier this week, CNBC’s Jim Cramer stated that it is possible for Bitcoin price to reach $1 mln in the future.\n\nOn the CNBC show “Squawk on the Street,” Cramer stated that the demand toward Bitcoin is rapidly increasing and because of Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, its price could potentially enter the $1 mln region, which would bring the market cap of Bitcoin to tens of trillions of dollars.\n\nHowever, Cramer’s reasoning behind his Bitcoin price prediction was fundamentally flawed as he failed to grasp the core purpose of Bitcoin and why investors are starting to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nRapid increase in global adoption\n\nOver the past two years, Bitcoin has transformed its image from being illicit dark web money to a safe haven asset and digital gold. Bitcoin’s public image altered drastically due to a rapid increase in global adoption.\n\nAn increasing number of investors and users have begun to understand that Bitcoin’s transparent nature disallows the cryptocurrency from being completely anonymous and, therefore, it makes it possible to track Bitcoin transactions.\n\nOn a show hosted by CNBC, Cramer stated that the recent surge of Bitcoin price can be attributed to the mass purchase of Bitcoin by European banks to pay off hackers and ransomware distributors.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"I think it could because the European banks are frantically trying to buy them so they can pay off ransomware. It's a short-term way to be able to deal with cybersecurity. It is the way to pay off the bad guys.”\n\nSuch claim is evidently non-factual because the European Bitcoin exchange market only accounts for nine percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market and it is behind the US, Japan, China and South Korea in trading volumes. Hence, if European banks are causing Bitcoin price to surge, it needs to have absolute dominance over the market. A nine percent market share doesn't have a major influence over the 44.9 billion market cap of bitcoin.\n\nDemand from investors\n\nMore importantly, Cramer’s statement fails to consider the fact that Bitcoin is being utilized as a currency and safe haven asset more than it is being used as a lifeline to feed ransomware developers.\n\nIn the case of WannaCry ransomware, the biggest ransomware attack in history, the distributors earned less than $100,000. That is only 0.0012 percent of the European Bitcoin exchange market. Thus, to say that Bitcoin price is rising because of 0.0012 percent of traders from the fifth largest Bitcoin exchange market is not an accurate depiction of the surging Bitcoin price.\n\nAdam White, head of Coinbase’s digital currency exchange, said on CNBC in regards to Cramer’s statement that Bitcoin price is surging as a result of victims paying criminals: “I think that’s a stretch.”\n\nRegardless, Cramer believes that Bitcoin price will reach $1 mln one day due to its rapidly increasing trading volumes and demand from investors. Users of Bitcoin are expecting an alternative financial system to banks and existing financial networks.\n\nIf Bitcoin enters the $1 mln region, it will be competing with the reserve currencies of the world.",
  "latent_6078": "Angel mom Laura Wilkerson’s 18-year-old son Josh was killed by an illegal alien “dreamer” who came to the United States with his parents at 10-years-old and would likely have qualified under the once-touted Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill “DREAM Act” or DACA.\n\nOn Monday Wilkerson spoke with Breitbart News about Trump Administration plans to reverse now former President Obama’s unconstitutional immigration executive order Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nWilkerson said she never expected the Trump Administration to pull kids out of the arms of their parents to send them home. “I knew it was going to be a long process,” she said, adding, “I do not think they should be allowed any extras like in-state tuition.”\n\nShe said that if individuals have minor children, they can pick up those children and go home, and if they’re adults they can as well.\n\n“Separation is not like our separation, they can pick their kids up and go home. Do they want to? No,” said Wilkerson. She said she didn’t understand why he was holding off the implementation for a while, but she hopes there is a good solution in the works. “Definitely they need to go home,” she added.\n\nWilkerson said she has compassion, adding, “It’s a human issue. It’s so hard to just, ya know, if I’m standing looking a three-year-old kid in the face, ya know, crying ‘my mommy can’t come home,’ my question is just, your mommy should take you. That is the issue is take them with you and say, ‘ya know we tried to do this and for a while we did it, but I’ve made a mistake and this is what the consequences are, we’re going home to make a life wherever we’re from.’”\n\nShe emphasized that she doesn’t want to see these individuals getting perks such as in-state tuition, welfare, or the ability to vote.\n\nAsked what the effect on herself and her family has been on having a family member killed by an illegal alien “dreamer,” Wilkerson replied, “It’s devastation to our families that will never be repaired. I will never be the same person in this earthly life that I was before he was killed by somebody that shouldn’t have been here.” She said her family, surviving siblings, and Josh’s friends will never be the same.\n\n“You don’t know who you are anymore without this child in your life. It’s starting over and that’s the reality of it,” said Wilkerson. She said in some sense starting over may be a reality for those who have to return to their home countries, but that it isn’t comparable to her not being able to call her son, that her son doesn’t get to live out the rest of his life. “Everything for him stopped that day, no question.”\n\n“That for me is not separation,” Wilkerson said of those who could have to return to their home countries, but can take their families with them.\n\nShe commented that immigrants here legally certainly have nothing to fear, as they have done things legally.\n\n“We don’t have that luxury of skirting any laws because we have had a hard life, we just don’t,” said Wilkerson. “There’s no mistaking that I can’t call another country and talk to Josh. It’s just forever.”\n\n“They can still raise their child” if sent back to their home country, commented Wilkerson.\n\nWilkerson said she trusts the president’s judgement, and if a six month implementation is what Trump thinks is needed, then she was accepting that he knows what he is doing. However, she said ultimately that DACA needs to be removed as she sees it as just “perks.”\n\nShe said those that were brought illegally by their parents should have a discussion with their own parents to express the terrible situation those parents have put them in.\n\n“I would like to see them roll it back and be done with it,” Wilkerson said of DACA. She said she believes Trump wants to do this and to build the wall, but that it wouldn’t be “as easy as 1-2-3.”\n\nShe indicated that Trump may be giving Congress the opportunity to “put up or shut up” on addressing the issue of immigration, but wasn’t sure exactly what the strategy is. She said she trusts Trump to get things done, but also expressed that she will be heartbroken if nothing does get done.\n\nOn Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration plans to end the DACA program after a period of time. That time is supposed to allow Congress to act on the issue of immigration and those that have been shielded from immigration law enforcement under DACA.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",
  "latent_6112": "Tar-Palantir is interested in constructive feedback. It isn’t short – it is typical Tar-Palantir Wall of Text™.\n\nSo, get something to drink, put on some music you like, and sit back for a long read.\n\nJust in case you missed the memo about what is triggering this – new Sov System Dev blog.\n\nTar-Palantir will start out with one important Point of View note since it very much shapes all of his analysis and ideas below. Tar-Palantir started playing Eve because of wars. Not massive 4000 man fights – Asakai actually was of no interest to him. No, the wars. Fighting between parties that spanned months. The logistics, the internal organization, the resource collection, the strategy, the repeated fights, the stakes that make it worth all that effort – that is what Tar-Palantir loves about Eve. Other online games provide PvP – 1st person shooters, tank games, PvP arenas, space ship flight sims. Not interested – don’t really ever play them. No, it is the scope, the big picture, the war that interests Tar-Palantir. It started with following the ASCN war between BoB and ASCN back in 2006 (had RL friends on both sides of that war) and continued through The Great War of 2007, MAX, BoB Sov drop and Delve War II, the IT invasion of Fountain, INIT’s 2010 conquest of Catch, the destruction of the old Northern Coalition by the DRF, Raiden and White Noise vs Goons, TEST vs CFC of 2013, the Halloween War of 2013-2014, etc, etc, etc. As far as Tar-Palantir has found, no other online game offers this. It is unique to Eve. Tar-Palantir is just a foot soldier and scout in wars, but that massive scope and all that goes with it is his passion.\n\nNONE of that is to say that he likes the current current Sov mechanics nor the state of Null-sec politics. He doesn’t like them and could write an equal Wall of Text™ about it, but is not diving into that here. This is focused on the new Sov system proposed. This is a Tar-Palantirian Wall of Text™ – it isn’t short. So it has 3 sections so you can avoid having to read it all.\n\n1 – Summary version of problems with the system (2-5 sentences long each).\n\n2 – Detailed version of the problems with more examples to help see the logic chain (if needed, not every point in the summary section has a detailed version)\n\n3 – Some design ideas/examples from the past Sov systems that are NOT proposals, but good food for thought when designing a Sov system.\n\nThe new Sov system appears to have several critical problems with the design. While Tar-Palantir understands where the proposal is coming from, he fears people haven’t considered the full ramifications of the proposals and just how players will actually use them. Now, the proposals are a bit vague on exact mechanics, which is understandable at this stage. However, Tar-Palantir doesn’t feel that exact mechanics can be tweaked to remove all of these problems so believe what follows still stands even if the exact mechanics come out a bit differently than Tar-Palantir’s current assumptions.\n\nSummaries\n\n1. Attacker has a massive advantage while putting very little at risk. The defender on the other hand has everything at risk. A single attacker in a fast ship can threaten Sov, reinforce stuff in 12-40 minutes, and even take Sov fairly quickly if not stopped. All that the attacker risked was 1 fast ship. No longer do attackers need fleets to at least be a threat (may need them to actually win however). The defender has everything to lose – IHubs, IHub upgrades, Sov indexes, strategic infrastructure. So the defender needs to treat every single neutral or hostile that shows up in local as a threat to Sov. The attacker calls all the shots throughout the entire Sov struggle. Such a tilted scale allows attackers to harass the hell out of Sov holders at low cost/risk and can be done with minimal or no actual fighting.\n\n2. Extreme Blitzkrieg – an attacker can blitz and entire section of Sov space using both a main fighting fleet and small ships that split up and blanket the region. They can reinforce every single system in the region in less than 1 hour. A equally sized defender can react of course, but they have a main combat fleet they need to deal with as well as all the small groups. Unlike the attacker, they don’t know what is happening 1 hour in advance. It is very unlikely they will be able to stop them all fast enough. This then creates a huge timer burden 2 days later when ALL of that stuff comes out. Like with #1 – the attacker hasn’t risked a lot (bunch of fast ships and 1 main line combat fleet) while the defender is looking at possibly losing most of their Sov space 2 days later.\n\n3. The Prime Time vulnerability window is very limiting. Neighbors on different TZs can harass one another (see item #1) but can’t really fight pitched battles/Sov contests. They are invulnerable to one another most of the time. Members of the alliance outside of the Prime Time window can’t really fight for the alliance when it is under attack. They can do some support tasks, but not fight. The time window size can be expanded, but until that window becomes quite long (probably 12 hours-ish), RU TZ alliance and US TZ alliance neighbors can not really fight a Sov war.\n\n4. Removing the Prime Time Vulnerability makes #1 and #2 far, far worse. Suddenly instead of having to guard every system 4 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, the defender has to defend every system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you are a primarily 1 TZ alliance this is not viable.\n\n5. Range of “painting” and mobility of the “attacking” ship. The T2 mod has a range of 250 km and the attacking ship can still move. While a defender can prevent progress by the attacker by painting the structure with 1 ship as well, the threat isn’t really removed till the the attacker is dead (leaving the system doesn’t really solve the threat either since they can just attack another system). So the attacker can be a threat that has to be countered while taking very little risk himself (back to point #1). While the attacker can’t warp during module cycle, with a 2 minute cycle it is possible to paint, run around/keep range, turn off module, and when the cycle finishes, warp off and come back a bit later or go hit another Sov structure.\n\n6. Alliance with large member bases are very powerful in this new system. They can obliterate smaller powers using their #’s to just swarm surrounding space in a Blitz-like attack. The same numbers help them again in the timers with all the different command site contests. They can do this very rapidly, 1 hour on 1 day to reinforce an entire region, 4-5 hours on the timer day when everything comes out. Their large numbers mean that small attackers can’t really return the favor. They can harass as in #1, but not actually take as long as the large alliance chooses an appropriate amount of space to hold.\n\n7. Alliances can’t take a break from Eve, not even for a day. Christmas? Nope – all your stuff could be reinforced in 1 hour by 40 guys who don’t observe Christmas. Russian alliance that mostly celebrates Eastern Orthodox Easter while the rest of Europe celebrates Easter on a different day? Same problem. Chinese based alliance (there are a few) – similar problem on their unique holidays. The ease and speed at which an attacker can threaten Sov makes what used to comprise a mild annoyance in the past a major threat to Sov.\n\n8. If Sov is very fragile and systems change Sov holders rapidly/frequently (say every few weeks) very few will be willing to invest resources or time into systems they won’t be able to defend. The large alliances can – they have the resources and manpower to be reasonably secure. Their members can risk investment. Any infrastructure investment by small powers is a very risky investment as it can be wiped very rapidly by a larger neighbor. Reductions in investments in infrastructure and assets reduce the incentives to actually risk ships in fighting to defend it.\n\nDetails\n\n1. Risk/Resource Imbalance Between Attacker and Defender\n\nThe attacker can put close to nothing at risk and threaten Sov by reinforcing stuff. A single ship can threaten Sov. If we interpret the clause “low fitting requirements” to mean “can fit to a frigate”, the attacker can put basically nothing at risk. Now, that single frigate may be easy to drive off if the system is occupied – that is true. However, it doesn’t change the fact that he can threaten your Sov very easily. The current dev blog rules out warping/jumping while the module is active, but not moving. So it sounds like a frigate could run around grid “painting” the Sov structure or command site and alone be a threat to your Sov for which you need to scramble people to counter. So a random group of 10 people in frigates can now tie up your alliance with defending your Sov. If they get completely wiped out – they lose 10 frigates. If they get countered but not killed, they don’t make any progress, but they don’t lose anything other than time, while they tie up all of your defending forces chasing/trying to kill them. If you aren’t able to scramble in 10-50 minutes, you already lost struggle #1 for Sov. To 1 guy with a frigate.\n\nNow a counter to this is… you should have someone in system during your 4 hour window to protect your Sov! Ok, that is part of the design. However, as the system currently works, you may want 3 people per system – one for each structure. Even with that, all you can do is prevent them from making progress. If you only put 1 person in system, he has to run around system figuring out which structure the guy is hitting. If he module cycles after you arrive to defend, he just turns it off, warps off to one of the other 3, and starts on that one. You can solo chase them with your frigate, maybe even get a nice 1 v 1 fight and … now a 1 v 1 fight determines whether a system gets reinforced. Again, 1 guy in a frigate is calling the shots.\n\nYes, the defender has other options – they can send 5 guys with combat Intys and AFs out to counter the 1 guy and they’ll probably kill him, or at least drive him off. However, the general idea stands – 1 person is a risk to Sov and you as the defender have to treat every single guy in a frigate as a threat to your Sov. If they cycle their “painter” and warp off, they can just move to another system and start over. So you’ll be chasing them around till they finally die.\n\nThis same principle then applies to the combat site timers in the next stage. Assuming the attacker eventually found a system the defender doesn’t get to in time, or the defender loses the 1 v 1 fight, you now got to stage 2. That single guy can go racing around “painting” the flags in the command sites. Now, because of your defense bonuses, you’ll be able to beat him without too much effort, but you will have to show up and do it. If the attacker wins a 1 v 1 fight with your guy countering him, you have to scramble more people/replacement ship to prevent lost Sov. More likely, the defender will at least have several people show up. If the 1 attacker is smart, he’ll just go 5 systems over and threaten Sov there. So now you have to defend a new system and these command sites all from 1 guy in a frigate.\n\nThis makes harassing the hell out of Sov holders easy. Sov holders will have to have people on duty in every system they hold for the 4 hour Prime Time vulnerability window. Just to prevent people in frigates from generating timers. This seems to take the idea of required occupancy a bit far. You can up the fitting requirements to try and deal with this, but that just moves it to nano-cruisers. Pretty sure it being a BS mod doesn’t fit “low fitting requirements” design principle.\n\n2. Extreme Bliztkrieg\n\nIn part due the the above, a decent sized alliance can blitz an entire region in 1 hour for very little cost/risk. Let us say that an alliance can put 250 people in fleet during their prime time. Multiple large alliances are easily capable of this. Their hostile neighbor is roughly the same #, and same TZ. The attacking alliance takes 150 of the group in typical fleet doctrine BS and moves to the main staging/living system of their foes. They besiege the station, threatening Sov and fighting with the defenders – it is their staging system after all. The other 100 guys are in frigates – Intys and AFs likely work best. They split up into 2 man pairs and spread out across the 50 systems in the region. In each system the attacker hits the IHub and Station (if there is no station they can threaten the TCU – but more likely you would threaten only the IHub with the other frigate providing combat cover/protection). Intys can cover a region in minutes with their warp speed and interdiction nullification. You make it a cruiser and above module and the attacker can go nano cruiser or user more expensive and nullified fast warp speed T3’s.\n\nSo the defender puts her response fleet together, only having a few minutes warning of a hostile fleet entering their space. Assuming they form up quickly, they are ready to fight in 20 minutes. By now, some system are already reinforced – anything with the lower 1/2 of defense bonus’ to the timers. The other systems are already 1/2 way to being reinforced. They undock and engage the main hostile fleet and a nice fight breaks out. Such BS fights usually take awhile – let us assume 1/2 hour. They utterly destroy the attacking fleet. Their staging system is saved. All 49 other systems they hold are in reinforced. In 2 days time they will have to defend 49 different system with possibly 49-98 timers – each generating 5 combat sites per timer in various nearby systems. Think about that for a second. Most of that was done by 100 guys in frigates. The attacker did risk (and in this case lose) a BS fleet that went to the defenders staging system. In 2 days time, the defender could lose the entire region in 1 large fight even after WINNING the main BS fleet fight during the initial blitz.\n\nThat is the extreme “we formed up to defend our staging and couldn’t send someone out to clear other systems” worst case scenario. Let us assume somewhat more favorable events happen. The defender has some small defense squads outside of their main staging system. So those squads move around to systems chasing and killing what frigates they can while the main force forms and fights in the main staging system. Let us assume they are quite successful and in 20-30 minutes time they are able to burn around and kill or drive off 1/2 of the attacking frigates. Ok, now they only have 25 system that could fall in 2 days, each generating 5 command sites per sov structure for a total of 25-50 timers. Again, all the attacker put at risk was one 150 man BS fleet & 100 frigates. The defender could now lose 1/2 of a region in a total of 2 days, all happening in a 1 hour time window.\n\nIt gets even more extreme when we come to the reinforcement timers in 2 days. Same parties involved. This time the attacker puts all his effort on 1 system using one 250 man fleet. This system is important to you, but it’s not your staging since you saved that from being reinforced 2 days earlier. If the defender focuses all their people on that system for the fight, you could lose 48 other systems to 1 frigate from a 3rd party wandering around. Or perhaps a 5 frigate squad from allies of the attacker. Nothing major, nothing your intel channels or spies would have warned you about. If you split up your forces, the main fight you are now at a #’s disadvantage. The defender here is looking at potentially losing most/all of their Sov space if they lose that main fight. They can try to do what the attacker did the 1st time, put a smaller fleet in the main fight and have guys run around to save systems. However, they’ll probably lose the main fight then and while they will save some of the systems, suspect they won’t be able to save them all. Also, 3rd parties can easily pick off systems while the two are fighting. The attacker has risked very little – 2 BS fleets and 100 frigates. The attacker has gotten to make all the choices – which systems to hit, when (within the narrow window this is true), with what.\n\n3. Prime Time Vulnerability\n\nThat your Sov is only open to attack during a 4 hour “Prime time” vulnerability window is very limiting. It means that for defense purposes, your other TZ players don’t matter for Sov. They are USELESS to defend your space except by raising your indexes by ratting/mining. The one thing they can do (and some people will like this aspect) is they can ATTACK someone else’s space. They don’t have anything to defend (since they aren’t in the 4 hour window) so they are free to go attack others. But when it comes to defending the space they live in, they can’t really help.\n\nYet, even attacking your neighbors may not work. They have the same Prime Time vulnerability setting. So, let us assume a heavily Russian TZ based alliance lives next to a primarily US TZ based alliance. Each logically set their Prime Time vulnerability windows to their strongest times when they have the most active people. That is intended behavior under the design. Result – those 2 neighbors will NEVER fight a Sov war. For most of the day they can’t even attack each other. They can follow the above idea of sending in frigates to harass the enemy – that still works. Forcing the defender to chase your frigates around for 4 hours. But due to the forces involved, they can’t be serious threats to each other.\n\nTo be a viable attacker with this new system, your Alliance needs to have a pretty even TZ coverage. Single TZ/country/language based alliances basically can only fight other alliances with similar TZs (think of Russian alliances, or Chinese speakers, or French, or German, etc). So this really pushes all Sov holding alliances to be very diverse in their membership. TZ coverage is useful with any reinforcement timer system. However, with this system it is a requirement to attack people.\n\n4. Removing Prime Time Vulnerability\n\nIf, due to the above problems in #3, you remove the Prime Time vulnerability window and make it either very wide, or removed entirely, the entire system breaks down into a horrible mess. Now you need people in every system 24/7 to prevent a single guy in a frigate from reinforcing stuff in less than 1 hour at very little risk to himself. So now, the only alliances that can hold Sov are those with good TZ coverage on all hours of the day. The Sov system is now completely and utterly broken for a game. Needing guards active in every system 24/7 is a job, not a game.\n\nYou can try a tweak where the system is always vulnerable, but the defense timers will come out inside of that 4 hour window. That does give the defender something to work with. However, it still means that a 1 TZ focused alliance can have all their Sov space reinforced by a small number of different TZ guys in frigates in 50 minutes. All the timers may be in that 4 hour window, but you could still have dozens of them (50-100 timers if we use the 50 system example from above). So a small number of guys in 50 minutes on a TZ where your guys are all asleep or at work puts all your Sov holdings at risk and forces your alliance to spend 4 hours running around running command sites. They don’t even need to show up for those timers, they can just do it every 3 days to annoy the hell out of you.\n\n5. Range and Mobility of the Ship “Painting” the Sov Structure\n\nThe Dev blog mentions a 250 KM range on the T2 module, and while ships can’t warp or jump while the module is running, they don’t say anything about moving. Assuming “low fitting requirements” means it can fit on a Inty, you can be truly evil and insane in attacking Sov. Fit out an Inty so it can lock out to 150+ km (this can be done with a Crow without too extreme of mods), fit for as much speed as possible with that lock range (implants included). Now orbit said structure at 150+ km at high speed. As the defender you can paint the structure with your own mod to at least prevent them from making progress but that just gets you a stalemate. They can warp away at any 2 minute interval when the module cycles. Or they can just keep orbiting, forcing you to sit there countering them until they decide the leave. You could also call in backup while you sit on the structure painting it to “defend” and have your buddy in a fast Inty try and got out can tackle the guy. If he speed implants and speed bonuses you won’t catch him unless you have the same. This works for the defenders too by the way. The defender can have a single guy in such a max range Inty doing the same thing, tying your 150 man BS fleet in knots, unable to reinforce the system until a single Inty is killed. However, this is harder to pull off for the defender since it requires GETTING there quickly, while the attacker decides when he will show up, and can also decide when he will leave. Defenders don’t have those choices.\n\nThis one is actually solvable by making the range of the mod shorter. Perhaps it was just a typo in the dev blog – don’t know. Another possibility is to make the ship immobile, or perhaps unable to use a AB/MWD. That at least decreases the chase insanity.\n\n6. Power In Numbers\n\nLarge numbers are very powerful with this system. A large power can blanket a region of smaller powers with ships for 1 hour. Having enough people, they can crush or delay most resistance until many systems are reinforced. Come back 2 days later for 4-5 hours and win most of the contests unless an equally large opponent comes to stop them. The small guy can’t do anything but get = #’s to help them with all the Sov contests. Even if you have a good combat force, with all the different timers that a blitz can create, you need man power that you can spread across all those different command sites.\n\nThe large #’s in an alliance help on the defense as well, providing the manpower to crush any threats from smaller powers. A large alliance with a high population density is fairly safe (especially with the Prime Time Window) while being capable of obliterating anyone smaller within frigate or HAC travel range. Large powers have always had advantages, but now they can obliterate smaller powers’ Sov completely in 3 days time with just a few hours of actual work. The attacker can lock the smaller powers out of their stations entirely by coming back for the 2nd set of station timers if they want.\n\nSo, having burned down parts of the current proposal, Tar-Palantir is going to lay out some ideas about what a new system should have. These are more general ideas and examples from the past than proposals. They are things that people more inventive than Tar-Palantir can think about when designing a new Sov system. Tar-Palantir will readily admit to not being that imaginative.\n\nIdeas/Examples that are Definitely Not Proposals\n\nA. The attacker needs to be required to put some effort forward and something at risk to attack Sov. Needing only 1 ship means completely disrupts the risk/benefit balance. 1 person can destroy all the benefits of Sov unless the defender is always there in force to protect it. Harassing becomes so easy that attackers do it just to make the defender squirm.\n\nThe old POS Sov system required the attacker to come with an actual fleet of some kind. POS can shoot back, so it needed to be a combat fleet. The defender could scramble a few people as POS gunners to put up more of a fight/slow things down while they formed up a counter/response. Fights could evolve. 1 guy in a frigate couldn’t threaten your Sov.\n\nThe defender also had a say in how much the attacker had to put at risk. If the defender put in the time and isk, she could have large POS, lots of guns, points, webs, and neuts. However, there was the initial isk cost of those mods, the long hours of setting the damned thing up (longer back then than now), and then the fuel costs of the POS, which back then went up based on the # of online mods. The defender could save herself costs by just putting up unarmed small POS, but then roaming HAC gangs could just reinforce everything. So the 2 sides had decisions to make about the amount of resources put forward. It also allowed a wealthy/well organized alliances to invest heavily to help them fight off much larger but less resource/less organized attackers. They could invest in strong POS infrastructure, organized logistics to support them, good design of the defenses of the POS, and adjust them over time in response to how the attacker attacked.\n\nB. The attacker needs multiple ways to threaten/take Sov. Not multiple mechanics, but rather a mechanic that is open to multiple approaches. The Dominion system is very direct brute force. You must put down SBU, then DPS down these structures, show up for a list of timers and DPS down those structures again. You’ll need to win the fleet fights around those timers. SBUs added a little variety – defenders could either defend the station/IHub or go on the offense and kill the SBU before the attacker could kill/reinforce the IHub/Station. But in practice, it usually wasn’t that interesting.\n\nThe old POS system, for all its flaws (it had them) offered the attacker more options. The attacker needed the majority of the POS in system, but there were multiple ways to get this. You could blitzkrieg the system, reinforce everything, pick the best timers from the results, and try and kill enough POS so that you could replace them with yours to get the needed majority. Or, you could ninja-spam POS on open moons and start a race that way with both sides spamming POS to keep majority. Ships spamming POS are vulnerable to attack – far more so than covert haulers uncloaked for a grand total of about 15 seconds when SBUing. POS also need to be fueled and stronted – so interdicting POS fuel shipments was a viable tactic as well.\n\nTimers weren’t hard set – they were based on stront. So the defender and attacker had to make decisions and try to anticipate/manipulate what the opponent did for stront timing. You could attack at an odd hour so their default stront timing was “off”. You could blitz so their stront timers didn’t have time to get there to change stront timing. You could kite POS to force the timers into a different TZ. The Defender on his side could adjust the default timing based on what he though the attacker would do. If the defender expected kiting, he could adjust as such and a kiting attacker would get a nasty disappointment when she finally finished her kiting.\n\nAlso, you had more than 1 or 5 timers. There could easily be 20 timers for one system with both sides reinforcing the POS of the other, so both sides could pick and choose which ones mattered most. Fighting daily over a system for a week was not uncommon. The key was it was constant/daily, which is good. It was a war, not a “we’ll show up in 5 days with a massive fleet and win the only timer that really matters, then rep everything”. There are people to this day on both sides of the fight that still fondly remember the December 2007 siege of NOL-M9 in Delve. A week of nearly constant fleet fights all day long across all TZs as both sides struggled to kill POS and take/defend the system Sov. While that is one of the more famous sieges, it isn’t the only one.\n\nOk, that was long and this isn’t saying we should go back to the old POS system (though, honestly, it is better than this new proposal and better than Dominion was). However, it gives you some of the good stuff in that system that can be used in a new design.\n\nC. The Sov system needs to scale badly. The larger you get, the harder/more effort it takes to hold together. Phoebe already helped here, by restricting rapid movement via teleportation (cap ship jumps, titan bridges, jump bridges). The old POS systems scaled badly. The larger you got, the heavier the burden of the logistics of running all those POS became. Same for distribution of POS gunners and stront timers. While it annoyed the hell out of the major alliances, that was a good thing. Dominion Sov scaled linearly for the most part. You just paid a higher Sov bill, but at the same cost per system. Just be sure to have the isk in the right wallet! The new system also scales badly, so it has that idea. However, for the reasons already listed above, it doesn’t actually work out well. However, this bad scaling is an important consideration in a Sov design.\n\nScout, tackle, warp-in point, suicide agress, die.\n\nyour humble Interceptor pilot\n\nTar-Palantir\n\nEditor’s Note: Gyrn Fzirth has edited Tar Palantir’s original post to include a few links and images with Tar Palantir’s permission",

  "latent_6181": "This was originally posted on James Lewis’ personal blog at:\n\nhttp://marsblogger.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/minerals-and-the-search-for-life-on-mars/\n\n(Re-posted with permission)\n\nUnderstanding if life could ever have existed on Mars is one of the most challenging scientific questions facing us in the 21st Century. We know that the Martian surface at present is an arid environment bombarded with ultraviolet radiation, so the chance of finding living organisms existing there today is extremely unlikely. However, Mars has not always been this way, its history is divided into three distinct geological periods; the Amazonian, Hesperian, and the Noachian. The oldest of these, the Noachian, is likely to have been a significantly more promising time for life to potentially evolve as liquid water persisted on or near the surface long enough to carve valleys into the Martian surface and leave behind distinctive rock units. For example, in Gale Crater Curiosity Rover discovered minerals that indicated the presence of a freshwater lake at the time of their formation billions of years ago, an environment favourable to life or at least life as we understand it on Earth.\n\nThough life could potentially exist deep underground on present day Mars the most realistic aim, with our current technological abilities, is to examine ancient Martian rocks for pieces of evidence that life could have left behind. Any life that may have existed on ancient Mars would likely be microscopic so looking for fossil evidence is extremely challenging and many microscopic features that look like fossils can often be formed by non-life processes. The most unambiguous result would be to find carbon compounds on Mars that we know form through biological means. Life leaves behind many distinct carbon compounds but not all carbon compounds, which are referred to as organic molecules, are evidence of life. Many form by non-biological processes, such as reactions between carbon dioxide, water and rocks at high temperature or the accumulation of dust and grains in the early Solar System. We know that cosmic dust, asteroids and comets are packed with complex organic molecules. Even if life never existed on Mars we would expect to see the organic compounds added to the planet by the regular impacts from these bodies.\n\nThere have been several missions sent to Mars for which searching for organic compounds was a high priority (the Viking Landers and Curiosity Rover). However, none of these have made a conclusive detection of either biological or non-biological indigenous carbon compounds. All that has been detected so far are simple carbon and chlorine compounds that could be from chemicals used to clean the instruments before departure from Earth. The most commonly used detection technique employed by these missions is to scoop or drill a sample, bring it back into the lander or rover and then heat it in an inert atmosphere and see what gases come off. This technique is called pyrolysis and is widely used on Earth to analyse the minerals and organic compounds within samples. Heat decomposes the materials and the gaseous fragments can be analysed and used to work out the type of compounds that were in the sample. A key requirement for successful pyrolysis is an inert atmosphere, a potential problem for Mars missions is whether the minerals introduced alongside potential organic molecules remain stable at the high temperatures the sample is heated to. Most minerals will remain inert, however some will release carbon dioxide and water and the most problematic will release oxygen. Oxygen can combust organic compounds so that all that is detected is carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTrue to Mars’ track record of making exploration of its surface as complicated as possible it just so happens that it is coated in a mineral that releases oxygen on heating. The mineral is a salt of chlorine and oxygen called perchlorate. It was first discovered by the Phoenix Lander in the polar regions of Mars in 2008 and has also been detected by Curiosity Rover in Gale Crater. It’s extremely rare on Earth, where it is only seen naturally in extremely arid environments such as the Atacama Desert or the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Perchlorates also release chlorine on heating and it is possible that they are responsible not just for unsuccessful organic detection experiments but the fact we see simple chlorinated organic compounds when we heat Martian samples.\n\nHowever, this may not be a complete disaster. Carbon dioxide is easy to analyse and the temperature at which it is detected could potentially indicate the nature of the material the carbon in the carbon dioxide is sourced from. New research has highlighted the fact that if perchlorate is heated with low weight organic matter (typical of contamination) you get a lower temperature carbon dioxide peak than if you heat perchlorate with a mix of organic matter weights (typical of indigenous organic matter). Chlorinated carbon compounds, like those seen by Viking and Curiosity, were also detected during these heating experiments.\n\nWhen Curiosity Rover heated a sample from within Gale Crater called the Sheepbed mudstone oxygen and chlorinated carbon compounds were seen to be released at the same temperature. This indicates that perchlorate sourced oxygen and chlorine were interacting with organic matter but the low temperature of releases suggests that in this case it was just contamination. Though searching for organic compounds on Mars has been found to be extremely difficult some information can still be gained from heating experiments. As we approach an era where sample return missions (that is sending a mission to Mars that then sends back samples to Earth) or even manned missions are likely, having an understanding of where on Mars may be organic rich or which rocks units may be most promising will be extremely valuable.\n\nI was a co-author on the new pyrolysis of perchlorate and different molecular weights of organic matter research and you can get the open access paper by clicking here.\n\nPlease post any comments and questions below or to my twitter account.",

Most Russian speakers supported the move to join Russia; the Tatars – a Muslim minority who make up about 12% of the population – largely boycotted the vote and wanted to remain in Ukraine.\n\nCrimean Tatars gather at a cemetery outside Simferopol for the funeral of Reshat Ametov, who disappeared and was later found dead after protesting against the Russian takeover of Crimea. Photograph: Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters\n\nOn the day of the referendum, the body of Reshat Ametov, a Tatar who had protested against the seizure of the peninsula by Russian troops, was found with signs he had been tortured.\n\nHe had last seen alive in video footage showing unmarked men in camouflage leading him away from a protest in Simferopol's Lenin Square.\n\n\"It's like when we came in the 1990s, they looked at us askance. It's the same way now,\" said his wife, Zarina Ametova. \"They look at us like an enemy.\"\n\nAksyonov has denied that local militias had anything to do with Ametov's murder, which remains unsolved. But many fear the murder was the start of a campaign of violence and political persecution against the Tatars.\n\nThe US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, told Congress this month: \"We are extremely concerned about the human rights situation for all Crimeans but notably for Tatars.\"\n\nIn a report released on Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, said the Tatars faced numerous problems including physical harassment, fear of religious persecution and internal displacement.\n\nThe report warned of an \"alarming deterioration\" of human rights in eastern Ukraine, where it said insurgent groups had carried out \"targeted killings, torture and beatings, abductions, intimidation and some cases of sexual harassment\".\n\nCrimean Tatars protest on 3 May after their unofficial leader Mustafa Dzhemilev was banned from re-entering the peninsula. Photograph: Alexander Polegenko/AP\n\nThe UN highlighted the case of the Crimean Tatars' unofficial leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, a Ukrainian MP and former Soviet dissident, who was banned from the peninsula after he left for meetings in Kiev and was not allowed back in.\n\nDzhemilev has set the tone for the Tatar people and their self-governing Mejlis council by refusing to recognise the new pro-Russia government and the referendum to join Russia, even telling the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to withdraw Russian troops in a phone call before the vote.\n\n\"They want to make us all Russian citizens, but there's no democracy in Russia,\" Dzhemilev said. \"We're used to living more freely.\"\n\nAfter Dzhemilev was denied entry to Crimea for the second time on 3 May, more than 1,000 Tatars closed roads around the peninsula in protest.\n\nIn response, Crimea's chief prosecutor, Natalia Poklonskaya, said last week that members of the Mejlis were suspected of \"extremist activity\" and that the council could be \"liquidated\".\n\nSahri Mustafayev, one of those who closed roads, said he had been fined 15,000 rubles (£260) last week along with at least 10 others, adding that 200 others also faced fines. But he plans to appeal against the decision, and the harsh measures seem to have only hardened protesters' resolve.\n\n\"I'm a Crimean Tatar, why can't I say what I want?\" Mustafayev said. \"This is our homeland. We have nowhere else to go. I would rather die here than listen to this new government.\n\n\"We're waiting for what the Mejlis will say to us. If they say rise up, we will,\" he said, but added that Tatars were also waiting for the results of the Ukrainian presidential election on 25 May, in which many of them hope to vote.\n\nDzhemilev said the Mejlis was split on whether to refuse to cooperate with the new government, but he thought it would have to compromise.\n\nThe political tension has been exacerbated by incidents such as one in which a 14-year-old Crimean Tatar was beaten by unknown men who reportedly said Tatars should be kicked off the peninsula.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin, his envoy to Crimea Oleg Belaventsev and Crimean PM Sergei Aksyonov meet Tatar representatives in Sochi, Russia, on Friday. Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/AP\n\nA member of the Mejlis, Abduraman Egiz, was beaten on camera last week by men who he said identified themselves as members of a pro-Russia self-defence unit and demanded to check his documents.\n\nTatar leaders are calling for the liquidation of self-defence forces, which have been a major issue of contention for the community.\n\n\"They say they ensure law and order. We think that they don't ensure it, they start conflicts,\" Egiz said, adding that beatings were on the rise. \"They're dangerous in Crimea. They destabilise the situation.\"\n\nLocal police did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to the independent Crimean political analyst Sergei Kostinsky, the Kiev government had previously kept discrimination against Tatars by the Crimean government in check.\n\nDespite a promise by Putin last month to deal with issues including housing for Crimean Tatars, Kostinsky said Moscow has yet to take serious steps to rein in \"Crimean chauvinism\". Russians are beginning to express old biases in everyday life, he said.\n\nKostinsky attributed the pressure on Tatar political leaders to the Kremlin's attempt to crush opposition to its rule in Crimea and eventually divide the Tatars politically.\n\n\"Today Crimea is supposed to be a window exhibit for Russia, the world community, Ukraine,\" he said. \"There's supposed to be mass support for Russia here, and if there is 12% to 20% of the population that considers itself to be Ukrainian it will ruin the picture and negatively affect the image of Russia, which says that the Crimeans invited it to invade.\"\n\nAbout 1,500 Crimean Tatars have fled to western Ukraine, most of them fearing religious persecution, according to Rustem Ablyatifov, a Crimean Tatar who heads the pro-European integration NGO Institute for a Civil Society.\n\nDzhemilev has said a total of 5,000 Crimean Tatars have had to leave since the Russian takeover. Ablyatifov fled to Lviv because he was afraid of retaliation for his active support of the Euromaidan protests in Kiev after security services followed him and tried to arrest him, he said.\n\n\"When they detained us they shouted: 'We'll deal with you Muslims, we'll show you!'\" he said.\n\nAbout 30 Crimean Tatars have received political asylum in Poland, according to Ismail Ismailov, a pro-Euromaidan activist who has himself fled to Azerbaijan.\n\n\"The chauvinists have more government posts now. They feel more confident, and they will constantly put pressure on Crimean Tatars,\" Ismailov said.\n\nFor now, the conflict has yet to affect the daily lives of most Tatars. At the Khan's Palace in Bakhchysarai, the historical capital of the Crimean Tatars, tourists and a Russian wedding party posed for photographs on Sunday as Tatars sat outside the mosque.\n\nAt the city bazaar, where Russians and Tatars hawk their wares side by side, a Russian, Viktoria Bayeva, said that \"everything seems friendly\" for now.\n\n\"Of course we're worried, we're worried about the future of our children, but we hope it will be OK,\" said a Tatar woman named Sabina, who was sitting with her two daughters outside the mosque.\n\n\"For now the conflict isn't touching these peaceful women, but it could touch their husbands and brothers,\" said Nadzhie Femi, a local journalist who writes for Radio Free Europe.\n\n\"When they forbid a Tatar, especially one of such status as Dzhemilev, to enter Crimea … it's interpreted as the start of bigger repressions\".",
  "latent_6352": "DANA POINT Donna Kalez looked out her office windows Sunday at the six docks at Dana Wharf and saw a woman trying to pose with a very robust sea lion on Dock 3.\n\n“The lady probably got an awesome shot and it’s probably all over Instagram and Facebook,” said Kalez, who operates Dana Wharf Sport Fishing and Whale Watch. “I’m just glad she wasn’t bitten.”\n\nAt other times, Kalez sees people at the seawall taking pictures of multiple sea lions at the end of the dock. Then she sees those same people climbing over the locked dock gate to get closer. Even kayakers are coming in to get a better look.\n\nKalez has had to step up monitoring her privately leased docks for months now since OC Parks – the county agency that manages Dana Point Harbor – put up large colored inflatables, with waving arms and shaking hips, to scare away sea lions from the Orange County Harbor Patrol dock in the harbor’s east basin.\n\nThose sea lions – which she considers a nuisance and a public safety hazard – have moved on to other docks like hers.\n\nOC Parks initially bought six air dancers for $150 each in late June after dozens of sea lions had begun to cluster on the Harbor Patrol dock, turning it into a mini version of San Francisco’s Pier 39. Their weight – together more than 1,000 pounds – was making the concrete on the dock crack and break.\n\nCounty and Dana Point Marina Co. officials also worried about boater safety.\n\n“We didn’t want boaters coming to their boats at night to fall over sea lions on the docks,” said Doug Whitlock, general manager of Dana Point Marine Co., which manages Dana Point Harbor’s east basin.\n\nWhitlock asked the county for 19 more inflatables after the initial test run showed them to be effective.\n\nNow, three months later, Marisa O’Neil, spokeswoman for OC Parks, said the county’s effort has helped keep sea lions off the targeted docks. But it will take a lot more air dancers to cover the 1,400 boat slips in the harbor’s east basin.\n\nWith cooler temperatures, Whitlock and O’Neil said no more air dancers are being purchased at this time.\n\nWhitlock, who has been in the harbor for 30 years, said the sea lions have become more plentiful in the last two years. He credits that to better water quality in the harbor and an explosion of more food options such as anchovies.\n\n“There were so many anchovies in the water this summer that it actually darkened the water,” he said.\n\nOther harbors, like Newport Beach’s, have experienced their fair share of sea lion nuisances. Newport Beach used water sprinklers, bright-colored netting and cement-filled bucket as barriers. In past years, the city hired a contractor to spray water at sea lions in the evenings to keep them at bay.\n\nSgt. Steve Marble with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department Harbor Patrol, said there were fewer sea lions in Newport Beach this summer.\n\n“Maybe the sharks scared them off,” he said.\n\nIn the past three years, thousands of sea lions have stranded themselves because of an increased inability to find food near the Channel Islands breeding grounds. Marine mammal rescue centers from San Diego to San Francisco last year took in more than 4,400 sea lions. The Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach this year has rescued nearly 300.\n\nKeith Matassa, executive director of the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, has been tracking sea lions in Dana Point Harbor that have been released from his and other centers. He said he thinks the inflatables are a good, nonlethal way to deter them from docks and boats.\n\nTo increase the air dancer’s effectiveness, the county has used them in combination with other obstacles such as five-gallon water buckets. But many of those buckets have been pushed aside by the sea lions.\n\nOrange County Harbor Patrol Sgt. John Hollenbeck said he recently saw a whole group of sea lions sleeping under an inflatable.\n\n“I don’t know that they’re helping that much,” he said.\n\nStill, Kalez has stepped up her game. Her docks don’t have electricity to inflate the dancing figures so she put up a kite-like banner to wave in the wind.\n\n“But yesterday, we had a 2,000-pound sea lion on the dock and every single person wanted to come and touch it and take pictures. It was pretty scary,” she said.\n\nWhitlock agrees with Kalez’ concerns. He said educating people about the sea lions and reminding them to stay away from the animals is key.\n\n“They are wild animals,” he said. “When they bark at you, they can get very aggressive.”\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-2254 or eritchie@ocregister.com or on Twitter:@lagunaini",

  "latent_6552": "Score yet another win for drug war panics. Florida lawmakers, in response to the increasing number of deaths caused by opioid overdoses, are pursuing a tactic we know is not effective: mandatory minimums.\n\nToday Florida's Senate has added the opioids fentanyl and carfentanil to the list of drugs that will send possessors to prison for a mandatory minimum sentence of three years and possibly much much more.\n\nThe three-year minimum is triggered by possession of four grams of the drug, which typically ends up being about seven or eight pills after it's mixed for consumption.\n\nWhen considering HB 477, the Senate originally agreed unanimously to amend it to give judges a \"safety valve\" to give less than the mandatory minimum in certain cases, such as when it was clear the defendant was not a trafficker or didn't realize they had bought a drug (like Xanax) on the street with fentanyl in it.\n\nBut when HB 477 returned back to the Florida House, lawmakers stripped that safety valve right back out. The drug warriors insisted that these mandatory minimums would catch drug traffickers, not addicts. In reality, that's simply not true, because the law doesn't differentiate between pure fentanyl and fentanyl mixtures. As Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) notes, four grams of pure fentanyl would indeed be thousands of doses on its own, but the law actually states that it just needs to be a \"mixture\" containing the forbidden substance.\n\nSenators warned that without the safety valve, the mandatory minimums are going to drag in users, not just dealers. From the Tampa Bay Times:\n\nState Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was among those putting up the biggest fight, warning that if a few grams of carfentanil is mixed in a water bottle, the weight jumps and that person could face 25 years in prison for just a few grams. Someone thinking they just had a few grams would be facing significant time in prison unknowingly he argued. \"Addicts have no idea what they are buying,\" he said.\n\nUnfortunately, the Senate decided to go along with the House and approve the legislation with the safety valve stripped out. More Floridians face long prison terms over this law. Even further, the law also allows prosecutors to charge a person with first degree murder if they provide these drugs to another person who then dies of an overdose.\n\nSadly, we already know full well that mandatory minimum sentences in Florida drags in thousands of offenders for long prisons terms for low-level offenses. Lauren Krisai and C.J. Ciaramella crunched the data for Reason and calculated that the vast majority of people in prison for opioid \"trafficking\" were low-level users or dealers.

  "latent_6973": "Vice Premier Li Keqiang of China (R) meets International Monetary Fund (IMF), Managing Director Christine Lagarde (L) inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 23, 2015 in Beijing, China. (Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)\n\nWhat China’s SDR Bond Issue Really Means\n\nThis is the first step toward one world currency\n\nThey promised, they delivered. The World Bank will issue a $2.8 billion SDR bond, or Special Drawing Rights bond, in China in August. Separately, the China Development Bank will also issue between $300 million and $800 million of SDR notes.\n\nChina, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and interested think tanks have been pushing the idea of private SDR since the beginning of the year. It has now come to fruition. But what does it actually mean?\n\nInitially, SDR-denominated bonds will be of particular interest to official investors, but gradually, they will also attract investors from private sectors. — Zhu Jun , director-general, PBOC\n\nThe so-called SDR is an IMF construct of real currencies—right now the euro, yen, dollar, and pound—without actually containing any of them. It is just a claim to demand payment in these currencies. It made news last year when the Chinese renminbi was also admitted, although it won’t formally be part of the basket until Oct. 1 of this year. The IMF and member countries trade the units currently worth $1.40 among each other.\n\nRelated Coverage China Capital Outflows Were as High as $39B in July\n\n“Initially, SDR-denominated bonds will be of particular interest to official investors, but gradually, they will also attract investors from private sectors. In such a way, an SDR bond market will be developed,” Zhu Jun, the director-general of the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) international department told the Chinese business paper Caixin.\n\nWorth Wray, the chief global macro strategist of STA Wealth Management, agrees: “Right now there is no organic demand, but over a five-year horizon it could develop globally and maybe that creates another channel for capital to flow into China—if that’s the only market there is for it,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe SDR bonds issued by the two official institutions are different from the official SDR issued by the IMF. In fact, they are a derivative of it. When the World Bank unit called International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) issues the bonds, it receives payment in yuan from the Chinese market or at first from the issue’s underwriter, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\nIt can then proceed to either spend the yuan in China or exchange them for other currencies and spend them abroad. So far, the IBRD has disbursed $46 billion worth of loans, grants, and credits in China. It is important to note that this process is effectively creating SDRs, which have previously not existed.\n\nChinese investors receive the SDR bonds, but what do they actually own?\n\nFor the Chinese investors, there is the advantage that they can hold a sizeable non-yuan denominated asset in China and reduce their risk to the Chinese currency.\n\nOfficial SDRs can be redeemed for dollars, euros, yen, pounds, and soon yuan through the IMF. However, the new private SDR, or M-SDR as the IMF calls it, cannot. The new bonds represent a claim on the IBRD. Since the IBRD doesn’t have any SDR assets, the repayment will also be in yuan, dollars, euros, yen, or pounds. So what’s the point of having this new basket?\n\nFor the IBRD, there is no advantage because it is borrowing in strong currencies and getting paid in a relatively weak one. For the Chinese investors, there is the advantage that they can hold a sizeable non-yuan denominated asset in China and reduce their risk to the Chinese currency, which may further fall in value. Because of still-existing capital controls, buying foreign assets in size is not yet possible on the Chinese domestic bond market.\n\nHowever, this is only an advantage for the time being. At the point of maturity, foreign currency will have to flow from the IBRD to the Chinese bond holders, unless they choose repayment in yuan, in which case the whole exercise would be rather pointless.\n\nSo given this lackluster value proposition, why are China, the IMF, and the U.S.-controlled World Bank going out of their way to push the SDR into private markets?\n\nProminent market observers like James Rickards and Willem Middelkoop have long argued that the SDR will be the next world reserve currency. In fact, the current governor of the PBOC, Zhou Xiaochuan, has advocated for the SDR to become the next global reserve currency for a long time now.\n\n“Special consideration should be given to giving the SDR a greater role. The SDR has the features and potential to act as a super-sovereign reserve currency,” wrote Zhou in 2009. He also wanted the yuan to be included in the SDR, which is going to happen on Oct. 1. Take heed of his predictions.\n\nIt’s a geeky name but it’s a kind of world money printed by the IMF. They’ll flood the world with trillions of SDRs. — James Rickards , author, 'Currency Wars'\n\n“The Chinese … have made it very clear that the Special Drawing Rights of the IMF is the preferred future international world reserve currency,” Middelkoop wrote in a note to clients.\n\n“What you are going to see is world money. You are going to see the IMF print Special Drawing Rights (SDR). It’s a geeky name but it’s a kind of world money printed by the IMF. They’ll flood the world with trillions of SDRs,” Rickards told the Epoch Times earlier this year.\n\nRelated Coverage China Banking Regulator Tells Banks to Evergreen Loans of Troubled Companies\n\nNow that the first issuance is well underway, it is easy to lever up the balance sheets of international development organizations and keep issuing—or printing—SDR obligations even in the trillions until even private market actors support and accept them. Once the SDR is widely accepted as payment, the IMF could just redeem all outstanding local currencies for SDR and the world would not only have a new reserve currency, but just one global currency.\n\n“You create new liquidity. That’s the kind of reform that could change the international system immediately,” says Worth Wray.\n\nWillem Middelkoop says this could be done through an IMF substitution fund, an idea already discussed in the 1970s. “This fund could facilitate a direct exchange of dollars for SDRs. The liquidity issue would be resolved with one stroke of the pen, as an SDR would be created for every dollar that was exchanged,” he wrote in his note.\n\nSounds crazy? It is, but the official plan is right here, for everyone to see.\n\nTwitter: @vxschmid",
  "latent_7014": "A look at the Winnipeg Jets schedule down the stretch\n\nThe race to the playoffs has been in full swing for quite some time as the Jets and a handful of other Western Conference teams battle it out for the final few post season spots in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Jets have just 23 games left on the schedule and we took a look at the quality of the opponents that they will face in their remaining contests.\n\nWinnipeg currently sits 5th in the West although they have played the most games (59) to date. As I said above they have 23 games left with 10 against Western teams currently in the playoffs, four against Western teams in the hunt and one against a team well out of the playoff mix. They have eight left against the Eastern Conference with five against teams in the playoffs, one against a team in the hunt and two against teams that are out.\n\nHere are the specific teams they will face and they are grouped by whether the opponent is in the playoffs, in the hunt or on the outside and already thinking about next season:\n\nWestern Conference:\n\nPlayoffs: St Louis x 4, Nashville, San Jose, Vancouver x 2, Chicago and Calgary. (10)\n\nIn the hunt: L.A., Minnesota, Colorado and Dallas. (4)\n\nOut: Edmonton. (1)\n\nEastern Conference:\n\nPlayoffs: Washington x 2, Tampa Bay, Montreal and New York (Rangers). (5)\n\nIn the hunt: Florida. (1)\n\nOut: Toronto and Ottawa. (2)\n\nIt certainly won’t be an easy schedule for Winnipeg down the stretch as they try and make the playoffs for the first time since the move to Winnipeg and just the second time in the Thrashers/Jets history.\n\nIn case you were concerned that the four teams outside the playoffs (LA, Minnesota, Dallas and Colorado) looking in will have an easier time than the Jets here is how their remaining games breakdown:\n\nL.A (26 games left) – 16 (in playoffs), 4 (in the hunt) and 6 (out);\n\nMinnesota (26 games left) – 16 (in playoffs), 4 (in the hunt) and 6 (out);\n\nDallas (26 games left) – 18 (in playoffs), 4 (in the hunt) and 4 (out);\n\nColorado (25 games left) – 13 (in playoffs), 6 (in the hunt) and 6 (out).",

  "latent_7161": "By Winifred Phillips | Contact | Follow\n\nSo happy you’ve joined us! I’m videogame composer Winifred Phillips (pictured above working on my career breakthrough project, God of War). Today I’ll be discussing a hot topic that we’ve previously explored, but that definitely deserves to be revisited periodically. This is one of the most popular subjects that I’ve addressed in my previous articles here: How does a newcomer get hired as a game composer?\n\nI’m asked this question frequently, and while I offered quite a lot of advice on this topic in my book A Composer’s Guide to Game Music, I’m keenly aware of how urgent the need is for updated guidance on this issue for aspiring video game composers. Game music newcomers often feel adrift and alone in the game industry, and some good advice can be a welcome lifeline. In my book, I described the career path that led me into the game industry and allowed me to land my first gigs, but I’m well aware that my experience was pretty unique. With that in mind, I’ve collated some recent research and insights from some top game industry professionals in this article, in the hopes that some of these expert observations might prove helpful. There are lots of original and provocative viewpoints presented here, so we should feel free to pick and choose the strategies and tips that will work best for us.\n\nAlso, later in the article you’ll find my presentation for the Society of Composers and Lyricists seminar, in which I answered the question about how I personally got my start in the games industry (for those who might be curious). Finally, at the end of the article I have included a full list of links for further reading and reference.\n\nThe Demo Reel\n\nHere’s a new topic this year: the music demo reel, otherwise known as a professional portfolio. To prepare an awesome demo reel, we game composers usually start by collecting our best music pieces and arranging them in a way that we hope will be impressive enough to arrest the attention of a potential client. If we were in a sentimental frame-of-mind, we might think of our demo reel as a fragile flower in an outstretched palm, offered up in the hopes of finding an appreciative audience. But there’s nothing about this process that’s sentimental. The demo reel is a marketing tool, and its crucial that we think of it with a sense of strategic detachment. We have a product we’re trying to sell, and our demo reel needs to act as our figurative foot in the door. So, how do we make our reels stand out from the competition so that they attract the interest of clients who might want us for a famous game franchise or an indie masterpiece?\n\nAccording to sound designer Nathan Madsen, when preparing our demo reel for review, we should put our newest work first. “Having an up to date portfolio, or even relatively up to date, really helps you be ready for sudden job opportunities,” Madsen observes. This opinion is echoed by Daniel Spreadbury (product marketing manager at Steinberg Media Technologies), who goes even further to suggest that “if you think that your talent as a composer is best displayed by the piece you’re currently working on, there is no reason that this can’t be submitted as well, as an example of a work-in-progress. While it will be incomplete, it can still be used to illustrate your creative process and your understanding of composition.” That being said, Spreadbury urges that composers turn a critical eye to their work when selecting musical candidates for their demo reel. “It’s often tempting to try and include as much of your own material as possible. In fact, it is usually far more useful to submit a carefully curated selection of your composing work, rather than everything that you’ve ever worked on. It is important to strike a delicate balance between submitting enough work that your talent and consistency are clearly demonstrated, but not so much that it overwhelms your intended audience.”\n\nAre there any considerations regarding the format of our demo reel? According to Matthew Marteinsson (sound designer at Klei Entertainment), a collection of music files may not be enough. “Have a video reel,” Marteinsson urges. “We are a medium that is the marriage of video and audio.” Marteinsson observes that when receiving an audio-only reel, he is left uncertain of the capabilities of the composer he’s evaluating. “I know you can make cool sounds, but I don’t know if you can marry them to the right visuals, so have a video reel.”\n\nHow much music should be included in our demo reels? According to Kevin Regamey (Creative Director of Power Up Audio), less is more. “What you’re making here is a teaser trailer,” he points out. For composer demo reels, Regamey suggests that a two minute time limit is a good rule of thumb. “Most reels are usually too long,” he states. “Keep in mind that you can always show longer things later on. Get them interested, and if they like your stuff they will listen to your things that are not in your main demo reel.” Regamey goes on to point out that “you need to tailor your reel to its audience. Make sure you know who is getting this reel and what they want to see.”\n\nCertainly it’s preferable to know what a prospective client is looking for, but how can we achieve this? Ariel Gross (Founder of the Audio Mentoring Project), suggests that we decide what games or franchises we’d like to be working on, and then pursue that goal. “Most of the time you don’t need to be an avid player of the specific game or franchise that you’re trying to work on, though it can be helpful,” Gross observes. “At the very least, you want to be well versed with the products. If you can’t play the game, go consume lots of gameplay videos on YouTube, read articles and reviews about the games, and look for interviews with the people that worked on it.”\n\nApart from how our music demo is constructed and targeted, timing may also be an essential consideration. “You absolutely need to have a showreel or a demo. Also, you need to have it ready before you start contacting people,” advises Will Morton (Audio Director at Solid Audioworks). “You don’t have to be carrying around a folder of CDs and DVDs with you all the time, you can have a Soundcloud account with MP3s ready to give people links to if you need to,” Morton suggests. “It is easier than ever to have your work on-line and accessible from anywhere these days.”\n\nFinally, Brian Schmidt (Founder and Executive Director of the GameSoundCon conference), suggests a novel approach. “If you want to create a demo that will really create an impression, create a ‘MOD’ for a game. A MOD is a game where some component has been altered or changed. Taking a portion of a game and swapping in your own music or sound design is a great demo,” Schmidt observes. “By creating an interactive demo (instead of just a bunch of mp3 files) you will stand out over 95 out of 100 other composers or sound designers.”\n\nThere seem to be numerous theories regarding what makes an effective demo reel, as well as many options for its format and content. But if we’re unable to get it into the hands of a potential client, it won’t be of much use. So let’s discuss how to build relationships that can open doors in the game development industry.\n\nEffective Networking\n\nBeyond having a strong music demo, we will also need to be able to make professional connections in the games industry, and that can be a bewildering task. How to begin? Perhaps the better question is not how, but when. “Your time at college is the ideal time to start networking,” advises Will Morton of Solid Audioworks. “Make friends and work with people who are doing sound design. Make friends and work with people studying composition. Make friends and work with people on game development courses. Make friends and work with people studying TV or film production. Make friends and work with people studying any kind of performing arts. This will again help you build a better body of work to use in your showreel, and arguably more importantly gives you a network of people who may at some point ask you to be involved with a project they are working on.”\n\nThis opinion is echoed by Jason W. Bay (Owner and Editor of GameIndustryCareerGuide.com). “Attending an audio school will also help to kick start your career networking,” Bay says, “because as the people in your classes graduate and then start getting jobs all over the country or even the world, they’ll become your eyes and ears inside of those companies. And they can help you spot job openings and even help you get interviews whenever the opportunities arise.” The benefits of cultivating a network of college friendships are invaluable, according to Bay. “It helps you find out about job openings before they’re posted. It increases the chances of getting a job when people inside the company already know you and trust you, so it helps you get hired.”\n\nHowever, not all of us attended colleges ripe with networking opportunities, and some of us began pursuing a game audio career many years after graduating college. What then? According to Bobby Prince (Owner of Bobby Prince Music), it’s possible to attain some of the same collegial relationships by attending educational conferences. “Go to the GDC (Game Developer’s Conference),” Prince suggests. “You can hang out in the public section of the location for the GDC and watch for miracles. They happen every second. Another great place to hang out is the local after/during hours hangouts. Keep your eyes and ears open for an opportunity. You don’t have to force an opportunity — the best ones will come to you without effort from you.”\n\nWhile such efforts may yield results, the chances are far better if we’re emotionally ready to sell ourselves to our fullest potential. Confidence is key, according to Rocky Kev of Black Shell Media. “Great game developers know they’re talented, and that confidence enhances their work. You can do the same with networking. Block out all the self doubt and act like you know what you’re doing. Fake it. You’ll be surprised how much it works.” Kev goes on to add that “powerful networkers approach conversations with curiosity, treating the speaker like they’re the most important person in the world.”\n\nOur ability to connect with people and convey our confidence and enthusiasm can be an invaluable asset. In my book, A Composer’s Guide to Game Music, I discussed how our excitement for our work can intersect with the need to exude self-discipline and restraint when developing our professional network.\n\n“As composers, we feel passionately about our jobs. This passion drives our daily workflow and inspires the creative decisions we make. Emotions such as this can be helpful to us when we’re meeting with possible clients, but only when well controlled through a disciplined and organized presentation. Some of our prospective employers may appreciate raw enthusiasm, but this sort of eagerness also has the potential to scare some people off. What we need is the ability to gracefully articulate our enthusiasm while at the same time impressing developers and publishers with our thorough professionalism.\n\n“Unfortunately, this is a skill attained only through practice. Those of us who are uncomfortable or fearful in such situations can look for opportunities to practice in a safe, consequence-free environment. For instance, helpful friends may volunteer to be an audience for us, applauding our strengths and drawing our attention to areas needing improvement.” A Composer’s Guide to Game Music, page 242.\n\nGetting the first gig\n\nEveryone’s ‘big break’ story is unique. I’m frequently asked about my own entry into the video game development industry, and there has been particular curiosity about how I landed my first game composer job. Since we’ve included the advice and insights of many other game audio professionals in the article, it seems right that I should also include my own “first job” story. It’s a pretty unusual tale, and certainly isn’t the normal way that aspiring composers break into the business. Nevertheless, it can be useful to consider how demo music preparation and networking skills helped me to get my start as a game composer. With that in mind, I’ve included a video of a Society of Composers and Lyricists seminar, in which I tell my story of how I got my start as a game composer:\n\nThe List\n\nFinally, here’s the full list of links to resources that may help a newcomer trying to break into the business. Some of these links were the source of the quotes we discussed earlier in this article.

  "latent_7185": "As long as bicycles have existed, those who wish to steal said bicycles have found new and inventive ways to get around whatever locking mechanisms are put in place to keep them safe. As a result, lock manufacturers have to come up with new ways to ensure their products do what they're supposed to: keep the locked bike from being stolen. Among all the different designs, the U-style lock has widely been adopted as the best and overall strongest.\n\nOf course, all bike locks have a common issue: the lock itself. Not only are locks pick-able, but keys can be lost (or stolen), essentially making the lock itself useless. Enter new Kickstarter project BitLock that looks to change the way bike locks work. In short, BitLock wants you to ditch keys and start unlocking your bike with something that's far less likely to ever leave your side: your phone.\n\nIn the same way that Lockitron wants to modernized home locking systems, BitLock looks to bring many new and innovative features to bicycle protection. As shown in the above video, BitLock will use your Bluetooth-connected cell phone as proximity sensor and allow you to unlock it with the press of a button. While this is what I feel is the core feature of BitLock, it has a lot more to offer – like a simple and easy way to share your bike with friends.\n\nThe BitLock app will allow users to control who has access to their bike (and when), and allows those privileges to be revoked at any given moment. It will also log the location of the bike every time it's locked/unlocked, so you always know where your wheels are. At the current time, the app is compatible with the iPhone 4 and above, as well as a handful of modern Android devices: Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Note 3; HTC One, Droid DNA, EVO (assuming this is the EVO LTE, though the BitLock page doesn't specify); Motorola Droid RAZR/MAXX/M, Moto X; and the Nexus 4 and upcoming 5. It's probably safe to assume that support for more devices will be coming as the project progresses, but that's definitely a good start as it covers the bulk of popular devices right out of the gate.\n\nThe app doesn't just stop at lock functionality, either – it also tracks valuable data normally found within cyclometers or fitness tracking apps, including distance traveled, average speed, total moving time, elevation, estimated caloric burn, and even the amount of CO2 emissions saved from cycling instead of driving a vehicle. This essentially eliminates the need for multiple applications. One app that controls basically all of your biking needs – that's something I can get behind.\n\nOf course, the lock's strength is also a concern for many users – what's the point in having a fancy lock if it can just be hacked off easily? According to the Kickstarter page, BitLock is both hacksaw- and bolt cutter-proof, as it's made from \"reinforced, heat-treated, and cut-resistant steel.\" All the security isn't just found in the metal, either – the app uses bank-level encryption to ensure it's not something that can easily be \"hacked\" from another Bluetooth device.\n\nAny time something is modernized and digital tools come into play, there's another concern: battery life. According to the BitLock crew, the battery inside the lock can last an astounding five years without ever having to be replaced. That's pretty incredible.\n\nSpeaking of battery, should your phone's battery die (or worse, the device be lost or stolen), BitLock generates a 16-digit binary code (which happens when the lock is initially set up) that can be used to unlock the device via a second button. You can also borrow someone else's phone, log into your BitLock account, and unlock the unit that way. So you're not completely out of luck.\n\nCurrently BitLock has received nearly $45,000 of its $120,000 goal, but it still has 27 days to go. There are, of course, several different pledge levels, but if you want to ensure a BitLock for yourself, it'll set you back $99. The units are expected to ship in July of '14 should the project get all its funding. For more information or to donate to the project, check out the Kickstarter page.",

Dion can’t stay out of trouble. Tommy can’t move past it. For two friends on the brink of losing everything, a dusty pipe dream of opening up an upscale restaurant in their hometown of the Bronx is all they have left to turn their lives around. They push one another to follow through on their dreams, welcome love into their lives and overcome their demons.\n\nThey also betray, backstab, manipulate and coerce each other into the most dangerous situations imaginable. For Tommy, a successful haute Hellenic restaurant is his means to give his son a life he never had. For Dion, this venture is a perfect opportunity to secretly repay his debt to the mob. Together, they take on the insanity of the New York restaurant world and navigate its underbelly of petty criminals, corrupt officials and violent mobsters.\n\nAdditional series castings include Mad Men alum Michael Gladis as Patrick Woichik, aka The Tooth Fairy, the soft-spoken, brutally intimidating local mobster with a penchant for pulling teeth; Lorenza Izzo (Hemlock Grove), who will play Pilar Herrera, a woman who meets Tommy in a grief group and is desperately searching for true love; Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. grad Christine Adams, who will portray Tommy’s late wife Rie Moran; The Wire's John Doman, who will play Tommy’s father Aidan Moran, a ruthless businessman and unapologetic racist; and Elijah Jacob (Spot On), who is set as Tommy’s 10-year-old son TJ Moran.\n\nBased on the Danish series Bankerot created by Kim Fupz Aakeson and produced by DR Broadcasting, Feed the Beast hails from Lionsgate TV, where Dexter and Nurse Jackie alum Phillips has an overall deal, and AMC Studios. Phillips will executive produce alongside original Bankerot producers Henrik Ruben Genz and Malene Blenkov as well as Piv Bernth (The Killing). The series marks the latest Danish adaptation at AMC, following its remake of Forbrydelsen, which became The Killing and ran for three seasons on the cabler before closing out at Netflix.\n\nFor Schwimmer, the role marks his latest TV foray following American Crime Story and 2014 ABC comedy pilot Irreversible, which did not move forward.\n\n\"David and Jim are each incredibly talented actors whose careers span theater, film and television. But more importantly, they both possess an inherent honesty and vulnerability in their craft, which are essential in the flawed characters of Tommy and Dion,” said showrunner Phillips. “Their grasp of the story, and their respective characters’ journeys, is something I’m very eager to dive into with them.”\n\nSchwimmer is repped by Gersh; Sturgess is with CAA.

  "latent_7310": "Australia is a microcosm of the dilemma the world faces over climate change as the Australian government, businesses and the general public grapple with the tensions, conflicts and complexities that surround the issue.\n\nThis article was originally published on http://hagainitiativet.se/\n\nExtreme weather events made world news in January when the Australian Open Tennis Tournament was suspended due to excessive heat. But extreme weather has far more serious consequences.\n\nIn 2009 over 500 Australians died in a savage heatwave and massive bushfires in Melbourne and the surrounding area. In 2010, about 78% of the state of Queensland – an area larger than Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark combined – was flooded, with damages of at least AUD 5 billion.\n\nThe summer of 2012/2013 saw an astounding 123 extreme weather records, many of them due to extreme heat, set across the country. A massive heatwave covered over 70% of the continent for over two weeks.\n\nThe most recent summer – December 2013 through February 2014 – was even worse. Over 150 extreme weather records were set across Australia, again many of them associated with extreme heat. And the science pointing to the influence of climate change on extreme weather events has become even stronger.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia’s large coal mining sector is set to expand its exports even further, aided by both the federal and state governments. New port facilities for the state of Queensland, where many of the prospective new coal mines are located, have now been approved.\n\nOffshore from the prospective new coal mines lies the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest ecosystem and the biggest economic asset in Queensland. The science is absolutely clear about the threats that burning coal pose for the Reef, both through warming that bleaches the corals and increasing ocean acidity that corrodes them. Over the past 30 years, about half of the Reef’s coral cover has disappeared.\n\nAustralia’s coal industry is also facing challenges of an economic nature. Once the dominant fuel for the country’s electricity generation sector, renewable energy is now mounting a major challenge. Over 1.2 million Australian homes, about 10% of all homes in the country, now have solar photovoltaic cells on their roofs. The number is growing rapidly.\n\nBoth solar and wind are now competitive with fossil fuels in terms of cost. Projections for additional generation capacity out to 2020 show renewable energy gaining ascendancy, with no new fossil fuel generation planned.\n\nYet Australian society remains deeply divided. The new government appears to be backing the fossil fuel industry and slowing or stalling the rapidly growing renewable energy sector.\n\nUnless Australia braces the changes that now seem inevitable, the country is in for a very rough ride – divisive politics, increasingly risky investments, a costly and disruptive economic transition, and significant environmental damage. Can the rest of the world do better?",

Truly great.\" \"Make no mistake, when Gaga is in South Korea, she'll wear clothes with Japanese and the Rising Sun!\" \"She probably just thinks those characters are a symbol. No biggie.\" \"Waaah. This certainly makes her less cool.\" \"You net users are something else!\"\n\nUm... There's a lot to unpack here! First, yes, 2ch tends to bend a bit conservative, so know that. Also, Japan and South Korea are not on the best of terms right now, so a foreigner decked in out in Korean letters actually might ruffle some feathers—the same might be true if Gaga wore Japanese characters in South Korea. Who knows. Maybe, maybe not. Though, Korean television did recently ban a Kpop group from using Japanese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd finally, people in Japan don't want to be confused with people in Korea—and Korean people don't want to be confused with Japanese people. They are different countries! With different cultures and traditions. Obviously, an outfit like this can unintentionally give the impression that one thinks all Asians are the same.\n\nThis was probably unintentional. An honest mistake. I'm sure Lady Gaga is well aware that both South Korea and Japan are entirely different countries. With the way relations between the two countries have been wound up of late, a little bit more care might be needed.\n\n来日のレディガガ、ハングル文字の服で六本木徘徊！白人目線で日本も韓国も同じ現実判明へ [2ch]\n\nTop photo: Lady Gaga\n\nTo contact the author of this post, write to bashcraftATkotaku.com or find him on Twitter @Brian_Ashcraft.\n\nAdvertisement",
  "latent_7507": "Whether the Cuban sandwich hails from Cuba or Florida is up for debate. What's indisputable is that these pressed sandwiches, packed with roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles, are worth fighting over.\n\nGet the Recipe Cuban Sandwiches\n\nMore Sandwiches Tips and tricks for making the best sandwiches at home.\n\nWhen life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. When Past You gives Present You leftover Cuban roast pork, first you drink a toast to Past You for the generosity and forethought (a mojito is both thematically and gustatorily appropriate), then you pay it forward by making a Cubano sandwich for Future You.\n\nDon't worry: Once you have that pork (thanks, Past Me, for doing all the hard work!), the rest of the sandwich is exceedingly simple to make. It's not much more than a gussied-up ham and cheese toastie, though saying that discredits it. It's more than just another ham and cheese. It is the unchallenged champion of ham and cheese sandwiches. El rey de jamón y queso. El tigre numero uno. A ham and cheese sandwich so far elevated by pickles, roast pork, and mustard that it almost transcends the genre.\n\nWhere Was the Cuban Sandwich Invented?\n\nSome folks claim that the sandwich originated in Cuba and eventually made its way to the States, but from my reading, it seems far more likely that the Cuban mixto sandwich emerged in the mid-19th century to feed cigar- and sugar-factory workers in Key West, Ybor City, and Tampa. Our article on the history of the Cubano comes to a similar conclusion. As Tom Scherberger reports for Florida's tourism board, records of Cuban sandwiches go back to well before Miami even registered on the map as a real city, though it's less clear when toasting the sandwiches in a press—to my mind, an essential part of what makes a Cubano a Cubano—became the norm. Perhaps Miami may have some claim to that particular innovation?\n\nAs with the cassoulet of southern France, a dish with equally contentious origin-story rivalries, I find it best to just observe these feuds from afar, enjoying the delicious fallout of the debates rather than taking sides.\n\nCuban Sandwich Ingredients\n\nThe easy part is collecting the extra ingredients. I use honey ham sliced from the deli (any sort of sweet ham will do—you want that sweetness to contrast with the savory roasted pork), along with deli Swiss cheese slices and dill pickles, which I slice by hand very thinly lengthwise. This is a case in which hand-slicing will give you superior results to the typically-too-thick-for-a-Cubano slices that you get in jars. You want that pickle to really meld with the other ingredients.\n\nFor the bread, ideally you want to get a real Cuban loaf. The bread is typically a white, European-style long loaf made with a good amount of lard added to the dough, which gives it a subtle flavor and a distinct softness, allowing it to crisp up nicely without getting so hard that it rips up your gums as you bite into it. Your best bet is to look for a local Latin bakery. Even if they don't specifically make Cuban bread, I've found that most Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican bakeries will have something similar. If all you've got is a standard North American supermarket, so-called soft \"French\" or \"Italian\" bread or a not-too-crusty ciabatta is the way to go. Skip fancy artisan baguettes and the like—they'll be too tough.\n\nTo construct my sandwich, I start by spreading a moistening layer of mustard over each bread half. Next, I layer the halves with cheese. It's important to have cheese on both sides—it is the mortar that holds the sandwich together.\n\nHere's where the real Tampa-versus-Miami debate occurs. See, aside from Cuban immigrants, Tampa was also home to many Italian immigrants, and as the two cultures met, so did their foods. Eventually, Genoa-style salami became a staple ingredient in Tampa-style Cubanos. Folks on Twitter were quite rambunctious when I asked about the legitimacy of salami on a Cuban sandwich, with 34% declaring \"no way!\" (my guess: all Miami residents and visitors) and 54% saying that it \"sounds weird but I dig it.\" Presumably the 12% of people who voted \"of course\" are from Tampa.\n\nAh, the tyranny of the masses in action.\n\nI won't force your hand either way, but personally, having tried both side by side, I gotta go with Tampa on this one. Cubanos made with salami are downright delicious, with the salami adding a little funk to the sweet-savory pork situation. Either way, when you're done layering give he sandwiches a gentle press with your hand to make sure that nothing is gonna slip or slide when you get to the real pressing.\n\nHow to Press Cuban Sandwiches\n\nTo press the sandwich, there are a couple of options. If you have a panini press with either flat or ridged plates, by all means break it out and use it, after greasing it with butter, of course. (And don't take any guff from someone who tells you that a Cuban sandwich must be pressed on a flat plancha, not a ridged panini press. The ridges make it extra crispy and delicious, despite its inauthenticity.)\n\nAt the Serious Eats office, we have a Cuisinart Griddler, which offers both flat and ridged plates to work with. It's definitely convenient if you make a lot of hot sandwiches, but for most folks, it'll wind up taking up shelf space most of the time.\n\nIf you don't have a press, just form a makeshift one with a couple of hot surfaces. I'm using my Mini Baking Steel Griddle here, along with a cast iron pan to weigh the sandwich down (you'll have to flip the sandwich halfway through cooking). But two cast iron pans works fine, as does a stainless steel pan, a Teflon pan—heck, even a waffle iron or a clothes iron can double as a sandwich-toasting implement.*\n\n* Pro tip: Going on a staycation? Construct Cubanos, butter lightly on the exterior, then wrap them in aluminum foil. When you get to your hotel, iron those sandwiches for about seven minutes on each side, unwrap, and enjoy your hot, crispy sandwich. This is the reason I used to keep an iron in my desk drawer during the short period of my life in which I had an office job.\n\nPushing quite hard is key here. The bread should compress down to about a third of its original volume, and all of the internal ingredients should meld. Just don't push so hard that mustard and juices squeeze out and make the bread soggy.\n\nI hope you bought an extra-long loaf, because these sandwiches ain't gonna stop until the pork runs out.**\n\n** \"Ain't Gonna Stop Till the Pork Runs Out\" is, coincidentally, the title of the fourth track of the album of kids' songs I'm working on. We started with the title and are building the song around it.\n\nGet the Recipe Cuban Sandwiches View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

  "latent_7559": "Do you know your acetate from a hole in the ground? Your gussets from your grommets? If not, here's a list of the more commonly used textile words and terms that you'll see in our catalog. For more information or clarification, you can call us at: 1-800-882-4323\n\nACETATE - A manufactured fiber that uses cellulose refined from cotton and/or wood pulp. Characteristics: fast drying, wrinkle- and shrinkage-resistant, crisp or soft depending on end use, luxurious in appearance.\n\nACRYLIC - A manufactured fiber made from long-chain synthetic polymers. Characteristics: wrinkle resistance; low moisture absorbency and quick-drying; provides warmth yet lightweight, soft and resilient.\n\nALPACA - The fleece from an Alpaca, a cousin to the llama. Alpaca fleece is similar in characteristics to wool, but softer, silkier and more lustrous.\n\nBANDED COLLAR - A shirt without a fold-over collar; there is only the band at the neck.\n\nBARTACK - A close series of stitches crossing a piece of cloth in order to reinforce at a point of concentrated strain (e.g. belt loop or patch pocket corner).\n\nBASKET WEAVE - A variation of the plain weave in which two or more threads weave alike in both warp (down) and filling (across) directions, joined in the regular order of the plain weave. So named for the basket-like pattern of the weave.\n\nBATIK - A method of resist dyeing which employs wax as the resist. The pattern is covered with wax, and the fabric is then dyed: the wax patterns will not take the dye. The wax is removed after dyeing by boiling the fabric or applying solvent. The fabric is often streaked where the dye has gone through cracks in the wax. Batik dyeing originated in Indonesia.\n\nBESOM - A narrow piece of fabric that works as an edging on a pocket; can be single besom, one side of pocket opening or double besom, both sides.\n\nBOX PLEAT - Two small, back to back outward facing pleats that have a box- like appearance. On shirts, box pleats are positioned in the center back at the bottom of the yoke to allow ease of movement in the shoulders and arms.\n\nBROADCLOTH - A fine, closely woven, lustrous cotton or cotton/poly blend made in plain weave with a fine rib in the direction of the filling (across). The filling yarn is heavier and has less twist than the warp yarn (down). The cloth is usually mercerized, and has a soft, firm finish.\n\nBRUSHING - A finishing process for woven or knit fabrics in which brushes or other abrading elements are used to raise a nap (a fuzzy or downy surface). Brushed fabrics have a soft, slightly weathered, broken-in feel.\n\nBUTTON-DOWN COLLAR - Having buttonholes on the collar points so they fasten to the shirt.\n\nCAMP COLLAR - A one-piece collar that lays flat, part of the shirt also lays flat to create a notch. Also called a Convertible Collar or Notched Collar.\n\nCANVAS - A general classification of strong, firm, closely woven fabrics usually made with cotton. A heavier, open weave comprised of plied yarns (a number of single yarns, usually three, twisted together). Characteristics: very hard-wearing, generally water-resistant.\n\nCASHMERE - The fleece that comes from a Cashmere goat. These animals roam at high elevations (10,000 - 15,000 ft.), hence their very warm, soft fleece. Garments made with cashmere are normally more expensive because of limited yield (one goat produces only 4 ounces of fleece a year).\n\nCHAMBRAY - A general class of plain weave, usually cotton, made with a colored warp (down) and white filling (across). Most often made using blue and white, but also available in stripes, checks and figured patterns.\n\nCOMBING - The removal of short fibers or noils from material so that the resulting yarn be composed of larger fibers. The comb straightens and arranges them in parallel order.\n\nCORDUROY - A strong, durable fabric with cotton ground and vertical cut-pile stripes (wales) formed by an extra system of filling yarns. The foundation of the fabric can be either a plain or twill weave. Of all cotton fabrics, corduroy is the warmest because its wales form an insulated cushion of air.\n\nCOTTON - A vegetable fiber consisting of unicellular hairs attached to the seed of the cotton plant. The normal color of cotton is light to dark cream, and its chemical composition is almost pure cellulose. A distinct feature of the mature fiber is its spirality or twist. In fabrics, cotton makes for strong, versatile, cool-wearing and comfortable garments.\n\nCREPE - A general classification of fabric characterized by a broad range of crinkled or gained surface effects. Methods of making crepe include the use of hard twisted yarns, special chemical treatment, special weaves and embossing.\n\nDART - A tuck in the fabric that is sewn. It is used to define the shape of a garment making a two dimensional piece of fabric into a three-dimensional garment. Darts are usually seen where the body curves: bust, waist, hip.\n\nDENIM - A well-known basic cotton or blended fabric in a right- or left-hand woven twill. Generally, the warp (down) is dyed blue with a white filling (across). Also called \"dungaree.\"\n\nDOBBY - A general term for a fabric woven on a special dobby loom, which allows the weaving of small, geometric figures. These patterns are beyond the range of simple looms, yet too limited to be produced economically by Jacquard loom. A dobby weave can be distinguished from a plain weave by its more ornate and intricate woven appearance.\n\nFLANNEL - Generally, a cotton or wool fabric, napped on one or both sides (usually both), then bleached, dyed or printed, and brushed or rerun through the napping machine to revive the nap. Flannel fabrics are very soft and cozy.\n\nFLEECE - 1). A heavy napped surface, most often in knit goods, made with a heavy and soft-spun back yarn, which is napped in finishing (e.g. the inside surface of a sweatshirt). 2). Wool sheared from sheep or other animals in the wool class. The term is especially used for the entire coat of wool shorn from the sheep at one time; it is generally taken off the animal in one piece.\n\nGARMENT DYEING - The garment is first produced, then the complete garment is dyed.\n\nGARMENT WASH - The garment is constructed and then washed to soften the fabric and minimize shrinkage.\n\nGAUGE - A measurement used in knitted garments that reflects the size of the needles used to knit the garment. The larger the gauge, the smaller the needle - therefore, the finer the knit.\n\nGORE - Vertical panels in a skirt or dress; enhances the fit of a garment.\n\nGROMMET - Little air holes reinforced with metal ring, usually on jackets, hats or shoes to allow ventilation.\n\nGROSGRAIN - A firm, closely woven, ribbed fabric. It has a dressy appearance and is used for ribbons, neckties, hatbands and trimmings.\n\nGUSSET - A triangular piece of fabric inserted into a garment to improve the fit or for reinforcement (e.g. on the sleeve of a jacket under the arm to allow for extra layering).\n\nHERRINGBONE TWILL - A broken twill weave composed of vertical sections which are alternately right hand and left hand in direction, resembling the vertebral structure of the herring (zigzag). The twill changes direction perfectly where the weave breaks, balancing the overall pattern of the fabric.\n\nHOLLYWOOD WAISTBAND - The waistband is the same piece of fabric as the rest of the garment. Advantages are that it has a smooth silhouette making the transition from hip to waist more gradual.\n\nJACQUARD - A system of weaving which, because of a pattern-making mechanism of great versatility, permits the production of very ornate, complex woven designs. This type of weaving is used for tapestry, figured necktie and dress fabric, and figured patterns on knit goods (sweaters).\n\nJERSEY - A generic term for a plain knitted fabric; its principal distinction is that it is not a fabric with a distinct rib (e.g. T-shirt fabric).\n\nKNIT - Knit fabrics are made up of a series of interlocking loops that result in a flexible construction. All knits have some stretch.\n\nLINEN - One of the oldest textile fibers known. Though the fiber and the fabric are both commonly known as linen, it is actually flax, the fiber of the Linum plant. Linen is generally favored for its fine, strong, cool-wearing properties. It drapes away from the skin rather than clinging to it. In knitwear, linen is combined with other natural or synthetic fibers for improved strength and resiliency.\n\nMERCERIZATION - A treatment of cotton yarn or fabric to increase its luster. Its affinity for dyes is also enhanced. In the process, the material is immersed under tension in a sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) solution. This later is neutralized in acid. The process causes a permanent swelling of the fiber, thus increasing its luster.\n\nNYLON - The generic term for man-made fibers composed of polyamides derived from coal and petroleum. Characteristics: high strength, elasticity, low water absorption and quick-drying.\n\nOMBRE - A color effect woven into the fabric that has gradual changes in shade from light to dark, generally produced by arranging different tones in the warp.\n\nPIGMENT DYEING - A process in which a specific type of dye is applied to the surface of a fabric, then after one washing it fades into a softer color. The color will slowly continue to fade with age. Pigment dyed products from Territory Ahead are prewashed and will not harm other garments during washing after they've been washed once.\n\nPLACKET - An opening with fabric piecing and buttons or snaps on a garment that facilitates dressing. Plackets can be at the neck of a shirt, the cuff of a sleeve, or the waist of a skirt or pair of pants.\n\nPLEATS - Small tucks in clothing to allow for extra room and ease of movement. Pleats can be seen at the waist of pants or skirts, the cuff of a sleeve, the waist or bust area of a blouse or dress.\n\nPOLYESTER - A manufactured fiber made from long-chain synthetic polymers. Characteristics: crease-resistance, quick-drying, great shape retention, high strength, abrasion resistance and easy care.\n\nPRINTING - Applying color(s) in definite, repeated patterns of fabric by any one of a number of printing methods. Color is deposited in thick paste form and treated with steam or chemicals to cause it to migrate into or adhere to textile material. The design is not woven into the cloth but stamped in after the cloth is woven or knit.\n\nRAMIE - A strong, soft fiber yielded by the inner bark of the Ramie plant. The fiber is white, soft, lustrous and slightly coarser than flax (linen) when degummed and bleached. Ramie fabrics are strong, smooth and durable.\n\nRAYON - A generic term for man-made fibers composed of regenerated cellulose derived from trees, cotton and woody plants. Characteristics: high absorbency, bright or dull luster, pleasant feel or hand, good draping qualities, ability to be dyed in brilliant colors and superior strength.\n\nREACTIVE DYE - A type of dye that completely saturates the fabric for a long lasting color.\n\nRIB KNIT - A double-knit fabric in which the rib wales or vertical rows of stitches intermesh alternatively on the face and the back of the fabric. Rib knit fabrics have good elasticity and shape retention, especially in the width.\n\nRISE - The measurement on pants from the front waist between the legs up to the back waist. This refers to how high or low a pant will ride (i.e. \"short-waist\" or \"long-waist\")\n\nSANDBLASTING - The garment is literally sandblasted for a worn-in look; fabric has to be very durable to withstand the abuse, usually 14 oz. denim for jeans.\n\nSANDWASH - Sand is put into the industrial wash for a softened feel and texture for the garment.\n\nSHIRTTAIL HEM - The curved bottom hem of a shirt - higher on the side hip area (for ease of movement) dipping low in the front and back (so that the shirt will stay tucked into pants).\n\nSILK - Continuous protein filament produced by the larvae of various insects, especially the caterpillar when constructing its cocoon. The chief portion of commercial silk is produced in Japan and China. Characteristics: resiliency, aesthetics, elasticity and strength, warm in winter, cool in summer.\n\nSLUB - A lump or thick place on yarn caused by small lengths of yarn adhering to it during the spinning process. This adds a random texture to the fabric when the yarn is woven or knit into a garment.\n\nSPREAD COLLAR - An open collar with no buttons to hold the collar points to the shirt. Spread collars have two pieces: the fold over collar part and the stand that keeps the collar close to the neck.\n\nSTANDARD WAISTBAND - An extra piece of fabric that is sewn to the body of the pants, shorts or skirt.\n\nTENCEL - A cellulosic fiber produced by Courtaulds, spun from an amine oxide solvent that offers a higher degree of polymerization than is available with rayon. Characteristics: pleasant feel or hand, good draping qualities, ability to be dyed in brilliant colors, superior strength, and easy care.\n\nVENTED BOTTOM - The bottom hem of a shirt that is cut straight with side slits to allow ease of movement. Vents are usually 2\" deep.\n\nWALE - In woven fabric, one series of ribs, cords, or raised portions. In corduroy fabric, wales per inch are counted to distinguish broad- from fine-textured cloth. The higher the wale number, the finer the texture of the fabric.\n\nWEIGHT OF CLOTH (OZ.) - A description or classification of many fabrics by weight per yard.\n\nWELT - A piece of fabric that works as an edging on a pocket; usually a single welt and wider than a besom.\n\nWOOL - Primarily the fleece of a sheep or lamb - but can also refer to fleece of the alpaca, angora, cashmere goat, camel and vicuna. The fiber is distinguished from hair by the character of its covering: minute overlapping scales, which give it a felting property. Characteristics: strong and resilient, soft and warm, wicks away moisture and dyes well for rich coloration.\n\nWOVEN - Woven fabrics are produced by the interlacing of yarns. Each filling yarn goes alternately over and under each warp yarn.\n\nYARN-DYEING - Dyeing of individual yarns before weaving or knitting. Compared to garment dyes or prints, yarn-dyed fabrics boast richer, longer lasting color.\n\nYOKE - An added section of fabric in a shirt or pants that enhances the fit. On a shirt, the yoke is usually on the back across the top shoulder area but can also be on the front shoulder to chest area. On pants, it is generally on the back of jeans-style pants located below the waistband.",
  "latent_7564": "1.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nThe American Dream is being systematically destroyed right in front of our eyes and most Americans don’t even realize what is happening. In the old days, if you were a hard worker and you played by the rules you could always find a good job. That good job would enable you to buy a house, buy at least one car and support a family. It would also enable you to take a couple of vacations each year and buy some nice things for your family. After working for 30 or 40 years you would look forward to a comfortable retirement. But these days fewer and fewer Americans are able to enjoy the American Dream. Once upon a time, the United States had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the history of the world, but now that is changing at a breathtaking pace. Our economy is not producing nearly enough jobs for all of us anymore, and an increasing percentage of the jobs that are being produced pay 10 dollars an hour or less. The cost of living continues to rise steadily every single year while wages do not. Close to half of all American workers are living month to month, and many American families have gone deep into debt as they struggle to pay the bills. Millions more Americans are falling into poverty each year and dependence on the government is at an all-time high. Something is fundamentally wrong with our economy. It is not working the way that it used to, and the middle class is being absolutely shredded. Most American families are finding it harder and harder to make it through each passing year, and unless a miracle happens things are going to continue to get even harder.\n\nThe following are 22 statistics that prove that the American Dream is being systematically destroyed….\n\n#1 As the economy has declined, the number of Americans living month to month has soared. At this point, millions upon millions of Americans are living without any financial cushion whatsoever. If you can believe it, one recent survey found that 28 percent of all Americans do not have a single penny saved for emergencies. Another survey found that 42 percent of all American workers are currently living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n#2 Thanks to horribly oppressive regulations, red tape and taxes, it is incredibly difficult to run a successful small business in America today. According to the Christian Science Monitor, more than half of all small business owners in America cannot even afford to put food on the table from their small business earnings….\n\nA shocking figure from the Wave survey relates to how well the business owners were able to meet their basic needs through their business. An incredible 52% of American small business owners can’t put food on the table through the earnings from their business over the past twelve months.\n\nAnother recent survey found that 23 percent of all small business owners have gone an entire year without pay.\n\n#3 In recent years U.S. families have experienced an astounding decline in wealth. According to the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of families in the United States declined “from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010“.\n\n#4 The U.S. economy is not producing nearly enough jobs for all of us at this point. For example, it was reported that 20,000 people applied for just 877 jobs at a Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Alabama earlier this year. Sadly, the official U.S. unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for 40 months in a row, and this is supposed to be “the recovery”.\n\n#5 Eight million Americans have “left the labor force” since the recession supposedly ended. If those Americans were added back into the unemployment figures, the unemployment rate would be somewhere up around 12 percent.\n\n#6 Corporate profits as a percentage of GDP are at an all-time high. Meanwhile, wages as a percentage of GDP are near an all-time low.\n\n#7 The United States was once ranked #1 in the world in GDP per capita. Today we have slipped to #12.\n\n#8 Just paying for the basics is becoming increasingly difficult for many Americans. For example, there are now 20.2 million Americans that spend more than half of their incomes on housing. That represents a 46 percent increase from 2001.\n\n#9 The average American household spent approximately $4,155 on gasoline during 2011, and electricity bills in the U.S. have risen faster than the overall rate of inflation for five years in a row.\n\n#10 Health insurance continues to become more expensive. Health insurance costs have risen by 23 percent since Barack Obama became president. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, health care costs accounted for just 9.5% of all personal consumption back in 1980. Today they account for approximately 16.3%.\n\n#11 As the cost of living goes up, wages continue to stagnate or even fall in many areas of the country. Sadly, this is part of a long-term trend. According to one study, between 1969 and 2009 the median wages earned by American men between the ages of 30 and 50 declined by 27 percent after you account for inflation.\n\n#12 The percentage of low paying jobs just continues to increase. At this point, one out of every four American workers has a job that pays $10 an hour or less. If that sounds like a high figure, that is because it is. Today, the United States actually has a higher percentage of workers doing low wage work than any other major industrialized nation does.\n\n#13 Over the last several decades, the debt burdens being taken on by average Americans have absolutely exploded. All of this debt is making things incredibly difficult on American families. The following is from a recent CNN article….\n\nIn 1983, the bottom 95% had 62 cents of debt for every dollar they earned, according to research by two International Monetary Fund economists. But by 2007, the ratio had soared to $1.48 of debt for every $1 in earnings.\n\n#14 During this time of the year, there are large numbers of new college graduates entering the work force. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough jobs for all of them. In fact, approximately 53 percent of all U.S. college graduates under the age of 25 were either unemployed or underemployed last year.\n\n#15 Many young adults have found that they can’t make it on their own at all in this economy. Today, approximately 25 million American adults are living with their parents.\n\n#16 Wealth in this country is becoming highly concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Today, the wealthiest 1 percent of all Americans own more wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined.\n\n#17 Increasingly, our country is being divided into “two Americas“. According to Forbes, the 400 wealthiest Americans now have more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans combined.\n\n#18 The rise in poverty is hitting children particularly hard. If you can believe it, the poverty rate for children living in the United States is now 22 percent. Large numbers of children in this country would go hungry without assistance. At this point, approximately one-fourth of all American children are enrolled in the food stamp program.\n\n#19 The more money the government spends on poverty, the more poverty seems to increase. The federal government spent about 80 billion dollars on the food stamp program last year, but they can’t even tell us how that money is being spent.\n\n#20 While Barack Obama has been president, the number of Americans on food stamps has increased from 32 million to 46 million. But the Obama administration has decided that is not enough so they are spending taxpayer money on ads that will encourage even more Americans to go on food stamps….\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has been running radio ads for the past four months encouraging those eligible to enroll. The campaign is targeted at the elderly, working poor, the unemployed and Hispanics. The department is spending between $2.5 million and $3 million on paid spots, and free public service announcements are also airing. The campaign can be heard in California, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, and the New York metro area.\n\n#21 As the middle class shrinks, the ranks of the poor continue to expand. Sadly, at this point 48 percent of all Americans are either considered to be “low income” or are living in poverty.\n\n#22 More Americans are becoming dependent on the government than ever before.

  "latent_7578": "PALO ALTO, California (Reuters) - Revelations about the scale of U.S. spying on the Internet have badly damaged the country’s negotiating power in international talks on cyberspace regulation and law enforcement, analysts and industry leaders said at a conference on Tuesday.\n\nAn undated aerial handout photo shows the National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters building in Fort Meade, Maryland. REUTERS/NSA/Handout via Reuters\n\nDisclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about the vast scale of the intelligence agency’s data collection also are undermining U.S. efforts to maintain the Internet as an entity loosely governed by a mix of national, private and nonprofit forces.\n\n“We’re losing leverage internationally” to China, Russia and other countries that want to give more authority to the United Nations and governments, Hoover Institution professor Abe Sofaer said at the fourth annual meeting on international cybersecurity cooperation held by the EastWest Institute. “It’s terrible.”\n\nChina’s Minister of the State Council Information Office, Cai Mingzhao, in a speech advocated a greater role for the UN Group of Governmental Experts and said the discussion of rules of conduct, which the United States has sought to keep general and nonbinding, should move to the United Nations as well.\n\n“We should, step by step, create a fair and transparent mechanism for the governance of cyberspace,” Cai said.\n\nU.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyber Issues Chris Painter responded with the U.S. position that private companies and other non-government organizations who have been key to the Internet’s growth would be undercut if the U.N. were given exclusive power.\n\nThe conference at Stanford University drew senior officials, academics and corporate officers from more than 40 countries who are working through the EastWest Institute on systems for improving collaboration on Internet security issues.\n\nBut on some of the biggest issues, including the appropriate role for international bodies and privacy rights, U.S. officials were on the defensive even from their European counterparts and American company representatives, who said the loss of trust by Internet users and possible Balkanization of the Internet’s technological rules could erode economic growth.\n\nMicrosoft Corp Vice President Scott Charney, for one, said the software powerhouse was committed to protecting its users from privacy attacks by all countries and that when one nation attacks another through security holes in its products, he doesn’t want either side to win. “I’m not on your side,” Charney said. “I’m neutral.”\n\nSnowden’s documents have cast a harsh light on practices at Microsoft, Google Inc, Facebook Inc and other internet companies. Spy agencies use secret court orders to force the corporations to turn over records on thousands of users overseas. In addition, former federal agents say they can find ways to break into Microsoft’s Windows operating system.\n\nCharney urged the United States to disclose far more about what information it collects and what happens to that data. “Companies and governments need to be more transparent” for trust to be restored, he said.\n\nChina’s Cai cited needs for privacy and for transparency, echoing the language of those in other countries outraged by Snowden’s disclosures.\n\nHe said cybercrime was a major and growing problem within China, with 8 million servers compromised from overseas through August of this year, up 14% from the same period last year.\n\nSofaer, a former State Department legal advisor, said that the United States should follow the same pattern as it did with biological weapons, where it abandoned resistance to international treaties when it became clear that there was no other way to deal with the problem.\n\nHe said the United States should support a consensus approach, instead of a majority vote of nations, and do more to beef up such neutral standards bodies as the Internet Engineering Task Force before the U.N. demands more control.",
  "latent_7856": "Two weeks ago, I wondered why the government wasn’t using its own analysis to justify its proposal for an EI hiring credit—even after the parliamentary budget officer projected that the $550-million measure would create just 800 jobs, the government continued to defer to the analysis of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, an industry association that represents the businesses the credit is supposed to assist.\n\nA day later, we found out that while the government did conduct some kind of its own analysis of its own policy, it apparently hadn’t gone so far as to estimate how many jobs would be created by a policy that was touted as a job-creating measure.\n\nThat brings us to yesterday afternoon, when Finance Minister Joe Oliver appeared before the finance committee to testify about the government’s latest budget bill.\n\nThere, Oliver explained that the government had relied on the analysis of the CFIB. We know from the previous appearance of a finance official that the Finance Department has not analyzed the methodology behind that analysis. Nor has it analyzed the PBO’s methodology. Nor it seems, from Oliver’s testimony, has the government analyzed why the PBO and the CFIB arrived at different estimates.\n\nHere, first, is my transcript of the most relevant portions of yesterday’s exchanges between Oliver and the NDP and Liberal finance critics with a few interjections for context. After that, a few words from the CFIB about all this.\n\nWe start with NDP critic Nathan Cullen.\n\nCullen: Has your department done an analysis of jobs impact for the $550 million you’re taking out of the Employment Insurance fund, money that according to your colleagues does not belong to the government, but to the people who pay into it? Oliver: The government has relied on the analysis of those who are the small business experts, those who actually represent small business, which is the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and it estimated that the $550-million EI payroll tax reduction for some 780,000 companies will create 25,000 person years of employment. Cullen: Yet ignored the reality that was presented in the analysis from the parliamentary budget officer, an office that your government set up, that shows this will cost half a million dollars or more per job. To rely on the analysis of the CFIB alone and not your own department’s lack of analysis or that from the parliamentary budget officer I would say is to ignore evidence that’s in front of you as finance minister. Oliver: Well, we relied on those who know their industry best and they have been telling us for years that the No. 1 killer of jobs are payroll taxes. And so we listened to small businesses and we’ll continue to take measures to help create jobs and generate growth.\n\nA short while later, Liberal critic Scott Brison picks up the thread.\n\nBrison: When your finance officials appeared before this committee, they admitted that Finance Canada had not done any internal analysis on the small business job credit. Do you think it’s acceptable to introduce a measure that costs $550 million without doing any internal analysis about its potential impact on job creation? Oliver: Well, the department does not analyze every measure that we introduce, but if we don’t do it we look to those who have expertise and we did in this case, to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.\n\nThis seems to me to be a key point: Is it unreasonable to expect that the Finance department produce analysis of the impact of every major fiscal policy the government announces? Even if not, shouldn’t it be able to if the policy becomes a point of debate? How is Parliament expected to analyze and judge the proposals it is asked to approve?\n\nI suppose, ideally, we might have an analysis from the government, an analysis from a well-funded and properly empowered parliamentary budget officer. Then sufficiently independent committees would be allowed the time and resources to fully explore and debate the reasoning, data and context.\n\nOr maybe I’m just a crazy dreamer.\n\nBrison: So are you aware of the methodology they used? Oliver: We are aware that they have expertise, they’ve spoken to their members and I have had an opportunity to speak to them and I’ve had an opportunity to speak to many small businesses in my riding in Toronto and elsewhere around the country. You know, you may not want to listen to small businesses. We do, and they are the biggest generators of employment in the country. Brison: So you’re not aware of their methodology they used to come to that number? Oliver: I am aware that they have spoken to their members and they do their regular type of analysis that you’d expect them to do. I mean, when you invest over half a billion dollars, there’s a macro-economic impact and we’re very comfortable there’ll be significant job creation. Brison: So when the parliamentary budget officer’s analysis, which, you know, the methodology is transparent and is available to any of us, showed that the job credit would create 800 jobs over two years, did you ask your department to reconcile the difference, the delta between 800 jobs versus 25,000 from the CFIB’s estimate? Did you have a curiosity as to why there was such a delta? Oliver: Well, yeah, we have received a number of estimates from a variety of organizations on a variety of topics and sometimes one looks at them and decides on the face whether they seem to make sense. When the CFIB said it’s a big, big deal for small business, it’s good news for people looking for jobs, we’re influenced by that. When they say that small businesses should be thrilled with this announcement because time and time again they’ve told us that payroll taxes like EI are the biggest disincentive to hiring, we’re influenced by that because they have the expertise on the ground.\n\nSo to review: The government is content to trust the CFIB and the existence of a different estimate is met with a shrug.\n\nBrison: So you’re satisfied with no analysis on a $550 [million] … Oliver: We’re satisfied with their analysis. Brison: You said you do analysis for certain expenditures, what would trigger—is $550 million not big enough an expenditure to do an analysis? Oliver: What I said is that we don’t do analyses on every expenditure. Brison: So why wouldn’t you have done an analysis on this one? Oliver: Because we didn’t think that we needed to do another analysis when we already had received one. And we knew that this is a good-news story for small businesses. The small business organizations had been asking us for a long time for this break. Brison: The PBO also told this committee that there are around 10,000 businesses in Canada that pay between $14,000 and $16,000 in EI premiums. These businesses are close to the threshold, the cap of the program, which, according to economist Jack Mintz, could create a disincentive for hiring or a disincentive to growth. Are you concerned that 10,000 businesses in Canada that are between this threshold, for those businesses that this actually creates a disincentive to growth according to Jack Mintz, economist, and Mike Moffatt and a group of economic leaders? Oliver: I think that his comments have been parsed and he didn’t critique the whole program at all. I should tell you that we did analyze aspects of the proposal and as I mentioned they are going to benefit 90 per cent of businesses, 780,000 businesses. So we looked at that and we’re comfortable that there would be a significant benefit….\n\nEarlier this week, Jason Kenney told the House that Jack Mintz actually supported the government’s EI hiring credit. For the record, here is the analysis Mintz wrote for the Globe. Here is Mike Moffatt’s analysis. And here is Stephen Gordon’s analysis.\n\nAwhile after Brison’s time was up, the NDP’s Guy Caron returned to the issue. He asked about the PBO’s analysis and then returned to the CFIB.\n\nCaron: [inaudible] the utmost respect for the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses. They do good work representing their members. They prepared a study that actually recommends a measure that will cost half a billion dollars that will be to the advantage of their members. So they’re doing what they should be doing, which is working for the members and they are getting some money for their members. My question is not about the CFIB, it’s about in this instance, wouldn’t it be standard procedure for a government department, such as the Finance department, to actually undertake its own independent study to ensure the numbers are accurate and not coming from what is basically a lobby group? Oliver: They are a lobby group, but they represent small businesses and have the in-depth expertise to understand and to convey the implications of a decrease in EI for their members. We have looked at the impact, our department has looked at the impact of the 780,000 individual companies and on a macro-basis and we’re comfortable that when [en francais] the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses says that this will create 25,000 person-years, in other words jobs, it is relying on the expert analysis. … Caron: My question is that this is a group that is working to get benefits for their members. The government is not supposed to just take that at face value. It’s supposed to be undertaking its own, independent assessment to spend, because this is basically a fiscal expenditure, to spend the funds that has been allocated to it. So why doesn’t the federal government undertake independent study of a measure that will basically forgo over half a billion dollars? Put it another way, if the Canadian Federation of Students was coming to you and say with half a billion dollars we could actually create 25,000 jobs for youth, you wouldn’t take that at face value would you? Oliver: Well we would do what we did in this case. Do an overall review, but we would also look at whether the federation had the economic expertise to do that analysis. If they did, we would be influenced by it and so on.\n\nSo if the CFS has anything they’d like to ask for, now’s the time to do it.\n\nOver then to the CFIB. The federation’s chief economist posted his analysis on Oct. 9 after the PBO’s report was released.\n\nOver the phone this morning, Dan Kelly, the president and CEO of the CFIB, explained the federation’s discussions with the government.\n\nEI has been, for many years, the main feature of our pre-budget recommendations to government. So we provide them with a tonne of related information, survey data from our members showing that Employment Insurance is the No. 1 most harmful form of taxation to our members. We’ve provided them, over the years, with dozens of econometric analyses on the impact of payroll taxes on small firms and also we raised EI in this round with respect to the burgeoning EI surplus. We wanted to be very, very careful, as we were very critical of the Liberals in the past of using EI money for non-EI purposes, and wanting to make sure that there wasn’t a balloon surplus in any given year that the government would get excited about using for other purposes. So we said we want to see a reduction, the government didn’t believe that it had the capacity to lower EI rates significantly at that moment, so we suggested another form of an EI reduction and then ultimately landed, through back and forth discussions with the minister’s office, on this small business job credit. And that after it looked like that positive, we provided them with our data about what the impact is of a payroll tax reduction in terms of job creation, in terms of creation of person-years of employment. But that was kind of at the end of the process, after it looked like we were good in terms of encouraging them to announce a measure along these lines… This methodology that we used for this analysis is the same methodology, the same source of data, using the U of T model that we have used for every other discussion around payroll taxes. So we’ve gone over this with Finance for years, mostly related to the potential for a CPP increase. So it’s exactly the same analysis that was used, which is essentially measuring the impact of payroll tax reductions on employment. It’s the same source data that we’ve used, so it wasn’t anything new, it was stuff that Finance had seen for years. We didn’t do a separate analysis specific to this credit [earlier] because essentially it works exactly the same way: it’s a 15 per cent cut in EI premiums and works exactly the same way as any other form of payroll tax increase or decrease would work.\n\nKelly says he is “flabbergasted” by the whole discussion.\n\nThe credit is essentially speeding up a reduction that they had already announced. There’s been no debate about the reduction in Employment Insurance premiums in 2017 and small firms are essentially getting it a couple of years early. They’re getting a chunk of their reduction a couple of years early. The job-creation benefit of it is essentially secondary to the fact that this is essentially an EI cut because employers and employees should not have to pay higher EI premiums than is needed to pay for the cost of the program. So this is essentially returning EI rates back to their break-even level.\n\nThe CFIB’s involvement in the analysis of this issue does seem at least a bit awkward—the federation currently lists the hiring credit among its “victories” on the left side of its website. But I think its analysis should stand or fall on its own merits (note: I’m a guy with a degree in English literature and would never pretend to be able to judge those merits on my own). Kelly says the basis for the analysis that the CFIB has provided to the Finance department in the past can be found in this report on the impact of CPP premiums. I will leave it to others to judge all of that.\n\nOtherwise, we’re left with a wholly worthwhile discussion about how our public policy gets made.",
  "latent_7930": "Beginning in kindergarten, our Upper West Side yeshiva teachers and rebbis implanted within us a virus known as Halloween Aversion Syndrome. This virus programmed our minds to utterly reject the dastardly thirty-first day of October and its wicked tradition of trick-or-treating. Halloween was muktzeh, idol worship, and pagan witchcraft rolled into one.\n\nOur instructors would remind us that this was a particularly popular day for desecrating Jewish cemeteries.\n\nIn my case, their work bore fruit: I never trick-or-treated in our building on West End Avenue, nor would I distribute candy to all those pagan children in costume who came knocking at our door.\n\nA similar process occurred with respect to St Valentine's Day, with its blatantly Christian name and immodest connotations. As a result, I instinctively recoil from all things Valentinian.\n\nMy anti-Valentine infection puzzles and disappoints my wife. She was raised in a particularly un-Jewish suburb in New Jersey, where, like everywhere outside the yeshiva world, Valentine's is diligently observed with red hearts, pink greeting cards, romantic dinners and bribe-like gifts of roses, jewelry and lingerie.\n\nTo her misfortune Valentine's antipathy was deeply embedded within me, and despite her best efforts, I remain thoroughly ambivalent about St Valentine's Day. A dozen roses are all it would take to please my wife, yet the virus causes me to routinely 'forget' to pick up a bouquet.\n\nThe virus was also responsible for my failure many years ago to secure reservations at a certain French restaurant on Lexington Avenue that my wife had eyed for some time. While initially upset, she was understanding upon discovering that the restaurant's menu consisted exclusively of braised rabbits, sautéed frogs, fried snails and boiled shrimps ? not very enticing for this kosher husband.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

St Valentine was a martyr of the late Roman Empire; actually there seem to have been three or even four Saint Valentines, all supposedly martyred in late antiquity. A feast on this day was established in his, or their honor. However many St Valentines had really existed, all would be no doubt disturbed by the contemporary nature of the day that bears their name.\n\nThe amorous legends that came to surround this day are understood to have been developed in 14th century England, notably by Geoffrey Chaucer and his circle, when the feast day of February 14th first became associated with romance and erotic pairing, at a time when courtly love was emerging into vogue. It didn't become a full-fledged commercially viable love-day until the 19th century.\n\nActually, Valentines might have been a Christianized version of Lupercalia, an ancient post-winter-early-spring Roman fertility and purification festival that was observed on February 15th in which boys slapped women with bloody goat's hides.\n\nThe amorously-charged Carnivale celebrations and its American variant known as Mardi Gras also take place at this time. And Purim, which also may have originated as a Persian winter's-end festival, falls around now on non-leap years.\n\nNot to be a romantic spoiler, there is a grim, long forgotten reason for Jews not to rush out to invest in lingerie or make dinner reservations. According to Cecil Roth in his classic 'The Jewish Book of Days', it was on this day in 1349 that the Massacre of Strasbourg took place, perhaps the worst of the many anti-Jewish outrages that occurred during the Black Death. The locals had blamed fluctuations in the price of corn on the Jews, whom they suspected of being protected by the city council.\n\nIt was on February 14th that a mob barricaded the Judengasse (Street of the Jews) and drove the whole Jewish community into the cemetery where they built a huge pyre. About two thousand Jewish men, women and children were burned to death.\n\nA new council was installed shortly after, and officially barred Jews from the city for a century. As it happens, this ban was eased 20 years later.\n\nAmong the spoils of that day was a shofar the mob had found in the main synagogue. This find confirmed the suspicions of the townsfolk: it was, they said, prepared by the Jews in order to betray the city. By blowing it, the Jews would be able to signal their unnamed allies lurking outside the city walls.\n\nFor many years after, the so-called 'Judenblos' was blown each evening on a 'grusselhorn', an imitation shofar, as a warning to any Jews within the city limits to depart before nightfall, and also as a reminder to the townspeople of their 'miraculous' rescue from the machinations of the devious Jews.\n\nJews could be forgiven then for choosing to skip Valentines. That's not to suggest however that romance is lacking in the lives of Hebrews: six months from now is the 15th day of the month of Av. Commonly known as Too b'Av, this is the Jewish love-fest. It's just as ancient as the Roman Lupercalia and at least as erotic as the Catholic Valentines.\n\nMore Jewish World news and features",

A blue Dodge Ram pickup pulls into a parking space for a few minutes, the driver gets out, but doesn’t seem to go into the store, and then he and another person get in the truck, pull out of the spot, and take off. Gnetta Byrd was walking out of the garden center of the Walmart when the truck hit her. That was two weeks ago, and she’s still in a nursing home with a long road to recovery ahead of her.\n\n“When it happens so fast, you don’t really have time to see what’s going on. It was just like, ‘Bam,’ and that was it,” said Byrd.\n\nByrd says she didn’t see it coming.\n\n“He just wizzed around and took off.”\n\nBut she does remember what happened right after she was hit.\n\n“He left me there and all of the people from Walmart… They dropped everything, and come running over there to help me,” she explained.\n\nThe truck hit the cart and knocked Byrd over, abut the driver hardly slowed down.\n\n“We have a maniac on the loose, and he’s going to do it against somebody else,” said Doctor Gil Mobley.\n\nHe says he happened to be leaving the Walmart when he saw Byrd on the pavement.\n\n“Immediately got some ice, and you could actually tell by looking at Mrs. Byrd that from here up, thank God, she was OK. She explained that she had been hit and struck, and that she had fallen and taken a severe blow to her right hip,” said Dr. Mobley.\n\nHe says he hopes police are able to find the person responsible.\n\n“We as a community have a bigger issue. Who is this person that did this? Number one, probably a male. Number two, probably impaired. Number three, probably alcohol. Probably addicted to it. It was probably in the cab, that’s why the SOB kept going,” said Mobley.\n\nByrd asked, “Would you do this to your mother? Or your grandmother? Would you just let them lay there in the gravel, there, in the roadway? Wouldn’t you stop and say something?”\n\nNow, she is in a wheelchair, recovering from a broken hip. She says she’s in a ton of pain, and she has to learn to walk all over again. But she says the worst part was losing her independence.\n\n“It just knocks the wind out of you, thinking that within a split second, your whole life can turn around,” she said.\n\nBut she’s still smiling and she keeps a positive attitude. She points out that it could have been much worse.\n\n“I’m pretty tough,” she laughed, “If it could have happened, to me, it could have happened to anyone. So that’s my mission now, is just to get well and see if I can be out on a crusade.”\n\nIf you have any information that could help police find the driver who hit Byrd, contact the Springfield Police Department.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said 90% of its trains are being manufactured in India. And a case in point is Phase III. Of 846 coaches that have been ordered for this phase, only 120 are from Korea. The rest have been manufactured in the country.That's not all. These trains, made in India, are being exported abroad too, like to the Queensland and Sydney Metro systems in Australia.\"We have been consistently increasing the number of indigenous trains in the system,\" said Delhi Metro's director, rolling stock, H S Anand. Of 1,234 coaches in Phase I and II, 36 were from Germany and 64 were from Korea.The DMRC said over the last 10 years, it has been able to keep the capital cost for procurement of these coaches at a consistent level. \"These costs are substantially lower than the cost of Metro coaches world over,\" said DMRC spokesman, Anuj Dayal. For instance, while the capital cost of a coach is around Rs 8.94 crore in India, the cost in Vancouver is Rs 16.08 crore and in San Francisco is Rs 15.13 crore.Mangu Singh, the DMRC head, said, \"Delhi Metro's initiative to indigenize the manufacturing of its trains and ancillary technologies is in consonance with the 'Make in India' initiative of the government of India.\"The reason why the Delhi Metro has been going local is because, due to because of contract conditions mandating indigenization have resulted in major coach manufacturing companies setting up production facilities within the country.\"The conditions in the DMRC train contracts mandate a cap on upper limit of 25% for production abroad, while the balance of the contract order has necessarily to be manufactured in India either through tie ups or a wholly-owned subsidiary,\" the Delhi Metro spokesman said. That the quality remains high in these local manufacturing cases is a given, officials added.In fact, three Metro coach manufacturing units have set up their base in India. These are Bombardier Transportation in Savli, Gujarat, state-owned Bharat Earth Movers Limited in Bengaluru, and Alstom, which has established a new facility at Sricity near Chennai in Tamil Nadu.Besides manufacturing coaches in the country, 18 major sub-systems of these coaches have also been indigenized in the country in a phased manner. \"This has led to a lot of in-house ancillary industry and skilled manpower development.

  "latent_8241": "The Orphanage, 2018\n\nThe Moscow Orphanage or Foundling Home (Russian: Воспитательный дом в Москве) was an ambitious project conceived by Catherine the Great and Ivan Betskoy, in the early 1760s. This idealistic experiment of the Age of Enlightenment was intended to manufacture \"ideal citizens\" for the Russian state by bringing up thousands of abandoned children to a very high standard of refinement, cultivation, and professional qualifications. Despite more than adequate staffing and financing, the Orphanage was plagued by high infant mortality and ultimately failed as a social institution.\n\nThe main building, one of the earliest and largest Neoclassical structures in the city, occupies a large portion of Moskvoretskaya Embankment between the Kremlin and Yauza River, boasting a 379-metre frontage on Moskva River. The complex was built in three stages over two centuries, from Karl Blank's master plan (1767) to its complete implementation in the 1940s. Today, the ensemble of the Orphanage houses the Academy of Missile Forces and Russian Academy of Medicine.\n\nArchitecture [ edit ]\n\nAn outgrowth of the Russian Enlightenment, the idea of a state-run orphanage in Moscow was proposed by educator Ivan Betskoy and endorsed by Catherine II of Russia on September 1, 1763. Betskoy envisaged a spacious, strictly controlled, state-of-the-art institution that could raise abandoned infants and train them depending on each child's abilities—in craftsmanship, fine arts, or in preparation for university classes. Children born in slavery were automatically emancipated, and upon graduation could join the state service or the merchant estate.\n\nThe institution was set on a large lot of land between Kitai-gorod, Solyanka Street, Moskva and Yauza rivers, site of a former armoury. Construction was financed through a public subscription. The Empress herself pledged 100,000 roubles; the largest private donations, from Prokofy Demidov and Ivan Betskoy, amounted to 200,000 and 162,995 roubles.[1]\n\nAccording to the master plan by Karl Blank (assisted by Yury Felten), the Orphanage was designed as a chain of three square-shaped buildings: the eastern wing for the girls, the western wing for the boys and the central administration block connecting them. The inauguration ceremony, attended by the Empress, was held on April 21, 1764, although the western wing was not completed by Blank until three years later. The central building, constructed between 1771 and 1781, was surmounted by a square dome with a spire. The adjacent Moskva River embankment was paved in 1795–97 and set in granite in 1801–06.\n\nAlthough the eastern wing did not materialize, the Orphanage expanded continuously, under the supervision of senior architects Giovanni Gilardi (1790s-1817) and Domenico Gilardi (1817–34). Domenico and Afanasy Grigoriev designed and built the Board of Trustees building facing Solyanka Street. By the mid-19th century, the Orphanage had evolved into \"a city within a city\" – a largely independent and wealthy institution housing thousands of residents. The bulk of the Orphanage survived the Fire of 1812 and preserved its original aspect until the mid-20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s, the missing eastern wing was finally constructed to a design by Alexander Loveyko, who generally followed Blank's original plans, albeit in a considerably simplified form.\n\nEarly years (1764–1797) [ edit ]\n\nOn the inauguration day, 19 newborn babies were brought to the unfinished Orphanage. Two of them were publicly baptized Catherine and Paul, after the Empress and her heir, but both died soon afterward. This was an early portent of extremely high infant mortality that would be characteristic of the Orphanage in the 18th century.\n\nOf some 40,996 children admitted to the Orphanage during Catherine II's reign, 35,309, or 87%, died during their stay there.[1] As a result, the vast complex housed only a handful of survivors. A 1792 report listed as few as 257 resident orphans who studied a variety of trades ranging from metallurgy to accountancy.[1] Several attempts to decrease mortality by passing infants on to foster families did not improve the survival rate. The aged Betskoy could not be relied on for managing the expanding faculty, and the Orphanage became notorious for fraud and child abuse.[2]\n\nChildren lived at the Orphanage until the age of 11, whereupon they were sent for training to local factories and government offices. Some were assigned to the Michael Maddox theater school; others managed to qualify for free admission to Moscow State University. 180 students furthered their education in the universities of Western Europe. The majority, however, graduated with little more than a rouble in cash and a passport (which served to distinguish free men from serfs).\n\nThe institution was managed by the Board of Trustees and financed by private donations and two special taxes—a tax on public theater shows and a tax on playing cards. For nearly a century, all playing cards sold in Imperial Russia were taxed 5 kopecks per deck on domestic-made cards and 10 kopecks on imports. As a result, every pack of Russian cards displayed the symbol of the Orphanage, the pelican. This tax generated 21,000 roubles in 1796 and 140,000 roubles by 1803.\n\nBeginning in 1772, the Orphanage also managed three banks: Loan Treasury, Savings Treasury, and Widows Treasury. These financial institutions, initially plagued by fraud and poor management, became effective and influential under the guidance of Empress Maria. By 1828, their total assets exceeded 359 million roubles, the largest capital assets in all of Moscow.[3] This stock was the principal source of cash for the Orphanage throughout the 19th century.\n\nOrphanage Theatre [ edit ]\n\nIn 1772, plans began to be formed for a \"domestic theatre\" affiliated with the Foundling Home. There were classes on acting, and the first production premiered late in 1773. In the course of 1778 alone, the Orphanage Theatre produced twelve comedies, two operas, and several ballets. By October 1783, the troupe of orphans had become so popular that Baron Vanzura petitioned the Empress to open this \"home theatre\" for the general public. Catherine readily approved the project of a public theatre and presented to the Orphanage a disused wooden building of the Golovin Opera House near the Yauza. The public Orphanage Theatre was inaugurated on 9 February 1764 with the pantomime The Marine Brigands and the ballet Venus and Adonis.\n\nThe creation of a rival theatre company enraged Michael Maddox, an English entrepreneur who held the monopoly on public entertainment in Moscow. Under his pressure, the Board of Trustees agreed to close the Orphanage Theatre in November 1784, but the orphans were allowed to continue their acting careers on the stage of the Petrovsky Theatre, which was run by Maddox.\n\nReforms of Empress Maria (1797–1828) [ edit ]\n\nThe building of the Board of Trustees was erected shortly before Maria's death. In the 1820s, the Board controlled Moscow's largest bank.\n\nIn May 1797 Emperor Paul of Russia asked his wife, Maria Feodorovna, to oversee the national charities. Empress Maria remained in charge of the Orphanage and similar institutions after her husband's assassination in 1801 until her death in 1828.\n\nStep by step, Empress Maria changed the social profile of the Orphanage. She encouraged a thorough inspection of prospective foster parents and limited admissions \"from the street\"; these measures decreased the inflow of new orphans and considerably reduced mortality. By 1826, the mortality rate was reduced to 15% per annum.[3] The figure may appear outrageous by modern standards yet it was a great improvement on the 18th century.\n\nThe institution, headed by retired general Ivan Tutolmin, was not damaged during Napoleon I's occupation of Moscow, despite its proximity to the centre of the Fire of Moscow, which completely destroyed the adjacent districts, including Kitai-gorod and Taganka. While the French held the city, the Orphanage provided shelter for 350 children and an unspecified number of wounded soldiers. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Board of Trustees capitalized on the recent disaster by building cheap rental housing on its properties. As a result of this policy, the new facilities housed up to 8,000 residents of all ranks in the 1820s.[4]\n\nEmpress Maria realized the need to downsize the institution, separating children from adult tenants and improving the educational program for the former. She detested the \"dirty\" appearance of trade workshops and transferred them to new, independent orphanages. The Moscow Crafts College, the largest spin-off, was established as an orphanage for teenagers in 1830, and continues today as the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.[4] In the old Orphanage, a premium was placed upon high-level educational programs along the lines of the \"Latin classes\" for boys (established 1807) and the \"midwife classes\" for girls.\n\nBy the 1830s, the Orphanage finally achieved the espoused aim of taking the ablest children from the streets and preparing them for state service and professional careers. Among the teachers and tenants were Gerhardt Friedrich Müller, Alexander Vostokov, Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Nicholas Benois, Isaak Levitan, and Vasily Vereshchagin. Until the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Moscow Orphanage ranked among the most prominent national charities.\n\n20th century [ edit ]\n\nThe Bolsheviks disbanded the Orphanage immediately after the Revolution. The main building was conveyed to the Soviet trade unions, followed by Dzerzhinsky Military Academy and a long succession of state institutions. The satirical novel The Twelve Chairs features a famous episode: an abandoned wife chasing Ostap Bender, her runaway husband, through numerous editorial offices of the former Orphanage.\n\nDuring Joseph Stalin's reconstruction of old Moscow (1937), several Orphanage buildings facing Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge were torn down to make way for the new bridge. The right wing of the Orphanage was topped out by June 1941, but the project was not completed until after World War II. Viewed from the outside, this later addition is only marginally different from the left wing, to which the top floor was added at about the same time. The main building conforms quite closely to Blank's original designs.\n\n21st century – Parliament Center [ edit ]\n\nMoscow chief architect A. Kuzminov proposed to house Russian Parliament Center in the premises of the Orphanage. The Russian Parliament Center will be used by both Russian Senate and Russian State Duma as their main residence.[5]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCoordinates:",
  "latent_8341": "Brand New Steyr AUG/A3 SA USA Rifle in 5.56x45mm (.223 Rem.)\n\nAfter 20 years of absence the new steyr aug proves to be well worth the wait\n\nTRUSSVILLE, AL —-(AmmoLand.com)- Two decades after it was banned from importation, the venerated and much-sought-after Steyr AUG has made its triumphant return to firearm stores across America.\n\nNow built stateside by Steyr subcontractor Sabre Defense—legendary for its tactical rifles and its unrivaled M2HB and Minigun barrels currently in use by the U.S. military—under the watchful eyes and to the exacting tolerances of Austrian engineers, the new Steyr AUG/A3 SA USA made its debut at the 2009 SHOT Show and is now available in 5.56x45mm (.223 Rem.).\n\nAfter the importation ban in 1989, the legendary AUG/A1 frequently commanded in excess of $5,000, but the svelte, utilitarian Austrian bullpup in its upgraded, modern A3 configuration is now available at a fraction of that.\n\nWith an overall length of 28.15 inches including its 16-inch heavy barrel, the uncompromising, clean-running AUG/A3 SA USA measures 8 inches shorter than an AR-15 carbine with a comparable barrel length and an extended stock, making the AUG the ultimate home-defense or ranch rifle.\n\nAnd while the AR-15’s often maligned gas-impingement system expels a large quantity of operational gas—and all the accompanying carbon and unburned powder—directly into the bolt carrier within the receiver, all gas used to cycle the utterly reliable short-stroke gas-piston AUG design exits the system within an inch of the barrel’s gas port.\n\nThe new AUG/A3 SA USA also has two gas adjustment settings.\n\nThe AUG/A3 SA USA was engineered specifically with the American marksman in mind, and it incorporates all the features that AUG aficionados have always desired in the platform. An innovative muzzle brake design tames recoil exceptionally effectively, providing for accurate second shots on target. The new last-round bolt-hold-open feature provides a subtle “feel” indication that the magazine is empty, and after a magazine change, the low-profile bolt release is conveniently located on the left side of the stock. The redesigned charging handle, forward on the left side of the receiver, also serves as a forward assist.\n\nThe most obvious departure from the AUG of two decades ago is the lack of an integral optical sight. In keeping with its A3 designation, the new AUG is of a flat-top design with a marked, 25-position Picatinny rail. This makes sighting options almost limitless—from low-powered, long-eye relief optics to high-powered scopes to iron sights or even a combination of both. AUG purists need not fret; a Picatinny version of the original integrated Austrian “donut reticle” 1.5X optical sight is also available from Steyr Arms. A smaller side rail also has been added for the integration of one of the many illumination or laser devices on the market.\n\nOf course, the AUG/A3 SA USA has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip. The AUG/A3 SA USA includes two transparent polymer 30-round magazines, a cleaning kit that stores in the rifle’s buttstock, a factory sling, a soft carry case and an owner’s manual.

  "latent_8352": "Dr. Kent Brantly and his wife, Amber, are seen in an undated photo provided by Samaritan's Purse. Brantly became the first person infected with Ebola to be brought to the United States from Africa, arriving at at Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta on Saturday, Aug. 2, 2014. Fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol was expected to arrive in several days. Experts say Emory University Hospital is one of the safest places in the world to treat someone with Ebola, the virus that has killed more than 700 people in Africa. (AP Photo/Samaritan's Purse) The Associated Press\n\nBy MARILYNN MARCHIONE, AP Chief Medical Writer\n\nTwo American aid workers infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans and was only identified as a potential treatment earlier this year, thanks to a longstanding research program by the U.S. government and the military.\n\nThe workers, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, are improving, although it's impossible to know whether the treatment is the reason or they are recovering on their own, as others who have survived Ebola have done. Brantly is being treated at a special isolation unit at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, and Writebol was expected to be flown there Tuesday in the same specially equipped plane that brought Brantly.\n\nThey were infected while working in Liberia, one of four West African nations dealing with the world's largest Ebola outbreak. On Monday, the World Health Organization said the death toll had increased from 729 to 887 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, and that more than 1,600 people have been infected.\n\nIn a worrisome development, the Nigerian Health Minister said a doctor who had helped treat Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian-American man who died July 25 days after arriving in Nigeria, has been confirmed to have the deadly disease. Tests are pending for three other people who also treated Sawyer and are showing symptoms.\n\nThere is no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, but several are under development.\n\nThe experimental treatment the U.S. aid workers are getting is called ZMapp and is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight off Ebola and is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the virus.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it was working with LeafBio of San Diego, Defyrus Inc. of Toronto, the U.S. government and the Public Health Agency of Canada on development of the drug, which was identified as a possible treatment in January.\n\nThe drug is made in tobacco plants at Kentucky BioProcessing, a subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc., in Owensboro, Kentucky, said spokesman David Howard. The plant \"serves like a photocopier,\" and the drug is extracted from the plant, he said.\n\nKentucky BioProcessing complied with a request from Emory and the international relief group Samaritan's Purse to provide a limited amount of ZMapp to Emory, he said. Brantly works for the aid group.\n\nThe Kentucky company is working \"to increase production of ZMapp but that process is going to take several months,\" Howard said. The drug has been tested in animals and testing in humans is expected to begin later this year.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration must grant permission to use experimental treatments in the United States, but the FDA does not have authority over the use of such a drug in other countries, and the aid workers were first treated in Liberia. An FDA spokeswoman said she could not confirm or deny FDA granting access to any experimental therapy for the aid workers while in the U.S.\n\nWritebol, 59, has been in isolation at her home in Liberia since she was diagnosed last month. She's now walking with assistance and has regained her appetite, said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based group that she works for in Africa.\n\nWritebol has received two doses of the experimental drug so far, but Johnson was hesitant to credit the treatment for her improvement.\n\n\"Ebola is a tricky virus and one day you can be up and the next day down. One day is not indicative of the outcome,\" he said. But \"we're grateful this medicine was available.\"\n\nBrantly, 33, also was said to be improving. Besides the experimental dose he got in Liberia, he also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care. That seems to be aimed at giving Brantly antibodies the boy may have made to the virus.\n\nSamaritan's Purse initiated the events that led to the two workers getting ZMapp, according to a statement Monday by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The Boone, North Carolina-based group contacted U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials in Liberia to discuss various experimental treatments and were referred to an NIH scientist in Liberia familiar with those treatments.\n\nThe scientist answered some questions and referred them to the companies but was not officially representing the NIH and had no \"official role in procuring, transporting, approving, or administering the experimental products,\" the statement says.\n\nIn the meantime, dozens of African heads of state were in Washington for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, a three-day gathering hosted by President Barack Obama. U.S. health officials on Monday spoke with Guinean President Alpha Conde and senior officials from Liberia and Sierra Leone about the Ebola outbreak.\n\nThe Defense Department has long had a hand in researching infectious diseases, including Ebola. During much of the Cold War period this served two purposes: to keep abreast of diseases that could limit the effectiveness of troops deployed abroad and to be prepared if biological agents were used as weapons.\n\nThe U.S. military has no biological weapons program but continues to do research related to infectious diseases as a means of staying current on potential threats to the health of troops. It may also contribute medical expertise as part of interagency efforts in places like Africa where new infectious disease threats arise.\n\nThe hospital in Atlanta treating the aid workers has one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Ebola is only spread through direct contact with an infected person's blood or other bodily fluids, not through the air.\n\nThe CDC last week told U.S. doctors to ask about foreign travel by patients who come down with Ebola-like symptoms, including fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. A spokesman said three people have been tested so far in the U.S. — and all tested negative. Additionally, a New York City hospital on Monday said a man was being tested for Ebola but he likely didn't have it.\n\nWritebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since last August, sent there by SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte. At the clinic, Nancy Writebol's duties included disinfecting staff entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area.\n\n\"Her husband, David, told me Sunday her appetite has improved and she requested one of her favorite dishes - Liberian potato soup — and coffee,\" SIM's Johnson said.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal, Mike Stobbe and Stephanie Nano in New York, and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nCDC Q&A: http://tinyurl.com/cdc-ebolaQ-A",

  "latent_8573": "Credit: Wikimedia Commons Image\n\nIf you watch the news you'll see no shortage of ridiculous things a lot of Americans believe. A number of people believe that President Barack Obama is actually a Kenyan-born foreigner, despite producing a legitimate U.S. birth certificate. There are large portions of the population who believe modern vaccines will cause children to develop autism, despite the only study that made such a claim being discredited and the author having his medical license revoked. There are Americans who believe they've seen angels, bigfoot, and unidentified flying objects.\n\nGiven all of this is it really so surprising that in the 1980s huge swaths of the American people were genuinely convinced there was a global Satanic conspiracy that had infiltrated day cares and schools for the express purpose of molesting and sacrificing children to the devil himself?\n\n(By the by there is a difference between devils and demons, in case you were curious.)\n\nPeople Believed What?\n\nI'll repeat that because it bears repeating.\n\nThroughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s huge swaths of the American public genuinely believed there was a global conspiracy of Satanists which had infiltrated their neighborhoods, day cares, and schools for the sole purpose of corrupting and abusing their children. Now if that sounds patently ridiculous that's because it is, but for reasons that will become clearer (if not more understandable) this panic had a death grip on the American conscience for nearly a decade.\n\nNot only that, but there are still remnants of this panic with us today. If that doesn't scare you wait until you get the details about what actually happened during this period of American history.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\n\nCredit: MorgueFile Image\n\nThe incident that marks the start of this panic were accusations made in Manhattan Beach, California in 1983. A 39 year-old woman accused teacher Raymond Buckey, a man who worked at the reputable McMartin Preschool, of having molested her two and a half year-old son. While this might seem like a regular crime to be investigated by the authorities the mother didn't let the accusations stop there. By the time accusations were finished being made the story was that hundreds of children had been molested, and that Satanists were responsible for doing it. These same Satanists, who apparently used occult symbols and wore black robes, were also responsible for animal sacrifice, and the physical and psychological torture of children.\n\nYes the woman making these claims suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Despite that telling fact police decided to inform the parents of all the McMartin students that their children may have been molested. The children were interviewed by psychologists, and even though none of them had actually been molested the children wanted to tell the grown-ups what they wanted to hear (this incident is one of the reasons that interviewing children is now held to such stringent standards by the authorities). As such seven teachers were accused of lurid, exotic, terrible, and on occasion outright impossible crimes.\n\nThe trials went on for seven years.\n\nStirring The Pot\n\nOnce the initial incident happened it set the national stage for copycat accusers. Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) was the term created for this crime that had never actually been confirmed, and it soon became a social weapon used for personal gain. SRA would come up in divorce proceedings, or in instances where someone wanted to take custody of children away from parents. It was talked about endlessly on shows by people like Geraldo Rivera, and it was also latched onto by the burgeoning evangelical segment of the population. Everyone was selling the story that the Satanists were everywhere, and you could barely turn around without a news bulletin, recently-authored book, or movie claiming to be based on true events that promised with a straight face that Satanists were out to get you.\n\nThis was made worse by a practice that is now deemed illegal in many instances; recovered-memory therapy.\n\nThis practice is so ridiculous that it's become a trope; someone perfectly normal undergoes hypnosis and \"remembers\" they were raised by a Satanic cult that abused them, and in some cases which forced them to have children before taking those children as a sacrifice to the Dark Lord. It sounds like the perfect scoop of laughable ice cream to go with this big slice of hysteria pie, but it was very commonly practiced during this time. Baby Boomers, particularly women, would undergo this therapy and suddenly \"remember\" being part of this imaginary Satanic conspiracy going back to the 1950s!\n\nThe whole conspiracy got so big that evangelicals and talk show hosts could, with a straight face, claim that heavy metal albums played backwards told kids to worship Satan. They said that violent cartoons were paving the road to hell, and that roleplaying games like the very popular Dungeons and Dragons were seducing young people into occult societies and preparing them for roles as Satanic priests. While we might acknowledge these statements as unfounded tripe, we haven't been able to shake these ideas from our collective consciousness just yet. That's how strong this panic was.\n\nWhat Stopped It?\n\nCredit: MorgueFile Image\n\nThe Satanic Panic, like all beasts born out of ignorance and fear, was killed by facts.\n\nIn the early-to-mid 1990s the FBI launched a thorough and complete investigation into SRA allegations, and found that none of them had happened. There was no evidence of a conspiracy, Satanic or otherwise, to abuse children in any way. None of the resurfaced memories that had been found in therapy proved to be true, and the therapists were sued into poverty for abusing their patients with the practice. In short America's fever broke, and it wondered what it had been raving about for the past few years.\n\nThe Satanic Panic left scars, though. Hundreds of people, including the teachers in the initial incident, lost their jobs, their children, and in many cases their freedom for years. People are still in prison for \"crimes\" that were supposedly related to Satanic cult activity, and are only just now being exonerated.\n\nIf you think this kind of hysteria is behind us just watch the public's reaction the next time there's a school shooting. It was the video games. It was the rock and roll. It was the roleplaying games, the comic books, and the cartoons. It was the devil.",
  "latent_8577": "David Petraeus speaks onstage during a fireside chat at the Team Rubicon Salute to Service Awards at Skirball Cultural Center on Nov. 7, 2014, in Los Angeles.\n\nBroadwell is Petraeus' former mistress, as well as a former Army Reserve officer who wrote his biography. Petraeus has previously stated he never passed classified documents to Broadwell.\n\nProsecutors with the FBI and the Department of Justice recommended the charges against Petraeus, a retired four-star general who led U.S. forces in the Afghan and Iraq wars. The recommendation comes as a result of an investigation into whether he gave Paula Broadwell access to his email and other classified documents. The New York Times was the first to report the recommendation.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder will now have to decide if he will pursue an indictment. If convicted, Petraeus could end up in prison.\n\nHolder said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation that the decision of whether to charge Petraeus would be made at the \"highest levels\" of the Justice Department.\n\n\"The determination in any case is made at the time that all of the evidence has been acquired, all of the evidence has been reviewed, when it has been gone over with people who are the subjects of the investigation and with their lawyers and so at the appropriate time, the proper people within the Justice Department will make determinations as to what, if any, action should occur,\" Holder said.\n\nHolder did not comment on many details of the case, saying he could not do so because it is an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe recommendation to charge Petraeus comes after a years-long investigation. Following a high-profile military career, Petraeus was appointed to head up the CIA in 2011 but resigned in 2012 when news broke of his affair with Broadwell. The affair was exposed during an investigation into a security breach of Petraeus' email.\n\nJesseyln Radack, the director of national security and human rights at the Government Accountability Project, told BuzzFeed News she thinks it's \"more than fair\" that Petraeus face charges.\n\n\"This is a justified leak case, especially in light of Petraeus' hypocrisy in condemning former CIA official John Kiriakou for 'leaking' the name of a torturer,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why Petraeus leaking classified information to his mistress is any worse than Leon Panetta leaking classified information for the production of a Hollywood movie — both should be prosecuted.\"\n\nRadack, a former whistleblower who has publicly defended other famous leakers including Edward Snowden and Thomas Drake, described a double standard in place when trying leak cases.\n\n\"While I'm uncomfortable with the use of the Espionage Act to punish unauthorized disclosures, the fact of the matter is that the only national security and Intel officials prosecuted for leaking classified information have been whistleblowers trying to expose fraud, waste, abuse and illegality.\"\n\nTrevor Trimm, Executive Director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said prosecuting leaks is never necessary, arguing that administrative repercussions worked as an adequate policing mechanism for decades.\n\n\"I don't think prosecuting leaks is ever really necessary, unless the person is 'leaking' to a foreign government for personal gain. There are plenty of motivations for government officials to never leak to the media, including the loss of pay, loss of their job, the loss of their security clearance and their career. This is primarily how the government policed leaks for decades,\" Trimm said Friday evening.\n\nBut Trimm argued that if the government is committed to pursuing leak cases, \"they should do so fairly and across the board — no matter one's rank in the military or place in the government.\"\n\n\"We know, for example, the last two CIA directors besides Petraeus, Leon Panetta and John Brennan, have leaked classified information to the media, but they faced no punishment. Yet lower-level CIA officers like John Kiriakou and Jeffery Sterling have been charged with felonies and faced jail time for extremely similar alleged acts, in cases many consider whistleblowing,\" he added.\n\nJack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former Department of Justice and Department of Defense attorney during the Bush administration, argued Petraeus' case is unique in that high level officials are rarely prosecuted for leaking information.\n\n\"In the past the government has gone after lower-level officials for leaking or mishandling classified information to the press, but it has never prosecuted senior officials, who often reveal classified information, either on purpose or inadvertently. Petraeus might be an exception because he leaked the information to his mistress rather than the press,\" Goldsmith said, noting that despite that distinction \"the law is the same regardless of the recipient of the leak. But there is at least a weak moral case for sometimes leaking classified information to the press (for purposes of government accountability), and no such case in Petraeus' situation.\"",
  "latent_8671": "The New York Times – the Upshot, no less – is feeling the love for sociology today. Which is great. Neil Irwin suggests that sociologists have a lot to say about the current state of affairs in the U.S., and perhaps might merit a little more attention relative to you-know-who.\n\nIrwin emphasizes sociologists’ understanding “how tied up work is with a sense of purpose and identity,” quotes Michèle Lamont and Herb Gans, and mentions the work of Ofer Sharone, Jennifer Silva, and Matt Desmond.\n\nWhich all reinforces something I’ve been thinking about for a while—that ethnography, that often-maligned, inadequately scientific method—is the sociology most likely to break through to policymakers and the larger public. Besides Evicted, what other sociologists have made it into the consciousness of policy types in the last couple of years? Of the four who immediately pop to mind—Kathy Edin, Alice Goffman, Arlie Hochschild and Sara Goldrick-Rab—three are ethnographers.\n\nI think there are a couple reasons for this. One is that as applied microeconomics has moved more and more into the traditional territory of quantitative sociology, it has created a knowledge base that is weirdly parallel to sociology, but not in very direct communication with it, because economists tend to discount work that isn’t produced by economics.\n\nAnd that knowledge base is much more tapped into policy conversations because the status of economics and a long history of preexisting links between economics and government. So if anything I think the Raj Chettys of the world—who, to be clear, are doing work that is incredibly interesting—probably make it harder for quantitative sociology to get attention.\n\nBut it’s not just quantitative sociology’s inability to be heard that comes into play. It’s also the positive attraction of ethnography. Ethnography gives us stories—often causal stories, about the effects of landlord-tenant law or the fraying safety net or welfare reform or unemployment policy—and puts human flesh on statistics. And those stories about how social circumstances or policy changes lead people to behave in particular, understandable ways, can change people’s thinking.\n\nIndeed, Robert Shiller’s presidential address at the AEA this year argued for “narrative economics”—that narratives about the world have huge economic effects. Of course, his recommendation was that economists use epidemiological models to study the spread of narratives, which to my mind kind of misses the point, but still.\n\nThe risk, I suppose, is that readers will overgeneralize from ethnography, when that’s not what it’s meant for. They read Evicted, find it compelling, and come up with solutions to the problems of low-income Milwaukeeans that don’t work, because they’re based on evidence from a couple of communities in a single city.\n\nBut I’m honestly not too worried about that. The more likely impact, I think, is that people realize “hey, eviction is a really important piece of the poverty problem” and give it attention as an issue. And lots of quantitative folks, including both sociologists and economists, will take that insight and run with it and collect and analyze new data on housing—advancing the larger conversation.\n\nAt least that’s what I hope. In the current moment all of this may be moot, as evidence-based social policy seems to be mostly a bludgeoning device. But that’s a topic for another post.\n\nAdvertisements",

When the bacteria-carrying males mate with wild females, their eggs don't hatch, because Wolbachia prevents the paternal chromosome from forming properly. Since the species only lives 30 to 40 days in the wild, preventing them from reproducing can effectively wipe out local populations.\n\nMosquitoMate only got permission to release what they're calling the \"Zap males\" in 20 states and DC, because those are the places most similar in temperature and precipitation to Kentucky, New York and California where it held its tests. It plans to sell its \"good guy bugs\" to hotels, establishments and even homeowners through a summer-long subscription. While it's unfortunate that most of the southeastern states are not included in the list, MosquitoMate is hoping to be able to release a different species all over the US.\n\nEarlier this year, the startup unleashed 20,000 Wolbachia-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the Florida Keys as part of a trial. The fact that it was able to conduct tests in the Keys is promising enough, considering a UK firm called Oxitec failed to secure permission to test its genetically modified moquitoes in the area.

  "latent_8800": "From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.\n\nThe subject of this article has no official name.\n\nThe name currently in use is a fan designator; see below for more information.\n\nAn in-game trade is a trade made with NPCs in the core series and spin-off Pokémon games. The process uses the same trading sequence as player trades and is usually done for Pokémon that are difficult or impossible to obtain through other means, or for Pokémon unavailable at that point of the game. In later games, the traded Pokémon often has special moves, like Egg Moves.\n\nPrior to Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the NPC Trainer will always specify a Pokémon they want to trade for. The Pokémon the player receives in the trade will have a fixed Original Trainer and nickname; in later games the Trainer ID number, held item, Nature, IVs, and/or level can be fixed as well.\n\nLike Pokémon traded externally, the traded Pokémon will be treated as an outsider, and gain a boosted amount of experience points in battle. Prior to Generation V, every Pokémon has the same level as the Pokémon it was traded for, except in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.\n\nList of in-game trades\n\nGeneration I\n\nThis article is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this article to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: Check that the Gen II held items of trade evolutions and Japanese Blue's Krabby are correct.\n\nAll Trainer ID numbers and IVs are random in the Generation I games. The Original Trainer always uses the hardcoded text string 0x5D, which is displayed as TRAINER (Japanese: トレーナー Trainer) in the game's language. In Western language versions of the handheld games and Pokémon Stadium, this string is displayed in ALLCAPS (\"TRAINER\" in English), whereas in Pokémon Stadium 2 it is displayed in title case (\"Trainer\" in English).\n\nThe held item column refers to the item the Pokémon will be holding if it is traded to a Generation II game. With the exception of Pokémon that evolve during that trade and Krabby in Japanese Blue, they have the same item a wild Pokémon of the same species would have if it were traded to a Generation II game; Pokémon that evolve during the trade have the item their evolved form would have, while Krabby has TM13 (Snore) instead of TM33 (Reflect).\n\nRed and Blue/Green\n\nIn Pokémon Red and Blue, Nidoran♂ is traded for Nidoran♀; in Pokémon Red and Green, Nidoran♀ is traded for Nidoran♂.\n\nBlue (Japan)\n\n1.0 1.1 This Pokémon will evolve due to being traded but Pokédex data for the unevolved Pokémon will be registered first.\n\nYellow\n\n↑ This Pokémon will evolve due to being traded but Pokédex data for the unevolved Pokémon will be registered first.\n\nUnused trades\n\nThere are a few in-game trades in the game data of Generation I games which are not assigned to any NPC.\n\nGeneration II\n\nGold and Silver\n\nCrystal\n\nGeneration III\n\nSeveral Pokémon have raised Contest conditions, including those from Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen but excluding those from Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness (which also do not have set IVs).

  "latent_9065": "Just when details of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's scandalous actions were finally dying down, here comes another self-styled godman, who seems to be following in his footsteps. The Delhi police on Tuesday, December 19, raided an ashram in the capital city where the godman is said to have sexually exploited numerous minor girls and women.\n\nThe police raided the Adhyatmik Vishwa Vidyalaya in Rohini until late in the night after several parents told the Delhi High Court that self-styled godman Virendra Dev Dikshit kept numerous women there. The police have detained a guard and a woman from the ashram, where the team also found a room used to store a huge amount of medicine and syringes. However, Dikshit, 75, is yet to be arrested.\n\nDikshit has branches of the ashram all over the country and his ashrams house women of all age groups, sources told Mail Today. These women, called gopiyan, are reportedly made to dress in pink sarees and white blouses. A former disciple also told the daily that Dikshit organises a seven-day course for his followers and many parents also leave their daughter at the ashrams. During these times, the girls are often sent to various other ashrams without the knowledge of their parents.\n\n\"My daughter was just 14 years old and even wasted her whole academic year,\" a retired police official, who had left the girl at the Delhi ashram but she was found in Uttar Pradesh, told the daily.\n\nPolice also spotted several odd things at the ashram such as secret chambers, tiny maze-like rooms, and weird staircases that would make escaping impossible for the victims. Neighbours also revealed that about four-five girls had committed suicide at the ashram.\n\nA meticulous plan\n\nDikshit also seems to have a well-thought out way in which he gets these girls and women to the ashram. He reportedly convinces the parents to send their daughters to the ashram, after which they are made to sign a declaration that says that the parents have willingly sent their daughters to the ashram. When the girls turn 18, they are made to sign another declaration that they are in the ashram on their own will, which in turn is sent to the parents and the local police.\n\nAfter this, the women are not allowed to meet their family members and are often sent to various other locations. One of the victims from the ashram also revealed that she was repeatedly raped by Dikshit. Another follower also revealed that the \"godman\" was a drug addict and often exploited women, sometimes raping about 10 of them a day.\n\nHe reportedly also tracked the menstrual cycle of the girls and the girl who got her first periods would be flown down to the ashram so that Dikshit could rape her. He also regularly got massages from naked girls.\n\nWorried parents are said to have approached the Delhi High Court through NGO Foundation for Social Empowerment run by Seema Sharma after which a raid was ordered. \"The matters complained of in the writ petition are of an extremely urgent nature and suggest danger to the lives and limbs of several girls stated to be illegally confined in the premises,\" the court order said.\n\nEarlier, a few women had spoken to Hindi Daily Dainik Bhaskar and detailed their ordeal at the ashram. They had revealed that the women living their were routinely raped and assaulted.",
  "latent_9144": "Physician Group Calls On Government To Rein In Drug Prices\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gary Waters/Getty Images/Ikon Images Gary Waters/Getty Images/Ikon Images\n\nIt's not just patients who are getting tired of ever rising drug prices. Doctors are joining the chorus of frustration.\n\nThe latest voice? The American College of Physicians, whose membership includes 143,000 internal medicine doctors. It published a position paper Monday calling for the government and industry to take steps to rein in spiraling costs.\n\n\"This is consistent with our mission to put the patient first,\" Dr. Wayne Riley, ACP president, tell Shots. We've heard from our patients, and our patients are frustrated with dealing with this.\"\n\nThe article, being published Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the U.S. is the only country in the 34-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes most advanced economies, that doesn't have any government regulation of drug prices.\n\nThe ACP paper offered seven recommendations that would change that, and that the physician group says will help control U.S. drug prices. The recommendations include allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with drugmakers and re-importing drugs from countries like Canada, where they're often sold at a lower cost.\n\nThe ACP also wants drugmakers to disclose the actual research and production costs of developing and manufacturing each drug, and to disclose the prices paid for drugs — including discounts and rebates — that take advantage of basic research funded by the government, such as the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\"We particularly feel strongly about those drugs that came to market and made it through the R&D process with support of the NIH grants or VA grants, [that they] should be particularly compliant with more transparency,\" Riley says.\n\nPeople in the pharmaceutical industry dispute that more information about prices will help. \"Making it more transparent will make it more clear, but it will have a negative effect on competition,\" says Ed Schoonveld, head of the market access and pricing division of ZS Associates, which consults with pharmaceutical companies on pricing.\n\nHe says it's important for doctors to join the discussion on pricing because insurers are moving to restrict access to some drugs to save money, and that may not be best for patients. However, the solutions the ACP is advocating, such as re-importation, may not make a difference, he says.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has consistently opposed drug importation on safety grounds. In response to a rise in online pharmacy sales to Americans, drugmakers restricted supplies of medicines going to drug distributors in Canada.\n\nAbout 60 percent of U.S. adults take prescription medications, according to a study from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. While retail prices for brand-name drugs have soared in recent years, the actual prices paid by health plans remain a mystery because they are determined through private negotiations that involve discounts and rebates.\n\nStill, a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that patient copays are rising faster than incomes.\n\nThe American College of Physicians' Riley says the group plans to bring its messages about drug prices to Washington in May, when its members will call on legislators in Congress to press for action.",

In a video (shown above) on Antonir’s YouTube channel, however, he explains the real power of the app. With a little basic math, the app can actually be used as a scale for weighing anything you like. Other developers have tried to make a similar app already, but Apple doesn’t currently allow scale apps in the iOS App Store. Antonir’s clever workaround allowed his app to be accepted, and it’s a neat way to weigh mail, ingredients for cooking, and other small things. You can download the app for free at the link below, but it does require a 3D Touch capable device.\n\nUpdate: Looks like the video has been pulled, but the app is still available to download. If you want to weigh things with the app, head to Training mode. As you push on the screen you’ll see a number between 0 and 1,000 appear, depending on how hard you press (the harder you push the higher the number). Start by weighing the spoon or holder first and recording its force number. Then add whatever you want to weigh to the spoon. Subtract the spoon’s force number from the new force number, then divide that by 1,000 (to get the new ratio), and finally, multiply it by 385 (the maximum force—in grams—that can be recorded by 3D Touch).

The city now has about 500 miles of lanes and trails, though only about half of that provides adequate safety and separation from automobile traffic.\n\nAdvocates, who have vocally touted the plan for months, said it is a major step forward in terms of Houston committing to protect cyclists and provide the necessary lanes and trails many riders want.\n\nOfficials believe developing convenient, comfortable trails and lanes is crucial to increasing bicycle use – thereby reducing car and truck reliance – and providing safe recreational amenities for Houstonians.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner said it was a growing quality of life issue, and the city needs to provide bike options to economically disadvantaged areas where facilities are lacking and people need more exercise options and sometimes safe routes to work.\n\n\"We cannot stand still,\" Turner said. \"When it comes to the infrastructure, cycling is a major part.\"\n\nThough it leaves many questions unanswered, notably exactly how officials will pay for some of the lanes and trails in the plan over the next 20 years, council members said Houston has to start pedaling to get anywhere.\n\n“We have to look to the future,” At-Large Councilman Jack Christie said. “Bayou Greenways started 10 years ago with a plan to finish in 20 years… People came together with a plan and now it’ll be completed four years from now.”\n\nExplore Houston's Bikeways Map\n\nThe interactive Bikeways Map shows the city's existing bikeway network and long term vision for bikeways in Houston.Click here for the full version.",
  "latent_10187": "Wayne Gretzky, whose No. 99 is retired by the league, would like to see Gordie Howe's No. 9 retired by the NHL. (0:49)\n\nDETROIT -- Wayne Gretzky doesn't have much say in these matters, but the man known as The Great One said Tuesday he would like to see Gordie Howe's No. 9 retired by the NHL in honor of his idol, Howe, who died Friday at age 88.\n\nGretzky's number, No. 99, is retired throughout the league. Gretzky wore No. 99 in honor of Howe.\n\n\"I'm pretty biased,\" Gretzky said during the public visitation for Howe at Joe Louis Arena. \"If I had my way, I would do it. But that's for the league. I'm not involved with the league right now. But listen, whatever they choose to do is going to be very special because Gordie deserves something really special and unique.\n\n\"I don't think anybody helped promote, support the game, the sport or our country better than Gordie Howe. He was proud to be a Canadian, proud to be from Saskatchewan. And I don't think the NHL is going to overlook the fact of how important he was to the game, so I'm sure they are going to do something real special for him.\"\n\nWayne Gretzky (left) with the late Gordie Howe in 1989 after Gretzky broke Howe's career points record. Gretzky said on Tuesday the NHL should retire Howe's No. 9. B Bennett/Getty Images\n\nHundreds of mourners showed up in the early hours of the public visitation for Howe at Joe Louis Arena in downtown Detroit. The Red Wings set up the inner bowl of the arena almost like a church, with Howe's retired jersey hanging at the center, where Howe's children spent time greeting mourners who came to pay their respects.\n\nThe public visitation, which Gretzky, Al Kaline, Scotty Bowman and other Detroit dignitaries attended, was scheduled to last 12 hours -- from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. -- before Wednesday's funeral, also in Detroit.\n\nHowe's retired No. 9 jersey was lowered to just above his casket, and the Stanley Cup banners he helped the Red Wings win in the early 1950s were lowered off to each side. Video monitors below the banners showed a streaming gallery of pictures, including some from the early part of his career in the 1940s, some from near the end of it when he played professional hockey with his sons, and some from after he hung up his skates.\n\nFor Gretzky, there was no chance he would miss this chance to remember his idol. Gretzky said that being asked by Howe's children to be a pallbearer is one of the greatest honors of his life, along with meeting Pope John Paul II and lighting the Olympic torch in Vancouver.\n\nGretzky broke Howe's points (1,850) and goals (801) records, and he said part of what made that special was Howe's excitement about Gretzky setting new records -- Howe was almost as excited as he would be if he were breaking the marks himself.\n\n\"He was everything to me,\" Gretzky said. \"He was a second father. He was a mentor. We played golf together. We did commercials together. We had a lot of time for each other doing things together.\n\n\"Now, had we played a lot against each other in the 1960s, we would have battled each other until the end. But I was lucky enough to be part of it today, and it was something that I'll never forget.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",
  "latent_10189": "Major League Soccer will distribute former Chivas USA players via a Dispersal Draft on Nov. 19 and on Friday, the LA Galaxy and the rest of the league’s 19 teams learned their placement in that draft.\n\nThe LA Galaxy received the 16th overall selection after a Weighted Lottery that saw Western Conference Semifinalist FC Dallas finish with the top pick while New York City FC and Sporting Kansas City round out the top three choices. According to the league, teams will not be allowed to trade their picks to other teams.\n\nBut what will the Galaxy do with the selection, if anything?\n\nWhile there will be several interesting options that are expected to be available like goalkeeper Dan Kennedy or U.S. Under-20 midfielder Marco Delgado, the rules that require clubs to pick up players’ contract options and award them a 2015 roster spot could see only a limited number of players selected.\n\nGiven the Galaxy’s place in the draft, they’ll be unlikely to have a chance to select players like Kennedy, Delgado or Englishman Nigel Reo-Coker. However, they may be able to add to their defensive depth by acquiring one of several promising youngsters from the Rojiblancos.\n\nIn particular, Bruce Arena and the Galaxy may opt to bolster their defensive depth by acquiring 22-year-old center back Andrew Jean-Baptiste who was highly touted just two years ago after being selected by the Portland Timbers with the eighth overall pick in the 2013 MLS SuperDraft. Jean-Baptiste took a step backward with the Rojiblancos in 2014, making just 10 appearances, but he possesses the raw size and athleticism that may make him a project going forward.\n\nThe options aren’t purely limited to the defensive end, however, as there are several interesting attacking prospects like rookie forward Thomas McNamara or Homegrown striker Caleb Calvert.\n\nMcNamara, the 20th overall selection in the 2014 MLS SuperDraft, shined at the start of his rookie season, before suffering a torn ACL and a torn right meniscus in his right knee that ended his season after just six games. How the forward will recover after a major knee injury is concerning, but if provided minutes with a team like LA Galaxy II, he may be able to recover his earlier form.\n\nMeanwhile, Calvert drew considerable attention from youth soccer circles when signed from the Chivas USA Academy midway through the 2013 season, but to date, the teenage forward has yet to play a competitive minute in MLS.\n\nNo matter who is available, the Galaxy will likely be best served by passing on whoever is available from the club formerly known as Chivas USA. In the end, there is simply not enough talent available to bolster an already deep Galaxy roster and with the contract constrictions, selecting a player could alter LA’s ability to organize their squad for the 2015 season.",
  "latent_10317": "A new report tracks violence and incarceration rates across America's states and metros.\n\nThe United States is significantly less violent and more peaceful than it used to be, according to the United States Peace Index 2012 from the Institute for Economics and Peace. The State Peace Index is based on five factors: the homicide rate, violent crime rate, incarceration rate, police presence, and availability of small arms. That said, the U.S. remains significantly less peaceful than other advanced nations, according to the report. It is one of only two OECD nations that are not among the top 50 most peaceful nations in the world. As the reports notes, \"this is primarily the result of having the world’s highest incarceration rate, as well as extensive military spending and involvement in multiple military campaigns.” America does perform better than the OECD average on two of five global peace indicators: violent crime and police presence. Still, violence costs the U.S. economy an estimated $460 billion a year, or $3,217 per taxpayer (including direct and indirect costs), according the the report.\n\nThe map below by Zara Matheson of the Martin Prosperity Institute (based on data from the report) shows where states fall on the Index. The higher its score, the less peaceful a state is. (Click the map for a larger image) The good news is over the past year, a majority of states, 35 of 50, became more peaceful. However, there is substantial geographic variation. New England ranks as the nation’s most peaceful region with the lowest scores; Maine is the nation’s most peaceful state, followed by New Hampshire and Vermont. Minnesota and Utah are fourth and fifth; North Dakota, Washington, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Iowa round out the top ten. Louisiana is the least peaceful state on the State Peace Index, followed by Tennessee, Nevada, Florida, and Arizona. Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Mississippi round out the ten least peaceful states. (Click the map for a larger image) The second map, above, charts the Institute's Metro Peace Index across the United States. The brand new Metropolitan Peace Index covers 61 metros and is based on four of the five factors in the State Peace Index: the homicide rate, violent crime rate, incarceration rate, and police presence. The availability of small arms was not included because data are unavailable. Cambridge, Massachusetts, tops the list as the most peaceful metro, followed by Edison-New Brunswick, New Jersey, and Seattle, Washington. Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, and Peabody, Massachusetts, rank fourth and fifth. Providence, Rhode Island, Lake County-Kenosha County, Illinois-Wisconsin, Nassau-Suffolk, New York, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Portland, Oregon, round out the top ten. The least peaceful metros were Detroit, New Orleans, and Miami.\n\nThe report includes correlations for a range of economic, social, and demographic factors, including poverty, income inequality, education levels, infant mortality, and teen pregnancy, among others. With the help of my MPI colleague Charlotta Mellander, I ran a few of my own. As usual, I point out that correlation does not imply causation. Still, the findings point to a number of interesting patterns. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... Two factors that stand out are poverty and inequality. Higher levels of violence and lower levels of peace are closely associated with both, at the state and metro levels. The report finds one of the very highest correlations between lack of peace and the percentage of children living in single parent households. Education also plays a role. Levels of peace are higher and violence lower in places with higher rates of both college and high school graduates. At the metro level, the report finds levels of peace to be higher in places with higher concentrations of the creative class. States with higher levels of social capital have higher levels of peace and less violence as well, according to the report. The report found close associations between peace and several key indicators of community health, including, not surprisingly, life expectancy. But levels of peace are significantly lower in states where greater percentages of people lack health insurance. And, the report finds especially strong correlations between the lack of peace at the state level and higher levels of teen pregnancy and infant mortality. Our own analysis suggests that religion plays a role as well. We find a considerable negative correlation between the State Peace Index and the share of state residents that are \"very religious\" (according to Gallup surveys). Counter-intuitively perhaps, the more religious a state is, the less peaceful it is.\n\nWe also found modest associations between peace at the state level and political orientation, with levels of peace being higher in states that voted for President Barack Obama and lower in states that voted for Senator John McCain. If the Peace Index brings some welcome news about diminishing levels of violence, it also confirms that America is divided not just by income, education, and political orientation, but by the incidence of peace and violence.

  "latent_10338": "No, no, grapefruit is actually NOT a great gift idea for loved ones.\n\nPhotograph by Thinkstock.\n\nHappy holidays, and brace yourself for the season’s worst tradition! I speak not of the crass commercialization of Christmas, nor of the unconscionable deceit of hyping children up for Santa’s visit. No, I speak of the annual bombardment of grapefruit.\n\nWe’ll see Harry and David catalogs in the mail, Cushman’s ads in the newspaper, and other marketing ploys for the putrid stocking stuffers. That one clueless aunt will mail you a crate. The ritual of shipping your loved ones grapefruit goes back to the Great Depression, when people wanted to send each other “nourishing” gifts they could actually “use.” Unlike apples and pears, domestic citrus fruits reached peak ripeness during the colder months. Grapefruit proved durable and thus cheap to transport—packed into crates, they could be loaded onto railroad cars and delivered around the country. Almost a century later, nostalgia (or would that be obstinacy?) keeps the tradition in play.\n\nIt needs to stop. This killjoy has already invaded our breakfast routines. Its baleful pink, white, or red flesh shines from thousands of tables. Its pulp gets stuck in our teeth. Its juice stains our clothes. And now, we are asked to inflict the scourge on our relatives, shipping it off in packages of 12 or more in order to demonstrate our love?\n\nNo. Grapefruit is unwieldy, disgusting, and in some cases dangerous to eat. It is indisputably the worst fruit anyone has ever put on a plate.\n\nA pause, now, for its partisans to bellow, “But it’s a superfood!” Grapefruit enjoys an exalted reputation, thanks in part to countless magazine stories and nutrition listicles singing its praises. It figures in fad diets, including its eponymous diet, dreamed up by Hollywood sadists. Even its scientific name, Citrus x paradisi—so called because, in 1750, naturalist Griffith Hughes dubbed grapefruit the “forbidden fruit” of the Barbados—implies that it belongs somewhere in the Garden of Eden. It does not. It belongs in the trashcan. Consider the evidence:\n\n1. It’s impossible to eat.\n\nA halved grapefruit demands that the opposition suit up for battle. Its edible parts radiate out from its center in segments; separating those wedges from the membrane requires you to saw at them like a maniac with the edge of your spoon. (Some people prepare the fruit with a knife first, which makes things easier but is tedious.) Either way, you end up squirting juice all over yourself. If you’re wearing a light color, you’ll have to change your clothes after the meal. If you’re outdoors, you’ll immediately become a trough for every insect within a three-mile radius.\n\nIncidentally, there are legends of something called a “grapefruit spoon,” with a serrated edge designed to help carve out the fruit’s viscera. I have never seen one. Perhaps they only reveal themselves to the worthy, like the Holy Grail. (Or perhaps I simply don’t spend enough time in rarefied circles.)\n\nMagic utensil or no, things don’t get much easier once you’ve managed to part pith from flesh. You must dig underneath the pulpy segment, trying to balance it on your spoon so that it doesn’t slip off. When it does—and it will—you can choose between retrieving it with your fingers while your classier friends pretend not to notice or just commence sawing a new section. The whole ordeal is not unlike shoveling fish, if you can imagine shoveling fish as an ostensibly healthy, socially approved activity.\n\n2. It tastes disgusting.\n\nA difficult eating process doesn’t have to be a deal breaker; the choreography of consumption can add to a meal’s charm (think lobster). But grapefruit has a more damning problem: It tastes awful. I’m not alone in this judgment.\n\nThe polling site Amplicate reports that 26 percent of its 8,066 respondents hate grapefruit. That’s more people than hate Chris Brown, bagpipe music, or Brussels sprouts. And the Internet abounds with discussion threads titled things like “Why are grapefruits so nasty? (One answer: “I don’t know but they are. They make me feel like I have fur on my tongue.”)\n\nSlate’s Hanna Rosin told me recently that her Israeli parents served grapefruit for breakfast every morning because its bitter taste evoked the suffering of the Jews. American novelist and playwright Harry Crews also flagged grapefruit as a harbinger of strife. In his memoir Childhood: The Biography of a Place, he writes, “The tension and anger coming off” his parents “brought the unmistakable smell of grapefruit into the house.” Lest we harbor any doubts about the citrus’ infernal powers, Crews reflects thusly on the experience of trying grapefruit for the first time: “I only had to touch my lips to my piece to know something was wrong, bad wrong.”\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that some people, traumatized by the taste of grapefruit, go into denial about its very existence. This is the most reasonable explanation I can think of for why rapper 50 Cent acted as if he had never heard of it when a waiter brought him the grapefruit soda he ordered and he asked why it wasn’t purple (per comedian Aziz Ansari’s telling).\n\nIn fact, grapefruits got their common name from the way they cluster on the tree like a bunch of grapes. They did not, it is worth noting, get their name because they taste like grapes, which are delicious. In fact, a grapefruit tastes more like a bad-tempered orange soaked in kerosene, like a pack of stale Warheads rehydrated in vinegar, like a sock filled with battery acid. Grocers and grapefruit vendors describe grapefruits as “tangy,” “sharp,” and—rather poetically—“full of sunshine,” but this is laughable. Have you ever seen a grocer actually eat one?\n\n3. It’s plotting to murder you.\n\nThe compounds in grapefruit inhibit an enzyme in the intestine from metabolizing certain substances. These substances include drugs that regulate blood pressure (Nitrendipine), high cholesterol (Lipitor), heart arrhythmia (Cordarone), and depression (Zoloft). If you eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice within three days of taking such drugs, your body fails to process the medications as it should, and you can experience side effects resulting from higher levels of the drug in your system. The bottom line? Grapefruit is trying to kill us.\n\nWhat, then, accounts for our national grapefruit worship? Why do we lie to ourselves about its suitability as a holiday gift? Why do we continue to tolerate the sourness, the mess, the mechanical impossibility of consuming grapefruit without a prissy specialized spoon that belongs, perhaps, in jokes about Mitt Romney’s table settings, but not in real life?\n\nApparently it’s crammed with Vitamin C, fiber, calcium, and a possibly cancer-preventing antioxidant called lycopene. Never mind that the list of fruits with more Vitamin C than grapefruit takes care of half the produce aisle: papayas, strawberries, oranges, clementines, tangerines, kiwis, guavas, and cantaloupe, for starters. Or that you can get way more calcium and fiber simply from eating a bowl of cereal with milk. Or that the tests demonstrating the cancer-fighting properties of lycopene were inconclusive.\n\nExperts once thought grapefruit contained a mysterious enzyme that dissolved fat, but that theory was debunked in 2011 by a study from—of all people—the Florida Citrus Department. “There is no evidence that grapefruit has fat-burning enzymes, nor is it a magic bullet for weight loss,” Connie Diekman, the past president of the American Dietetic Association, has said.\n\nMeanwhile, diet gurus loved grapefruit because they believed it required more energy to digest than it actually contained. In other words, eating grapefruit burned calories! It was exercise!\n\nUnfortunately, the “negative calorie” label is problematic on its own—and even if it weren’t, it’s unclear that grapefruit would fit the bill. While grapefruit does boast a low glycemic index, its effect on weight loss is fairly weak, according to one 2004 study from the Scripps Clinic.\n\nMore importantly, many unpalatable or impracticable things can help people lose weight, including eating woodchips or wrestling bears. That doesn’t mean we eat woodchips or wrestle bears, although I’d honestly consider doing both before fake-smiling my way through another grapefruit half over Sunday brunch.\n\nSo please, if you were even remotely thinking about shipping a box of grapefruit to someone you love for the holidays, kindly desist. Offloading a box of grapefruit on someone you hate, however—at least the revenge will be sweet.",

  "latent_10463": "Darth Vader became the face of interstellar evil as the ultimate villain of the Star Wars universe. Now his infamous helmet has been modded by 100 artists, serving as a blank slate for interpretations that turn the Sith Lord into a clown, a rat fink, the Statue of Liberty, a psychedelic creature and even his real-world kindred spirit, Dick Cheney.\n\nThe wild mods, which are part of The Vader Project, go on sale Saturday at Freeman’s Auction House in Philadelphia.\n\n“ Star Wars is something we all relate to, understand and grew up with,” Dov Kelemer and Sarah Jo Marks, owners of DKE Toys and producers and curators of The Vader Project, told Wired.com in an e-mail. “Darth Vader is not only an essential pop-culture icon, but also the all-time most evil movie villain. Using the helmet as a 3-D canvas allowed for playing with or against Darth Vader’s inherent themes.”\n\nThe goal? To show off Vader’s thematic and artistic diversity, and deliver lightsaber shine to some of the Jedis of the art world. And to get the artists paid, mostly starting at bids of $1,500. “People hear the word auction and think it’s for charity,” said Kelemer and Marks. “If artists being paid for their work is considered charity, then that’s what this is. In our culture, art is pushed aside when it comes to funds.”\n\nBidding for Freeman’s auction kicks off Saturday at noon Eastern online and in Philadelphia. Serious Star Wars and art geeks can watch it live online, or pick up a copy of The Vader Project’s eye-popping catalog. We rounded up some of the best Vader Project selections below, from distinctive artists including Winston Smith, Peter Kuper and rockers The Melvins.\n\nPraise the Lord by Plasticgod (Above)\n\nDoug Murphy, aka Plasticgod, has notably deconstructed celebrity and pop culture before. But his Darth Vader is a thematic mash of precious metals, spiked nightmares and Anakin Skywalker’s blinding hubris. No wonder Anakin couldn’t see that his inevitably bright future was darker than deep space. He was too hypnotized by Palpatine’s bling.\n\nDarth Fink by David S. Krys\n\nDavid S. Krys’ DSK Designs specializes in the same kind of car-pop culture and Americana bleed that helped make George Lucas’ American Graffiti a warm, fuzzy blockbuster. Without which, one should note, the director might not have been able to make Star Wars at all.\n\nKrys’ vision of Vader is a dirty, deliberate homage to Ed “Big Daddy” Roth’s Rat Fink, which itself was a deliberate perversion of Mickey Mouse that helped popularize the hot-rod antiheroics of the ’50s and ’60s. We imagine Vader made this face while revving up his TIE Fighter.\n\nCarmen Mirandarth by Girls Drawin Girls\n\nSpeaking of delightful perversions, this acrylic pink Vader noggin, resplendent with fake fruit, is a crack-up, and a clever way to filter out the Sith Lord’s feminine side. Bonus points for the little birdies hiding in his fruit basket. It’s a great fuck-you to the fanboys.\n\nNo wonder: Girls Drawin Girls was founded by The Simpsons artists Melody Severns and Anne Walker to break through art and animation’s masculine ceiling.\n\nEverything and Nothing by The Melvins\n\nOne of Wired.com’s favorite ferocious headbanger bands, The Melvins, or just Melvins for the purists, has been bleeding eardrums dry since the early ’80s. The deafening jesters were variously influenced by Black Flag and Black Sabbath, but have gone on to influence equally towering artists like Nirvana, Soundgarden and Tool.\n\nThe Melvins’ dark humor is evident in this spray-painted gold skull, in which the word father is laconically written across Vader’s brow in ornate script. Same goes for the grim, skeletal sun and butterfly that respectively adorn its helmet and neck, as well as the cartoonish dragons locked in an Ouroboros-like struggle.\n\nSpy Vader Spy by Peter Kuper\n\nHe co-founded the politically minded World War 3 Illustrated at the end of the ’70s, and has taken over Mad magazine’s storied Spy vs. Spy strip since the end of the ’90s. So it makes sense that illustrator Peter Kuper‘s Vader would draw from both touchstone comics, and deliver the martial art.\n\nRespectively armed with a gun and a bomb, Mad ‘s memorable black-and-white spies chase each other around Vader’s helmet. But unlike other Vader Project productions, Kuper’s villain can remove his helmet and show off the spies battling alongside his head. As usual, no one wins besides the richest bidder.\n\nI Have You Now! by Winston Smith\n\nDarth Vader’s classic line from Star Wars , exclaimed when he thought he was about to blow his own son out of the Death Star, brings to decontextualized life all of Winston Smith‘s surreal collage art. Lifted imagery of satellites, robots and hazmat suits situate Darth Vader’s cyborg villainy in sci-fi’s overall continuum, while allowing him to serve as the canvas by which it is all measured. Unlike many of Vader Project helmets, Smith’s Sith Lord features terrified eyes that speak to the horror of what he’s done and what he’s become.\n\nMeanwhile, the recognizable letters on Vader’s brow are a nod to the Dead Kennedys, whom Winston Smith — born James Patrick Shannon Morey but named for the doomed protagonist of George Orwell’s 1984 — has collaborated with since the ’80s. His dense, dizzying work has also been appropriated by artists like George Carlin, Green Day and Ben Harper.\n\nJoin the Happy Side by Yoko D’Holbachie\n\nThose in search of J-popcult horror shows should dig this multicolored bizarro helmet from Japanese artist Yoko D’Holbachie. Like much of her commercial and artistic work, D’Holbachie’s Darth Vader veers between innocent iconography and psychedelic monstrosity.\n\nShe’s one of the few artists from The Vader Project to literally think outside Darth’s head: She added cute but splotchy ears, which look nasty. We think.\n\nFull Metal Vader by Eelus\n\nAn early discovery of astounding street artist Banksy, Eelus has since exhibited alongside hotshots like Shepard Fairey. His camouflaged Vader helmet is an obvious nod to Stanley Kubrick’s war satire Full Metal Jacket .\n\nEelus’ Vader helmet says “Born to Kill Jedi Scum,” rather than the film poster’s more general “Born to Kill.” The helmet is strapped with several full-metal jacket bullets, with two tongue-in-cheek additions: a can of Vader gun polish (“Brightening the Dark Side Since a Long Time Ago”) and a picture of Darth with his two Jedi kids, Luke and Leia, vacationing at the beach. Aww, what a sentimental butcher.\n\nHanus by Jim Koch\n\nStraight outta Spokane, Washington, Jim Koch‘s eponymous design shop has crafted up cool illustrations and installations for straight-edge corporations like Hasbro and Hard Rock Cafe. But his fearsome incarnation of Darth Vader is among The Vader Project’s most arresting skulls.\n\nWhile other helmets use Vader’s sleek, fearsome design as a point of departure, Koch’s clown gives the Sith Lord a perverted makeover. From its haphazard clothes and fat red nose to its buck teeth and purposefully misspelled name, Hanus is a carnivalesque mess. Which is what Darth Vader really is on the inside. Creepy.\n\nA Disturbance in the Force by Robbie Conal\n\nLos Angeles artist Robbie Conal has been routinely plastering up grotesque guerrilla posters of revered and hated political and cultural figures since the ’80s. His profane art attacks have landed him in the mainstream, from the pages of Time and Newsweek to films like The Insider .\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that two of his favorite targets, George Bush and Dick Cheney, would garishly pwn the sides of his Vader helmet. Conal’s art has compared Cheney, who has been equated with Vader for years, to everything from the Energizer Bunny to Big Brother. But this marks the first time he’s actually been able to post up Cheney’s mug on the side of Vader’s skull.\n\nUntitled by T9G\n\nThis is easily the most hilarious head in The Vader Project. We’re not sure if Tokyo figure artist T9G is trying to say that the villainous Vader has rudely imprisoned adorable moppet Anakin Skywalker beneath his legendary mask, or if, for all his perceived menace, the Sith Lord is just another toy clogging up the malls. Maybe T9G is simply telling us it takes a youngling to slay a youngling.\n\nWhatever its message, T9G’s untitled goof is a cackle-inducing blast. Juxtaposing the jolly and horrific is always a tough balancing act. But I’ll be honest: If we weren’t mired in a recession, I’d be the first in line to buy this deadly humorous Darth Vader homage.\n\nThunder Vader by Tristan Eaton and AZK One\n\nOminously outfitted with a gas mask and emblazoned with a blitzkrieg logo, this arresting Vader iteration from Tristan Eaton’s Thunderdog Studios restores the original terror of the term stormtrooper. Unlike the stark white blaster fodder of the Star Wars universe, Germany’s World War I stormtroopers were literally “shock troops” that would gas and infiltrate enemy pressure points without mercy.\n\nIt’s a stark reminder that Star Wars ‘ adult-approved military sci-fi has a bloodier, more visceral precedent. Sure, geeks love it when their kids play with kickass Star Wars toys and watch every episode of The Clone Wars . But how many of us want our kids to become shock troops?\n\nUntitled by Wade Lageose\n\nA handful of Vader Project artists redesigned Vader’s helmet altogether, but visual effects artist Wade Lageose — who has designed logos, posters and DVD menus for Lucasfilm, Walt Disney and other high-profile clientele — decided to house Vader’s thick skull with America’s most recognizable headdress. The fact that he didn’t add a title to the piece says it all.\n\nWe know that Darth Vader is as famous, and salable, as the Statue of Liberty. We also know he is a timeless American creation. And if we stretch hard enough, we can admit that he is a beacon of liberty to the universe. After all, Emperor Palpatine sure wasn’t going to throw himself to his own death.\n\nBut what the conflation truly means is up to you, which is the beauty of Star Wars , and of art at large. Let us know in the comments section below what you think of this head, or any of the others from The Vader Project. And definitely let us know if you decide to buy one.\n\nSee Also:",

  "latent_10589": "Review: Rome: Total War By Nick Vigdahl\n\nRome: Total War, the legendary 2004 PC game, is now available on mobile thanks to Feral Interactive. This was a groundbreaking game back when it came out and provided opportunity for both strategic and tactical gameplay. The strategy came from building a world-dominating empire, one turn at a time, and sending your army out to subdue and absorb other lands in the name of Rome. The tactical component was satisfied by a n excellent battlefield simulation where you were the architect of a battle's victory, or defeat. This mixed-level gaming offered something for any strategy or war gaming fan and justly earned a place in gaming history.\n\nWhich classic strategy game would you like to see next on mobile? Let us know below!\n\nIt's been fourteen years and switching to Apple's ecosystem hasn't gone smoothly for other fan favorites. How does this mobile version hold up? Read on, dear gamers.\n\nTHE CAMPAIGN\n\nThe Rome: Total War campaign takes you back to the (abstracted) height of the Roman Republic. You play as one of three major Roman families—the Julii, Brutii, or Scipii—and seek to build economic and military strength through growth and conquest. Your ultimate goal is returning home to end the republic and rule Rome as emperor.\n\nYour faction starts with a couple cities and some controllable family members. They are all male and act as governors when in in town and generals when in the field. Additional family members become available when they come of age, sixteen years, or through marriage. Your mandate, as directed by the Roman Senate, is to go forth and conquer for the glory of Rome.\n\nThe setting of Rome: Total War is Europe, North Africa, and Near-East Asia—the area within the Roman Empire's historic grasp. It is your classic turn-based strategy game filled with infrastructure development, domestic management, diplomacy, espionage, and of course war. You develop your cities to fuel your economy and improve your military capacity. You recruit armies and build ships and go forth to subdue other cities and nations.\n\nOnce you conquer you must rule, and foreign populations won't make it easy on you. A key aspect of Rome: Total War is city management. You'll manage expenses, set tax rates, track morale, and host expensive gladiatorial games to keep the masses distracted. If you don't, they will revolt and set back your imperial ambitions. You also recruit diplomats and send them far and wide to deliver your offers, threats, and bribes to other factions and their emissaries. Spies and assassins do the dirtier work of opening city gates and taking out enemy leaders.\n\nGameplay is turn based and you can assign actions to each settlement, family member, and other key resources like diplomats and admirals each turn. Settlements have both a construction and recruitment queue. You can construct buildings that confer different benefits—a market to increase trade and commerce, or stables which enable the training of cavalry units and dogs of war, for example. Based on the buildings in that settlement you can recruit different military units as well. Both queues allow you to set actions for several turns in advance, which saves a little time if you have a long-term goal in mind.\n\nRuling a material portion of the known world is complicated, and there's a lot going on in Rome: Total War. The game is addictive and can quickly suck you in with one-more-turn syndrome. Long ago I used to play the campaign mode for hours and hours and the urge to keep playing has been ported to iPad as well. The campaign mode is still very fun and holds up well. The UI shows its age a bit, but is still fine and I found the touch controls to be easy to work with. Once you complete a campaign with one of the starting factions the remaining eight playable factions are unlocked including the Greek Cities, Macedon, Britannia, Egypt, and Gaul. This adds quite a bit of replay value to the game.\n\nTHE BATTLES\n\nThe tactical component of Rome: Total War is the lifelike, real-time, battlefield simulation. You can command each and every unit down to the smallest detail of where they go and who they attack. You can view the battle from a birds-eye level or zoom way in to be part of the action. The attention to detail is very high and its clear Feral gave the soldiers a new layer of polish to better shine on more modern devices.\n\nBattles can be very difficult as every unit has its strengths and weaknesses against each other, so proper alignment is key. The real-time element means things change pretty quickly and you will need to be equally fast to keep a handle on things. Feral didn't skimp on units or options in the battle simulation to simplify things for the iPad, which is commendable and something tactical gamers, and long-time fans of the game, will certainly appreciate. Naturally they have rejiggered the controls for touchscreen so you can pretty quickly tap and send units to where you want them. I found these controls to be fine, but far from optimal. I accidentally sent units out of place more than once in an absentminded attempt to change my viewpoint.\n\nIf you're worried about fat-fingering a victory into defeat, or just aren't interested in micromanaging units and tactics in every battle, you can choose to auto-resolve them. The auto-resolution rules seem fair, much like in the original. If you go in with an advantage you'll win. If you go in evenly matched or an underdog you might do better taking the reins yourself, especially if you are a capable virtual general.\n\nOTHER OPTIONS\n\nThere are other options beyond campaign mode. You can step into and play either side of ten historic battles. Most of which feature Rome versus one of its many adversaries. There's also a \"quick battle\" option which drops you immediately into the deployment phase of a battle where you take the reins of a Roman army. Custom battle lets you build your own battle. You decide the map, type of game, season, weather, time of day, time limit, and many other variables. Naturally, you also get to decide who fights and which side each is on.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nRome: Total War is one of my favorite games of all time and I'm very happy I can now play it on my primary gaming device, my iPad Pro. The beauty of the game remains in the interplay between the strategy and tactical elements. The ability to play both leader and general, stepping from a macro to micro view and back again, is something that few games have successfully replicated since Rome: Total War showed us the way.\n\nAs is to be expected, Rome: Total War is a huge install and a bit of a battery buster, but the game holds up well. The campaign mode is still very fun and will continue to please history buffs as well as strategy gamers. The real-time battle component does not hold up quite as well, but will satisfy the master tacticians out there given its depth of play. The extra options for a historic, quick, or custom battle also nicely replicate what the PC game offered.\n\nAll in all, this is a very well done port of the game to mobile. Fans of Rome: Total War will certainly not be disappointed. Those who have never played before might feel the game UI to be somewhat dated, but will likely soon forget as they are sucked in to the turn-based play of the campaign. I'd definitely pick this one up for your iPad today.",
  "latent_10649": "A bison calf that tourists loaded into their vehicle at Yellowstone National Park because they were concerned for its welfare could not be reunited with its herd and had to be euthanized.\n\nHELENA, Mont. (AP) — A bison calf that tourists loaded into their vehicle at Yellowstone National Park because they were concerned for its welfare could not be reunited with its herd and had to be euthanized, park officials said Monday as they reasserted the importance of avoiding wildlife.\n\nThe incident last week and several other recent cases led to fresh warnings that park rules require visitors to stay at least 25 yards from all wildlife and 100 yards from bears and wolves.\n\nVisitors brought the newborn calf to a park facility on May 9, which officials called a dangerous move because adult bison are protective and will attack to defend their young. Rangers took the animal back to where it was picked up, but they could not get it back with the herd after several tries.\n\n“The bison calf was later euthanized because it was abandoned and causing a dangerous situation by continually approaching people and cars along the roadway,” the park said in a statement.\n\nThe visitors were cited for touching park wildlife and fined $110, Yellowstone spokeswoman Charissa Reid said. She declined to name the visitors or issue a copy of the citation amid the investigation.\n\nBison were recently declared the country’s national mammal.\n\nIn another recent high-profile case, a woman was seen on video trying to pet an adult bison as it rested on the boardwalk around Old Faithful. In another, tourists posed for photos dangerously close to bison that had caused a traffic jam on a road.\n\nFive visitors were seriously injured last year after getting too close to the massive animals.\n\nApproaching wildlife also can affect their well-being and survival, possibly causing mothers to reject their offspring, park officials said.\n\nSuch reminders are included on Yellowstone’s website, in information handed to visitors as they come in and on signs throughout the park, Reid said.\n\n“This year we’ve added translations of the safety signage and provide park newspaper translations in a number of different languages,” she said in a statement.",

  "latent_10708": "One of my ongoing projects is to go through all my favorite musical artists, listen to all their albums, and make audio CD compilations of the very best stuff. One thing I like about audio CD's is that they have a small fixed size, so you're forced to exercise your judgment, whereas a big hard drive is like a vacuum cleaner bag that accumulates whatever trash it happens to suck up.I don't imagine that anyone cares what songs I put on my multi-CD compilations of Camper Van Beethoven or Hawkwind, so I didn't write about those. But the Beatles are the most popular and influential band of all time, and because I'm not a huge fan, I decided to hold them to one CD. This is something that might be interesting for other people to read or write about: What if you had to edit the Beatles down to less than 80 minutes? So, after many hours of listening to the 2009 remasters of the Beatles' UK albums and singles, here's what I came up with.(Note: even though I use words like \"greatest\", this is purely an expression of my own personal taste, with which nobody will agree. If you make your own one-CD Beatles page, send me the link. For audio editing, I used mhWaveEdit in Linux. If you're in Windows I recommend Audacity .)From their first two albums, Please Please Me and With The Beatles, I took nothing. My disc is not a historical document -- it's a collection of songs that I will actually enjoy listening to, and there are a lot of Beatles songs, especially from the early years, that I've already heard to death. From their third album, A Hard Day's Night, I took only four seconds: the famous opening chord . Originally I was going to take \"Things We Said Today\", but after a few listens I got tired of it. Some Paul McCartney songs are like sweet barbecue sauce with no meat, and no fire.From their fourth album, Beatles For Sale, I again used the editor to take only the first minute and fourteen seconds of \"I'll Follow The Sun\", because after that it just repeats and I was tight for space. And rather than having the chord from \"A Hard Day's Night\" as a separate track, I stuck it on the beginning of the wrong song. Yes, I have no respect for the intentions of the artists.So, through 1963 and 1964, the track list is most ofplus the chord. In 1965, the Beatles released Help!, which had John Lennon's first great song,, and two great McCartney songs,and \"Yesterday\". The melody for \"Yesterday\" came to McCartney in a dream, and then he became obsessed with it and spent a year figuring out the title and lyrics. After its release, it was the most played song on American radio for eight straight years, and it is easily the most covered song of all time. I didn't put it on my disc because I don't need to hear it again. (For the same reason, I left \"Stairway to Heaven\" off my Led Zeppelin compilation.)From Rubber Soul, which came later in 1965, I took two Lennon songs,andNow we come to 1966 and Revolver, where the Beatles were musically mature but not yet self-indulgent. I took three songs, McCartney's, Lennon's, and George Harrison's, the first and best showcase of the classical Indian stuff that Harrison learned from Ravi Shankar. I think it would be better without the vocals.It was the Beatles' policy to keep their singles off the albums. The singles were eventually all compiled on the Past Masters discs, and I ended up taking only two. The first, from the Revolver sessions, released as a B-side to \"Paperback Writer\", is my new favorite John Lennon song:. I had no idea how good it was until I did this project.In 1967, The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the most influential album of all time, and frequently cited as the greatest album of all time by people who were listening to music when it came out. I wasn't quite born yet, so by the time I started listening to music, everything new on Sgt. Peppers was old. And when you factor out the influence, what's left is a bunch of average songs, and one classic:. (But I cut off the famous piano chord at the end.)Most Beatles albums exist in both stereo and mono versions. In the UK in the mid-1960's, stereo was not taken seriously, so the Beatles put all their attention into the mono mixes, and then the stereo mixes were done quickly by other people. Presumably the 2009 remastering improved the stereo versions, but there are some people who like the mono remasters better, especially on the first two albums and Sgt. Pepper's. Since I took only one song from those three albums, I decided to go with stereo for everything.From Magical Mystery Tour I took nothing. \"I Am The Walrus\", \"Strawberry Fields\", and \"Penny Lane\" are, eh, pretty good. Then in 1968 came The Beatles, the legendary White Album. Having never listened to it straight through, I was a bit disappointed. On a double album, Lennon manages only one good song,. Then I took Harrison's, and one of McCartney's greatest,. Next, my respect for Paul McCartney increased immensely when I found out thatwas his song. But I killed the part where the music comes back after the false ending, and replaced it with the amazing ending of, made by a wine bottle resonating on top of a speaker. Finishing off the White Album, I used the single version of, which is much better than the album version.From Yellow Submarine I took nothing. Next is my favorite Beatles album, Abbey Road. I took Lennon's, Harrison's second greatest song,, and used the editor again for Lennon's. I hate the bluesy vocals in the first half, but I totally love the long jam at the end, so I just took the last 3:10. Then I switched the order of the next two songs, becausebegins with almost the same riff that \"She's So Heavy\" ends with, so they fit perfectly back to back. Then, of course, is George Harrison's masterpiece,. Next I edited together two McCartney songs,, because they were recorded together and they're always played together on the radio (but I don't like \"The End\"). Finally I stuck inbecause it's only 26 seconds long.Let It Be was recorded in 1969, before Abbey Road, but released after it, and was famously ruined in post-production by Phil Spector. Then in 2002 McCartney and three engineers went back and remixed it, and released it as Let It Be... Naked. The Naked version of, without the orchestral overdubs, is clearly better, and after careful listening I also chose the Naked versions of McCartney's, and Lennon'sand. Also I used the Naked ordering of the songs. And for \"Two of Us\" I did more editing. It's a great 40 second song that's repeated four times plus some filler to push it over three minutes. So I just took the first 40 seconds.Finally, the reason I put Let It Be after Abbey Road was so I could end the disc with my favorite Paul McCartney song,. After listening to the original album version, the single version, and the Naked version, I picked the original album version, which is weaker in some ways, but has by far the best guitar solo. Final time: just over 79 minutes.",

At one point, he was kept in solitary confinement for 49 days, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHis family had previously said he lost weight, had a back problem because his cell didn't have a bed and suffered from various infections.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd it is unlikely he could return soon to the country that had much shaped his identity and career.\n\nHe had gone there, trying to show a more positive image of a country at a crossroad. Instead, he had ended up at Tehran's Evin Prison, where a decade ago, the Montreal-based photojournalist Zahra Kazemi had been detained and beaten to death.\n\nThe 39-year-old Mr. Rezaian was born in the San Francisco area, the son of a businessman who immigrated from Iran in 1959.\n\nAccording to his mother, Mary Breme Rezaian, from an early age, the young Jason was fascinated by the culture, history and food of his father's ancestral land.\n\nHe didn't get to travel to Iran until he was in his mid-20s.\n\nIn a 2008 documentary he co-wrote, Mr. Rezaian noted that his parents had never applied for Iranian citizenship for him, creating visa problems for him when he started working as a freelance writer.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe became a dual citizen, which eased some of the red tape, but eventually would be held against him when he was arrested.\n\nHe married Ms. Salehi, an Iranian citizen who worked for the Abu Dhabi newspaper, The National.\n\nHis initial years in Iran were spent sharing stories about the changes in a country isolated by years of economic sanctions because of its nuclear program and its support for militant movements in the Middle East.\n\n\"The American public and their leaders need to see the real Iran, all its parts,\" he told his mother.\n\nJust after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Rezaian applied for a job with the new administration, citing his familiarity with Iran.\n\nMartin Baron, the Post's executive editor, said the application was done online. Mr. Rezaian got a form response by e-mail but never got a job.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNevertheless, that correspondence would be cited one day by Iranian authorities as evidence that Mr. Rezaian had some connection with the Obama White House.\n\nFew Western journalists are allowed to work permanently in Iran. The Post hired Mr. Rezaian in 2012, the year before the election of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate.\n\n\"He has reported not just on political developments in Tehran but also on social issues, such as a water shortage, and cultural developments, including a nascent Iranian appetite for baseball,\" the Post said in an editorial after his arrest.\n\nHe and his wife were taken into custody the evening of July 22, 2014. It would be five months before he was charged. After a closed-door trial, he was convicted last October.\n\nObservers believe that Mr. Rezaian was held because of the power struggle between reformers and hard-liners in the judiciary who wanted to embarrass Mr. Rouhani.\n\nDespite last-minute delays, Mr. Rezaian flew out of Tehran Sunday. His brother, Ali, told CNN that Mr. Rezaian was still in hospital, but in \"good spirits.\"",
  "latent_10899": "If you are a parent of young children or teens, you have probably heard about the standard techniques in exercising discipline with children. Primarily to sternly address the child about the unwanted behavior and follow through with consequences.\n\nThese techniques are effective, however most parents who report using these techniques report little to no success. As a matter of fact, it appears that the more difficult and temperamental the child is, the less successful the parent will be at redirecting the child.\n\nThe reason for this disparity less in the parent’s ability to be at peace with the situation. I have witnessed parents during sessions, execute redirecting techniques with frustration written on their faces.\n\nUpset feelings parents experience when disciplining their children could be frustration, , and sometimes confusion. Regardless, these are feelings that the child easily reads into, regardless of the words of reason coming from the parent. Children are primal beings, and thus, the most important communication they pay to is the mood of the communicator. A parent who is upset, regardless of how reasonable their words are, is going to trigger upset feelings in his or her child. This will place the child in a state of fight or flight, leading the child to engage in defensive behaviors. Some children may choose to lash out in , while most will resort to shutting down.\n\nConsider this example, John and Peter are siblings, John was playing a video game, when Peter walked in and asked to pay with him. When John refused, Peter became upset and pulled the cord for John's controller, thereby disrupting John's game. John then became engaged, got up and punched Peter In his gut. Subsequently, John found himself receiving a talking to and a consequence from his mother. This upset John, because he felt that Peter's consequence and taking to was less severe that his. So, John became enraged and threw a tantrum. This led his mother to become even more upset as she addressed his tantrum. From John's perspective, every time he detected his mother's frustration and towards him, he became even more convinced that she favored Peter over him, and dealt with his feelings by throwing a bigger tantrum. This back and forth between mother and child continued until John became exhausted and became silent, much to the relief of his mother.\n\nIn the example given, John's mother said and did all the right things, however she was frustrated, and her upset feelings with John was all John could hear and see. From his perspective, John believed that his mother was being unfair to him, and voicing his protests, while his mother's frustration came from her failed attempts to reason with him.\n\nFor parents to get their children to listen to them more, they must bring their feelings under control before engaging with the child.\n\nA parent who is genuinely calm, when addressing misbehavior with children, will experience a higher rate of success in reasoning with the child. This is because, in the absence of raw emotions, the child subconsciously mirrors the parent's calm mood, thereby decreasing activity in the lower brain and increasing activity in the cortex and prefrontal cortex regions. This leads to more clarity of thought with the child.\n\nUgo is a psychotherapist and owner of Road 2 Resolutions PLLC.",

'So I'm totally grateful to everyone involved.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nRicky Dubose (left), 24, and Donnie Russell Rowe (right), 43, were caught on Thursday after their shocking Tuesday escape from a prison bus, in which they killed two guards\n\nThe pair had taken an elderly couple hostage before tying them up, stealing their Jeep and getting involved in a 100mph car chase with police. They crashed, fled and were captured\n\nEarlier in the day, police in nearby Shelbyville had responded to a call about a home invasion, where a couple had been held captive, Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Nelly Miles said.\n\nThe suspects fled in the couple's vehicle and fired on sheriff's deputies chasing them on Interstate 24 about 50 miles southeast of Nashville, Tennessee, Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Bill Miller said. Rutherford County Sheriff Michael Fitzhugh said his deputies did not return fire and none of them was injured.\n\nRowe and Dubose crashed the car and bailed out, running into the woods, Miller said. They then came across a home set back on a long driveway.\n\nTennessee Highway Patrol Lt. Bill Miller, center, speaks during a news conference held at a truck stop Thursday, June 15\n\nTennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn, center, at the briefing\n\nThe trooper said the homeowner looked outside and saw the two allegedly trying to steal his car. The man held the two at gunpoint with a neighbor he called for help until the sheriff's department could get there to arrest the fugitives.\n\nThe two were being held at the Rutherford County jail.\n\nGeorgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Greg Dozier said in a news release that he was relieved the two inmates were captured and no longer a threat to the public.\n\n'They will be brought to justice swiftly for their heinous crime against our officers,' he said, also expressing gratitude to all of the law enforcement officers who provided support and assistance in the search for the two men.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Nathan Deal applauded the 'tireless efforts' of law enforcement but also turned his thoughts to the families of the two officers, saying their pain remains.\n\n'We will do everything in our power to support their loved ones, and we will not forget their sacrifice and service,' Deal said.\n\nTennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine said the bureau's agents will take part in processing the scene.\n\nThe two men had been on the run since early Tuesday, when they are accused of having killed Sgt. Christopher Monica and Sgt. Curtis Billue.\n\nThe rampage began (1) on state highway 16 in Georgia on Tuesday at 6:45am, when Dubose and Rowe killed their guards and carjacked a passerby. (2) At 10:30am, they ransacked a home in Madison and stole clothes. (3) Around 12 hours later, they ditched the car and store a white pickup from a quarry near Madison. They fell off the radar until 2:30pm, when they held an elderly couple hostage in their Shelbyville, Tennesee home for three hours before stealing their Jeep. They were quickly spotted and after a 100mph chase, they crashed on the I-24 (4). They fled on foot but were captured in Christiana, Tennessee, at 7pm\n\nThe pair had escaped on Tuesday from a prison bus in Georgia. They were arrested around 200 miles away in Tennessee. In-between, they jacked two cars, stole a third and burgled a house\n\nThe two inmates overpowered and disarmed the guards on a bus about 6:45 a.m. Tuesday as 33 inmates were being driven between prisons, authorities have said. One of them fatally shot both guards, and then they jumped out of the bus and carjacked a driver who happened to pull up behind them on state Highway 16 in Putnam County, southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.\n\nThe two inmates then fled in the stolen Honda Civic and drove about 25 miles north to Madison, where they ransacked a home, stealing food and clothes and leaving their prison uniforms behind around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nLate Tuesday night, about 12 hours after the home burglary, the pair stole a Ford pickup truck from a rock quarry about 9 miles from the burglarized home when the trail had gone cold.\n\nDubose is seen left in an earlier photo, before he got his distinctive tattoos, and right afterward. Both men were said to be highly dangerous\n\nThe FBI announced a tip line and said pictures of the men and information about a $130,000 reward would appear on billboards in multiple states. TBI's Gwyn said Thursday he wasn't sure who would collect the reward.\n\nOne of the murdered guards was Christopher Monica (pictured), who had been a prison guard since 2009. He had been working an extra shift to pay for his ill wife\n\nAuthorities warned that the men, who had escaped with the guards' 9 mm pistols, were considered very dangerous. Gwyn said investigators believe both weapons have been found at the site where the men crashed the vehicle.\n\nMonica and Billue were transfer sergeants at Baldwin State Prison. Monica had been with the Georgia Department of Corrections since October 2009 and Billue since July 2007.\n\nPutnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said the escaped inmates had been inside a secured area of the bus. He said he didn't know how they got through the locked cage to overpower the guards.\n\nProtocol is to have two armed corrections officers on the bus, but the officers don't wear bullet-proof vests during transfers, Dozier said.\n\nBoth escapees were serving sentences for armed robbery and other crimes. The Department of Corrections said Rowe, 43, had been serving life without parole since 2002, and Dubose, 24, began a 20-year sentence in 2015.\n\nIf convicted of capital murder for the deaths of the guards, they could now face the death penalty.",

It approaches the competitive mindset with a psychological eye, so give it a read!\n\nCredit for this goes to a local player of the Chicago-land Smash 4 scene, REZ.\n\nMindset and Competitive Smash Bros\n\nAll quotes and references in this article are from Mindset by Carol S. Dweck, PHD.\n\nWhen you play Super Smash Bros competitively, you naturally come up against failure. Maybe you lose because your controller broke. Maybe you lose because you’re having an off day. Maybe you lose because your opponent is straight better than you are. The reason for your loss is not important. What is important is how you deal with it.\n\nDr. Carol S. Dweck asserted that there are two types of mindset. That is to say, that there are two primary approaches to adversity. Through her research, Dr. Dweck discovered that the mindset you adopt for yourself affects the way you live. The first one I’d like to discuss is the fixed mindset. I’ve found that many of the players in this community adopt a fixed mindset towards the game, and it really hinders their growth as both a player and a person. I’m guilty of this mindset myself, many times over. Dr. Dweck writes that the fixed mindset is “believing that your qualities are carved in stone,” which “creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over.” This most commonly manifests itself as a limiter of sorts. “I only lost because my controller broke.” “Another off day, do I even have on days?” “This player is better at Smash than me. I’m never going to beat him.” It also manifests itself as a constant need to prove oneself. Each victory brings a validation, and each loss proves to yourself what you believe is true. “I lost to player X, I am a failure.”\n\nThe other type of mindset is the growth mindset. Dr. Dweck described this as being “based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ… everyone can change and grow.” The growth mindset takes a completely different look at losing. The growth smasher doesn’t view a loss as a failure, merely as a challenge.”My controller broke, but it’s my fault still for losing. What other mistakes did I make?” “I’m having an off day, next week will be better.” “I got three-stocked by player X. Why? How can I do better next time?” Dr. Dweck presents these points of view from the growth mindset. “Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset.”\n\nSo you’ve gotten this far and maybe some of the fixed mindset stuff resonated with you. Heck, some of the growth stuff probably did too. How can you improve your mindset in regards to Smash and maybe more? The first thing you can do is to change your outlook on losing. Losing sucks and everyone hates it. But losing doesn’t make you a loser. Your worth as a player or a person is not dependent on your results. You are no lesser for dropping a set. Take the opportunity to learn. How were you outplayed? Did your opponent pick up on any of your habits? Just as habits are important in Smash, you also want to work on your mental habits. When you’re down a stock, do you start to freak out? Every time that happens, try to make a habit of telling yourself to calm down. Do you throw your controller in a rage whenever you lose an important match? Create a new habit for whenever you finish a game, win or lose. Eventually, it’s all you’ll do when you finish a set.\n\nIf you are of a fixed mindset, it’s important for you to realize that’s not a failure in itself. Recognizing your mindset is an opportunity. It’s an opportunity to improve yourself. It’s an opportunity to improve your skills. And most importantly, it’s an opportunity to have more fun with the game we all love.",
  "latent_12457": "Breastfeeding 101 for Sexual Assault Survivors\n\nMy son was a planned surprise, which means I wanted him but didn’t think he could ever happen. What was even more unexpected were the feelings that arose around my ability to care for him. It took years for me to figure out that a lot of my struggles as a new mother were directly related to my history as a sexual assault survivor.\n\nOne of the unanticipated difficulties was breastfeeding. Eighteen years ago, when my son was born, breastfeeding was not quite as supported in my city as it is now. Just this year an ordinance was passed in support of public breastfeeding, so you can imagine the atmosphere nearly two decades ago!\n\nI had experienced miscarriages and been told I probably wouldn’t be able to have a child. When I found out I was pregnant again after I had given up trying, I was thrilled. Wanting to be “supermom,” I researched everything I could at the local library. I intended to babywear, use holistic treatments, and breastfeed exclusively. I attended a La Leche League meeting and met with a lactation consultant at my clinic. I was going to give my baby everything I did not have as an adoptee in a poor family.\n\nI was open with my doctor about my history of sexual abuse. The clinic provided me with a counselor, nutritionist, lactation consultant, and mentor throughout my pregnancy. I was lucky to have so many resources and support to work through my fears and traumas.\n\nSumayyah Talibah, a writer, jewelry maker, mother to boys aged 11 and 7, and survivor, says: “I didn’t breastfeed. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Breasts were always sexual for me, having been well-endowed in that area for all of my life. My breasts were usually the first thing noticed about me, commented on, and touched, often without permission. It’s like I had some sort of block when I went to try [to breastfeed], panic attack and all, remembering my experiences.” Like many other moms, she went on to add that she was shamed by nurses in the hospital for not trying to breastfeed.\n\nAs for me, I found hospital staff unsupportive of my desire to breastfeed. They refused to let me keep my son in the room with me overnight. Fortunately I had ample support once we got home. I had been taught that “you know he is latched on correctly because it doesn’t hurt,” one of the breastfeeding claims I still side-eye. When he latched on, it sent a shooting pain through my breast and down my spine, and continued to hurt the entire time he ate. I would tense up in anticipation of the pain. I told my lactation consultant, who explained to me that I had a rare condition that would not improve. I tried to nurse for another week or so anyway, but when he developed a serious illness, we decided it was better to not have the breastfeeding stress as well. It wasn’t until later that I was told mine was a reaction often experienced by sexual assault survivors, though I still do not know the name of the condition.\n\nBrooke Benoit, a mother of 6, artist, writer and editor, shared: “When the topic of breastfeeding came up during my first pregnancy, my reaction was no. Why would I do that? Why would I give my breasts to another person all day every day for some indefinite period of time? My husband was surprised by my response. I was a very all-things-natural, loving person and he had assumed I would be a give-all kind of Mama, which I was aiming for, but it had also been lost on him (and myself) why I would even consider an elective c-section. At that time I could not bring the feelings to the forefront of my brain or my tongue because I am a survivor of sexual abuse and am not always in touch with all the reasons why I do certain things out of striving to maintain autonomy over my body at all times. One such thing is that I do not like anyone touching my sexual bits when I am not in a sexual mode.”\n\nHow sexual trauma can come back to us during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum varies. Our reactions are not uniform, and there are many possible reactions a survivor might have that are not readily seen as related to a history of trauma. We often live with shame, guilt, and isolation because we do not realize trauma is the root of our issues. When we struggle to breastfeed but cannot articulate why, it is also difficult to get the appropriate support. Lactation consultants, postpartum doulas, and other support providers should be better educated in sexual trauma and prepared to help parents with such history recognize if that may be what is causing difficulties. All those supporting new parents should be open to modifying their approaches when encouraging breastfeeding, realizing that someone may not know or feel safe enough to say why they have a visceral negative reaction to trying. Unfortunately, there is not much quality intersectional writing (or even thoughtful consideration) on the needs and experiences of sexual assault survivors during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum.\n\nChloe Viening-Butler, mother of four boys, artist, poet, and activist shares: “I actually didn’t have any issues at all with that [breastfeeding]. Well… at least until I weaned. While I was weaning and was ready to be done, but the toddler wasn’t ready, I would feel really gross. The only thing that helped me then was to have a safe place or person to speak it out loud to. I wrote about and talked about it, and I was fortunate enough to have people who said directly ‘it’s okay and normal to feel that way’…then at the very least I had put language to my discomfort and heard someone say it was something I wasn’t alone in.”\n\nTytina Sanders-Bey — lactation counselor, doula, and mom of five kids — suggests there are additional benefits for a survivor when breastfeeding. “At first I was ashamed of my breasts. They were often touched by my first offender,” she says. “Once I began to willingly have sex with a partner, my breasts were often off-limits. I wouldn’t even take my bra off. When I had my first baby and learned about breastfeeding, it actually boosted my confidence. Not only did I have milk to feed my baby, but I felt sexy and it was okay for me to feel sexy. I had that child at a young age, but she was my way away from the boogie man forever.”\n\nSexual assault survivors have different feelings about their bodies. Some may be very concerned about autonomy, while others might not feel as if their bodies belong to them. Pregnancy and motherhood can amplify these feelings, or cause a major shift. Many survivors look for ways they can exert control over their body, and may feel that breastfeeding either takes away that control or liberates them in some way. Discovering that your body is capable of incredible things, like bringing forth a life and feeding it, can be quite empowering and even enable you to reclaim your body.\n\nIf you are a sexual assault survivor and thinking about breastfeeding, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\nIf you do not want to try to breastfeed, you do not have to. We have flipped in the last 20 years from little support for breastfeeding to the prescriptive pushing of breastfeeding. You do not owe anyone else an explanation for your choice. Know that you are not alone, and you are not a bad mother for doing what is best for your unique situation. Your baby is not going to starve or have some terrible illness because you fed them formula. If bonding is a concern, reliving trauma does not make for a happy bonding experience either. Find other ways to interact with your baby. After all, no one has ever claimed that your partner’s bond with the baby is wrecked by a bottle, so yours won’t be either!\n\nWe have flipped in the last 20 years from little support for breastfeeding to the prescriptive pushing of breastfeeding.

If you do want to breastfeed, set realistic expectations for yourself with a no-shame rule, and gather your supports . You may, like others, discover that breastfeeding doesn’t actually cause the feelings and discomfort you expected. Or, like me, you may discover that it causes other feelings you were not prepared for. Your feelings, whatever they are, are valid. Do not try to repress them, but figure out how you would like to deal with them to get through nursing anyway. This may mean that you need to take additional time to yourself before or after feedings. It may mean you take up meditation or seek outside help to talk about how you are feeling. No matter how many times I’m told, I still need to be reminded that taking care of my own needs is not selfish. Being aware of your own needs and honoring them helps you to be there for your baby.\n\nYou may, like others, discover that breastfeeding doesn’t actually cause the feelings and discomfort you expected.

Prepare your body and think about how you can set boundaries. You may decide that you cannot breastfeed exclusively, or that expressing your milk is less triggering than actually nursing. Brooke says: “One thing I nipp(l)ed in the bud was that some women allow their baby to play with their other breast and nipple while nursing. For me, no way. I have now breastfed six children for two years each and when each one has begun their little explorations of my body while nursing, I gently hold their adorable teeny hand in mine and say ‘no.’ Babies are brilliant, you know, and mine have all respected this first boundary between their body and mine.”\n\nYou may decide that you cannot breastfeed exclusively, or that expressing your milk is less triggering than actually nursing.

Between the hormonal roller coaster and the sleep deprivation of parenting a new baby, these pressures and tendencies can increase. Find ways to have fun, however you define it, and give yourself permission to enjoy your new baby and new life.\n\n$ Donation Amount: Updating Amount ... Like this article? Tip The Toast!

  "latent_12478": "The coalminer plucked from the bush to play two Bledisloe Cup Tests turned down the offer of a professional contract in favour of heading straight back home\n\nOn a glorious wintry day at Rugby Park in Singleton, two hours drive north of Sydney, a leathery, battle-hardened Steve Merrick stands with his people watching their beloved Singleton Bulls. The last of rugby union’s amateurs, 20 years ago Merrick played an unlikely role in the Wallabies Bledisloe Cup campaign against New Zealand. After the second Test in 1995, he returned to Singleton, where he remains to this day.\n\n“Been a tough one for the Bulls,” says Merrick in a country drawl as a couple of younger players slap him on the back. “You find out about people in seasons like this.”\n\nIt has been a lean and dispiriting year for the Singleton Bulls, freshly promoted to the Newcastle & Hunter Premier League but limping to the end of the season at the bottom of the ladder with a record of one win and 12 losses.\n\nTheir opponents today are Hamilton who are top of the table with a 12-1 record. On form it should be a bloodbath but the Singleton Bulls have put up spirited resistance and at half-time are down a respectable 27-7.\n\nClub president and backbone Shane Thompson is filling in for the team manager, furiously marking down stats and managing substitutions. In a break in play he recalls the first time he met Merrick. “Steve wasn’t even the best footy player in his family,” says Thompson. His brother Dale was the natural sportsman – a quality league and union player and an A-grade golfer and cricketer. Steve didn’t win the genetic lottery but Thompson remembers his work ethic: “Steve had to work so much harder but it paid off.”\n\nI was brought up to play for enjoyment and I’m equal with my team-mates Steve Merrick\n\nNext year is the Singleton Bulls 50th anniversary, and both Merrick and Thompson agree on the challenges facing the club. With a population of just 25,000 the talent pool is stretched and being a ‘20-pit’ mining town means unstable team selection. “The miners work every second weekend and we lose 10-15 players on shifts,” says Thompson.\n\nThe Singleton Bulls have had a tough five years but it wasn’t always the case. With Merrick at scrumhalf they won five premierships. “He was unpredictable, dynamic and a fierce competitor,” says Thompson. “He was already a tough league player and adapted.”\n\nThompson is proud of the Bulls’ achievements and the boutique ground the club owns. “We carved it out of farm paddocks,” he says. He misses the amateur days where international teams such as the All Blacks, Scotland and Fiji would play and fill the ground. Now they fly in and out of the big cities and he believes “country rugby is poorer for it”.\n\nThompson winces as Hamilton score another try. He laments the disparity between clubs in which some pay for imported players and others don’t. “We don’t pay anybody.” says Thompson. The global slowdown for coal has meant job losses and with good jobs hard to come by, the Bulls struggle to attract new players.\n\nMerrick coaches the Bulls Under-15s team, which includes his son Beau. He loves working with the youngsters: “Steve comes in whenever we ask and does whatever we ask. A true club man,” says Thompson.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Merrick in the Singleton dressing room after a game, 30 March 1996. Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\n\nMerrick was born in 1968 in Singleton, a small town on the banks of the Hunter River in the heart of coalmining country. His parents Robbie and Jenny both came off farms in Singleton and the Merrick pedigree in the district goes back more than 200 years to the early 1800s.\n\nAn accidental rugby union player, he played rugby league until the age of 18 and thought union was “strange”. Heavily influenced by his brother Dale who had recently switched from league, he came down to Rugby Park to watch him play in a Tooheys Cup final against Orange. He was instantly “hooked on the continuity and rucking” and joined the Singleton Bulls second grade team in 1987.\n\nHis father was an amateur boxer for Australia and remains a guiding force. “When he came to watch me play he gave me nothing except a nod of the head for my very best game,” he says. “I just worked hard to please mum and dad.”\n\nMerrick took time to add new skills but continued to improve leading to his breakthrough year in 1993 when he was selected for NSW Country against Tonga and South Africa. In 1994 he won NSW Country player of the year and played against Ireland in an Australian XV side in Mt Isa.\n\nWe played on a handshake and Steve has my full respect and the respect of the rugby community Graeme Bachop\n\nIn 1995, he was not selected for the Wallabies World Cup team, but after Australia’s disastrous quarter-final loss to England he was driving his mining truck when he received a call from Coach Bob Dwyer in South Africa. Merrick hung up, thinking it was a mates prank call. Dwyer called back and asked Merrick to make himself available for the NSW Waratahs to play against Otago in New Zealand.\n\nMerrick played well and kept his spot for two games for NSW against Queensland, winning man-of-the-match at Concord Oval and scoring a try at Ballymore in the return game.\n\nAlthough he had struck a vein of hot form, he did not expect to displace World Cup scrumhalf George Gregan for the Bledisloe Cup team, which was being announced at Sydney Airport baggage terminal, timed for the return of the NSW team from Queensland.\n\nComing down the airport escalator, his wife Rebecca was waiting for him. He knew instantly: “I could tell by the look on her face.” he says. Merrick had been selected as Wallaby number 722 to make his debut in a Bledisloe Cup match against the All Blacks in New Zealand on 22 July, 1995.\n\nThe rugby union world was shocked that a ‘bolter from the bush’ had unseated Gregan and keenly awaited his debut in front of 50,000 at Eden Park – one of the rugby’s toughest proving grounds and unforgiving terrain for a debutant.\n\nHaving missed his first Wallabies training session due to a previous commitment - “I had to bring a mate back to Singo” – a strange thing happened to Merrick after another session he did make it to. He was pulled into a side room to be met by players sitting at a table who wanted to discuss a rebel union competition. They were offering $100,000 to sign as a professional and if it didn’t go ahead he could keep the sign on fee. Easy money.\n\nMerrick, however, burst into laughter.“I can’t believe I’m hearing this,” he told them, “I play footy because I want to play footy. That’s it.”\n\nOn the morning of the Test match in New Zealand, Merrick’s room-mate and Wallaby legend Tim Horan pulled back the curtains to reveal torrential weather. Merrick recalls Horan looking outside and looking back at him saying coldly: “Your first Test. Eden Park in this weather. I’d jump out the window.”\n\nJonah Lomu effort against England tops poll for greatest Rugby World Cup try Read more\n\nHoran’s advice was brushed off and Merrick took to the field, where he faced the Haka. Jonah Lomu stared straight at him for the entire war dance, pulling “those New Zealand faces”.\n\n“Lomu was a freak,” says Merrick who was dragged along a few times when targeted by the rampaging winger. The Wallabies came close, losing 28-16 in bad conditions. His Wallaby debut was a blur: “It was like playing 10 minutes of footy, no time, so fast and intense.”\n\nAt full-time he sheepishly remembers brokering a deal with the security guard in the tunnel: “I was the only smoker in the side, got my smokes and lit one up behind the cameras.”\n\nHis opposing scrumhalf that day was All Blacks legend Graeme Bachop who remembers Merrick as quick, rugged and tough. On the line from Christchurch in New Zealand, Bachop savours a kindred spirit: “After those Test matches I got to know Steve well.”\n\nBirds of a feather, Bachop also refused the offer to play professionally for the All Blacks. “We’re similar in some respects,” he explains, “both quiet sort of guys and we wanted to play for fun and the honour of the jersey, not turn it into a job.\n\nAfter the game they swapped shorts and later became friends, meeting at tournaments around the world. Merrick remembers “the best night of my life!” walking out of a pub in Hong Kong with the sun coming up, laughing with Bachop and former Wallabies halfback Nick Farr-Jones.\n\nThe Wallabies had played well in a losing cause and Merrick retained his spot for the second 1995 Test a week later against the All Blacks at the Sydney Football Stadium. If there was any doubt in the first Test, there was none in Sydney as the Wallabies lost 34-23. “Lomu flogged us,” Merrick remembers painfully.\n\nMerrick’s second Test was another blur, but this time for different reasons. All Blacks Zinzan Brooke and Frank Bunce crunched his shoulder badly in a tackle and after attending the post match function on pain killers, he jumped in his car and drove back to Singleton. The patrons at the packed Percy Hotel could hardly believe their Wallabies star was drinking with them having just watched him on television. “I just wanted to do my job and not look like an idiot,” says Merrick.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Merrick tackles New Zealand’s Walter Little at Eden Park on 22 July, 1995. Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images\n\nThe new Wallabies scrumhalf returned to driving trucks at the coalmine, positioned for a long playing career. Meanwhile, a civil war raged between the World Rugby Corporation, who had staged a coup by signing 500 of the best players to start an elite global competition, and the freshly-formed Sanzar unions, who with the backing of Rupert Murdoch lured players back to the establishment with juicy financial contracts.\n\nOffer and counter offer drove up players’ values while Sydney’s rugby community was a nest of intrigue; emotions were running high and lifelong friendships were severed.\n\nThe Australian Rugby Union invited Merrick and his wife down to Sydney to offer him a contract – as an incumbent Wallaby, his signature was prized. A big offer was tabled, but there were conditions: Merrick had to live in Sydney, play with the NSW Waratahs and leave bush rugby.\n\nThe important decisions often make themselves and Merrick recalls looking at his wife and sharing “a moment”. Rebecca replied: “I’d rather be poor and happy.”\n\nIn a move that caught everyone off guard, the 26-year-old Merrick said no to both sides, shunned the new era of professionalism and returned to Singleton to play footy with his mates and start a family.\n\nGeorge Gregan replaced him in the Wallabies XV and went on to become Australia’s most capped Test player, retiring in 2007 with a record 139. Merrick retired from the Singleton Bulls in 2007 having played his 300th game over a 20-year career.\n\n“I want to live in a place where you can play cricket on the street and get 20 overs in before the first car comes.” Merrick told the Sydney Morning Herald soon after.\n\nThe decision was clear and definitive. “I’ve done everything I’ve ever dreamed of in the last four weeks,” he said. “I wouldn’t be disappointed if I broke my leg and couldn’t play again. I’m off. Hooroo!”\n\nIt is the sweetest irony that after 100 years of amateurism, a working class coalminer with a rugby league background was the last man standing upholding rugby union’s amateur tradition.\n\nOver a freshly poured beer, Merrick chuckles at his brazen younger self: “I still hate Sydney,” he says. “I couldn’t live there now. People aren’t friendly, they’re angry on the roads. I need space.”\n\nCrises precipitate change and Sanzar prevailed over the rebel World Rugby Corporation, player salaries crystallised and the amateur era was officially over.\n\nMany fans argue that the quality of the game has increased but it is undeniable that modern day rugby is now less fun. Curfews, skin fold tests, alcohol bans, nutritionists, recovery, regeneration, rehydration and sponsor servicing have turned elite rugby into a job and eroded some of its core values.\n\nThe social side of the game has suffered with less interaction between players who are now managed as ‘assets’. The change was felt by elite players across the world, including former South African front rower Keith Andrews, who said: “Players don’t get to know their opponents now after the game – they’re not mates, its straight on the bus.”\n\nMerrick is not beguiled by nostalgia and has no regrets. “The game needed to go that way and it didn’t suit me,” he explains. “I was brought up to play for enjoyment and I’m equal with my team-mates. It’s never been a job for me.”\n\nMerrick is now out of the coal truck and promoted to working in the mine as a technical supervisor – a “job for life.” His daughter is at university studying to be a primary school teacher and he enjoys coaching his son. He rarely gets invited to Wallabies functions, but he’s happy in Singleton among his mates and family. In his spare time he is a long distance dirt biker, sometimes riding 1,000 kilometre days and never happier than “out on the bike”.\n\nMerrick is cautiously optimistic for the future: “It’s hard to get kids off their phones and down to training but the fundamentals still apply. If you work hard there’s nothing you can’t fix in a couple of months.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The painting ‘Steve Merrick - The Spirit of country rugby’ hangs on the wall at Singleton Bulls clubhouse.

The socialising and drinking continues in the upstairs clubhouse and pride of place on the wall is an enormous painting of Merrick donated by media king John Singleton.\n\n“The rugby spirit lives,” says Merrick, watching on as the two teams mix, sing and share stories: “Two teams with players from different backgrounds playing and drinking together for the love of it.”\n\nHis legacy, says Bachop, is clear: “He could easily have gone on to be a great player but said ‘see you later’. We played on a handshake and Steve has my full respect and the respect of the rugby community.”\n\nRugby’s beloved Scottish commentator Bill McLaren once said: “I loved rugby when it was an escape from the daily grind, now it is the daily grind.” McLaren would have been at home here at the Singleton Bulls, a beer in one hand and listening to the story of Steve Merrick, the coalminer plucked from the bush to become a Wallaby, and when asked to name his price, didn’t have one.",
  "latent_12556": "Comparisons between what TCU's Gary Patterson did entering the 2014 season and what Charlie Strong is doing heading into his second season at Texas have been running rampant throughout the offseason.\n\nBoth are defensive-minded coaches who've achieved tremendous success in their careers have had to give in to the offensive-dominated culture of the Big 12. The Horned Frogs, coming off of a 4-8 season in 2013, switched to an offense fitting the skill set of quarterback Trevone Boykin like a glove resulting in TCU finishing with a 12-1 record and a share of the Big 12 title.\n\nBut the one noticeable difference between the approaches by the two coaches is Patterson brought in Sonny Cumbie and Doug Meacham as co-offensive coordinator. Strong stuck with Shawn Watson as the assistant head coach for offense in addition to keeping the title of offensive coordinator on Joe Wickline.\n\nWhile the Longhorns didn't change their offensive hierarchy, Strong isn't making the offensive shift without help and hopes the two hires he did make can have make a huge different. Watson confirmed recently what sources have mentioned to Horns247 since the spring, which is that Jay Norvell and Jeff Traylor have been instrumental in helping the Longhorns shift to an offense capable of Texas' ability to put strain on a defense in space and play fast.\n\nThe experiences both coaches bring the table have proven to be invaluable tools for Watson, who recently said it's been “absolutely awesome” to have the Norvell and Traylor in the meeting room. The quarterbacks coach will continue to call the plays but Texas' new wide receivers coach and the man now over the tight ends and H-backs are huge reasons why the Longhorns have been able to advance the offense through spring practice and into preseason camp.\n\n“Couldn't have done it without them,” Watson said. “They've been great. They each bring a different background to the table in it.”\n\nNorvell's experience as the co-offensive coordinator at Oklahoma over the last four seasons, where he was heavily involved in the Sooners' weekly game plans, helps Texas' transition to a tempo offense in a big way. In the four years where Norvell was doing his part to lead the offense in Norman the Sooners averaged 24.4 per seconds between snaps, but he's been quick to point out when asked about Texas playing fast that it has to be done in moderation as to not lead to quick three-and-outs or be the reason a team wears down late in games.\n\n“Any style of offense is a tool,” Norvell said. “We just have to use it properly and use it to our advantage. We'll do our best to do that and our kids will understand it better the more we do it.”\n\nTraylor's time at Gilmer saw him lead one of the state's most prolific offensive attacks, including his 2014 state championship team that scored 950 points in 16 games. As has been the case with many high school coaches across Texas, Traylor remembers when he moved Gilmer to an up-tempo spread and is thrilled to be involved with the genesis of the current regime's shift to a more wide open offense.\n\n“It's been really exciting going back through it again,” Traylor said. “I think it'll help since I came in and we were on ground zero working our way up on it.”\n\nIf the offense succeeds and is able to carry its weight more often than not, which wasn't the case last season, the impact of the two new hires offensively will deserve their share of the credit and then some.",

Thankfully, the New York native, who is traditionally difficult to get on the phone, was open to revisiting his golden era glory days and reflecting on the creation of one of Hip Hop’s most coveted albums, one he suspected would become an undeniable classic.\n\n“I kind of thought it was [a classic] because when I made it, it was kind of different from everything out at the time,” Keith explains to HipHopDX. “I kind of felt that album was going to be different from than anything else in Hip Hop. I had knew the milestone back when ‘Critical Beatdown’ was out and so I knew something different was going to make a mark. The music was all different.”\n\nOver 20 years later, Dr. Octagonecologyst is not only getting a vinyl reissue, but the talented trifecta also just reunited for its first live shows ever. Prior to March 2017, Dr. Octagon had never performed as a unit. While Keith has remained active with his solo career (most recently, he dropped a full-length, Feature Magnetic) and resurrected his Analog Brothers project with Ice-T, Pimp Rex, Marc Live, and Silver Synth last year, Dr. Octagon’s seminal album was a landmark project that launched him into legendary status. It also didn’t come with massive amounts of features, something he believes dilutes any project.\n\n“Features kill an album,” he says. “I think an artist nowadays can’t hold an album by themselves. I was on the whole [Dr. Octagon] album, maybe [Sir] Menelik was on a couple tracks. Production was all Automator. It wasn’t two tracks from this person and two tracks from that person. Kool and the Gang was all Kool and the Gang. James Brown was all James Brown music. It wasn’t a feature over here and feature over there, and if there was a feature, it wasn’t a predictable one. Those are good things. Most commercial features are pretty much predictable. That’s cool once in awhile, but I think people get carried away with that stuff.”\n\nFrom his stint with the Ultramagnetic MCs to his incarnation as the Black Elvis, Keith has become a master of reinvention, and continues to evolve. In his opinion, however, many current rappers don’t take their image seriously and with so many features on their records, he believes it’s led to the lack of classic albums.\n\n“So many features makes it seem like the artist can’t handle his own,” he explains. “He’s not interesting enough to carry his own, so you have to flood him out with a bunch of features, and soon the features become the stars on their own album. You start thinking the guest wrote the album.\n\n“It’s the image, too,” he adds. “Rap came too far to dumb it down. That’s why people don’t take it seriously. People got their stereotype on rap. Like, ‘Oh, rappers look like they’re going to snatch my pocketbook.’ A rapper not supposed to really look like that. They supposed to be the star.”\n\nFor now, Keith is focused on keeping his skills sharp as he kicks off another tour with the rest of Dr. Octagon throughout the months of May and June. At 53 years old, he’s like the Mick Jagger of Hip Hop and we’ll most likely be hearing about Keith for years to come.\n\n“Rap is a sport,” he says. “You have to keep it up. It’s like if you don’t shoot no ball for a while, you’re going to get out a shape. Some guys can’t adjust. You hear Big Sean rap fast or Drake’s cadences. It don’t bother me. Shit, I did Octagon.”",
  "latent_12601": "You Thought MS Dhoni Was Finished As A Finisher? He Just Proved You Wrong With Another Last Ball-6 Win\n\nYou Thought MS Dhoni Was Finished As A Finisher? He Just Proved You Wrong With Another Last Ball-6 Win\n\nAFP\n\nExpect Mahendra Singh Dhoni to do the unthinkable. Just when you were starting to wonder where has his Midas Touch disappeared, where are the big hits from his blade, where is the helicopter shot, where are the victories, he does exactly that. Dhoni lit up today's Indian Premier League dead rubber match with his match-winning 32-ball 64 not out that took Rising Pune Supergiants to a four-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab that helped his team avoid the last position in the points table this season.\n\nChasing KXIP's 172/7, Dhoni was once again at the helm trying to do the most difficult task for his side - taking them over the line when the 20th over started. Left-arm spinner Axar Patel was the bowler and 23 runs were needed in 6 balls.\n\nAFP\n\nHere's How It Happened\n\nThe first one was a dot ball and a second ball was wide. With 22 runs needed from 5 balls, Dhoni only had his bat in hand and some real level of self-belief in himself. Riding that, he hammered Patel for a six over deep mid-wicket on the second ball. Third ball he hit in the deep but didn't take the single. With 16 to get from 3 balls, he hammered one over covers for four. Second last ball was smashed over square-leg for another six. Six to win from the final ball and the crowd knew they were up for something special. Without much fuss, Dhoni unveiled his trademark helicopter shot on Patel and deposited the ball into the mid-wicket fence to the joy of everyone in the stadium. Below is the last-ball six:\n\nDon't Miss 241 SHARES 246 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES 15.5 K SHARES 156 SHARES\n\nInsta\n\nHopefully, Dhoni's man-of-the-match effort does silence his critics who were discussing whether or not he should quit all forms of the game. He definitely has answered that query with the bat in hand. A 64 from 32 balls that is punched with 4 fours and 5 sixes is enough proof that Dhoni, even at 34, is here to stay.\n\nAs a team, Dhoni's side may have definitely not made it to the play-offs but still five wins in 14 games with bulk of the overseas players back home due to injury, Rising Pune Supergiants's opening season could've gone a lot worse had it not been for their captain.\n\nHere's how fans reacted to Dhoni on twitter:\n\n23 needed to win off the last over?\n\nNot a problem for MS Dhoni!\n\nStill the world's greatest finisher...#RPSvKXIP pic.twitter.com/KCOeVAMOWn — BreatheSport (@BreatheSport) May 21, 2016\n\nLike rum and coke.\n\nLike movies and popcorn.\n\nLike pizza and oregano.\n\nDhoni & last ball six.\n\nMatch made in heaven!#RPSvKXIP — Rashi Kakkar (@rashi_kakkar) May 21, 2016\n\nHe Is He Will & Always Will Be Best Finisher In The World Dhoni You Make Fans Proud What A Knock Man Luv U Mahi #RPSvKXIP — Bhushan Khiladi (@Bhushanadhau1) May 21, 2016\n\nWow what a finish that by @msdhoni bhai.

  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nJust a week after leaving Boston for a summer internship in California, our 21-year-old son landed in an emergency room and was put on a suicide watch. I’m going to ruin the suspense and tell you what happened: His roommate told him to help himself to the food in the fridge, and he ate a marijuana-laced chocolate bar meant to be consumed as six servings.\n\nFrom my son’s perspective, he was simply cooking dinner while eating a chocolate bar, and suddenly he found his mind and world turning inside out. Thinking he was dying, he called 911. Paramedics found him lying on the front lawn, out of his mind and without any explanation.\n\nTerrified, he called us from the emergency room. He couldn’t remember the names of his siblings.\n\nA team of doctors deemed him a danger to himself and sent him to a rehab facility for a planned 72-hour watch. I was asked questions over the phone like, “Has your son ever experienced episodes of depression or mania before?” I was on the first flight out to California the next morning, worried sick.\n\nI went to his apartment to pack pajamas and a toothbrush for his observation stay. I cleaned out his pants pocket and threw the candy-bar wrapper into the trash, where his roommate later found it and texted me, “I think I know what happened.” Fortunately, I was able to explain the situation to the doctor on duty, and my son was released that day.\n\nOur son’s toxic trip sheds light on the alarming health dangers that marijuana-infused chocolate, candy and other snacks and drinks pose to those who might mistake them for innocuous treats. He ate a one-ounce 4:20 Bar made by the Venice Cookie Company. His was milk chocolate; the bars also come in dark chocolate, toffee and other flavors. On its website, the company advises, “Until you know the effects of this product, eat only half a segment and wait 75 minutes before consuming another portion.”\n\nMy hungry son did not do that. Would your 6- or 12-year-old? As a recent article in The Times, “Snacks Laced With Marijuana Raise Concerns”, points out, it’s tough to regulate a drug disguised as candy. We live in a society that’s used to keeping alcohol away from children, with kids who are accustomed to the idea that an unfamiliar can or bottle might contain a “grown-up drink.” Candy, though, has always represented an innocent temptation. According to a July 2013 JAMA Pediatrics article, significant toxic reactions to marijuana in children can include anxiety, hallucinations, panic episodes, respiratory distress and coma. Do we want this to happen to our kids? Because it will, as long as potent levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, take the form of enticing sweets.\n\nI am not against medical marijuana. I voted in favor of Question 3 in Massachusetts in November 2012, which legalized the use of medical marijuana in the state. What I am against is the marketing of products that look and taste like candy, contain potent levels of THC, and are not sold in child-resistant, tamper-proof packaging. Yes, kids ingest all sorts of medication and harmful products. But those products are not designed to mimic candy. The 4:20 Bar, for example, doesn’t look like a vitamin, or medicine. It just looks tasty, and if your vocabulary doesn’t include THC or cannabis, there’s no obvious reason not to consume it.\n\nThe most frightening part of our experience was not knowing what had happened to our son. He wasn’t a young guy who thought he’d try marijuana, ate too much and freaked out from the effects. He thought he was eating a candy bar.\n\nBy allowing the production and sale of appealing THC-laced sweets, we are headed down a sticky path in protecting children from accidental drug ingestion. Experts agree that the wider availability of edible marijuana now that recreational marijuana can be sold in Colorado and Washington will escalate the problem by increasing availability. Based on my son’s experience, I can only believe that will be the case.",

  "latent_13031": "He got 'Crossfire' canceled, told Larry King CNN was \"terrible\" and relentlessly destroyed Jim Cramer. Now, with his final show airing on Aug. 6, the 'Daily Show' icon leaves behind a blistering comedic legacy … and a gaping satiric void.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Aug. 7 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe.\n\nOn Nov. 4, 2008, the night Barack Obama was elected president, I was sitting with the audience of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart in its studio on the west side of Manhattan. No one would have been gobsmacked by the rooting interests that night of both the guests or the host. Stewart has never hidden his point of view; and on this night he looked, to put it simply, pumped.\n\nThe show was a live election-night special. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report was co-anchoring, and, as the returns came in, the celebratory mood grew in intensity. When the news networks called enough states to make it official, Stewart looked straight into the camera and told his audience: \"At 11 o'clock at night, Eastern Standard Time, the president of the United States is … Barack Obama.\"\n\nAs the crowd unleashed a roar of approval (and Colbert did his best faux harrumphing, saying it was still only a \"maybe\"), Stewart exerted a visible effort to swallow down the grin that threatened to explode across his face. It was only after he left the air a short while later that the explosion came, as first he and Colbert shared what looked like a victory hug, and then Jon met his wife, Tracey, who was in the audience, and they also embraced.\n\nThat night was momentous both for Obama and Stewart, who cemented his position as the comic voice (and conscience) of the political left-of-center in 21st century America. Since then, Stewart has used that position to become the left's most trusted critic of political hypocrisy and mendacity.\n\nStewart usually was seen as an ardent defender and friendly host during frequent (seven) Obama appearances — though he took on the president over several issues where he was disappointed, including veterans affairs and the massively botched launch of Obamacare. So it certainly rang a bit discordantly July 23 when the former correspondent (and the show's only black writer at the time), Wyatt Cenac, described a charged confrontation with the host over what Cenac perceived as a racially insensitive impression of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. Cenac recounted a shouting match that ended with Stewart telling him he was \"done with him.\"\n\nStewart's bona fides as a progressive on race are legit and long. Most recently he won huge praise for his heartfelt commentary on the slaughter of black churchgoers by a white supremacist in Charleston, S.C.; he also was singularly responsible for promoting black comic and writer Larry Wilmore — first on The Daily Show and then as Stewart's handpicked successor to Colbert on the 11:30 p.m. Comedy Central program The Nightly Show, which Stewart produces. Wilmore has been effusive to me in his praise for Stewart's generosity and leadership.\n\nThe Cenac episode stirred a round of surprised reactions, though veterans of the show know well that Stewart can be a demanding boss. But the incident is likely to have little impact on Stewart's legacy as he heads for his exit from the show on Aug. 6. Mainly that departure is expected to leave a void for loyal followers of liberal causes, though it also may inspire sighs of relief from the horde of public officials Jon has eviscerated over the years.\n\nThe only place those sighs will echo louder is within the newsrooms of the major media enterprises, which have, if anything, endured an even worse bludgeoning thanks to Stewart's relentless scrutiny. It is no exaggeration to say it: When Jon Stewart goes, the country will be losing the most focused, fiercest and surely funniest media critic of the past two decades.\n\nAs one longtime executive at CNN put it to me: \"The irony always was that most people in the place truly enjoyed his show, never missed it. So it was always incredibly painful that he would attack us the way he did.\" And oh he did. When Larry King asked him directly why he picked on CNN so much, Stewart memorably fired back: \"You're terrible!\" Terrible, in Stewart's view, for blowing stories (like \"poop cruises\" or missing planes) out of proportion; for substituting holograms of reporters in place of substantive news; for foisting on viewers what he perceived as poseurs (favorite Stewart pinatas included Tucker Carlson, Rick Sanchez and Eliot Spitzer — none of whom survived long after the eviscerations); but mainly for not living up to Stewart's — and by extension his viewers' — expectations.\n\nInside CNN, many felt Stewart's barbed contempt tilted unfairly in their direction — and it may have, because it sprang from chagrined disappointment more than pure disdain. Colleagues reported that Wolf Blitzer took Stewart's hectoring especially hard. (Among other instances, Stewart memorably spit-roasted Blitzer the night CNN jumped the gun to report the Supreme Court had overturned Obamacare, only to backtrack with Blitzer citing \"widely different\" reports.)\n\nBut CNN hardly was lonely inside the Stewart bull's-eye. The litany of Stewart takedowns of media figures and institutions extended across the television and print landscape. In June, Stewart kicked The New York Times around for nitpicking at Marco Rubio for his traffic tickets and buying a boat while in debt. \"Paying off law school loans. How dare you?\" Stewart jabbed at the Times. \"At long last, senator, have you no sense of insolvency?\"\n\nThe Fox News Channel took Stewart's wrath particularly hard. Officially, Fox News has been largely dismissive of Stewart as just another lefty ideologue who mocked the conservative-leaning channel to gin up ratings. But star anchor Megyn Kelly once acknowledged that an especially comprehensive takedown of her by Stewart had reduced her to tears.\n\nStewart never has disputed his ideological differences with the network, conceding, as he did in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, that there was \"a special place in our hearts for Fox.\" Nor has he run from his identifiably progressive point of view. \"My comedy is informed by an ideological background,\" he told Chris Wallace on Fox. He argued, though, that he was neither a rigid ideologue nor an activist. His friendly interaction with Fox's Bill O'Reilly seemed genuine (which consistently surprised his harder-left fans), and he took O'Reilly's jibes (\"You have an audience of stoned slackers who love Obama\") with apparently unflappable good humor. Both hosts clearly benefited from the cross-cultural exchanges.\n\nMSNBC got ladled into that soup as well. Stewart told Maddow her network was just as guilty of the sin of setting out to \"amplify division\" in the country. When the network's Chris Matthews visited to pump his memoir, Life's a Campaign, Stewart's jaundiced reaction led Matthews to accuse the host of \"trashing my book.\" No, Stewart said, he wasn't trashing the book, he was \"trashing your philosophy of life.\"\n\nAnd then there was CNBC, whose host Jim Cramer came in for perhaps the most classic Daily Show disemboweling. With Cramer having denied he proposed a buy on Bear Stearns after the investment firm's epic collapse, Stewart pulled the clips. \"Very big upside, very limited downside,\" Cramer was caught saying on tape. When Cramer appeared as a guest to defend himself, arguing that there was a market on television for stock-touting, Stewart responded: \"There's a market for cocaine and hookers!\" (Stewart later acknowledged he probably went too far chewing on Cramer.)\n\nStewart clearly has had an impact on other media careers and decisions, most notably on the termination of the political debate show Crossfire on CNN. The then-CEO of the network, Jon Klein, said when he canceled the show in 2005 that he was \"firmly in the Jon Stewart camp\" on the issue of cable news offering too much partisan arguing. One veteran CNN executive told me that Stewart's determined efforts to hold that network's feet to the fire had had an impact all the way to the top of CNN's management. \"The purists at the network\" began to make the argument that Stewart was \"not a comic curmudgeon but a truth-teller.\"\n\nTruth is often subjective in contemporary media, of course. Fox News' Kelly accused Stewart of having \"no foothold in the facts.\" Few other charges would be more likely to raise Stewart's hackles. Some of his most effective media critiques have been built around scrupulous fact-based research, the kind other media outlets might have done had they been as thorough.\n\nIn May, in response to what he saw as deliberately skewed Fox News coverage of Obama's policies on poverty, Stewart tossed the Fox host Stuart Varney on his grill. After a shot of Varney saying Fox never criticized the \"recipients\" of welfare, Stewart showed clip after clip of Varney disdaining the poor, saying they aren't really poor because they own things like refrigerators and microwaves, and what they really lack is \"a richness of spirit.\"\n\n\"If you see a boy on crutches, push him down,\" Stewart said, in his best Dickens voice, as though shouting out the window as Scrooge on Christmas morning. \"He's not crippled. He's crippled at heart. He lacks a richness of legness.\" How could Fox News be so unaware of these \"glaring contradictions,\" he said, in how their protestations of innocence were undermined by a raft of previous coverage? \"Is it a product of lack of self-awareness, or cynicism or stupidity or evil?\" Stewart asked, clearly boggled.\n\nStewart then expanded the critique to include commentary on MSNBC by Mike Barnicle, who said he had never heard the poor described on Fox in terms like \"lazy, sponges and leeches.\" \"Well, I guess it's time for our favorite game show: Did You Even Try to Research This?\" Stewart said, incredulous, introducing clips where Fox commentators used those exact words. Time and again, The Daily Show under Stewart embarrassed other quarters of the media as its assiduous video researchers ferreted out precise examples of hypocrisy or outright lying.\n\nPresumably the holdover staff can keep up that standard after Stewart is gone. (Comedy Central's talent drain — with Stewart, Colbert, John Oliver and Key & Peele all gone in the span of about a year — has left much of the rest of the television business boggled.) But replacing the filter of his high expectations and righteous anger will be much more difficult.\n\nStewart always twisted himself into a knot denying that he held a significant place in the world of journalism or media — or criticism. He professed to be a comic, first and always. \"There is no honor in what I do, but I do it as honorably as I can,\" said Stewart (getting it half right). \"I don't take any satisfaction in just being a critic.\" Many of his viewers certainly did.\n\nBill Carter has covered television for 40 years, mostly at 'The New York Times,' and is a CNN contributor.",

Jasmine Hirsch, left, at an afterparty for an In Pursuit of Balance tasting in 2015. Photo: Courtesy Photo Photo: Courtesy Photo Image 1 of / 12 Caption Close Influential wine organization In Pursuit of Balance to cease operations 1 / 12 Back to Gallery\n\nIn Pursuit of Balance (IPOB), a nonprofit organization of California wineries who champion a restrained style of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, has announced that it will cease operations at the end of 2016.\n\n“There’s so much energy and excitement around IPOB,” said Jasmine Hirsch, who co-founded the organization with Rajat Parr. “On the one hand, it maybe seems strange to close it now, but we also really feel like the conversation in California has changed. We’ve really reached the apex of what we feel IPOB can contribute.”\n\nThat, and both Hirsch and Parr want to dedicate more time to their own individual (for-profit) winery ventures. The demands of running a nonprofit, Hirsch said, were becoming unrealistic.\n\nHirsch, who runs her family’s Hirsch Vineyards on the Sonoma Coast, and Parr, the longtime wine director for Michael Mina’s restaurants and owner of the Santa Barbara wineries Sandhi and Domaine de la Cote, established IPOB in 2011. The idea was simple: to hold tastings, both for trade and for consumers, featuring a group of like-minded California wineries who produce wines that embody a principle of “balance.” The tastings, held in several different cities each year, would aim to generate a larger conversation.\n\n“Balance,” of course, is vague. In the context of IPOB, the term was often interpreted to mean wines that are lower in alcohol and higher in acid — a much-needed departure, the group believed, from the boozier, flabbier style of wine that had dominated California for decades prior.\n\nToday, the equation of alcohol and acid can feel like the only conversation within the wine industry. But “in 2011, not as many people were talking about it,” Hirsch said. “We felt we were responding to a need that had to be addressed.” Now that the conversation has proliferated — perhaps excessively — does IPOB still need to exist?\n\n“We think we’ve achieved that, and it’s time to move on,” Hirsch said.\n\nThe visibility and influence that IPOB managed to achieve is perhaps unprecedented for a roaming tasting event. Certainly, its promotion of restrained-styled wines coincided with other thought leaders, like writers and sommeliers, celebrating lower alcohol levels. Critics of the group accused it of attacking other styles of wines; of co-opting the principle of “balance,” which, many asserted, is much more complicated than alcohol and acid; of becoming a cool-kids club who only scratched the backs of their friends. The wine critic Robert Parker once famously referred to their like as the “anti-flavor wine elite.”\n\nHirsch acknowledged these criticisms and defended her group’s mission. “I think that IPOB has been misunderstood,” she said. “Some of that was our fault — we weren’t very good at the beginning about communicating about what our mission was.” There has never been a maximum-alcohol requirement, she insists; the wines have always been chosen by blind tasting.\n\nBut to the extent that IPOB has become a stand-in term for wines of restraint, Hirsch is not bothered: “We are champions of that movement.”\n\nThe IPOB wineries are expected to reunite one last time for a tasting in San Francisco in November, though the plans have not been finalized. “San Francisco is where we got started, and where we feel is the right place to end,” Hirsch said.\n\nStay tuned for more news about that tasting, and further thoughts on IPOB’s legacy.\n\nCurrent winery members of IPOB:\n\nAu Bon Climat Winery\n\nBig Basin Vineyards\n\nCalera Wine Company\n\nCeritas\n\nChanin Wine Company\n\nCobb Wines\n\nCopain Wines\n\nDomaine de la Côte\n\nDrew Family Cellars\n\nFailla\n\nHanzell Vineyards\n\nHirsch Vineyards\n\nKnez Winery\n\nKutch Wines\n\nLaRue Wines\n\nLIOCO\n\nLiquid Farm\n\nLittorai Wines\n\nLUTUM Wines\n\nMatthiasson Family Vineyards\n\nMignanelli Winery\n\nMindego Ridge\n\nMount Eden Vineyards\n\nNative9 Wines\n\nOjai Vineyard\n\nPoe Wines\n\nPresqu’ile Winery\n\nRed Car\n\nSandhi Wines\n\nSmall Vines Wines\n\nThomas Fogarty Winery\n\nTwomey Cellars\n\nTyler Winery\n\nVarner\n\nWenzlau Vineyard",

Sadly, Sir Stirling fell three floors inside the lift shaft and suffered two broken ankles and several other broken bones in the foot. There was some damage to his vertebrae but not internal injuries. He was admitted to the London Hospital and then moved yesterday following the intervention of Professor Sid Watkins to the Princess Grace Hospital, where he was operated upon. It is hoped that he will be moved out of the Intensive Care Unit later today and Lady Moss reports that he is in remarkably good spirits and already complaining about the size and quality of the hospital breakfast.\n\nMoss (80) is always considered to have been the greatest F1 driver never to win the World Championship. he raced in F1 between 1954 and 1962, when his career ended with a bad crash at Goodwood. He suffered serious head injuries. He was knighted for his extraordinary service to the sport in January 2000.\n\nMoss is best remembered for his behaviour in 1958 when his sporting attitude cost him the World Championship when he stood up for rival Mike Hawthorn, who faced a penalty in Portugal that would, in retrospect, have denied him the points that he needed to beat Moss. Stirling never for one moment entertained any thought of gaining an advantage in such a way, and in any case his natural sense of justice would not have allowed him to see Hawthorn unjustly penalised. So he stepped forward to defend him. Hawthorn subsequently went on to beat Moss by a mere point, even though he had only won one race that year to Moss’s four. That was sufficient to make Mike Hawthorn Britainís first World Champion.",

  "latent_13803": "LONDON—One afternoon last week at The Cock Tavern, Allan Gow and Callum Herod were on a rant about how “bollocks” shouldn’t be classified as an unacceptable word.\n\nThe 18th-century pub, close to London’s Oxford Street, recently banned the use of expletives, and the two former military men were voicing objections.\n\n“You just can’t ban swearing in a place where they serve alcohol,” said Mr. Gow, 63, over a pint of Organic Lager. “That’s bullshit.”\n\n“Tell whoever issued this ridiculous policy,” said Mr. Herod, 64, “to go stuff themselves.”\n\nSamuel Smith Old Brewery, the 250-year-old brewery that operates The Cock Tavern and more than 200 other pubs across Britain, in April instituted a “zero-tolerance policy” against swearing—the first time, pub historians say, a British pub chain has sought an official ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pubs’ “landlords,” as the British call tavern operators, have been instructed to refuse orders from foul-mouthed drinkers and have begun ejecting some patrons who refuse to curb their cursing.\n\nThat ban may or may not include “bollocks,” British slang for testicles and nonsense. A Cock Tavern bartender declined to comment on the word.\n\nThe Cock Tavern is part of Samuel Smith’s nationwide ban on swearing in its pubs.Photo: ALI KATE CHERKIS for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLandlords said the edict, which wasn’t publicly announced, was communicated by Samuel Smith’s in an April memo they said doesn’t list unacceptable words.\n\n“Where do you draw the line?” asked a landlord at a Samuel Smith’s pub in Northwest London. “Is ‘bloody’ a swear word? It’s quite confusing.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamuel Smith’s didn’t respond to inquiries.\n\nOther bars clamping down on cursing include Wetherspoon’s, the U.K.’s largest pub chain, which last year expanded its management training to help landlords muzzle their more loquacious patrons, stopping short of a ban.\n\n“The hierarchy of pub conversation is like the Ten Commandments,” said J D Wetherspoon PLC Chairman Tim Martin. “There’s a word or two that are completely off limits, but the general rule is you don’t swear at people.”\n\nSome independent landlords are taking their own irreverent approaches, with one popular sign demanding: “No Bloody Swearing!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anti-profanity push, intended to lure families, is the latest chapter in a decadeslong shift in British drinking culture that has transformed thousands of traditional beer houses into bijou bars and gastropubs—establishments serving high-end food and craft beer.\n\nMany of those changes have been popular. But the move to call time on swearing has prompted searching questions on whether pub culture and colorful language—cornerstones of British cultural life—should ever be separated.\n\nThe English are proud of the range of their profane vernacular. A popular book is “Roger’s Profanisaurus,” a 624-page dictionary of about 12,000 profanities that commentators say is a whistle-stop tour of the most disgusting expressions the language has to offer.\n\nMoreover, “the British pub is an institution where people go to enjoy themselves, an informal place where class and salary are forgotten,” said Tom Stainer of the Campaign for Real Ale, or CAMRA, an organization that says it represents 187,000 beer drinkers around the world. “We don’t need rules to restrict that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPetr Knava, a 29-year-old public-health worker and longtime Samuel Smith’s patron, promised to unleash a barrage of blasphemy at the pubs to protest “this shitmonkey of a decision,” which he calls “arse-backwards twattery.”\n\nInside The Horse and Groom, London.Photo: Georgi Kantchev/The Wall Street\n\nSam Eeles, a 31-year-old software engineer, was working his way through the “The Sam Smith’s Challenge”—a tour of the brewer’s three dozen pubs in London—when he and his friends were repeatedly reprimanded for swearing.\n\n“It feels like you’re sitting in your grandma’s lounge,” he said, “after you’ve been told to watch your language.”\n\nSamuel Smith’s, whose website boasts of its “uncompromisingly Victorian” traditions—its pubs are known for Victorian-era décor and cheap drinks—has kept tight-lipped on the reasons for the ban.\n\nSeveral Samuel Smith’s pubs visited by The Wall Street Journal displayed signs reading: “We wish to inform all of our customers that we have introduced a zero-tolerance policy against swearing in all of our pubs.”\n\nMelissa Gillespie, a 20-year-old bartender at The Horse and Groom in London’s Fitzrovia District, polices the ban by first pointing to the sign or holding it aloft. Formal warnings follow. She said she hasn’t kicked anyone out.\n\n“Regulars come here to take pictures of the sign because they can’t believe we would implement it,” she said. “One man I showed the sign said he couldn’t stop swearing because he had a chronic case of Tourette’s. I wasn’t sure how to react.”\n\nAt the Widow Cullens Well, a Samuel Smith’s pub in the English East Midlands city of Lincoln, manager James Piazza said he recently had to eject a “massive group of 17 blokes” for repeatedly swearing. “I’m lucky they didn’t beat me up.”\n\nMind Your Manners! Over their history, English pubs have endured bans on musicians, cockfights, darts, duck baiting and indoor archery. 1189: Ye Olde Jerusalem, the UK’s oldest pub, opens its doors.\n\n1656: Oliver Cromwell’s puritanical government bans musicians from playing in pubs.\n\n1849: Prevention of cruelty to animals attempts to stop cock fighting and duck baiting -- a fight in a pond pitting a dog against a duck with its wings constrained -- in UK pubs. Many of the names of UK pubs -- The Cock, or the Dog & Duck -- hint at this darker past.\n\n1917: Amid claims that productivity is being hampered by drunkenness, pubs reduce opening times and alcohol strength. The Defence of the Realm Act forbids ‘treating’—patrons’ buying each other drinks—to reduce binge-drinking in towns where munitions are manufactured.\n\n1930s: Licensing justices in Liverpool and Huddersfield rule that darts should be banned in pubs because the game contributes to excessive drinking, drunkenness and danger.\n\n1950s: Pubs in Southern England move to ban indoor archery after some establishments allow teams to fire arrows against a dartboard.\n\nDespite their freewheeling reputation, British pubs for centuries sought to shape behavior according to fashions of the day. In 1656, Oliver Cromwell’s puritanical government banned musicians from playing in pubs.\n\nDuring World War I, the Defence of the Realm Act forbade “treating”—patrons’ buying each other drinks—to reduce binge-drinking in towns where munitions were manufactured.\n\nA Wetherspoon pub last year banned tracksuits and baseball caps. Some pubs have put an embargo on bare chests.\n\nBack at The Cock Tavern, Messrs. Gow and Herod weren’t booted for their impolite words, including the bollocks.\n\nSome drinkers noted the ban could see them ejected for mentioning the name of the pub in the wrong context. Others insisted swearing and storytelling were part of the essential nature of British pubs.\n\n“Swearing is the language that accentuates stories. It gets across your emotional response in a visceral way,” said Matt Hill, a 30-year-old sound engineer from North London. “What better place to do that than the pub?,” he said. “For want of a better word people won’t give a shit.”\n\nWrite to Joe Parkinson at joe.parkinson@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com",

Last season he played in 64 games for Memphis Grizzlies, averaging 6.7 points and four rebounds off the bench.\n\nMcRae starred with Melbourne United two years ago before he also got to play with James after being acquired by Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2015-16 NBA season.\n\nPerry Ellis Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nFerguson broke new ground last year when he signed with Adelaide, becoming the first import to play in the NBL straight out of high school.

He spent the year with the Greensboro Swarm in the NBA Development League, appearing in all 50 games and averaging 9.8 points and 4.7 rebounds.\n\nSydney coach Andrew Gaze contacted Ellis's agent a few months ago and a contract was soon on the table. Ellis has been playing with Minnesota in the NBA Summer League and arrives in Australia in September.\n\n\"I haven't talked to anybody directly about [playing in Australia], but I've heard from people that know people who've been there and they said they loved it,\" he tells ESPN. \"There's a lot of things you can't control but I want to play basketball as long as I can, and whatever path is met, that's the path I'm going. Some other options were mentioned but nothing that was really eye-opening. Playing with Sydney seemed like the best option.\"\n\nHailing from a close-knit family, Ellis credits his older sister for positively influencing his work habits in high school and college -- both on and off the court. Boasting a degree in sports management, he has always taken education seriously, earning the title of class valedictorian in high school and Big 12 men's basketball scholar-athlete of the year in his junior and senior years.\n\n\"Balancing those things is tough to do, so it's a cool thing looking back on it now,\" the 23-year-old Wichita native said.\n\nTerrence Ferguson Morne de Klerk/Getty Images\n\n\"At a young age I got to watch my sister and learned a lot from her. She helped me a lot and showed me the way, and I kind of just followed in her footsteps.\"\n\nThe move to Sydney will be his maiden trip to Australia, but Ellis is no novice traveller.\n\n\"This will be my first big move coming out of college, but I got to travel a lot with KU and play overseas, which was pretty cool, so I'm just excited about coming to Sydney,\" he says.\n\nAnd he is confident he will be a comfortable fit at the Kings.\n\nLatest news & video - delivered to you SUBSCRIBE\n\n\"On the court, I'm someone that runs the floor really well, takes off the dribble really well and shoots stretch range,\" he says. \"Off the court, I'm just a guy who's willing to do whatever it takes to help out and be the best player I can be.\n\nIf he doesn't ever crack the NBA, Ellis is happy to consider that he might \"just\" get to travel the world as a professional basketballer \"because not a lot of people get to do that\".\n\n\"My ultimate goal is to get to the NBA, but if it doesn't happen, it is what it is. You move on and continue playing, wherever that might be. That's my mindset.\"",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nIsrael needs to reach peace with the Palestinians to avoid becoming a binational state, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday.\n\nHe stressed, however, that the core of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians was not territory, but rather a Palestinian unwillingness to recognize Israel’s legitimacy within any boundaries.\n\nNetanyahu’s comments at a meeting with top Foreign Ministry officials came amid signs of revived motion on the Palestinian track . He made similar comments during a meeting later in the day with five US congressmen, giving the impression that he was staking out a pre-negotiation position.“We’re engaged right now in an effort that we appreciate, led by [US] President [Barack] Obama and Secretary [of State John] Kerry to restart the peace negotiations between us and the Palestinians,” Netanyahu told the delegation headed by Rep. Ed Royce (R-California).“We’re eager to do it; we have no preconditions and we think there shouldn’t be any preconditions to restart negotiations,” he said.He added, however, that for the negotiations to succeed, they have to rest on two basic pillars: “One is that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state, and second that Israel has solid security arrangements.”At the Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, Netanyahu said the root of the conflict was not territorial.“It started long before 1967.You saw what happened when we left Gaza. We uprooted the last settler, and what did we get in return? Missiles,” he said.“The unwillingness of the Palestinians to recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people is the root of the conflict,” he said. “If we reach an agreement, I want to know that the conflict does not continue, and that there are no other Palestinian claims afterward.”Explaining the context of Netanyahu’s remarks, one government official said that there was “currently a great deal of effort to get the process back on track, and we might be getting close to talks.”As a result, he said, these issues are “more relevant again.”Netanyahu’s comments came two days after an Arab League delegation in Washington, following meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and Kerry, indicated it would accept in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative a slight modification to the pre- 1967 lines as part of an Israel- Palestinian peace accord.Kerry on Tuesday afternoon in Washington heaped praise on the Arab League delegation for what he said was essentially the relaunching of their initiative. He said that initiative will ensure that if Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement, the 22- member Arab League, as well as the 57 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, would consider the conflict over, normalize relations with Israel, sign peace agreements with Israel and provide security for all regional states.“I don’t underestimate the significance of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, [United] Arab Emirates, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, and others coming to the table and saying, “We are prepared to make peace now in 2013,” he said.Netanyahu, meanwhile, urged the Foreign Ministry staff to stress over and over in their messaging that the root of the conflict was not Yitzhar in Samaria but rather Acre, Jaffa and Ashkelon.“You need to say that,” he said. “There is no need to apologize, you need to tell the truth.”He did not directly address the Arab League move.“The root of the conflict is not territorial,” he said at the meeting, his first with the Foreign Ministry since the elections and his taking over as foreign minister until the fate of Avigdor Liberman is determined in court.In addition to discussing the diplomatic situation, he also heard complaints about budgetary constraints facing the ministry and the fact that some of its traditional duties had been parceled off to other ministries.One participant at the meeting said that when asked about the ministry’s budgetary problems, Netanyahu replied simply, “Lousy strategy and big money get no results. Good strategy, little money, get good results.” He made no promises of a bigger budget.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_13969": "The Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar (commonly called the Hershey's Bar , or more simply the Hershey Bar ) is the flagship chocolate bar of the Hershey Company . Hershey refers to it as \"The Great American Chocolate Bar.\" The Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar was first sold in 1900, followed by the Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds variety, which began production in 1908.\n\nThe Hershey Process milk chocolate in these bars uses fresh milk delivered directly from local farms. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and produced the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, especially in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a company and trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This flavor gives the product a particular sour, \"tangy\" taste that the US public has come to associate with the taste of chocolate, to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.[1] The American bar's taste profile was not as popular with the Canadian public, leading Hershey to introduce a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983.[2]\n\nUntil 2015, Hershey also added polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) to their chocolate, which contributed to the difference in taste between Hershey chocolates and European chocolates.[3] Artificial vanillin was also removed in 2015.[4]",

This growth is reflected not only by volumes but by all the main financial indicators and shows how the company today is solid and well prepared for future challenges,” said Claudio Domenicali, Ducati CEO.\n\n“Key financials confirm that Ducati’s growth is on a consistently upward curve,” added CFO André Stoffels. “We maintain our high investment level and increase significantly our positive net cash flow.”\n\nThe 2015 result is also the fruit of the company’s constant investment in new technologies and new models. This investment effort has enabled Ducati to present nine new models for 2016, including the XDiavel, Multistrada 1200 Enduro and Scrambler Sixty2, with which Ducati has entered three new segments — the cruiser, off-road and the below-500cc capacity segments, respectively. Thanks to this further enlargement of the product range, Ducati can look to the future with optimism and confidence and expect to continue its growth trend.\n\nThe sales network of the motorcycles manufacturer now includes more than 720 dealers in over 90 countries and, in the course of 2015, has led to an increase in deliveries in almost all the world regions. North America is confirmed as Ducati’s largest market, with 12,136 delivered motorcycles, an increase of 14 percent compared to 2014. In Italy, the company achieved a 53 percent increase in sales for a total of 6,569 motorcycles. Other sales records were achieved in the rest of Europe, where Ducati increased total deliveries by 31.2 percent to 21,473 units, with a 24 percent increase in Germany and a 37 percent increase in the United Kingdom.\n\nAsia-Pacific area markets also trended well: Ducati delivered 6,502 motorcycles (12 percent increase) in total in these regions, also strengthening its presence in China, up by 46 percent.\n\nToday, Ducati Group has a total of 1,541 employees, with 137 new hirings in the course of the past year and around 100 planned for 2016.",

  "latent_14267": "Justin Brake, reporter and editor at Newfoundland and Labrador’s The Independent, has been charged with disobeying a court order and mischief concerning property over $5000 for following demonstrators onto the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric construction site in October 2016. That month, Brake — despite covering the protest as a journalist — was named in a court order specifying that demonstrators could face arrest if they did not leave the site.\n\nThe charges were first announced in an RCMP news release Tuesday that did not include the names of the accused.\n\n“We will obviously be arguing vigorously in the courts that as a journalist I have the right to report on stories of such critical importance and that I shouldn’t be charged criminally for doing that,” Brake tells CANADALAND.\n\nReporters Without Borders, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE), and other journalists have condemned the proceedings against Brake and spoken out in his support.\n\n“This is a serious threat to press freedom,” says CJFE executive director Tom Henheffer. “This is a well-known tactic, that they can prevent coverage by saying journalists can’t come in. We know that the RCMP has a long history of brutality when it comes to Indigenous protestors, so it’s critically important to have a journalist there as an observer. Journalists need to be able to do their jobs.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time in Canada that a journalist has been charged with entering private property in the course of their reporting. In another instance, Montreal journalist Cori Marshall was charged for covering the occupation of an Immigration Canada office in May 2016.\n\nIn October, activists cut a lock to access the Muskrat Falls construction site as part of their demonstration against the project, which they are concerned will harm the environment. In total, 18 men and 10 women will face a total of 60 charges including disobeying a court order, mischief, mischief over $5000, taking a motor vehicle without consent, and breaches of a court order.\n\nAccording to the RCMP release:\n\nThe RCMP respects and protects the right to peaceful demonstrations as guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The role of the RCMP when unlawful acts occur during a demonstration is to ensure public safety, preserve the peace and enforce the law while upholding the fundamental freedom of peaceful demonstrators.\n\n“There were other reporters on the scene that day that did not follow the story, and if I hadn’t, then this really, really important story wouldn’t have gotten out,” Brake says.\n\nJustin Brake is set to appear in Provincial Court in Happy Valley-Goose Bay on April 11th.\n\nMeanwhile, the province’s Supreme Court is set to rule next week on the validity of the original court-ordered injunction against Brake.\n\n@ebalgord\n\nCLARIFICATION (3/9/2017, 6:40 p.m.): This article originally carried the headline “Journalist Facing Criminal Charges For Covering First Nations Protest.” Although the Muskrat Falls protests have involved First Nations, they were in fact started by the Inuit.",
  "latent_14328": "TV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place.\n\nThe Maggie Jordan goes to Uganda storyline has the virtue of being both better and worse than I expected it to be. On the one hand, it’s better because it doesn’t go anywhere near where I feared it would from the early episodes. At the time, I feared Aaron Sorkin might offer his particular riff on the Lara Logan situation, in which she was beaten and sexually assaulted by hundreds of men while reporting in Egypt. This is the sort of thing a journalism drama could do a strong spin on, but it’s not the sort of thing I trust Sorkin to handle with any tact or nuance. So I was relieved to find this wouldn’t be the case as we headed into the bulk of Maggie’s story in Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, just about every other element of her story was telegraphed from the instant we met young Daniel, the Ugandan boy marked for death by dramatic irony (he’s staying at the orphanage while his parents work because he’ll be safer there) and by having his narrative intersect with that of one of the main characters. Daniel is one of my least favorite kinds of characters on television, the one-episode guest star who exists solely to teach one of the main characters a lesson. The second I saw him, I knew he was going to die, probably in horrible fashion, by the end of the hour. The second his teacher said blonde hair was nothing but trouble, well, I knew why Maggie had chopped off her hair and dyed it red. It wasn’t as bad as I’d feared it would be, but it was far more predictable and, somehow, all the worse for it. The final sequence, where Maggie lays out exactly what happened to her in Uganda in the midst of the deposition, is cloying and overwrought in all the worst ways, not least of which is Sorkin’s choice to underline every single plot point with Maggie explaining it to us in the future. It’s a collection of weak storytelling choices, and they snowball into something far worse than simply a few small missteps.\n\n“Unintended Consequences” is, I think, by far the weakest of the four episodes HBO sent out to critics to write reviews of the second season, and I suspect it tempered some of the already muted enthusiasm that exists for these episodes. (Then again, I probably liked episodes two and three slightly more than David—and thanks be to him—did.) To my mind, the most interesting thing about those first three episodes is the unfolding of the Operation Genoa storyline. There are problems I have with it—I think it would be far more interesting if the person who got the story wrong were an existing character like Jim or Don, rather than a new character brought in just to bring this down on everybody else’s heads (tell me something else about Jerry other than his function within the story)—but I’m at least intrigued to see where things are going, particularly after last week’s episode ended with that great moment of the reporters finding the tweets about what seemed to be the saran gas attack.\n\n“Unintended Consequences” puts all of that on hold in order to tell us what happened to Maggie. Sure, there’s stuff there about the pursuit of Genoa, but that’s largely in service to a storyline that heightens some of the show’s worst tendencies, involving many of the characters becoming irresponsible journalists and outright jackasses to Shelly when she wants an apology for how Will treated her on his show. To be clear, I don’t really think Shelly deserves an apology, but when the team so clearly needs her help, you’d think they could deal with her as functional human beings, not condescending assholes. Once again, the show’s inability to blend the tones of a relatively serious and straightforward journalism drama with a goofy comedy about professionals in over their heads when it comes to their personal lives drives a problematic storyline that never holds together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Genoa is very much in the background of this particular episode, in favor of Maggie’s trip to Africa and Jim’s adventures in New Hampshire. In the case of the latter storyline, things get more and more irritating with every week that passes. This week, Jim gets everybody lost while trying to find the Romney bus, and this costs Hallie a story her editor needs, which puts her in jeopardy. So, naturally enough, because this is Jim, he manages to land a favor—any favor!—from Constance Zimmer (whom I’m really enjoying as Romney’s communications director), and instead of interviewing the candidate himself, as he’s been trying to do from the word go, he passes it off to Hallie. He hopes it will be seen as a noble gesture, but Hallie is upset he feels he has to make this sacrifice for her—to say nothing of how Mackenzie is furious about him giving up a potentially important interview for a girl he likes.\n\nThis is actually all pretty darn good, particularly the scene where Hallie lays into Jim, but it all ends up reversed when Hallie comes out to the pool to talk with him and thank him for what he did, then ends up kissing him. It’s a pointless reversal of what had been a strong scene for a character who was nothing more than “girl Jim can have a crush on who’s not Maggie,” and it tanks the storyline for the most part. I have no investment in Jim and Maggie, but I have even less in Jim and Hallie, even as an impediment to the other couple getting together. Plus, the kissing scene is interrupted by more pointless discussion about Vassar, which is what passes for character development for a guest on this show. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThat was nothing, however, compared to the stuff in Uganda. I so wanted this to feel like something more than one of those episodes of ER where Carter went overseas and learned about how much terrible stuff was going on in Africa, only to realize that nobody back home cared enough. Then he would stare soulfully at the camera, and both he and the audience would think about doing something, only to have it all largely recede into the background in the next week’s episode. Worse: This episode makes important, serious issues in Africa into a character growth story point for a comfortable, well-off white person in the United States. Daniel is never anything more than a cute kid marked for death. It’s one thing to make Hallie a plot device. We’re used to that with love triangles. But when it’s Daniel, the whole thing becomes that much more cringe-inducing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is to say nothing of how the whole story is told as a part of the deposition for no reasons I can really figure out. Maggie has to tell the entire story, rather than simply explain about her medication situation—which is all the lawyers really want to know about in the first place—and it just ends up making everything in the storyline feel that much more hollow and forced. This is something that swings for the fences but ultimately ends up hitting a little dribbler right down the middle. And when it comes to a season of television that’s had its moments here and there, that’s difficult to take. “Unintended Consequences” shows just how ruthless this series has become about forcing every other character into the personal growth curves of the series’ main players, and that’s a problem.\n\nStray observations:\n\nI know others have complained about it, but I kind of like Maggie’s freewheeling mangling of the English language. It reminds me of the way a lot of people in her and my generation speak, using the base roots of words to form others that mean roughly the same thing, a process that’s been sped up and twisted a bit by IM and text message speak. Does Sorkin intend to do this? I have no idea, but I kind of like it all the same.\n\nThings that would have made a better screencap for this article than whatever HBO actually provided: Charlie flattening his face against the glass.\n\nMore Newsroom weirdness: Sloan has just gotten around to seeing Titanic and informs the slumping Kodak that she’ll “never let go.” Olivia Munn seems as unconvinced by this as I am.\n\nHey, at least Shelly comes around and realizes that, yeah, she really was bad on TV. It’s important that everybody on this show ultimately realize Will McAvoy was right.\n\nThis episode does another Sorkin thing that irritates me: The quest is all for naught, meaning that the attempts to get Shelly to cave and tell the team where the OWS protestor who knows about Genoa is are ultimately pointless, because ACN tracks that person down anyway.",
  "latent_14373": "culture What Not to Eat at the CNE\n\nWe put the cronut burger—and other weird CNE food—to the test.\n\nThere are many classic reasons to go to the Canadian National Exhibition: the midway, the shows, the animals, and even the record-setting zip line. But recently, the meal offerings at the Ex have become an attraction in themselves. Every year, the food vendors have upped their game, coming up with richer, stranger, and more ridiculous combinations to tempt the masses.\n\nFrom the deep-fried nightmares and bacon-wrapped monstrosities, to the impossible burgers and the Nutella-smothered jalapeno poppers, many of the menu options in the Ex’s food building stand as a challenge to anyone’s intestinal fortitude. Of course, there are plenty of perfectly reasonable, even healthy options for fairgoers who don’t particularly want to treat eating as a competition, but that’s not why we went. We were there to track down the most extreme, most ridiculous, and most grotesque culinary abominations that we could find.\n\nWe were not disappointed.\n\nHere’s a record of our gastronomic adventure through the strangest and most terrifying creations the CNE has on offer this year.\n\nThe Jack’d\n\nWhat Is It: Two layers of pulled pork sandwiched between a total of three red velvet pancakes, topped with syrup and a big pat of butter.\n\nWe had a lot of hope for this one: the photo was imposing, the idea seemed decadent, and the combination of savoury and sweet held promise. Red velvet cake items are popular at the Ex in general this year—they make appearances in everything from funnel cakes to ice cream flavours—so trying a red velvet item seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nThe problem with this “sandwich” is that the execution is just not there. The pancakes aren’t red velvet in any true sense. They taste exactly like ordinary pancake batter with a lot of red food colouring (which bled unappetizingly into the pulled pork, making it weirdly pink). They were rubbery and unexciting, and while the flavour of the pulled pork was passable, it was dry and bland. With little sauce and no natural juiciness left, it was sadly disappointing. The best part of this dish was the butter and syrup.\n\nShould You Eat It: Eh, don’t bother. For the cost (over $12), the quality isn’t high enough.\n\nThe Chowdah Fries\n\nWhat Is It: A plate of thick-cut french fries smothered in seafood chowder and topped with bacon and chives.\n\nThis dish actually looked totally delicious. The rich sauce, crispy bacon, and fresh chives seemed like a great combination, and promised to be a novel alternative to the many decadent poutine options floating around.\n\nThe dish itself was by far the most disappointing of those we tried, both in terms of how different what we were actually served looked from the picture on the menu, and in terms of the flavour. The chowder had an unsettlingly greyish sheen, and it congealed quickly on the fries. The chives were limp and flavourless, and while the bacon and fries themselves were okay, that wasn’t enough of either to save the dish. The flavour of the chowder was unpleasantly fishy, to the point where we were worried it would make us ill. Also, we were hard pressed to actually find any seafood in the dish whatsoever. Most of the lumps were watery potato, which was especially disappointing considering the fact that there were fries underneath.\n\nShould You Eat It: Avoid at all costs. The chowder tastes like it’s prepared from a powder and the horrible seafood burps aren’t worth it.\n\nThe Cronut Burger\n\nWhat Is It: A cheeseburger with a cronut for a bun, topped with maple bacon jam. You can add bacon and/or a fried egg.\n\nFar and away the most hyped extreme item available at the CNE this year, the cronut burger was actually pretty good. The bun is a disappointing cronut, truth be told. It’s supposed to be a cross between a croissant and a donut, but it was pillowy and soft, and coated with a ton of sugar and cinnamon. The burger was a bit under-seasoned, but it was juicy and well cooked, and the cheese was a nice touch. The fat from the meat melted into the soft cronut, and that was delicious. The bacon jam on top, which was not advertised on the sign, was the least successful part of the dish—it was more like ground-up bacon and maple syrup. Overall, the burger was a bit too sweet to be perfect, but for something so decadent it was surprisingly pleasant to eat.\n\nShould You Eat It: Sure, go for it. Make sure you order it with bacon, which will add enough of a salty kick to counteract the sweetness of the bun.\n\nOn Tuesday, after this article was published, it was reported that twelve people fell ill at the CNE. Five were sick enough to need to be hospitalized. The one thing many of those who became unwell had in common? Each of them had consumed the dreaded cronut burger. The CNE closed down Epic Burgers and Waffles, and the stand remains closed voluntarily. Toronto Public Health continues to investigate.\n\nWe’re personally thrilled to report that we—neither myself, nor photographer Corbin Smith, who also sampled the burger—have so far suffered any ill effects, aside from some mild and well-deserved indigestion. We’ll update you in the event that either of us manifests super powers or discovers we’ve become a host to an alien life form.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Bacon Milkshake\n\nWhat Is It: A peanut butter milkshake filled with bacon bits and topped with a crispy strip of bacon.\n\nThis one came so close to being utterly delicious, but the execution fell short. The milkshake itself was near perfect. It had a good consistency, it wasn’t cloyingly sweet, and it had a rich, peanut butter taste. The full strip of bacon was crispy and delicious, and dunked in the peanut butter milkshake it was sublime. But the bacon bits failed miserably. Either Bacon Nation chose to use a ridiculously smoky bacon, or this particular batch was burned, because the bits left an overly dark, almost peaty aftertaste that took this milkshake from great to unpalatable very quickly.\n\nShould You Eat It: If the bacon bits aren’t burnt, definitely, but there seem to be some quality control issues here.\n\nThe S’More Weenie\n\nWhat Is It: A hot dog on a stick, covered in chocolate, rolled in graham-cracker chunks, and dotted with marshmallows.\n\nOh boy. Hoo. The s’more weenie.\n\nEverything about this was just wrong. From the smell, to the look, it was by far and away the food thing we were least looking forward to actually eating. It bears an unpleasant resemblance to a turd on a stick, which made taking the first bite even worse.\n\nWhereas all the other food sculptures that we tried over the course of the day were based on flavours that at least complimented each other or blended together in some way, these tastes stayed entirely separate. The chocolatey, crunchy hot dog just didn’t work. After a few more exploratory nibbles, we ended up eating the rest separately: we scraped off the chocolate, graham, and marshmallows, which tasted like a delicious s’more. Then, we topped the hot dog with ketchup and ate it; it was juicy and delicious on its own.\n\nShould You Eat It: For the love of all that is good, keep away. Some foods aren’t meant to be joined in some unholy hybrid.\n\nShaved Snow\n\nWhat Is It: An ice-cream-like frozen desert made of shaved ice, topped with fresh fruit and sauces.\n\nThis was a last-minute decision that we were so, so glad we made.\n\nWhile most of what we ate was in the Food Building, this frozen confection was nestled in a little hut by the Dufferin Gates. Chilly Ribbons calls its frozen treat “shaved snow” to differentiate it from a lot of other ice-cream alternatives, and different it is. The shaved snow falls in feathery layers that melt instantly in the mouth, and because of the way it’s served, even a huge pile is deceptively light. The strawberry flavour, topped with little strawberry boba jewels that pop on the tongue, was pretty close to perfect.\n\nShould You Eat It: Absolutely. It’s completely delicious and refreshing, and it actually made us feel better, after all the junk we’d mowed down.\n\nAn update to this post originally said, incorrectly, that Epic Burgers and Waffles was shut down by Toronto Public Health. In fact, it was shut down by the CNE, and it remains closed voluntarily.",

  "latent_14446": "Iain Duncan Smith was accused on Monday of relying on “dodgy” statistics to justify the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap for each household.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Secretary said that more than 12,000 people had moved into work after being told about the £500-a-week cap for families and £350-a-week ceiling for single people.\n\nLabour seized on the small print of a Department of Work and Pensions progress report issued as the welfare cap, which has been trialled in four London boroughs, was rolled out nationally from on Monday. It said: “This analysis is confined to correlation and does not show causation”.\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe qualifying statement follows a rebuke for Mr Duncan Smith’s previous claim about the number of people taking jobs as a result of the benefits ceiling. In May, he was criticised by the independent UK Statistics Authority.\n\nOn Monday, his department cited a poll it commissioned by Ipsos MORI of 500 people who were told their state handouts would be capped. The survey found that 61 per cent of the group now in work found their current job after being told about the cap. But critics said there was no proof that they would not have found work anyway or that the policy was responsible. In Haringey, one of the trial areas, only 30 of the 734 claimants affected by the ceiling are said to be in work.\n\nAlison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “This polling only demonstrates the paucity of evidence for the benefit cap. [It] reflects the fact that most people hit by the cap have worked and will soon work again. It’s also unhelpful for public policy and quite misleading to the public for the spin to run ahead of the facts through repeating dodgy claims about the effect of the policy on people moving into work when the evidence is clearly not there to back up these claims.”\n\nLiam Byrne, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “Iain Duncan Smith is having to make things up as he goes along because his policies are failing. Even the [DWP] report he hides behind makes absolutely clear that there is no evidence for his claims. It is simply incredible that the Work and Pensions Secretary thinks it is acceptable to operate his department on guess work and blind faith.”\n\nAn unrepentant Mr Duncan Smith accused the BBC of “seeking out lots of cases from people who are politically motivated” . He clashed with John Humphrys, presenter of Radio 4’s Today programme, who reminded him of the Statistics Authority’s ticking off. Mr Duncan Smith replied: “No. What they [the Statistics Authority] said was that you can't absolutely prove that those two things are connected.”\n\nMr Humphrys then quoted the independent authority as saying the minister’s statement was \"unsupported by the official statistics published by your own department\". Mr Duncan Smith replied: “Yes, but by the way you can't disprove what I said either.”\n\n“You can make any claim on that basis,” Mr Humphrys replied.\n\n“Well, I am. I believe this to be right. I believe that we are already seeing people go back to work who were not going to go back to work until they were short of the cap,” Mr Duncan Smith countered.\n\nHe told Mr Humphrys: “What you’re doing, as always in the BBC, you’re seeking out lots of cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong ... The fact is that people will not be earning more than average earnings sitting out of work unless they are in exempt categories.”\n\nThe Work and Pensions Secretary claimed that predictions that the benefit cap would lead to thousands of people becoming homeless had not materialised. “The homeless figures have hardly moved at all,” he said.\n\nHe also rejected claims that the ceiling would force families to move out of London. “The vast majority of the areas in London – a third of all rentable accommodation in the private sector – is available for those who are on social rents,” he said.\n\nBut Ruth Davison, director of the National Housing Federation, warned: “In many parts of the country, families won’t be able to pay high private rents because of the cap. There will be more demand for than ever for affordable housing, particularly in Greater London where nearly half (49 per cent) of the people affected by the benefit cap live.”\n\nShe added: “Families could face the stark choice of cutting back on essentials or having to move away long distances from their support networks to look for cheaper places to live. Until we see a long-term affordable housebuilding programme that will drive down the price of rents for everybody, housing costs should be removed from the cap.”\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true.

  "latent_14577": "The mayor will appoint an independent civilian to monitor the New York Police Department’s counterterrorism activities, lawyers said in court documents on Thursday as they moved to settle a pair of lawsuits over surveillance targeting Muslims in the decade after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThe agreement would restore some of the outside oversight that was eliminated after the attacks, when city leaders said they needed more flexibility in conducting investigations. In the years that followed, the Police Department secretly built files on Muslim neighborhoods, recorded sermons at mosques, collected license plates of worshipers and documented the views of everyday people on topics such as drone strikes, politics and foreign policy.\n\nThe settlement does not explicitly prohibit any methods that are currently allowed, and the city does not admit any wrongdoing. Police officials said many of the provisions of the agreement — such as barring investigations based solely on religion, race and ethnicity — simply codified changes already in place. But civil rights lawyers said some tactics that investigators used over the past decade violated the Constitution and would probably not have been allowed if anyone outside the Police Department had been reviewing the investigative files.\n\n“These safeguards will be a strong check against the discriminatory surveillance of Muslim communities that we challenged in our lawsuit,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project, who represents the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits. “We hope the settlement shows that effective policing isn’t at odds with constitutional policing.”",
  "latent_14609": "Fans at Providence Park watch the second half of an NWSL soccer match between the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign in Portland, Ore., Wednesday, July 22, 2015. Seattle won 1-0. (AP Photo/Don Ryan) The Associated Press\n\nBy ANNE M. PETERSON, AP Sports Writer\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Nowhere could the World Cup bump in women's soccer be more apparent than in Portland, Oregon, where more than 21,000 fans watched a National Women's Soccer League rivalry match between the Thorns and the Seattle Reign.\n\nIt was the second-largest stand-alone crowd ever to watch a professional women's league game in the United States. And while soccer-crazy Portland usually attracts big crowds for the hometown Thorns, the rest of the league is also seeing a surge in interest.\n\nThe NWSL is loving the attention.\n\n\"The last few weeks have been really, really nice for all of us,\" NWSL Commissioner Jeff Plush said. \"But there's more hard work. It continues to be a business we work very hard at every day. So it's not going to be a panacea. You have to work hard at growth.\"\n\nThe U.S. women's national team, whose players are allocated throughout the NWSL, defeated Japan 5-2 earlier this month in the title match at the World Cup, which was played across six Canadian cities. It was the team's third World Cup title, most of any nation.\n\nThe players have since returned to their club teams and to crowds eager to see the American victors.\n\nThe NWSL is in its third season and is in a crucial period because no other women's league in the United States has been able to last very long. Both forerunners, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) and Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) each folded within the three-year mark.\n\nThe league has attracted major sponsors, including Nike and, this season, Coppertone. In late June, the NWSL and FOX Sports announced an agreement to broadcast 10 league games this season. Three regular-season matches, three playoff matches and the championship will be shown on FOX Sports 1.\n\nBut it's the fans that have been making a difference in the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe Thorns set the league's attendance record on Wednesday night with a sellout crowd of 21,144 for a match against the rival Seattle Reign at Providence Park.\n\nThe record for a stand-alone professional women's soccer match in the United States was set in 2001, when 34,148 watched the Washington Freedom defeat the Bay Area CyberRays 1-0 at RFK Stadium. Mia Hamm starred for the Freedom while Brandi Chastain led the CyberRays.\n\nWhile other women's pro matches have drawn more than the Thorns did Wednesday night, those were double-headers held in conjunction with men's games.\n\nThe Thorns lead the league in attendance by a wide margin, averaging 13,769 fans a game this season. Wednesday night's match marked the fourth time the crowd has gone over 16,000 at the downtown stadium, which is also home to Major League Soccer's Portland Timbers.\n\nOther teams also have seen a spike in attendance.\n\nThe Washington Spirit drew a club record 5,413 fans to Saturday's 3-0 victory over the Reign at the Maryland SoccerPlex. The same day, the Chicago Red Stars played to a 1-1 draw with Boston before a record 3,560 fans at Benedictine University.\n\nA record 13,025 fans turned out at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston for the Dash match against the Red Stars. U.S. stars Carli Lloyd, Meghan Klingenberg and Morgan Brian were honored but didn't play.\n\n\"I think people just totally got attached to this World Cup in a different way than they have and it was so close to home,\" U.S. midfielder Megan Rapinoe said about the bump. \"That was such a huge thing to have American fans know they can go watch these players in their own cities for the rest of the season. Hopefully the bounce isn't coming down, it's just continuing to go up.\"\n\nThe WUSA was founded in 2000, hoping to capitalize on the U.S. national team's victory in the 1999 World Cup, but the league folded in 2003. The WPS played from 2010-2012 but had insurmountable internal organization and financial issues.\n\nThe NWSL has always maintained that it is better positioned to succeed because of its association with the North American soccer federations — the United States, Canada and Mexico — which pay the salaries of their national team players to help keep costs down.\n\nThorns coach Paul Riley said the real benefits of the World Cup probably won't be seen until next year — in season ticket sales.\n\n\"We're an anomaly when it comes to that. But you know, with Boston, Chicago, these places that have a huge boost right now, can they deliver season tickets? I know all the teams are working hard to get it done,\" Riley said. \"Our job is to entertain. Our job is to put teams out that people want to come pay money to watch, and put them in suitable stadiums for people to watch. I think that's the next step for everybody and hopefully they can do that, the whole league.\"\n\nPlush agreed there's more work ahead. The league, which right now has nine teams, could expand, possibly even next season.\n\nThe NWSL could also get another bump next season from the 2016 Olympics.\n\n\"The health of the league is good. It's exactly where we expected to be and where we wanted to be in the third year,\" Plush said. \"I think it's important for people to understand the context as a startup business. We're 2½ years in. Certainly the product is compelling, but we have the challenges and issues any business has. That said, we are rigorously planning for Year 4 and we have all the confidence in Year 5 and Year 6.\"",
  "latent_14628": "FTW pored through the record books (kidding; what are books?) and tallied up the number of regular season wins and playoff appearances over the past 10 years to determine which teams have been the most and least successful over the last decade. The best teams won’t be a surprise — hint, hint: (sound of deflation) — but there are plenty other surprises to be found in our list of 1 to 32.\n\n1. New England Patriots — 122 wins (9 playoff appearances, 1st in AFC East)\n\n2. Indianapolis Colts — 110 wins (9, 1st)\n\n3. Pittsburgh Steelers — 101 wins (6, 1st)\n\n4. Green Bay Packers — 98 wins (7, 1st)\n\n5. San Diego Chargers — 97 wins (5, 1st)\n\nThere are few surprises in the top four, with the two teams with the two best quarterbacks over this time period leading the way. And just think of how many more wins Tom Brady would have had if he’d figured out that deflation thing a few years ago! The biggest surprise is that Nos. 1 and 2 have as many Super Bowls combined as No. 10 (which you’ll hit farther down the list).\n\nTo veer off topic for a second, we don’t appreciate how ridiculously lucky it is for Indy that Peyton Manning went down in the season before Andrew Luck hit the draft. The Colts could have been stuck in a Sam Bradford, Blake Bortles or EJ Manuel year. Cam Newton, by all accounts one of the top No. 1 QB picks in recent memory, wouldn’t have even turned the team around. But just like the Spurs getting Tim Duncan, everything just fell into place at the right moment and here we are. (Because of the fortuitous down year in Indy, the only teams to finish every year of the decade over .500 were New England and Pittsburgh.)\n\nBut while the top four provides no shockers, the top five does. You could have asked 100 football fans, plus Norv Turner, to name the five winningest teams of the past decade and I’d say 99 wouldn’t have included the San Diego Chargers on that list, including Norv. But there they are, just one win behind Green Bay, buoyed by that 14-2 campaign under Marty Schottenheimer, Turner somehow getting them to 13-3 a few years later and a consistency that saw just one losing season in the past decade (a 7-9 year in Turner’s final season).\n\nSo there are the Chargers, with as many playoff wins since 2005 (four) as the New York Giants (the aforementioned No. 10 on this list), had in each of their 2007 and 2011 Super Bowl campaigns. The lesson: Regular season success does not beget postseason success. Heck, just ask the Pats, who won a staggering 122 games in the past 10 years but would have gone without a Super Bowl had it not been for the the worst play call in NFL history.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens — 96 wins (7, 2nd)\n\n7. Denver Broncos — 95 wins (5, 2nd)\n\n8. Dallas Cowboys — 93 wins (4, 1st)\n\n9. Seattle Seahawks — 91 wins (7, 1st)\n\n10. New Orleans Saints — 90 wins (5, 1st)\n\nPerhaps even more surprising than the Chargers at No. 5 is Dallas at No. 8. Didn’t they have like 19 years in a row where the Cowboys finished 8-8 under Jason Garrett? Oh, it was just three? Felt like more. But Dallas’s story is a lot like San Diego’s: Consistency. The only time Dallas finished below .500 in that stretch was back in 2010, when Wade Phillips was fired midseason and replaced with current coach Jason Garrett.\n\nFor a team that had a stretch of 9, 7, 8, 8 and 4 win seasons over the last 10 years, Denver ranks surprisingly high, but that’s what happen when Peyton Manning comes to town. Seattle also had mediocre seasons of 7, 7, 5 and 4 wins, yet actually made the playoffs one of those years, before recent success shot the Seahawks up this list. But it’s the Saints that have the worst single season of any team in top 10, posting a 3-13 record back in 2005, when Aaron Brooks was under center and Drew Brees still had a lightning bolt on his helmet.\n\n10. New York Giants — 90 wins (5, 2nd)\n\n12. Chicago Bears — 89 wins (3, 2nd)\n\n13. Philadelphia Eagles — 86 wins (5, 3rd)\n\n14. Atlanta Falcons — 85 wins (4, 2nd)\n\n15. Cincinnati Bengals — 84 wins (6, 3rd)\n\nThe Giants have the longest playoff drought of any team in the top 15, not having made the playoffs since 2011. But since Tom Coughlin is on the hot seat again this year, expect another turnaround season in Jersey. The Bears have the 12th most wins in the NFL over the past decade but only three playoff appearances to show for it. Philly was surprisingly low, until you remember that the Donovan McNabb/Terrell Owens glory days came before 2005.\n\nAs for the Bengals, everyone knows all about the four straight playoff appearances (and four straight losses) but the fact that Cincy has made six playoff appearances is a bit of a surprise, which might help explain why Marvin Lewis is the second-longest tenured coach in the NFL. That and the notorious cheapness of the Bengals organization, I guess. (Bill Belichick is the only coach who’s been with his team longer than Lewis.)\n\n15. San Francisco 49ers — 81 wins (3, 2nd)\n\n16. Carolina Panthers — 80 wins (4, 3rd)\n\n17. Arizona Cardinals — 76 wins (3, 3rd)\n\n17. Minnesota Vikings — 76 wins (3, 3rd)\n\n19. Tennessee Titans — 73 wins (2, 2nd)\n\nThe Titans have been under .500 in five of their last six seasons, which is why it’s so surprising to see them at No. 19. But when you go further back, you remember those odd years when Vince Young led the team to a 10-6 record and then Kerry Collins brought them to 13-3 and it makes more sense. As for the 49ers, even having the second-most wins from 2011-2013 wasn’t enough to get them up higher on this list. And with Jim Harbaugh gone, expect a slow decline.\n\n19. New York Jets — 73 wins (3, 2nd)\n\n21. Houston Texans — 72 wins (2, 3rd)\n\n22. Miami Dolphins — 70 wins (1, 2nd)\n\n23. Kansas City Chiefs — 68 wins (3, 3rd)\n\n24. Minnesota Vikings –– 67 wins (3, 3rd)\n\n25. Jacksonville Jaguars — 65 wins (2, 4th)\n\nThere it is, the surprise of the list: Not only aren’t the Jacksonville Jaguars in last, they’re not even close to last. They can thank Byron Leftwich and David Garrard for that and their two playoff appearances, which is still hard to wrap your head around: Jacksonville has been in the playoffs more times in the past 10 years than Miami. Florida, amirite?\n\n26. Washington Redskins — 64 wins (3, 4th)\n\n27. Tampa Bay Buccaneers — 63 wins (2, 4th)\n\n28. Buffalo Bills — 63 wins (0, 4th)\n\n29. Detroit Lions — 55 wins (2, 4th)\n\nMan, it only gets worse for fans of the Jets and Redskins. Despite two AFC championship appearances by New York and that brief glimmer of hope in Washington when Robert Griffin III was healthy and the team led Seattle 14-0 in a wild-card game, those two teams are surprisingly, but not shockingly, low — though it is a bit bizarre that the 25th and 26th ranked teams have as many playoff appearances as the No. 12 Bears.\n\nDespite a resurgence of late, Detroit still can’t past 29, which is what happens when there’s an 0-16 mark on your resume. Buffalo does surprisingly well for a team with no playoff appearances, sitting just one win behind both those Jets and Reskins.\n\n30. Cleveland Browns — 53 wins (0, 4th)\n\n31. St. Louis Rams — 49 wins (0, 4th)\n\n32. Oakland Raiders — 47 wins (0, 4th)\n\nThe less said about these teams, the better. But hey, Johnny Manziel!",

  "latent_14915": "An under-strength Barcelona side consolidated top spot in the Primera División on Saturday afternoon with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Granada at the Camp Nou.\n\nTwo first-half penalties, from Andrés Iniesta and Cesc Fábregas, set the champions on their way and Alexis Sánchez put the result beyond doubt 19 minutes from time – soon after the visitors had lost the midfielder Manuel Iturra to a red card.\n\nPedro added a fourth in the final minute to complete the rout as Barça moved provisionally six points clear at the summit ahead of the rest of the weekend's action.\n\nThe Catalan club headed into the game decimated by injuries, with Víctor Valdés, Dani Alves and Xavi having recently joined Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba, Jonathan Dos Santos, Ibrahim Afellay and Cristian Tello on the sidelines.\n\nFábregas and Gerard Piqué returned after injury, though, and the home team always looked like they had too much for the eighth-placed visitors.\n\nSánchez and Iniesta tried their luck from the edge of the box in the opening few minutes, but the Granada goalkeeper Roberto was equal to both, while Neymar also lashed over the bar from 20 yards.\n\nThe best Granada could muster in the early stages was a couple of long-range efforts – from Youssef El Arabi and Piti – neither of which troubled Barça's goalkeeper, José Pinto.\n\nThe hosts took the lead in the 20th minute, Iniesta coolly placing his right-footed penalty into the bottom-right corner after the referee adjudged Fábregas had been fouled by Dimitri Foulquier.\n\nPiti went within a whisker of snatching a swift equaliser, but saw his fierce left-footed shot hit the bar.\n\nAnd before the break Gerardo Martino's side had doubled their advantage – again from the penalty spot. This time it was Iniesta who won it, when he was brought down by Fran Rico, and Fábregas who converted, despatching into the top-right corner of Roberto's net.\n\nGranada could have pulled a goal back soon after the restart, but El Arabi directed his header over the bar.\n\nThe visitors' afternoon took a turn for the worse midway through the second half when Iturra was sent off for a second bookable offence following a foul on Pedro, having been shown the yellow card in the first half for a challenge on Neymar.\n\nAgain they showed they should not be written off and forced a decent save out of Pinto soon after, the Barça keeper parrying a close-range attempt from Allan Nyom in the 70th minute.\n\nHowever, the game was put beyond their reach moments later when the Chile forward Sánchez latched on to Neymar's slick pass and dinked over the advancing Roberto for his eighth goal in La Liga this term.\n\nWith the points in the bag, Martino handed a first-team debut to 17-year-old Adama Traoré in place of Neymar with seven minutes left.\n\nAnd then, just to rub salt into the Granada wounds, Fábregas teed up Pedro for a fourth goal in the 90th minute.",

It was the second highest rated show on the Fox network up to that point.[15] Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. IGN's Robert Canning in a 2008 review of the episode noted, \"though not the funniest of episodes, it certainly was groundbreaking. [...] With this episode, The Simpsons had its premise down, and it certainly had its edge.\"[16] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said of the episode: \"pretty standard early fare, with the series not quite hitting its stride.\" They went on to say, \"the realism of the first season is much apparent, with only the laser used to remove Bart's tattoo hinting at what the series will become.\"[2] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3½/5 and commented: \"Surprisingly, this early episode has a lot of the zest of the later shows, despite fairly odd looking art and a very Walter Matthau voice for Homer, still has some laughs.\"[17] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode \"is good but not great early Simpsons\" and further commented: \"For many years I thought of “Roasting” as a terrible episode, but it’s not. While I don’t feel it’s anything special, it remains a fairly entertaining show that has a few entertaining moments.\"[18] The episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990: \"Outstanding Animated Program\" and \"Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special.\" Because \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" was considered a separate special, The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category. This episode lost to fellow The Simpsons episode \"Life on the Fast Lane\".[19] In 2009, the website IGN named the episode number 4 on its \"Top 10 Holiday Specials\" list, writing \"With the off-beat sense of humor that we have learned to love from The Simpsons and a story showing the value of family on the Christmas holiday, we can't help but watch this great special every year.\"[20] In 2014, it was selected by current showrunner, Al Jean, as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.[21]\n\nHome release Edit\n\nThe special was the subject of the series' first home video release, The Simpsons Christmas Special, released on VHS in 1991.[22] The episode was also included in The Simpsons – Christmas (later retitled Christmas with The Simpsons), a DVD compilation of the series' Christmas episodes, produced in 2003.[23] The episode was also included on The Simpsons season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001.

An Esquire magazine article dubbed it not “just the worst designed building in the world—it’s the worst-built building, too.”\n\nNicknamed “The Hotel of Doom,” it has a design only an evil overlord could love—and a gift for UXers everywhere.\n\nA Shocking Proposal\n\nNorth Korea’s ominous reputation as a hostile tourist destination is so well-known that not too many people are keen on visiting.\n\nDespite these reservations, The World Festival of Youth and Students, a society then oriented towards spreading communist propaganda to the young, selected Pyongyang as the site for its 13th conference in 1989. It expected around 20,000 participants.\n\nIn preparation, North Korea took a variety of logical steps. It built the world’s largest stadium, shipped out all of the short people from Pyongyang, and started a massive construction project on the Ryugyong Hotel, which was to be the tallest hotel in the world and the crown jewel of the capital city.\n\nConstruction began in 1987, and because it takes more resources and know-how to build a 105-story hotel in two years than most dictatorships have laying around, the building missed its scheduled 1989 opening.\n\nWork plodded away until 1992 when construction stopped because North Korea literally ran out of money. That’s hardly a surprise, given that the $750 million (USD) pricetag represented 2% of the country’s GDP, a massive figure for any country to spend on a single building.\n\nWork finally resumed on the tower in 2008, despite languishing untouched for 16 years and warnings from international inspectors about its stability. The exterior was finished 2009, but the Hotel of Doom again missed announced opening dates in 2012 and 2013.\n\nToday it sits unfurnished, unoccupied, and even unlit, without a single tourist served over its 30-year existence.\n\nThe UX Gift: The Ultimate Case Study in Bad UX\n\nSo what can UXers take away from the Ryugyong Hotel? It turns out that there are three big lessons the World’s Worst Building can teach.\n\nDon’t Lose Focus on Your Userbase\n\nGovernments serve the people they represent. From that perspective, the people are their users. Even cursory user research would have shown a number of ways the money could have been better spent. $750 million dollars would have gone a long way to bolster the country’s woeful economy and feed its starving citizens. Instead of helping its people, North Korea lost track of its user base and started an expensive, time-consuming project that drained its budget and never served a single person.\n\nDon’t Design by Management\n\nLike a management team bent on building something simply because it looks good, North Korea’s insistence on building a 105-story hotel in the world’s least-welcoming country was a short-sighted mistake that prioritized flash over functionality. It ended up, as these decisions almost always do, as a costly and very public mistake.\n\nResearch The Problem Before Solving It\n\nThere was never a need for a 105-story hotel in North Korea. The government suspected there might be a shortage of accommodation for the conference, but never did any sort of study to define the issue. They merely reacted with overkill on a massive scale, and ended up only contributing to other problems. It was designed as a very permanent solution to a short-term problem. Even today, most of North Korea’s hotels are very eerily deserted.\n\nIN THE END, the Hotel of Doom still looms over Pyongyang, a dark structure without a single light of hope to shine over the city at night. While there are some signs that work may once again be underway on the building, there is still no timetable for its opening. 30 years after work began on the Hotel of Doom, it is the ultimate case study against many of the design sins UXers fight daily.\n\nAnd that may be the only purpose the World’s Worst Building may ever serve.",
  "latent_15256": "S.C. political consultant Scott Malyerck has walked across the State House grounds for years.\n\nWhen he was in college in the early ’80s, Malyerck passed by the State House on his way to campus. When he was deputy state treasurer from 2007-10, he worked in the State House complex’s Wade Hampton Building.\n\n“Every day, I’d see the state Capitol and the flag over the dome.”\n\nBut this year, Malyerck looked up at the dome and saw a different flag. Specifically, the palmetto tree on the flag flying on the dome was shaped differently.\n\nSign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to The State\n\nMalyerck said when he inquired, he was told the flag design changed because the flag manufacturer was different.\n\n“As there is no official description of the South Carolina State Flag in regulation or code, the statewide contract description of the flag focuses not on design detail but rather the quality of the materials used,” said Department of Administration Spokeswoman Kelly Coakley. “As such, the state flag design may vary depending on the manufacturer.”\n\nThat, Malyerck decided, could not stand. So he urged his lawmakers to introduce legislation requiring a uniform S.C. flag — no more misshapen palmettos.\n\nPart of the problem is while S.C. law says the flag will be blue and have a white palmetto tree and crescent on it, that law does not set specifications for their exact placement or design. As a result, some variations have found themselves into the state flags produced by competing flagmakers.\n\nSen. Ronnie Cromer, R-Newberry, introduced a proposal to require a standardized flag in the state Senate. Rep. Rick Martin, R-Newberry, introduced a similar proposal in the House. Both bills did not advance this year but could be considered when lawmakers return for a new session in January.\n\n“Every building should fly the same flag,” Martin said, adding variations in the flag are disrespectful to S.C. residents who have died fighting in wars. S.C. residents should pick the flag design, Martin added.\n\n“Our symbol in our flag is very popular,” said Malyerck, adding he owns a dozen ties with palmetto-tree designs.\n\nBut, Malyerck added, the state flag is too important a symbol to leave its design up to the manufacturer. “It’s common sense to have a flag that is uniform, standardized, that flies over our State House year after year, decade after decade.”",
  "latent_15414": "A major fire at a factory in Smethwick where 100,000 tonnes of plastic recycling bundle material caught fire was started by a Chinese lantern, the fire service have confirmed.\n\nApproximately 200 firefighters were deployed to battle the blaze that caused thick plumes of smoke to rise 6,000ft in the air.\n\nFirefighters were called to attend the scene on Sunday evening at the recycling plant J&A Young on Dartmouth Road.\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe fire was categorised as “major” by the West Midlands Fire Service because of “the strain it placed resources” and is believed to be the biggest to have ever broken out in the West Midlands. The first call reporting the blaze came in at 11.19pm, and despite reaching the site within minutes, it had grown so rapidly the fire service had to split it into three specific fire-fighting areas.\n\nThe fire has now been reduced to approximately a third of its original size.\n\nNow MPs have spoken out against the use of lanterns, arguing that they are dangerous for both industrial sites and conservation.\n\nTom Watson, Labour MP for West Bromwich took to Twitter and said the incident “should spell the end of Chinese lanterns. They're just not safe.” Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the National Farmers Union rural surveyor Louise Staples said: “Our members know how dangerous these lanterns can be. They can harm or kill farm animals by ingesting a wire frame in chopped grass and there is the fire risk to standing and stored crops, to buildings and they can cause wild fires on moorland.\n\n“As we have seen today, they can also cause severe fires on an industrial scale, an event that left several people injured.\n\n“We really would hope people would think twice about releasing them into the air because of the very real dangers they pose.”\n\nSpeaking from the scene, Vij Randeniya , Chief Fire Officer for the West Midlands Fire Service said the fire was under control, but had been very difficult to contain. He said: “It was quite a tricky incident because the fire moved and spread so quickly. The fire happened in a space measuring 300 square metres, so we have been trying to contain a blaze covering an area that big.”\n\nResidents were instructed to stay inside their properties without opening windows and doors. Mr Randeniya said: “Plastic also burns at a high rate and produces acrid, toxic smoke.\n\n“We are ‘modelling the plume’, so we are looking at how big the fire is and how high it’s gone. The air quality at the moment means that everyone is safe, but people should not be opening their windows or putting their washing out today.\n\n“The fire is releasing a lot of smoke which is toxic, but it is not at ground level.”\n\nNow Mr Randeniya, who is President of the Chief Fire Officers Association, has called for a meeting with “those in the top level of waste management.”\n\n“We are going to be here for a few days trying to put the fire out”, he said. “This is the 15th fire in a waste transfer site in the West Midlands alone. We would like to have a meeting with the top level of waste management - we are spending a lot of time and resources dealing with these.”\n\nTwo fire fighters were taken to hospital “as a precaution” and eight were treated by ambulances on the scene for minor injuries. The fire is believed to have caused up to £6million in damage.\n\nCCTV footage of the event captured a lantern landing on the plastic stacks in the industrial site. Eight minutes later, it set on fire. West Midlands Fire Service is now calling for a review into the use of Chinese lanterns.\n\n“We don’t want to be party poopers”, said Mr Randeniya, “but we have cause and effect here. They [the lanterns] can travel for miles and the wind currents have been particularly fierce with this fire. These lanterns have set fire to a number of properties and waste sites before.”\n\nThere were 35 fire engines and three hydraulic platforms being used to extinguish the fire, along with two high volume pumping units.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the unit had received over four hundred calls about the blaze.\n\nMotorists were also urged to avoid the M5, whilst nearby Galton Valley Primary School was shut due to road closures.\n\nBirmingham International airport were alerted to the blaze due to the smoke plumes, which could be seen by motorists as far away as Oxford and Coventry. A spokesperson for the airport said: \"Our operation has been running as normal today. We have had no disruptions.\"\n\nIn a statement released on Sky News, the director for Jayplas thanked the emergency services for their \"speedy response\" and for \"dealing with this incident in a thoroughly professional manner\".\n\n\"I'd also like to thank our staff on site for raising the alarm as soon as they were aware of the fire which allowed the fire brigade to act quickly and reduce the severity of the incident. Speaking with the Fire Investigation Officer, it looks likely the fire was caused by a Chinese lantern on site. This was a tragic accident of which we had no control. We would like to apologise to all of our neighbours for any disruption caused by this incident and hope to see things back to normal as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Jayplas will do everything we can to assist the emergency services and the Environment Agency to ensure the site and surrounding areas are made safe and cleaned up as quickly as possible with minimum impact to the local environment. We hope to have the site up and running as soon as possible.\"\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.\n\nAt The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

  "latent_15514": "In the two weeks that’ve passed since Saturday Night Live’s last new episode, President-elect Donald Trump has given the show an overwhelming amount of material to work with thanks to a parade of troubling Cabinet picks, rampant conflicts of interest, unprecedented casual phone calls to foreign leaders, and of course, sporadic tweets meant to attack his critics and defend (some of) his most controversial actions.\n\nThose tweets bore the brunt of SNL’s focus in its December 3 cold open, with Alec Baldwin returning to play a perpetually distracted Trump retweeting randoms instead of listening to his security briefings — and the show took pains to mention over and over that all the tweets mentioned in the sketch were real.\n\nWhen Trump’s former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway (played by Kate McKinnon) suggested he was tweeting to distract the media from other, bigger issues, he shrugged off that justification with a simpler answer: “My brain is bad.”\n\nAnd every time McKinnon’s Conway and a pair of security experts would try to keep Trump on task in listening to the briefing, SNL would almost immediately cut away to cast members playing whichever Twitter user Trump was retweeting instead — people whose bios featured such declarations as “liberalism is a cancer.”\n\nAs his staff grew visibly more anxious — while eyeing the iPhone clasped in his hand with increasing horror — Baldwin’s Trump remained unruffled.\n\n“Next, I’m going to do what I promised my whole campaign,” he said. “I’m going to build … that … swamp.”\n\n“Don’t you mean ‘drain the swamp’ and ‘build that wall’?” McKinnon’s Conway asked, hoping to guide him back to the point.\n\n“No, that’s too many things,” he replied. “Just smush ’em together.”\n\nThe sketch’s security briefing then veered off into a state of panic over only having seven weeks left until Trump’s inauguration, continuing until the president-elect eventually welcomed chief strategist Steve Bannon into the room, played by a man wearing a Halloween Grim Reaper costume.\n\nOkay, so in trying to catalog all of Trump’s recent antics, the sketch got pretty scattered. Maybe the SNL writers’ room was tired this week — but if the past 25 days have been any indication, the show should probably get used to having to pare down an embarrassment of Trump embarrassments to a number more manageable for a comedy sketch from here on out.\n\nUpdate: That is where this article originally ended, but it didn’t take long for President-elect Trump to personally comment on SNL’s sketch:\n\nJust tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\nAs of press time, it was not clear whether Trump really did stop watching SNL after the cold open, whether he stuck around for Weekend Update’s continued hammering of his tweeting habits, or whether he understood the irony of tweeting about a sketch that depicted his tweeting as an impulse he can’t help but indulge.",
  "latent_15597": "Bitcoin investors looking for alternative cryptocurrency investments\n\nThe Cryptocurrencies That Should Be On Your Radar\n\nWhat do you usually think of when you hear the word cryptocurrency? Chances are that the first thing that comes to mind is Bitcoin. There’s a good reason for that association simply because Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency landscape. Plus, Bitcoin stocks made this a good deal in 2017 when the value of a single Bitcoin topped $20-thousand. That’s pretty amazing for what amounts to a virtual currency that you use exclusively online. There are also bitcoin stocks that have taken off lately. Here is a list of bitcoin stocks you can take a look at as well.\n\nBut what about the other players in the field?\n\nWell, you could invest in just about any of the strong contenders but if you have an investment strategy that includes a bit of risk and a whole lot of diversity, maybe you should look at something further down the list of popular cryptocurrencies. In fact, there are currently over 700 cryptocurrencies currently in the market so you have a lot of choices when it comes to mixing up your portfolio. But, which ones should you watch and which should you ignore? Here’s a peek at a few of the others that don’t normally draw the kind of attention that Bitcoin stocks do these days. However, remember there was a time, not that long ago, when Bitcoin was also an unheard of entity.\n\n1 – Ripple (XRP)\n\nLaunched in 2012, Ripple is very different to Bitcoin although it has roots in Bitcoin as it was created by former Bitcoin developers. The goal at the time was to improve and possibly put a ripple (see the gag here?) in the global remittance industry. Essential Ripple is a network. The network uses the ripple token in transaction activity. The Ripple network is already being used by major banking institutions.\n\n2 – Vertcoin (VTC)\n\nLaunched in 2014, Vertcoin also nods to Bitcoin for connections to the development of both the cryptocurrency and the network it functions within. Vertcoin is the first of the virtual currencies to implement stealth addresses and offers next-generation ASIC. What this means to a potential investor is that this could be a breakout winner and is gaining traction based on the fact that there are well over 41-million Vertcoins in circulation. The cap was set at 84 million.\n\n3 – IOTA (IOT)\n\nLaunched in 2015, IOTA is also another cryptocurrency that carries a first. It happens to be the first cryptocurrency to use the Tangle blockchain. The next-gen Tangle has given IOTA some notable differences from Bitcoin. Bitcoin, for example, suffered from scalability and processing times. IOTA has managed to remedy this thanks to Tangle. You could be looking at a soon-to-be industry leader with this cryptocurrency.\n\n4 – Zcash (ZEC)\n\nLaunched in 2016, Zcash is really different from all the other players on the field. In fact, you may even consider this one a potential game changer. Where Zcash blows everything out of the water is that it is the first open, permissionless financial system. It employs zero-knowledge security. If risk is your game, this brave entry into the virtual currency industry could be worth looking into.\n\n5 – Potcoin (POT)\n\nWell, you know, some of those hippies did become successful businessmen a decade or two after they got their act together. However, thanks to the ongoing push to and success of legalizing the cannabis industry, Potcoin came into existence. Launched in 2014 it may be considered a ‘niche’ product but anyone who has monitored the stocks of companies directly or indirectly connected to the cannabis industry has seen growth and stability in their investments.\n\n6 – NEM (XEM)\n\nYou know how hybrid cars took off and seem to continue to have a place in today’s world? Well, NEM is sort of like that. It was launched in 2014 and is the first hybrid combined public/private blockchain. It was created from nothing and was also the first such solution to utilize the POI algorithm (Proof of Importance) from the EigenTrust reputation system.\n\n7 – Nxt (NXT)\n\nLaunched in 2014, Nxt is a flexible platform that was specifically designed to operate as that. The platform is used to build applications as well as financial services around the foundation of that protocol. It was also the first cryptocurrency to rely entirely on the POS (proof of stake) for consensus. As a result, a block creation rate of about 60-seconds is the claim to fame for Nxt.\n\n8 – DigitalNote (XDN)\n\nLaunched in 2014, DigitalNote is extremely unique in many ways. First, it is a private cryptocurrency. Second, it has instant untraceable crypto messages combined with first blockchain banking. Third, it uses the CryptoNote protocol in the banking implementation DigitalNote functions with. What’s that mean? Cutting edge technology. ‘Nuff said.\n\n9 – SwiftCoin (STC)\n\nLaunched in 2011, SwiftCoin is the first digital coin that has a value based on the production of electricity. It was also the first blockchain to use interest paid on debt for currency creation. Other firsts with SwiftCoin include that it was one of the first cryptocurrencies to receive a US patent. It was also the first blockchain that supported encrypted attachments via email.\n\n10 – Cardano (ADA)\n\nThis is another of the fully open source projects that looks to revolutionize smart contracts. With over 26-billion tokens already in circulation and a cap of 45 million, this relative newbie on the block (chain…sorry, we couldn’t resist!) is touted as hoping to deliver features far more advanced than any existing protocol. While that sounds ambitious to some, it may just be the one you won’t want to let get away.\n\nThere’s A Lot Going On Beyond Bitcoin\n\nClearly, the digital coin-age is not going away anytime soon. It is far more than a fad and in many cases, is still in the developmental stage. For investment purposes, there are several ways to look at the world of cryptocurrencies. Probably the smartest one revolves around trying to find a way to get in on the action early in the game.",
  "latent_15642": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere topped 400 parts per million at a key observing station in Hawaii for the first time since measurement began in 1958, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday.\n\nSmoke rises out of factories in Thailand's Chonburi province, about 90 km (56 miles) southeast of Bangkok February 1, 2007. REUTERS/Sukree Sukplang\n\nTo many scientists, crossing the 400 ppm threshold, which means that there are 400 molecules of carbon dioxide for every million molecules in the air, is a bit like the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising above 15,000 points.\n\n“It’s important mainly as a milestone that marks a steady progress of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” said James Butler of NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory.\n\nThe threshold has become an important marker in U.N. climate change negotiations, tagged as a dangerous level by most climate scientists.\n\nFor many years scientists have said that concentrations need to be kept below, or pushed back to, 350 ppm for countries to meet an international target of keeping the average temperature increase below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) this century.\n\nDozens of observing stations around the world monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide. But Mauna Loa, a volcanic mountain on the Big Island of Hawaii, is regarded as the benchmark site, NOAA said.\n\nTwo instruments at Mauna Loa showed carbon dioxide at 400.03 ppm on Thursday. Certain arctic observing stations exceeded 400 ppm more than a year ago, and the global average of atmospheric carbon dioxide could break the 400 ppm barrier in the next year or so, Butler said by telephone from Boulder, Colorado.\n\nWhether or not that occurs, Earth’s atmosphere hasn’t had this much carbon dioxide in it for at least 800,000 years, and possibly for as long as 5 million years.\n\nCarbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. It is emitted by fossil-fueled vehicles and coal-fired factories and power plants as well as by natural activities such as breathing.\n\nCarbon dioxide concentrations at Mauna Loa are documented in a graph known as the Keeling Curve, named for Charles Keeling, who began measurements there in 1958, when the level was 317 ppm. Information on the Keeling Curve is available at keelingcurve.ucsd.edu.\n\nDuring the last 800,000 years, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide fluctuated between 180 ppm and 280 ppm. With the widespread burning of coal and oil during the Industrial Revolution, the concentration of carbon dioxide rose to about 290 ppm by the end of the 19th century, Butler said.\n\nIn the 20th century, the rate of increase accelerated, with levels between 370 and 380 ppm by the year 2000.

It could speed up deep learning training from 'days or hours to minutes or seconds.'\n\nVideo: How to tell the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are impacting businesses. But, the terms are often used interchangeably. Here's how to tell them apart.\n\nDeep learning systems continue to gain widespread adoption in the enterprise, tackling photo and voice recognition, customer service interactions, and even spotting abnormalities in medical records. But while the artificial intelligence (AI) models, which rely on massive data sets to \"train\" themselves on recognizing patterns and making predictions—throughout multiple iterations—timing is still an obstacle. Developing an accurate deep learning model can take up to days, or even weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, a new deep learning model developed by IBM Research—Distributed Deep Learning—made big strides in the field: It achieved a record for image recognition accuracy of 33.8%.\n\nThe model, which used a massive data set of 7.5 million images, achieved \"record communication overhead and 95% scaling efficiency on the Caffe deep learning framework over 256 GPUs in 64 IBM Power systems,\" according to IBM—all in just seven hours.\n\nFor some context, Facebook AI Research could scale at 89% on Caffe2, at higher communication overhead. And Microsoft's accuracy for a similar task was 29.8% accuracy—over a much longer period of 10 days.\n\nAccording to IBM, this is a \"milestone in making Deep Learning much more practical at scale—to train AI models using millions of photos, drawings or even medical images—by dramatically increasing the speed and making significant gains in image recognition accuracy possible as evidenced in IBM's initial results.\"\n\nThe milestone was achieved by addressing the problem of performance bottlenecks, which are the result of fast GPUs trying to synch up simultaneously. According to IBM, \"this contention typically causes massive deep learning models on popular open source Deep Learning frameworks to run over days and weeks.\" To address it, IBM used \"dozens of servers connected to hundreds of GPU accelerators popular in gaming systems with near perfect scaling.\"\n\nSpeeding up deep learning training models could prove to come in very useful for businesses by helping create models quicker that could analyze things like medical images, spot fraud, or boost speech recognition.\n\nIBM Research has developed is a beta version of its Deep Learning software for IBM Systems, making it available to PowerAI v4 developers and customers for TensorFlow and Caffe.

Three of the 108 had had arrest warrants issued for them before, said Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8.\n\nThe 73 were apprehended after security officers launched a massive operation across Phuket to execute warrants which began in the morning and ended at 2pm.\n\nThe operation involved a total of 1,150 officers from Police Region 8 and the 41st Military Circle plus local administrative authorities.\n\nPol Lt Gen Panya Mamen said information gathered by a police task force in charge of the crackdown on local taxi mafia gangs and the Phuket Land Transport Office showed that there were 287 taxi queues and 3,594 illegal black-plate taxis (1,277 are on a list for legal green plates).\n\nAbout 70 taxi queues were operated by influential groups, Pol Lt Gen Panya said, and police had questioned 150 individuals from 51 local business operations whose businesses had been affected or were intimidated by the gangs.\n\n“Provincial Police Region 8 will try to protect and safeguard Phuket’s tourism, improving its standards to a point acceptable by all sides,” Pol Lt Gen Panya said, adding order, and better systems that meet international standards, would be necessary to make Phuket a province of sustainable tourism.",

As recently as May 2, gas in the United States cost $3.72 a gallon.\n\nIn response to these falling prices, Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, earlier this summer cut its production by 400,000 barrels per day. That did nothing to stem the decline in prices, and so, just last week, OPEC’s largest producer decided to recognize reality and unilaterally cut prices to its best customers, leaving its cartel members in disarray.\n\nTo add insult to this injury, Saudi Arabia then solicited long-term cut-price contracts with a number of its best customers in order to protect its own market share.\n\nThis was met by a decision by Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Company on Sunday to cut its price on its Basrah Light crude to its favorite Asian and European buyers by between $3 and $5 a barrel.\n\nThis was too much for Venezuela and the country’s foreign minister, Rafael Ramirez, called for an urgent meeting to discuss strategy. That call was ignored, and plans remain in place for the regular cartel meeting scheduled for the end of November.\n\nAmy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy at the University of California, Davis, expressed her astonishment: “There is a price war within OPEC. It is the most fractured I have ever seen OPEC.”\n\nA measure of discomfiture among members of the cartel is the recent behavior of Saudi Arabia’s longtime oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, who for years provided the soothing ointment needed to keep the cartel together. At regular semiannual meetings Naimi would arrive early to schmooze with the other members and lay the groundwork for agreement as to production quotas and price targets.\n\nNot anymore. At OPEC’s last meeting, Naimi showed up late and attended only one session, at which he recommended that an annual meeting would be more than sufficient under the new conditions. Said an observer at that meeting, Naimi’s message was clear: “We don’t need a meeting. People come and make nice when at the end of the day, Saudi Arabia carries the burden of balancing the oil market.” Added the delegate, Naimi “feels there is no point in talking as everyone does as they please.”\n\nThe new normal was admitted by OPEC member Kuwait when Ali al-Omair, that country’s oil minister, admitted on Sunday that the other members of OPEC were just going to have to suck it up and get used to lower, perhaps much lower, oil prices. Omair said prices could drop to $76 per barrel, which gets close to the average production costs per barrel in Russia and the United States.\n\nIt was just six years ago this summer that Saudi Arabia found itself in a similar position. At the start of the Great Recession, economies around the globe were contracting and prices for crude had dropped by almost 30 percent between July and September 2008. The cartel officially announced a cut in production to keep prices from falling below $100 per barrel. Following that announcement, however, Saudi’s Oil Minister Naimi spent most of the day holding private conversations with nervous customers to assure them that his country would nevertheless supply all the oil that was needed.\n\nOnce again, Saudi Arabia appears to be going its own way, against the wishes of the cartel. It remains to be seen whether this signals the death knell for this cartel that dates back to the early 1960s.\n\nPhoto showing row of oil pumps in Bahrain: AP Images\n\nA graduate of Cornell University and a former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at www.LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

  "latent_16043": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greets supporters after his rally at Ladd-Peebles Stadium on Aug. 21 in Mobile, Ala. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump — businessman, raconteur, fiery immigration hardliner — has repeatedly insisted that he will win the Hispanic vote once granted the Republican nomination next year. His argument is usually two-fold: one, he'll bring jobs and, two, a poll showed him leading among Hispanics in Nevada. The Nevada poll has a Trump-Tower-sized margin of error. And the idea that Hispanic voters will flock to the candidate who would have us assume that immigrants from Mexico are more likely criminals than not seems iffy.\n\nBut the worst fears of the Republican establishment, that Trump's unapologetic condemnations of immigrants will scuttle their shot at retaking the White House, so far aren't revealing themselves in polling.\n\nFor all of the polling that's been done in the 2016 races so far, there are a lot of gaps. A big one is that most polls don't include large samples of Hispanic voters, making it hard to isolate the views of members of that community. Often, Hispanic voters are grouped with black and Asian voters to form a statistically significant group of \"non-white\" voters.\n\nWhen the Post and ABC News polled voters in the middle of July, we asked whether or not people would vote for Trump in the general election if he won the nomination. White voters mostly said they wouldn't — and non-white and Hispanic voters (the former group including the latter, obviously) strongly said they wouldn't. The overlap between non-white voters on the whole and Hispanic voters is pretty close.\n\nThis matched with a Univision poll that showed that over four-fifths of Hispanic voters viewed Trump disapprovingly. In 2012, Hispanic voters backed Obama a little less heavily, by a 71 to 27 margin.\n\nBut it isn't that simple. If Trump's comments were hurting him and/or Republicans with voters, we'd expect to see them faring worse after the June/July period in which the comments became public -- and Trump rose in the polls.\n\nThe opposite happened. Trump's position among non-white voters improved, substantially, when you look at how he fared in a head-to-head match-up with Hillary Clinton. In a CNN/ORC poll conducted in late June, Clinton led Trump by 67 points among non-white voters. By the end of July, she led by 56 points. By mid-August, 49.\n\nWhat's more, in the most recent CNN/ORC polling Trump does better against Clinton with non-white voters than Jeb Bush. (Note the dashed line.) The net effect is that Clinton leads Trump by nine points among all respondents in CNN's most recent poll, and Bush by eight. In late June, she led Bush by 13 and Trump by 25.\n\nA lot of the narrowing gap has to do with Clinton herself, of course. And despite the Republicans' improvement, she is still leading.\n\nOnce the general election rolls around — and more people are paying attention to the race — everything Trump (and now, Bush) has said about Hispanics and immigrants will be on heavy rotation. At that point, we'll have a better gauge of what repercussions from Trump's comments there might be. For now, though, with voters who are paying attention and answering polls, the effect appears to be small.",
  "latent_16049": "Deleuze, Guattari and Market Anarchism\n\nI. Deleuze, Guattari, Accelerationism\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk about Deleuze and Guattari around both academic and activist scenes for quite some time. Sometimes they are objects of unfounded derision (decried as “holy fools” by traditionalist socialists like Richard Barbrook), and other times they are the beneficiaries of overtly non-critical praise (see the endless application of their theories to every topic under the sun). They’ve been labeled as secret agents for neoliberal capitalism (as charged by Slavoj Zizek) and as tacticians for revolution in the era of globalization (according to the transnational alter-globalization movement that arose in the 1990s). They’ve been invoked as joyful, hippie celebrants of cosmic emergence (certain points in the recent “new materialism” canon), as forerunners to chaos and complexity theory (Manuel DeLanda), and, perhaps most delightfully, as scribes of a “mad, black communism” that feasts on conspiracy and negativity (Andrew Culp). Before his turn towards neoreaction, Nick Land described Anti-Oedipus, the first volume of their two-part collaboration titled Capitalism and Schizophrenia, as “less a philosophy book than an engineering manual; a package of software implements for hacking into the machinic unconscious, opening invasion channels.”i\n\nWith so many different interpretations, which run the gamut from spot-on to the exceedingly problematic, it might seem like an inescapable cul-de-sac to look to their works for elucidating power dynamics in the world today. Their capture by the academy, that assembly-line of homogeneous thought, only compounds this weariness. It is my contention, nonetheless, that Deleuze and Guattari (henceforth D & G) has much to offer us today, and constitute a radical break (or, in their lingo, a schiz) is the annals of leftist theory that points the way towards a vision of the future that is similar to what Benjamin Tucker described as “anarchistic socialist” – or, in the parlance of today, left-wing market anarchism.\n\nThe suggestion that D & G’s political praxis overlaps with that of market anarchism, even one that is vehemently anti-capitalist, is bound to rankle many, and will undoubtedly court charges of “accelerationism”. The consummate political heresy of the last decade, accelerationism – a vague term that been applied in numerous, frequently conflict ways – emerges from a pivotal passage in Anti-Oedipus. In the wake of the failures of the left to overcome capitalism during the revolts of the 1960s, and the turn by the ‘Third Worldists’ towards nationalist capitalism, D & G suggest that the proper “revolutionary path” may indeed be one in which we need “[t]o go further still, that is, in the movement of the market… Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to ‘accelerate the process’, as Nietzsche put it: in this matter, the truth is that we haven’t seen anything yet.”ii\n\nThe charge of accelerationism is one that should not be warded off, but embraced, but only with a delicate unpacking. Light readings, lacking in nuance, have attached D & G’s reflections as one-off musing at best, and at worst, an uncritical acceptance of the then-emergent neoliberal capitalism, with its rhetoric of global markets, deregulation, and openness. The identification of accelerationism with the latter should be avoided (as well as the more recent association of accelerationism with state-centric technological development); instead, lets look to the possibility of an accelerationism that is ‘anarchistic-socialistic’ in nature, utilizes markets, and operates in unbridled antagonism to the conditions of the present. To do so, tracing out the positioning of markets against capitalism in D & G’s work should be carried out. What follows a cursory exploration of this, though it is by no means an exhaustive treatment. But first, we must look to D & G’s own stance towards the political itself, as individuals and together.\n\nII. Marxists, Anarchists, Both, or Neither?\n\nProviding a precise set of political coordinates for D & G’s theories, other than a very far-left orientation, is itself a rather difficult task. Like Foucault, Baudrillard, and others lumped together under the problematic sign of ‘post-structuralism’, D & G are often invoked by anarchists, particularly those in insurrectionist, communization, and and post-left currents, but debate over their status as anarchists has persisted over the years.\n\nWith ties to the borderline anarchists Autonomia movement in 1970s Italy, Guattari described his project as “autonomous-communist-anarchist”, though neither himself nor Deleuze had much to say on the history of anarchist thought at all. Deleuze’s lecturers made passing reference to Proudhon, though it was undoubtedly the strawman Proudhon of Marx’s The Poverty of Philosophy (this is unfortunate, as Proudhon’s own ontology of flux and becoming, as detailed in The Philosophy of Progress, clearly foreshadows Deleuze own). Meanwhile, in The Logic of Sense, Deleuze makes passing reference to Max Stirner; while it is hard to say if he was directly influenced by the egoist, Saul Newman has detailed numerous points of overlap between each of their philosophies.iii\n\nIt is not, of course, relation to the history of ideas or the name-drops one makes that dictates proximity to anarchism. Aside from tangential relationships with anarchist and quasi-anarchist groups (Guattari through the Autonomists, Deleuze through the Prisoner Information Group, an anti-prison activist network set up by Foucault), it is clear that the philosophy suggested by D & G is teeming with positions and propositions well familiar to anarchists. Among other things the two reject the state, capitalism, the USSR, fascism, the police, democracy, racism, colonialism, taxes, and even nostalgia, managerialism, and fixed identities.\n\nTo what extent can D & G be considered Marxists? It is undeniable that Marx holds an important position in their work – particularly in Anti-Oedipus, which sets its revolutionary praxis up as a combination of Nietzsche and Marx. Two decades prior to his collaboration with Deleuze, Guattari could be found in the thick of the two major intellectual tendencies of post-war France: existentialism and Marxist communism. In the late 1940s he was a prominent figure in the French section of the Fourth International of the International Communist Party, itself a band of militant Trotskyites; throughout the 1950s, he would drift towards a more libertarian communist position, working with other radicals and writing detailed critiques of the Soviet Union’s state structure and organizing against the Stalinists in the mainstream of French communist politics. In 1964, when this left opposition began to identify as Maoist, Guattari broke with them and began to move in the direction of the anarchic sectors of the students movement.\n\nDeleuze, on the other hard, had avoided these sorts of politics. While having been an enthusiastic reader of Sartre, existentialism didn’t appeal much to him, nor did the orthodox forms of Marxism. Towards the end of his life he did describe himself as a Marxist (“Felix Guattari and I have remained Marxists, in our two different ways, perhaps”),iv and at the time of his death was preparing to write a monograph on Marx. His late texts such as 1992’s “Postscript on the Societies of Control” were self-described as being Marxist, though it is a very funny kind of Marxism: when notions of resistance briefly raises its head, it isn’t the proletariat seizing factories, but “piracy and the introduction of viruses” into computer networks.v And while one would expect a self-described Marxist writing a Marxist text to use something akin to a Marxist theory of history, Deleuze’s vision of development doesn’t focus on class struggle, but on technological development. Instead of Marx, his point of reference is Foucault – a figure whose on relationship to Marxism is contested and complicated.vi\n\n‘A very funny kind of Marxism’ is probably the best way to describe Anti-Oedipus, as the very subtitle of Capitalism and Schizophrenia signals. The book, as Jean-Francois Lyotard would later argue, might try to remain ostensibly Marxist, but it is an undeniably variant – or more properly, mutant – form. For Lyotard, “the book’s silence on class struggle, the saga of the worker and the function of his party” helps craft a post-Marxism (or anti-?) that is scrubbed of the “[b]ad conscience in Marx himself, and worse and worse in the Marxists.”vii What might be the nature of this bad conscience? It is, Lyotard suggests, a feeling of guilt or repulsion for being entranced for elements within the dynamics of market processes – namely, the ability to shake the foundations of the entrenched: “[i]n the figure of Kapital that Deleuze and Guattari propose, we easily recognize what fascinates Marx: the capitalist perversion, the subversion of codes, religions, decency, trades, educations, cuisine, speech…”\n\nIII. Behind the Veil of Capital\n\nAs far back as the Communist Manifesto, Marx draws our attention, usually through the use of ecstatic and poet imagery, to the positive aspects of capitalism in that it both destabilizes old formers of power while simultaneously carrying out processes of ‘modernization’. “All fixed, fast-frozen relations”, as the famous passage goes, “with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all newly-formed ones become antiquated before they ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of his life, and his relations with his kind.” It is for this reason that D & G use terms like line of flight, deterritorialization, and decoding to describe capitalist relations: “lines of flight” because it follows a snaking trajectory of desire towards the new; “deterritorialization” because it uproots things from where they are stuck and allows them to circulate; and “decoding” because it breaks down codes, that is, the strictures of tradition, identity, culture, and other imposed value systems.\n\nDoes this not, however, fall rather short from the reality of capitalism? Marx was able to somewhat chart a course between being enthralled by the intertwining of economic circulation and exploitation, on one side of things, and the exploitation and violence on the other – though he still fell victim to series of critical inconsistencies that ultimately helped in undermining much of his project, be it confusion between the state and the market (as drawn out by Kevin Carson in Studies in Mutualist Political Economy),viii his repugnant and Eurocentric support for British imperialism in India, or the ambiguous relationship between capitalist development and liberation in the core of his philosophy of history – discussions surround which helped shape the paths taken following the Bolshevik revolution.ix\n\nD & G offer an escape from these inconsistencies and ambiguities, but it is an escape route that changes the very nature of the Marxist analysis of capitalism, and with it, the revolutionary goals that this analysis is intended to point towards. What is essential to note is that the elements that are identified as being ‘positive’ in capitalism – lines of flight, deterritorialization, decoding – are also the very things that become associated with liberatory politics. To wage a non-fascist revolt against the world – which is indeed the very goal of a book like Anti-Oedipus – is to revolt against the old in order to break open the possibility for new forms to arise. For Deleuze and Guattari it is desire itself that motors this process, just as it is desire that motivates all attempts at to move along a line of flight, to deterritorialize, and decode. Similarly, forces like deterritorialization and decoding put into play new desires that were not previously there. Deleuze and Guattari’s conception of desire is productive and tends towards excess and circulation, as opposed to the notions of desire rooted lack (as offered in earlier psychoanalytic discourses of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan).\n\nDoes this mean that capitalism can be identified as the expression of desire itself, a suggestion that sounds remarkably close to the rambling utterances of the vulgar libertarians and “anarcho”-capitalists? Not exactly. D & G argue for an understanding of capitalism not simply as a system, but as a constantly unfolding process. This process is not merely a reflection of desire filtered through the exchange patterns of the market, but a host of social relations tangled up in immanent relations of power and domination. No matter how flexible power relations may become, they always require some sort of rigid and fixed foundation at their base, some territory in which their codes operate. It would seem then that the elements of explosive creativity exhibited capitalist entrepreneurship and circulation – the market processes themselves, in other words – would stand opposed to this power, yet it does not. This is because, D & G argue, deterritorialization and decoding are only half of the capitalist process, and are conjoined with the reciprocal processes of reterritorialization and recoding. What’s more is that reterritorialization and recoding are presented as ‘stabilization mechanisms’ of sorts for the system itself, without which capitalism itself would cease to be. To quote them at length,\n\n…capitalism constantly counteracts, constantly inhibits this tendency [towards dissolution] while at the same time allowing it it free rein; it continually seeks to avoid reaching its limit while simultaneously tending towards that limit. Capitalism institutes or restores all sorts of residual and artificial, individual, imaginary, or symbolic territorialities, thereby attempting, as best it can, to recode, to rechannel persons who have been defined in terms of abstract quantities. Everything returns or recurs: States, nations, families. This what makes the ideology of capitalism “a motley painting of everything that has ever been believed”… The more the capitalist machine deterritorializes, decoding and axiomatizing flows in order to extract surplus value from them, the more the ancillary apparatuses, such as government bureaucracies and the forces of law and order, do their utmost to reterritorialize, absorbing in the process a larger and larger share of surplus value.x\n\nThat capitalism requires a state to maintain itself is no new revelation (nor is anything in the paragraph above). The best of Marx’s writings laid out, in incredible detail, the way the evolution of the modern state played a fundamental role in the birth of capitalism, while Benjamin Tucker’s excellent analysis showed how state action built up capitalism, as opposed to deterring it. The post-Marxist Regulation of School, which includes figures like Michel Aglietta and Bob Jessop, has conducted numerous studies of the way regulatory systems allow capitalism to ‘reproduce’ its relations. What D & G are describing here dovetails with these various analyses, but they are concerned with a very specific function: the way the state ‘seizes’ or ‘captures’ increasingly larger and larger elements in the forces that are being unleashed as a means of maintaining the entities that profit from this unleashing. While this might sound somewhat esoteric (and counterintuitive, especially in the face of traditional economic discourses), this process is more or less a depiction of networks of power relations being ‘reproduced’ by the constant co-production of capitalism and the state.\n\nD & G take this notion from two primary sources. The first is the study of money that was carried out by Foucault and presented as part of his series of 1970-1971 lectures at the College de France on “the will to know”. In these lectures, Foucault illustrates how ‘fixed money’ – money that imposed by the state, as opposed to the ‘spontaneous currency’ that appears to occur naturally – in ancient Greece operated as a regulatory mechanism for the whole of society. Money in Greek society “prevents excess, pleonexia, having too much… But it also prevents excessive poverty…”xi Taxation, for Foucault, is an essential aspect of the function of fixed money, and not some aberration to its evolution or something applied later by unscrupulous bureaucrats. Instead, it was created with taxation in mind, as something that could create a taxonomy of classes, help keep class structures stay relatively rigid in their make-up (primarily through debt accrued by the lower classes and the upward flow of tax money to the upper classes), and to facilitate public work projects necessary for the expansive of economic interests beyond their natural scope. Looking the modern era, D & G write that “the Greeks discovered in their own way what the Americans discovered after the New Deal: that heavy taxes are good for business… In a word, money – the circulation of money – is the means of rendering the debt infinite.”xii\n\nThe second source is the position of the neo-Marxist Monthly Review school put, as put forward by Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy in their book Monopoly Capital. Controversial in the annals of Marxism for their transgression of many of the central tenets of Marxist orthodoxy (such as the tendency for the rate of profit to fall), Baran and Sweezy were primarily concerned with the increasingly ‘organized capitalism’ that had grown in period running from the 1880s through the 1960s. This stage of capitalist development was marked by high levels of centralization of economic power in small handfuls of firms, the market activity between which could only be best described as monopolistic competition. Such a system becomes intractably top-heavy, Baran and Sweezy argue, making the economy tend towards stagnation by running up too much excess production and by slowing money’s circulation through the economy. Thus the state comes to pick up the slack, absorbing excess production and capital to ‘pump energy’ back into the economy, be it through welfare programs, infrastructure renewal, military spending, or any other ‘productive’ form of taxpayer-funded government enterprise. Sounding a bit like Foucault in his study of money, Baran and Sweezy suggest that\n\n…since large-scale government spending enables the economy to operate much closer to capacity, the net effect on the magnitude of private surplus is both positive and large… To [the ‘big businessman’], government spending means more effective demand, and he senses that he can shift most of the associated taxes onto consumers or backwards onto workers. In addition… the intricacies of the tax system, specially tailored to fit the needs of all sorts of special interests, open up endless opportunities for speculative and windfall gains. All in all, the decisive sector of the American ruling class is well on the way to becoming a convinced believer in the beneficent nature of government spending.xiii\n\nD & G expand these insights into a more generalized phenomenon, which they dub “capitalist” or “social axiomatics”. A mechanic process essential to the functioning of capitalism, these axiomatics are the means through which anything deterritorialized or decoded is rerouted back into the state-capitalism assemblage. It applies not only to the capture of monetary flows by the state via taxation, or the much earlier capture of exchange and circulation itself by the overcoding of spontaneous currencies with fixed money, but to things like the recuperation and co-optation of oppositional forms into the logic of power, so on and so forth. “There is a tendency within capitalism”, say D &G in A Thousand Plateaus, “to continually more axioms. After the end of World War I, the joint influence of the world depression and the Russian revolution forced capitalism to multiply its axioms, to invent new ones dealing with the working class, unemployment, union organizations, social institutions, the role of the State, the foreign and domestic markets, Keynesian economics, and the New Deal were axiom laboratories. Examples of the creations of new axioms after the Second World War: the Marshall Plan, forms of assistance and lending, transformation in the monetary system.”xiv\n\nAs is plain to see, sitting at the center of these interrelated concepts and models – reterritorialization, recoding, the addition/subtraction of axioms – is the state itself. D & G’s conception of capitalism is like a hydraulic system, where everything, be it capital, goods, people, and even desire, moves in flows that are constantly productive. Yet at the center of this system is the regulator that makes it work: “The state, its police, and its army form a gigantic enterprise of antiproduction, but at the heart of production itself, and conditioning this production.”xv\n\nIV. Against the State\n\nIn A Thousand Plateaus, these dynamics get recast as a struggle between state apparatuses and war machines. In Anti-Oedipus, divergent, deterritorialized and decoded flows and forces are treated as having “nomadic” qualities; the “war machine” is the next stage of this analysis, focusing on the more intransigent and conflict-driven aspects of their functions. War machines, in other words, make exactly what their name implies, and the target of this war is the state itself (D & G here were drawing on the anthropological work of Pierre Clastres, which analyzed the way certain indigenous societies made the repelling of the state the very rationale of their social quasi-orders). War machines come in many different forms: your affinity group is a war machine, the agorist is a war machine, street gangs and pirates, even certain kinds of commercial organizations. Not all war machines are positive: they’re capable of being darkly violent, tribalistic, even fascistic. While much could be said about this, it is the specific confluence of the war machine with particular economic functions that concerns us here.\n\nAgainst the war machine, D & G suggest, is the “apparatus of capture”, which is a function of the state that seizes or appropriates the divergent movement and makes it a part of itself. Such a force fits quickly comfortably along the treatment of reterritorialization, recoding, and axiomatics; indeed, D & G identify the apparatus of capture with the “megamachine”, which was Lewis Mumford’s term for large, stae-organized ‘socio-technical’ system that regiment and discipline the people bound up within it.xvi Importantly, they draw a further correlation between the megamachine and certain economic and political phenomena and mechanisms: the apparatus of capture “functions in three modes…: rent, profit, and taxation.” This schema, D & G tell us, is a recasting of Marx’s famous “trinity formula”, which he used to the describe the way the relations of capital become social relations. What makes D & G’s treatment different from Marx’s is twofold: first, because it positions the state, not the pure economic logic of capitalism, at the center of things; and second, because it is no longer a question of how capitalism becomes a social relation, but how things outside of the purview of the state become enmeshed in these various power relations. “It is not the State that presupposes a mode of production”, they write, “quite the opposite, it is the State that makes production a ‘mode.’”xvii\n\nOf taxation we’ve already said quite a bit, so it is rent and profit that must be addressed. While taxation is obviously correlated to state function, for many the suggestion that rent and profit – two fundamental aspects of the capitalist market economy – arise from the functions of the state might appear as absolutely erroneous. But consider the little-acknowledged understanding, even in conventional economic discourses, that the more open the systems of exchange and circulation are, the more the capacity to maintain rates of profit accumulation in the long-term falls. With the capacity to enter freely, or to subtract entire sets of relations, from market systems, the ability for certain actors to assume an inordinate share of the market becomes untenable – which is precisely why reliance on state-granted and enforced monopolies becomes necessary for entrenched power structures to shore themselves up against this deterritorializing tide.\n\nThe same could be said for rent, which is contingent, in the capitalist system at least, on private property rights backed by the state and rendered in the form of standardized titles. Perhaps the relationship between rent and the state is even more obvious than that of the state and property, given the undeniable role of the state in partitioning older property systems, and setting them into a circulation beneficial to economic, social, and political elites. The assault on rent that would occur in the void of the state was summed up best by Robert Anton Wilson: “Of course, since Austrian ideas exist as factors in human behavior, I will admit that people, hoodwinked by these ideas, will continue to pay rent even in freedom, for a while at least. But I think that, after a time, observing that their Tuckerite neighbors are not submitting to this imposture, they would come to their senses and cease paying tribute to the self-elected ‘owners’… I myself would not pay rent one day beyond the point at which the police… are at hand to collect it via ‘argument per blunt instrument’.”xviii\n\nSo who or what are the war machines that are captured in these three mechanisms of capture, tax, rent, and profit? D & G spend a significant amount of time discussing figures that would be dismissed in the annals of Marxism as ‘petty-bourgeois’: artisans, craftsmen, stone masons, metallurgists, merchants, etc. The existence of these figure does not, of course, remove from the picture of the exploitation of the peasant – and later proletarian – classes, but for D & G it is their nomadic and autonomous nature, “since their existence did not entirely depend on a surplus accumulated by a local State apparatus”, that makes them attractive for prefiguring new political ways of thinking and acting that escape from and attack the state. Referencing the historical development of metallurgy, D & G emphasize the way that the state’s drive to monopolize economies and maintain the status quo of power linked the capture of these actors to the exploitation of the lower classes: “State overcoding keeps the metallurgists, both craft and mercantile, within strict bounds, under powerful bureaucratic control, with monopolistic foreign trade in the service of the ruling class, so that the peasants themselves benefit little from the State innovations.”xix\n\nA more contemporary example of these dynamics in action would be the way 1) tinkerers and hackers produced paradigm-shifting innovations in information-communication technology; 2) the subsequent capture of these innovations under the state’s enforcement of IP laws and their service to large, top-heavy multinational corporations; and 3) the way further innovations from these developments are obstructed. Thus we can suggest a direct continuity between the reflections on artisans, craftsmen and metallurgists in A Thousand Plateaus to the musings on piracy and hacking in “Postscript on the Societies of Control” alluded to earlier.\n\nSo what we ultimately have, stepping back looking over these various tracings, is a contested space, a space of conflict, on one side of which is the state, capitalism, and the multi-scaled ecology of power that runs through these formations. On the other: autonomous movement, dynamic exchange and circulation, creative ecologies driven by desire. The former makes the latter the raw materials for itself, makes desire, creativity, the impulse to flee and transgress traditional territories, borders, and limits (is to destabilize not the most fundamental desire there is?), something that upholds more imperceptible forms of domination by way its various mechanisms and apparatuses. The most egregious of these is the way in which these ecologies force so many would-be breaks to simply fold inwards, and return to supporting the systems they supposedly contest. Liberation from capitalism is often synonymous with the retreat to social democratic variants of the same, which is no break from capitalism, but the strengthening of it by calling on the full forces of the state to flex its power. When we leave the question of blood-and-soil identity and aesthetic accouterments to the side, how different can we honestly saw these basic mechanics of the social democratic state are from the fascist state? With this in mind, let us return to the notorious accelerationist passage in Anti-Oedipus, which hopefully by this point take on a new appearance:\n\n[W]hich is the revolutionary path? Is there one? – to withdraw from the world market, as Samir Amin advises Third World countries to do, in a curious revival of the fascist “economic solution”? Or might it be to go in the opposite direction? To go further still, that is, in the movement of the market, of decoding and deterritorialization? For perhaps the flows are not yet deterritorialized enough, not decoded enough, from the viewpoint of a theory and a practice of a highly schizophrenic character. Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to “accelerate the process”, as Nietzsche put it: in this matter, the truth is that we haven’t seen anything yet.\n\nIs this not a vision of militant, leftist (or even post-leftist) articulation of how systems of exchange and circulation, operating on a global level, can undermine dominant ecologies of power, and that crude brutalism they inexorably tend towards – fascism? It is not a secret ode to neoliberal globalization, or the breakthrough of the capitalist world market; following their vision of the state and capitalism as forces bound up together as a common, modular, and reactive assemblage, ‘neoliberalization’ and all that comes with it (the slippering sloganeering of ‘privatization’, ‘deregulation’, ‘austerity’, ‘structural adjustment’, etc.) is nothing more than the next unfolding of the processes of adding and subtracting axioms. A positive left-wing anarchist accelerationism would have to position the horizon of their political activity beyond axiomatics, in a future space that breaks apart these ecologies. This is a future where desire operates at the “molecular” level, not at the level of some abstract collectivity.\n\nIt would be utterly incorrect to say that the entirety of D & G’s praxis is about some ‘free-market communism’, as it has been described by Eugene Holland.xx It would be equally incorrect , however, to pretend that the relationship between markets and liberation does not matter in the great scheme of their work (as so many leftist commentators, be they academic or not, have done). Any market anarchist elements that are gleamed must be married to their wider gamut of concerns – futurity, globality, the unleashing of desires to their fullest extent, the dissolution of all externals and internal dynamics of power, on and on. As the late Mark Fisher described, the accelerationism of D & G was “about accelerating certain tendencies which capitalism itself has to keep at bay… when those tendencies are accelerated, we go beyond those standard forms of subjectivities, life, and work that capitalism depends upon.”xxi",
  "latent_16135": "Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who has smoked crack cocaine, read a statement to the press this afternoon purporting to respond to claims published in Gawker, and followed on by the Toronto Star, that a video of him smoking crack cocaine was being offered for sale by people involved in the Toronto crack trade.\n\nFord, who—aside from briefly referring to the charges as \"ridiculous\"—has remained silent in the eight days since we published our story about his crack tape, made two claims in his remarks this afternoon:\n\n1) \"I do not use crack cocaine.\"\n\n2) \"Nor am I an addict of crack cocaine.\"\n\nNeither of those statements is inconsistent with Rob Ford having been caught on tape smoking crack cocaine within the past six months. The fact that Rob Ford says he does not currently use crack cocaine has no bearing on his past behavior. He did not say, as one who has never smoked crack cocaine might say, \"I have never smoked crack cocaine.\" He said he does not smoke crack cocaine, which is the sort of thing that someone who woke up this morning and decided to stop smoking crack cocaine might say, on the grounds that it's not presently untrue.\n\nSince we know that Rob Ford used to smoke crack cocaine, and in fact most certainly did smoke crack cocaine at some point within the last six months, we can only interpret his statement claiming not to currently smoke crack cocaine as an announcement that he has decided to kick the habit.\n\nAs for his second statement: No one here has accused him of being addicted to crack cocaine. As far as we are aware, the main point of controversy in Toronto has centered on that fact of his use of crack cocaine, not on whether that use was compulsive or recreational.\n\nBut what about the video? Here's what Ford—who does not smoke crack cocaine—had to say about that: \"I can't comment on a video that I have never seen or does not exist.\"\n\nSo, to recap: Rob Ford, who was caught on video smoking crack cocaine within the last six months, says he is not a current user of crack cocaine, is not an addict of crack cocaine, and has no comment on the video that shows him smoking crack cocaine.",

For three weeks, she’s dominated headlines, mobilized protesters, [and made] it safe, her supporters say, to voice doubts about the war, just as Walter Cronkite did on the evening news in 1968.”\n\nRELATED: Hillary Clinton and Obama’s Lies on Benghazi — Too Many to Count, But Let’s Try\n\nThen–NBC News anchor Brian Williams introduced a profile of Sheehan by saying, “As the 1960s protest song said, ‘There’s something happening here.’”\n\nSheehan’s use-by date was January 20, 2009, President Obama’s inauguration day. She was — and is — a vocal critic of Obama, too. But there was no room in the script for that. When she was a thorn in Bush’s side, she was just a normal American mom speaking truth to power. When she started criticizing Obama, the same media dismissed her as a crackpot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn’t particularly unusual in American politics. Activists often pretend to be “normal” people plucked out of obscurity by events. And sometimes, normal people plucked out of obscurity by events become activists as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how the press treats, say, Joe the Plumber or Sandra Fluke or Valerie Plame often seems to hinge on their political utility, or lack thereof.\n\nRELATED: 13 Hours: The Non-Political Benghazi Movie that Hillary Can’t Avoid\n\nWhich brings us back to Charles Woods.\n\nWoods is the father of Tyrone Woods, one of the heroes killed in the Benghazi attack.\n\nI have never found Benghazi to be as mysterious as some people think.

During that campaign, Obama had made his “success” in decimating al-Qaeda one of his key talking points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#share#As with pretty much every other terror attack before and after, the Obama administration’s first response was to downplay the terrorism issue.\n\nAnd, as with pretty much every other terror attack before and after, the Obama administration worked diligently to change the subject to something more politically convenient. We are currently debating Obama’s gun-control agenda, for instance, rather than a wave of Islamic State and Islamic State–inspired attacks, because this White House would rather have that debate than discuss Obama’s claim that ISIS is “contained.”\n\nRELATED: Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi Defense: It Depends on What the Meaning of ‘Lied’ Is\n\nSo, in the wake of the Benghazi attack, the president — whose oath of office requires him to defend the Constitution — focused the national discussion on the dangers of free expression. The White House insisted the attack was a response to a YouTube video mocking Islam that had been posted more than two months earlier. Obama even stressed the point in a major address to the United Nations. Cooperative journalists and intellectuals took to the airwaves and op-ed pages fretting over the limits to the First Amendment.\n\nHillary Clinton, whose own voracious hunger for the presidency was at stake as well, fueled the conversation. She vowed to bring the filmmaker to justice (which, as Reason magazine’s Matt Welch notes, is not a secretary of state’s job).

More recently, the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, took up the issue and essentially washed his hands of the whole affair, saying he couldn’t determine who was telling the truth.\n\nWoods’s moral authority isn’t absolute, because no one’s is.

  "latent_16353": "GQ article quotes Brady Quinn as undermining Tim Tebows success\n\nBrady Quinn has apologized for his comments about Tim Tebow that were put in a GQ article this past week. Quinn apologized via Twitter explaining his “disappointment with the writer” for taking his comments out of context.\n\nBrady Quinn’s comments were featured in a GQ article by Michael Silver on Tebowmania, “The Year of Magical Stinking: An Oral History of Tebow Time.” The article was written on the miracle of Tim Tebow’s success despite his terrible passing game through quotations from NFL professionals like analysts from ESPN and the NFL Network, various current NFL players and team managers as well as different coaches. Brady Quinn’s first comment gives way to how he felt about being leapfrogged by Tebow when former Denver QB was hurt. “I felt like the fans had a lot to do with that. Just ’cause they were chanting his name. There was a big calling for him. No, I didn’t have any billboards. That would have been nice.” Brady Quinn also seems to undermine Tebows talent by saying, about the team, “we’eve had a lot of, I guess, luck, to put it simply.”\n\nThe article also addresses Tebow’s “over the top Christianity” and how it has made some other players feel. Brady Quinn was quoted that he felt Tebow wasn’t very humble about his religion because of the way he flaunts it in front of the camera. “If you look at it as a whole, there’s a lot of things that just don’t seem very humble to me. When I get that opportunity, I’ll continue to lead not necessarily by trying to get in front of the camera and praying but by praying with my teammates, you know?” However, Brady Quinn wasn’t the only one who felt the need to question Tebow’s ways of praise; Nick Barnett, linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, was also quoted in the article as saying, “I think it does rub some of the guys the wrong way. For a lot of Christians, using football as a measuring stick of how good God is—it’s not necessarily what you’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nThough Brady Quinn blames the writer for taking his comments out of context, it does seem that he is being singled-out. As exemplified by Barnett’s comment, it’s any wonder why Quinn is the only one being chastised. Shawne Merriman, also a Buffalo Bill’s linebacker said in the article, “His teammates are making him look a lot better than he is,” and Terrell Suggs of the Baltimore Ravens said, “It’s just crazy that we’re calling him a phenomenon when basically he’s mediocre.”\n\nBrady Quinn has apologized via his Twitter, saying that his comments in the article “are in NO WAY reflective of my opinion of Tim.” Brady Quinn added, “I apologize to anyone who feels I was trying to take anything away from our Team’s or Tim’s success this season.”",

  "latent_16476": "Maybe you’ve always dreamed about retiring when you hit 60—or even before you get your AARP card at 50. Or perhaps you have watched the stock market climb for the past eight years in a row, with the S&P 500 index more than tripling since its 2009 low, and suddenly an early exit from the workplace seems as if it might realistically be within reach.\n\nGrab this opportunity to think about what “early” and “retirement” mean to you—and set yourself on a path to bring that vision to life. Some successful early retirees who now blog about their experience prefer the term “financial independence” to “retirement”: The essence is that you, and not an employer, get to call the shots on how you spend your days. That might be a pleasant schedule of travel and community service or maybe working as hard as—or harder than—before on a new business venture you’ve always hoped to pursue\n\nOn average, men stop paid work at age 64 and women at 62, government statistics show. Nearly half of retirees end up leaving the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to a recent report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That is often due to a layoff or an illness. But, encouragingly, a third speed up their exit because they can afford to.\n\nHaving a clear focus and a plan to retire early can be empowering. “It feels good to have a purpose and a strategy,” says Maggie Mistal, a career and executive coach in New York City. As you see your savings grow, “even the process of getting to your dream is fun and exciting,” she says.\n\nThat’s not to say that making an early exit is easy, though. The more ambitious your vision, the more important it is to start saving and planning as soon as possible and the more compromises between your current lifestyle and future goals you’ll likely need to make. Here are 12 key moves to make—from early in your career to your departure from the office—to turn your early-retirement dream into reality.\n\nLAY THE GROUNDWORK\n\nTo buy yourself the freedom to retire early, adopt the right mind-set and financial plan as early as possible in your career.\n\n1. Amp Up Your Savings Strategy\n\nThe first and probably most critical step if you really want to retire early is to assume a whole new attitude toward your finances. Every decision to spend money has to be a conscious tradeoff weighed against your goal. A little belt-tightening won’t do it. It’s saying no to big-ticket expenditures that makes the difference, not swearing off your daily latte. “Making your coffee at home is not going to get you to early retirement,” says Arielle O’Shea, investing and retirement specialist at NerdWallet.\n\nThe goal, in short, is to live far below your means so that you can shovel away an outsize portion of your income. How much? Aim for at least 30%, financial planners say, vs. the conventional target of 10% to 15% for a typical 40-year career. To do that, make savings a nonnegotiable item in your budget, says O’Shea, and funnel all tax refunds and bonuses into your nest egg as well.\n\nNotes: These amounts provide an 80% probability of lasting to age 90 when invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Assumes withdrawals rise with inflation each year. Source: David Blanchett, Morningstar\n\nGet creative about other money hacks that can help. Jennifer Owens, 39, of the Sacramento area, hopes to retire by age 45. The corporate strategy worker gets pretax money deducted from her paycheck for childcare expenses, and when she gets reimbursed, that money goes straight into savings. “You spend what your budget allows,” Owens says. While she and her husband recently bought a new Honda Accord, it was only because his 1997 BMW, purchased used, had finally given out.\n\n2. Avoid Lifestyle Creep\n\nThere’s a natural tendency to increase your spending as your earnings increase, which financial advisors call “lifestyle creep.” Certainly you should treat yourself when you get a big raise or promotion. But also direct at least half of those additional dollars to savings, by having more money deducted from your paycheck or transferred from your bank account.\n\nThe aim is to spend your dollars carefully but not feel deprived. Lesia and Al Riddick, both 42, of Fairfield Township, Ohio, say they have managed to live well and still save $1 million. The couple, who have no children, enjoy traveling but meticulously research the best deals and even pack food from home to whittle their travel meal bill. “There are things we value and things we don’t value,” says Lesia, who hopes to retire by age 50 from her job in information technology. Al, an entrepreneur and author, plans to keep working but scale back to spend more time with his wife.\n\n3. Cut Your Housing Costs\n\nIf you’re like most Americans, your biggest expense—and thus your biggest opportunity to save—is your home. Housing costs devour a third of the average budget, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thinking of buying new digs? Stay put if your home is big enough, or at least say no to buying the biggest house you can afford.\n\nConsider a hypothetical family in the Minneapolis area, where prices are in line with the U.S. average. They would save more than $50,000 over 10 years by staying in a starter home vs. upgrading to one 30% bigger, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at mortgage-information website HSH. That estimate includes mortgage, property tax, insurance, and utility and maintenance costs.\n\nHSH and other firms offer online calculators to help you determine the maximum mortgage you can swing based on your income and other financial details. But “you don’t have to borrow the max,” Gumbinger says. If you are looking to power-save, keep your housing spending to 30% or less of income, he says.\n\nWanda Crossman, 52, of Wyandotte, Mich., and her husband have found another way to limit housing costs. They own a two-family home and their tenant pays $950 a month. That covers most of the Crossmans’ $1,060 mortgage; the remainder is less than what many Americans pay for cell phone service.\n\n4. Take Advantage of Tax Savings\n\nThis much is certain: If you really want to quit early, you have to commit to putting away the maximum allowed in tax-favored accounts where Uncle Sam helps your money grow faster. This year, Owens and her husband plan to max out their 401(k)s to the limit of $18,000 per person and their Roth IRAs to $5,500 each. Married couples who file a joint tax return can fully fund Roth IRAs if their income is less than $186,000, regardless of whether they have a savings plan at work; the contribution is limited above that income and ends at $196,000. If you’re 50 or over, you can add an extra $6,000 to a 401(k) and $1,000 to an IRA.\n\nIf you have a side hustle as well as your regular job, use a retirement plan such as a SEP-IRA to save a portion of that income. In 2017, you can fund a SEP with 20% of adjusted profit, up to $54,000.\n\nAnother smart move, if you have a qualifying high-deductible health plan, is to pump as much as you can into a health savings account. An HSA can deliver a richer payoff than your 401(k) under certain circumstances, says Greg Geisler, a professor of accounting at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. Earnings contributed to HSAs aren’t taxed and can also be withdrawn tax-free—as long as the money is used to pay for qualifying medical expenses now or later in life. If the HSA is for one person under age 55, the worker and firm can put in a combined $3,400 this year.\n\nBEFORE YOU LEAP\n\nGetting close to your hoped-for departure? Here are the key elements of your plan that need to be locked down.\n\n5. Put a Price Tag on Your Dreams\n\nWhen you are within five years of your desired early exit, think hard about the lifestyle you want and tote up how much it will cost. That includes putting some specific figures on where you will live and the activities you will engage in. Many people mistakenly think their expenses will go down when they stop working, says Ron Weiner, managing director of RDM Financial Group at HighTower. In reality, many new retirees spend about 20% more than before, he says.\n\nAfter all, you will have the time and energy to pursue hobbies and take trips, which costs more than sitting at a desk all day. The younger you are when you leave the workplace, the more years in which you are likely to have the energy and good health for an active (and potentially costly) retirement lifestyle.\n\nKnow that some items in your budget may increase at a higher rate than overall inflation. Health care expenses, for example, could rise by as much as 7% to 10% annually, says Andrew Murdoch, president of Somerset Wealth Strategies in Portland, Ore.\n\nTools like T. Rowe Price’s Retirement Income Calculator can help you see if your portfolio is on track to support your projected spending. If not, you’ll have some choices to make: boost your savings, scale back your lifestyle expectations, or push your retirement out a few years.\n\n6. Line Up Medical Coverage\n\nHaving access to medical insurance when you leave the workforce can be a make-or-break factor for would-be early retirees. You’ll need a bridge until the Medicare eligibility age of 65. The gold standard: coverage through a spouse’s job or a former employer of you or your spouse.\n\nDarrow Kirkpatrick, 56, author and publisher of CanIRetireYet.com, was able to retire at age 50 thanks in part to the health coverage his wife had as a teacher. When she retired a few years after him, that insurance morphed into retiree medical coverage for the couple. (In private industry, just 16% of people worked at companies that offered retiree coverage in 2015, says the Employee Benefit Research Institute.)\n\nIf you won’t have coverage through a job, you’ll have to purchase individual insurance. Start researching current offerings through a broker such as eHealth.com. Nationwide, the average premium for a 2017 silver plan on the Obamacare exchanges is $574 a month for a 50-year-old nonsmoker who doesn’t qualify for government subsidies, according to HealthPocket; at age 60, that average is $872. Silver plans come with high out-of-pocket costs, including an average deductible of $3,572 for individuals, according to HealthPocket.\n\nKeep in mind that the options and costs you’ll face are up in the air as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans move to dismantle Obamacare. Some proposals would boost the costs of people approaching retirement by allowing insurers to charge older buyers up to five times what the youngest ones pay, vs. three times now.\n\n7. Play It Safer With Your Portfolio\n\nIf you plan to retire at age 50, say, you should be more conservative with your portfolio in your late 40s than your peers who plan to stay in the workforce until 65 or later. This is to avoid what advisors call “sequence of return risk,” or having a series of down markets clobber you when your finances are particularly vulnerable.\n\nConsider an example from fund company MFS of two hypothetical 61-year-old retirees who begin taking $12,500 a year from their $250,000 portfolios, with their withdrawals indexed 3% for inflation. Over a 30-year period, returns average 6.6% a year for both. Investor A, who starts off with three years of losses in a row, runs out of money at age 80. Investor B, who experiences early positive returns, sees his portfolio grow to $632,606 by age 91.\n\nAs a very general rule of thumb, you should have 40% to 50% of your portfolio in stocks at retirement, says Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. By contrast, for a 50-year-old who plans to work to 65, he suggests 50% to 60%.\n\nSimilarly, David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar, says a 55-year-old early retiree might keep 45% of his money in stocks, compared with 55% for someone the same age who plans to work until 65.\n\nOne way to gradually lower your portfolio’s stock risk is to use the new dollars you invest mostly to buy bonds, Pfau says. That could include building a “ladder” of Treasury securities by buying one 10-year note each year at TreasuryDirect.gov in the decade leading up to retirement.\n\n8. Plan for a Paycheck\n\nYou may have a clear vision for a deeply satisfying retirement life of social activities, travel, and volunteering. But in most cases, unless you are truly wealthy, you should also have a concrete plan for some type of paid work. While part-time labor gives retirees of all ages a financial cushion, earned income is essential for those who retire young, experts say.\n\nAs shown in the graphic below, a 55-year-old retiree who is paid just $10,000 a year for 10 years will increase the chances of his portfolio lasting until age 90 by nearly 10 percentage points, according to a calculation by Blanchett of Morningstar. This math assumes the man has a $1 million nest egg and withdraws 4% of that the first year; after that, he boosts the dollar amount each year by the rate of inflation.\n\nNotes: Assumes assets are 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds and withdrawals increase each year with inflation. Source: David Blanchett, Morningstar\n\nPart-time income can also help you delay claiming Social Security until age 70, a move that will boost your payout by up to 8% a year. Another consideration: Your Social Security payout is based on your top 35 years of earnings, so you want to have at least that many years of work income.\n\n9. Get a Head Start on Gig Work\n\nIf you don’t explore your options for retirement jobs now, “you are wholly unprepared to pivot” from full-time to part-time work in retirement, says Mark Gasche, vice president of career strategy at SoFi, an online finance company. This holds particularly true for those who have worked for decades in the same role or company, he notes.\n\nPlan to consult in your field? Start doing small jobs for friends or nonprofits, says career coach Mistal. You might not charge them, but ask for a testimonial when you’re done, she says. Websites such as VolunteerMatch .org can help you find nonprofits in need of volunteer help with grant writing and other professional tasks. If you’d like to explore paid options, firms such as Patina Solutions match experienced executives with companies looking for project-based help.\n\nFor another type of income, a friend of Kenn Tacchino, professor of financial planning at Widener University in Chester, Pa., started renting out a room in his home to out-of-town executives visiting a nearby company. One person ended up staying for two years on an extended assignment.\n\nSUSTAIN YOUR EARLY YEARS\n\nYou did it! But keep an eye on your compass and be ready to course-correct as you navigate your way in the initial stage of retirement.\n\n10. Stay Financially Flexible\n\nFinancial planners typically run annual checkups on their clients’ finances. If you don’t work with an advisor, do your own yearly review of your spending, which you can track with an app such as Mint. Revisit the financial-planning tool you used previously to update how long your portfolio might last given your actual spending and reasonable assumptions of investment returns.\n\nYou may go into retirement with a plan to withdraw a certain percentage of your nest egg in year one, and then adjust the dollar amount for inflation each year. For eight-in-10 odds of your money lasting to age 90, Blanchett of Morningstar says to use a 3.8% withdrawal rate if you retire at 65, 3% at 55, and 2.6% at 45. (Those percentages correlate with the required nest eggs in “What It Takes” graphic near the top of the story.)\n\nNotes: Assumes money is invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds and withdrawals increase annually with inflation. Source: David Blanchett, Morningstar\n\nIf a spending shock leads you to withdraw a lot more one year—maybe it’s for a granddaughter’s destination wedding—cut back the next year, Blanchett says. Similarly, he says that if you skip the inflation bump to your withdrawals in any year the market goes down, you will boost your chances of your portfolio lasting until age 90 by nearly 11 percentage points. That calculation assumes an initial withdrawal rate of 4%.\n\n11. Tweak Your Portfolio\n\nAs you move further into retirement, you might boost your stock exposure once again—say, to 60%—to benefit from the higher returns stocks have provided over time. For protection, you could couple that with buying a so-called longevity annuity that guarantees a set income stream later on. A 55-year-old man who invests $50,000 today can get $3,115 monthly for life starting at age 85, according to Murdoch of Somerset Wealth Strategies.\n\n12. Be Flexible on the Nonfinancial Part Too\n\nEarly retirement can be amazing, but it can also take a little time to adjust to.\n\nOne challenge: “If you’re 50 and retired, there aren’t a lot of people like you,” says Ken Moraif, senior advisor at Money Matters in Plano, Texas. You might meet working friends during their lunch hour. Look to make new pals, younger and older, through groups you get involved with.\n\nMurdoch finds that his early-retiree clients benefit from a “goal-focused approach.” One man, who retired as a chiropractor at 52, joined the Travelers’ Century Club, for people who have visited 100 or more countries. He takes pleasure in crossing countries off his list as he travels.\n\nEarly retirement involves some experimentation on how you want to live, Mistal says: “You’re giving your dreams a chance.”",
  "latent_16693": "Vice President Joe Biden says he did his part when it comes to marriage equality. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThere's one piece of the Obama legacy that Vice President Joe Biden is carving out as his own. \"I'd like to think I did my part for marriage equality,\" the vice president said at the Make Progress National Summit on Wednesday in Washington. \"And, by the way, it wasn't a half-thought. I said exactly what I believed.\"\n\nThe vice president took youth activists on a long, meandering journey – a speech House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to as \"master class\" – in the first of two major addresses he's delivering to progressives this week. Wednesday's speech was at an event sponsored by Generation Progress, the youth arm of the Center for American Progress think tank. The second one will be given at Netroots Nation in Detroit. And while he discussed a variety of issues, it was gay rights where he most marked his territory.\n\nBiden, of course, was bringing up the time he went on \"Meet the Press\" in May 2012 and endorsed same-sex marriage, beating his boss to the more progressive policy stance. \"Because how could I remain silent any longer on this issue,\" Biden recalled. \"And I know the president agreed with me as well.\" President Barack Obama did, later echoing Biden's statements.\n\nThe vice president said the quick turnaround of public opinion on gay rights, which allowed him the political cover, was thanks to the country's youngest activists – including the group he was addressing. \"You know, when I meet with progressive groups in the LGBT community they give me credit,\" Biden said. \"I say, 'No, you've liberated more straight guys and women than [I] have.'\"\n\nBiden then set a scene. It's 15 years earlier and a group of businesswomen and men are at a restaurant for lunch. \"And a waiter with a distinct lisp came up and asked for their order and someone said, 'Well let me tell you what I'd like,'\" Biden said, feminizing his voice and pretending to be a restaurant patron picking on the waiter. \"Everyone around that table, although they thought it was awful, wouldn't say anything.\" Because, as Biden put it, this was \"appropriate behavior\" – the consensus would have been that it's OK to make fun of someone who is gay. (Side note: Biden had a speech impediment as a kid.)\n\n\"Imagine what would happen today in any major city in America if some horse's tail said that at a luncheon?\" Biden mused. \"Everyone else at that table would turn around and say, 'What in the hell are you talking about man?'\"\n\nBiden brought up the example not just to tout his record and thank the activists, but to put them to work on another issue: campus sexual assault, something that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also spoke about at the daylong affair.\n\nWith a booming voice, Biden recommended any man who engages in such behavior be \"exorcised from the community.\" \"You're the only ones who can change it,\" Biden said. \"You have the ability, your generation … to make sure that anyone who engages in this behavior is a pariah.\"\n\nClarified on July 16, 2014 : This story has been revised to accurately reflect Joe Biden's former speech impediment.",
  "latent_17089": "Ahead of the Supreme Court’s Thursday ruling on Obamacare, Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul explained that government is already too involved in health care.\n\nThe one-time presidential candidate, who practiced medicine before becoming a congressman, had harsh words for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“It is obvious that Obamacare’s legal apologists either are wholly ignorant of constitutional principles, or wholly lawless in their blatant disregard for those principles,” Paul wrote on his online feed, “Texas Straight Talk.”\n\n“Likewise, supporters of Obamacare are willfully ignorant of basic economics. The fundamental problem with health care costs in America is that the doctor-patient relationship has been profoundly altered by third party interference. Third parties, either government agencies themselves or nominally private insurance companies virtually forced upon us by government policies, have not only destroyed doctor-patient confidentiality. They also inescapably drive up costs because basic market disciplines — supply and demand, price sensitivity, and profit signals — are destroyed … Obamacare, via its insurance mandate, is more of the same misdiagnosis.”\n\nThe Texas congressman went on to quote Gabriel Vidal, Chief Operating Officer of a U.S. hospital system who dismissed Obamacare back in 2009. Vidal stated, “Obama uses faulty logic to diagnose the problem.”\n\nPaul quoted Vidal to point out the flawed pricing that occurs when a third party is involved.\n\n“No matter how accurate the cost data, how well intentioned and how sophisticated [the] computer program … The just price of a health service can only be determined by the voluntary exchange of a patient with his hospital, physician, and pharmacist,” Vidal explained. “The relationship between the patient and his private provider has been corrupted by the intrusion of government and its intermediaries (HMOs, for example) to such an extent that we can no longer speak of a relationship that can produce meaningful pricing information.”\n\n“Absent such pricing information,” Paul wrote, “our system increasingly resembles socialist systems with centralized price setting, shortages, rationing, apathy, and declining quality of care.”\n\nPaul rejects plans for “a single payer government health care system” as well as plans that would maintain the status quo.\n\nWhat’s Ron Paul’s plan?\n\nHe wrote, “What America needs is a rejection of all government systems in favor of free market mechanisms.”\n\nFollow Nicole on Twitter",

  "latent_17167": "The relationship between women and the Left has always been complex. That fact leads many women to take a more critical look at the gender politics of the Left, to question the design of the unspoken hierarchy, and for some of us, to pare the idea of what the Left represents to the bare bones of its meaning. To tout a reductionist point of view for just a moment, the place of men in the Left has never been threatened, debated, or questioned whatsoever (and rightfully so), while the place of women has been… Let’s say “complicated.” This is, of course, dependent upon who you ask.\n\nSexual harassment and sexual assault are well-documented issues in any society or political sphere, that much has (hopefully) been made clear by being a sentient human being with decades of thinking and breathing on earth and understanding what happens to the other human beings around you. This is no different for leftist circles. In 2012, a member of the UK Socialist Workers Party announced that she’d been raped and repeatedly sexually harassed by Martin Smith, the former National Secretary of the organization. The “investigation” that followed demonstrated a noticeable lack of preparedness or willingness to respond to sexual harassment or sexual assault situations in leftist circles. Despite this being a pervasive and very serious issue, most groups have done little, if anything, to examine any harmful gender politics, underlying victim-blaming, or backroom misogyny that occurs in their circles.\n\nThis particular situation exhibited not only a lack of preparedness, but a reckless disregard for objectivity or fairness and obvious victim-blaming, as the Disputes Committee tasked with analyzing and voting on the final decision of the case consisted mostly of close friends and direct subordinates of Martin Smith. Not only this, but it was discovered that the woman had lodged an initial sexual assault report against Smith in 2011, two years before the investigation began. When it was finally underway, the line of questioning the complainant received were questions like “Is it fair to say you like a drink?’ in an attempt to discredit the victim and suggest that she was less likely to make wise decisions (I assume that’s their reason for asking that, I don’t deign to know the thought processes of misogynistic rape apologists). Despite overwhelming evidence against Smith, including another woman coming forward to admit that she, too, had been harassed by Smith, he was exonerated when the committee ruled that the evidence was “not proven,” but no reasoning was given for the ruling. Not only was Smith allowed to return to his usual post, but the central committee falsely stated that the leadership had voted never to discuss the claim again, and anyone caught doing so would be expelled from the organization.\n\nThis story is a problem that shows what happens behind the scenes of many leftist organizations. Many of you reading this will think to yourself “I’d never let that guy get away with what he did, how could they do that? What a bunch of sexist wankers!” and that’s what you should be thinking, but it’s not that simple. If it were that simple, those who harass and carry out sexual violence against women would not be tolerated and the problem would have largely been eradicated by now, but hasn’t been. Think of how he was able to absolve himself of all responsibility or punishment in the first place. Therein lies the problem.\n\nWhen a woman tells her political comrades that she’s been experiencing harassment or sexual violence, she’s met with varying degrees of toxicity. The most common of which is being told that your comrades “won’t take sides,” especially if they knew the aggressor. Coming in a close second is her comrades simply pretending it didn’t happen, acting as if they hadn’t heard it at all, and hoping the situation will magically go away or somehow resolve itself. If neither of those things happen or are possible, the victim-blaming begins. Perhaps most often, the survivor’s personal life, political activism, sex life, drinking habits, even clothing choices and appearance are scrutinized. Any reason an apologist can think of to discredit her, even irrelevant things like what she was wearing at the time of the attack or the subjective level of allure that her aura gives off, ranging from 1 to “slut,” is used to tell her she was either lying or that she was “asking for it.” Her announcement is met with fervent and ruthless accusations of trying to destroy the character of the aggressor, or that she’s “too emotional” or that she “misread the things he said/did” and that he would “never do that” to anyone. Aggressors are defended vehemently from the moment the complaint is announced. They’re called a “good organizer” or a “hard worker” or a “great leader,” showing that even if it’s found that this person did harass or assault the woman, their talents and usefulness outbid the fact that they’ve been actively perpetuating sexual violence and hostility. Victims are even encouraged not to go to police because doing so would be supportive of state violence and oppression, and that continuing to seek retribution will actively divide the group, and “That’s not what you want, is it?”\n\nThis discourse and the hidden politics, bias, and assumptions driving it are upholding a status quo that justifies the prioritization of the interests of those who actively perpetuate sexual violence against women over the safety of victims of sexual violence and women at large. We adopt a legalistic attitude towards perpetrators, touting “innocent until proven guilty,” not realizing that, by extension, we assume that those who come forward are guilty of lying about the allegation until they are proven innocent. How do we fix this? It’s very, very simple. Reject the idea that we’ve been inundated with by the state. Reject the misogynistic narrative we’ve been conditioned by the state to perpetuate when it comes to allegations of sexual violence. The safety of alleged victims and others in the organization is more important than the feelings of the accused. If someone has been accused of sexual violence truly cares about the safety of their comrades, they will understand that it is more important than perpetuating the state’s failed and misogynistic partyline, “Innocent until proven guilty.”\n\nEvery legitimate or popular leftist organization has dealt with a scandal involving sexual harassment or sexual violence. I find that the way these situations are dealt with are often representative of the gender politics of the group as a whole. It shows their unspoken infrastructure and often reveals the exploitation of women’s issues while not being supportive of the women who participate in their organization or actively ignoring women’s oppression when it can’t be used for exposure or gaining a reputation.\n\nYou’ll hear a lot of catchy “ain’t no revolution without women!” slogans in leftist organizations. Banners, memes, and propaganda images touting a group’s support of their female comrades are common themes throughout. What’s interesting is the reluctance to allow women to actively participate. You’ll find that many of the same groups that have low enlistment numbers for women are the same groups that advocate for women’s struggles. There are a few reasons for this: 1) Women are leaving due to being underappreciated. 2) Our work and struggle is being supported and used almost entirely for exposure. 3) The group is actively using sexist practices that alienate women. 4) Word has gotten out that the group is a place that isn’t safe for women. I’ve found that you’ll see all of these reasons in a group with a smaller number of women. In December of 2015, two leftist collectives held an event to discuss women’s mobility in public spaces. All members of both collectives were invited and the women were invited to speak openly about anything they please. When some female members of the Awami Workers Party raised questions about some allegations of sexual assault and sexism in their organization, they were quickly shut down. It wasn’t until a feminist collective organized another separate event that the women were able to truly speak freely about their concerns and grievances.\n\nThis isn’t unusual for leftist women. In fact, it’s the norm. It’s often easier for a male-dominated organization to denounce any claims or complaints from women regarding sexual assault/harassment as false, rather than investigate the conduct of their male comrades. It’s a reality that women have endured for far too long. We’ve accepted that our admittances of gendered sexual violence will be met with hostility and we’ll be presumed overly emotional liars or attention-seekers, rather than being treated respectfully or taken seriously. Even outside this context, our work is often instrumentalized without giving proper credit. Our names aren’t mentioned at events we organize, our literature is appropriated without giving proper credit, and our voices are silenced when we speak about the instrumentalization of our work that’s just had the serial numbers filed off. Men are often given credit for their work in leftist spaces, resulting in promotions, good reputations, or general congratulations. Men even hold up the signs at rallies that decry the support of women participating in leftist organizations. I’ve watched my male comrades be promoted alongside me in the spirit of equality when I’ve done far more work than they have. Think about that. Women can work harder, but still receive the same promotion as a man to be fair to the man’s feelings and not based on the amount or quality of the work he did.\n\nAll of these problems can be explained in one sentence: Women are wanted, but we are not valued. We are seen as apolitical and ruled by emotion. We’re largely ignored or spoken over by men who feel that their discourse and opinions are more important than ours. When our voices are heard, we’re thought of as shrill, annoying, or unnecessary. We are openly demonized and labeled liars when we speak up about sexual violence against us. Men who tout feminism or women’s rights as a badge often use the label of being pro-women as an aesthetic, a smokescreen to avoid addressing a deeper issue with the way they practice their politics and conduct themselves. Our oppression and our struggle is treated as secondary to problems deemed more important. Interestingly, at the meeting of the leftist organizations where women were invited to speak freely and their male comrades were urged to remain silent and listen, men who interrupted some of the women while they were speaking were told that what they were saying was “less important than the issue at hand,” and felt the exercise was unfair. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?\n\nAt this point, it’s important to remember that whether or not my telling you these things makes you angry or think that I’m a shrill, emotional liar, this is our experience.\n\nWhat do we do? How can we change this infrastructure, this culture of suppression of women’s ideas, voices, and work? It begins with each person analyzing their interactions with women. When a woman comes forward with ideas, projects, and opinions, how do you feel about her speaking? What do you think about what she’s saying? If the words obnoxious, shrill, emotional, or unnecessary cross your mind, you need to change the way you interact with women. If a woman admits to you that she’s experienced sexual violence or sexual harassment, and you immediately wonder if she’s lying, you need to change the way you interact with women. If a woman is in the middle of a sentence and you begin to speak over her because you think your thought is more important than hers, you need to change the way you interact with women. If a woman tells you that something you’re saying is detrimental to women or outright sexist, and you respond with something like “But, my other female friends don’t mind when I say those things!” or “You’re just offended by everything,” you need to change the way you interact with women.\n\nThe problem with sexism is that a person thinks if they don’t acknowledge their own sexist behaviors and give generic platitudes such as “I support equal rights for women,” that they are not part of the problem. You’ll often hear rhetoric like “Ain’t no revolution without women!” immediately before or after that person makes a comment about a woman’s body or using gendered slurs or silencing women who are trying to speak. Sexism is part of a pervasive societal hierarchy. It is not a person outright saying “I hate women.” This is especially a problem in leftist organizations, because many men believe that any issue not related to class struggle or workers exploitation is secondary or unimportant. This is precisely why women feel alienated. Problems present themselves in the form of sexual harassment and sexual violence as well as garden-variety sexist behavior.\n\nLeftist ideologies focus on abolishing social oppression and social hierarchies. The sexist behavior still seen in the Left is the result of cultural conditioning, messages, and behaviors that are created by the type of society we seek to abolish. If we are going to be leftists, real, true leftists, we must not only not participate in these behaviors, but we cannot tolerate them from anyone. Ever. To make leftist spaces truly radical and inclusive of the oppressed, we must change the form of our gender politics instead of just appropriating a feminist slogan. If there truly is “No revolution without women,” we must fight all aspects and embodiments of misogyny and patriarchy. We must ruthlessly attack the objectification of women, abandon the instrumentalization of our work and our bodies without giving proper platforms to women, loudly call out and abandon those who degrade or speak over women, and brand those who harass, perpetrate, or perpetuate sexual violence against women for what they are: Misogynistic, women-hating reactionary rapists. When I say “brand,” I mean literally brand them.\n\nWe must hold ourselves to the same standard to which our ideology holds us. To be a truly radical leftist organization, we must be classless. We cannot be classless if we uphold a status quo perpetuated by capitalism. We cannot allow women to be underappreciated, underutilized, harassed, assaulted, or objectified any longer. We are not the Left until we cease the urge to continue “business as usual,” relinquish the desire to use our platform to degrade women, smash our silent scenery, analyze the assumptions and prejudices that frame our debates, burn our seemingly invisible infrastructures to the ground, and emerge with something completely new, something unprecedented, something that looks like the end of the world to the status quo because it knows that these assumptions are active agents with important effects on our interactions with our comrades and that they determine the very content and form of our politics. Name it something holy, something mighty, something unlanguageable and indestructible; name it “Equality.”\n\nAdvertisements",

Caught by surprise, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was forced to block a parallel opportunity for a majority vote on extending all the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIt’s an important milestone for Senate Democrats, many of whose conservative members have been reluctant to vote for Obama’s plan, fearing dubious GOP attacks that anything less than a full extension of the Bush tax cuts amounts to a significant tax increase, particularly on small businesses.\n\nThe development unfolded between a series of obscure procedural tactics that spanned the day. McConnell offered Reid a similar vote Wednesday morning — an opportunity Reid declined. Republicans responded, taunting Reid for failing to marshall support for Obama’s plan.\n\nBy the end of the day, Reid had put a coalition together. Though the vote did not take place — and may not happen at all, it snuffs out the GOP’s potent argument that even Senate Democrats don’t support his plan.",

We expect to have a great game. It’s going to be a great atmosphere. It’s the last two Stanley Cup finals. They won one, we won one. There’s been a lot of great hockey the last couple of years between these two organizations”\n\nSome great action and some bad blood.\n\nThe Red Wings still haven’t forgotten that Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby took his time celebrating on the ice at Joe Louis Arena before finally joining the postgame handshake line, which is customary at the conclusion of the series. He took so long, all but a few of the Red Wings had returned to the locker room.\n\n“Yeah, there’s some extra juice for this game,” Detroit coach Mike Babcock admitted.\n\nThe Red Wings (26-19-9), who’ve battled numerous injuries all season, are limping along in eighth place in the Western Conference standings with 61 points. They are 2-3-3 in their past eight games.\n\nThe Penguins (33-21-1) are fourth in the Eastern Conference with 67 points.\n\n“I don’t know if I’m looking forward to it or not,” Detroit’s Henrik Zetterberg said with a crooked smile. “It’s a team we don’t see a lot in the regular season. I don’t think we need a measuring stick right now. We have our own issues. We don’t need to measure ourselves against Pittsburgh.”\n\nThe Penguins are in the midst of an 8-11-0 slump since Dec. 21.\n\nIf the current trends hold for both teams, there isn’t likely to be a third consecutive Stanley Cup finals meeting between Detroit and Pittsburgh -- although NBC analyst Ed Olczyk cautions not to count either of them out.\n\n“They will be a dangerous team, tough medicine for any team that might take them on in the Western Conference (playoffs),” Olczyk said of the Red Wings. “It would not surprise me to see both of these teams back in the Stanley Cup finals.”\n\nTomas Holmstrom, out since Jan. 6 with a broken foot, was a full participant in practice Saturday and remarked afterward that he anticipated making his return to the ice against the Penguins.\n\n“It’s my call, we’ll see how it feels tomorrow,” he said.\n\nThe coach had different thoughts about Holmstrom’s tender right foot.\n\n“I just think watching him (in practice), he wasn’t knocking my socks off. He needs another couple of days off,” Babcock said.\n\nThe Penguins are missing former Ferris State standout Chris Kunitz (abdominal surgery), Eric Godard (groin), Alex Goligoski (undisclosed) and Tyler Kennedy (undisclosed).\n\nDetroit goalie Jimmy Howard is shooting for his 20th win of the season.\n\n“It will be a great test against those two guys,” he said of facing Pittsburgh’s potent scoring combination of Crosby and Evgeni Malkin for the first time in his NHL career.\n\nE-mail Brian VanOchten at bvanochten@grpress.com and follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/BrianVanOchten",
  "latent_17300": "This week is Banned Books Week, seven days in which we celebrate the essential freedom to read. I’d never given it much thought before. Not until my publisher at Orbit sent me an email and asked if there was anything I’d like to do for Banned Books Week.\n\nI promise I had something more funny than this in mind.\n\nI originally was going to see if I could convince some local police to take a picture with me, looking on impotently as I read a formerly banned book with savage glee. When I realized that cops terrify me, I had planned to gather as many books as I could and make a fortress of freedom out of them. When I realized how expensive that was going to be, I thought maybe I’d just take some selfies with banned books and call it a day.\n\nI took only one.\n\nIt wasn’t that great.\n\nI had originally planned on just letting this week pass by with no particular contribution to me save that I was making a token effort toward the celebration. It wasn’t as though Orbit had held a gun to my head, after all. And there were other things to be doing: I need to finish The Mortal Tally (Book Two in Bring Down Heaven), I need to prepare for The City Stained Red’s eBook launch next month, I need to get ready for New York Comicon. I was pretty content to take freedom for granted and not do much of anything.\n\nThen I logged onto twitter.\n\nAs I tend to follow passionate people, I saw quite a bit of it on display. Sometimes, that passion turned venomous: people screaming at each other, wishing death upon each other, trying their best to get each other to shut up, generally acting quite vicious. Being the social opossum I am, I managed to steer clear of it, but as I figuratively lay on my back, feigning death and waiting for the scavengers to move on, I realized something.\n\nI’m scared to death of censorship.\n\nThis is something of a blessing, however convoluted that may seem. I’m certainly not immune to other tragedies such as being murdered, robbed, beaten or raped. I could get into a car crash, be stabbed to death in an alley, develop an incurable disease. I’m in a place in the world and the society that lives in it where I can usually live free of these worries. Not everyone can. So while these disasters might happen to me, they’re not likely to.\n\nIs me being censored any more likely, then?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nI can’t imagine any religious groups getting angry at me and burning my book, despite that it’s full of demons (that’d kind of rock if they did, though). Nor can I really foresee an event in which the American government would decide that my book is a threat to the nation and forbid it (again, this would only increase my allure). It’s a little more likely that I’d say something that would anger someone and they’d start doing everything in their power to get me off the shelves, but that’s not likely to go further than twitter and it’d probably be forgotten the moment someone else said something worse.\n\nSo why am I so terrified of censorship if it’s not that likely to happen to me?\n\nBecause, put plainly, censorship hurts everyone.\n\nIt hurts the person whose art is stifled and whose expression is silenced, certainly. But it also hurts the person who succumbed to their fear and sought its censure to begin with. But most importantly, it hurts everyone: everyone who was refused the right to judge for themselves, everyone who was refused the right to have the discussion, everyone who was refused the right to agree or disagree, everyone who was instantly robbed of a voice. A work, however abhorrent, is gone and we have lost the ability to speak because we embraced fear.\n\nAnd fear is at the heart of everything.\n\nI believe that all fiction, maybe all writing, is an exploration of which is the more powerful human emotion: love or fear.\n\nCensorship is a triumph of fear over love.\n\nThis fear that spawns censorship takes a variety of shapes. Many powerful people throughout history ear that a work might threaten someone’s influence or position in the world they live in and wanted it banned. Many parents succumbed to the fear that a work might negatively influence or alter their children and wanted it banned. Society at large lives with the constant fear that a work might introduce an idea that spurs someone to dangerous action and may ban something out of that.\n\nBut all these shapes of fear have a root cause: the fear of pain.\n\nThat is, after all, what the most common fear is, isn’t it? And it’s hard to blame people for being afraid of pain. None of us enjoy pain, be it mental or physical, and pain is never far from our thoughts. We’re hardwired to want to avoid it at all costs.\n\nIt’s my personal belief that pain is necessary for growth. Pain is what lets you know that things are happening. And just as your bones ache as you grow taller or your muscles are sore after working out, an idea that causes you pain is an idea that you eventually learn your response to and grow as a person.\n\nThe pain of loss is a reminder of how much you loved what you lost. The pain of betrayal is a testament to your capacity to trust someone. The pain you feel when someone else is hurting is the proof of your empathy and ability to love someone else more than yourself. None of these things mean anything without the ability to feel pain, sometimes even the willingness to feel pain.\n\nIdeas cause us pain.\n\nThey do everyday.\n\nAbout a month ago, I put a hole in my wall. I clenched my fist, swung it out and smashed a hole in the drywall just above my shoulder (don’t get any ideas about my ferocity; the drywall was very cheap). The reason I did this was because I read something in an online forum that made me incredibly angry. It was a vicious, hateful thing that made me genuinely upset. It made me angry and I damaged my house. I did this all the time when I was younger. I do it much less these days and I was embarrassed to have done it this time.\n\nI regret doing it. I regret letting my emotions get out of control. I regret giving into fear. But I don’t regret feeling pain at it. And I would have regretted taking actions to try and silence the statement.\n\nBut why, then, would I feel that way at such a terrible message?\n\nI wouldn’t have been rid of that statement or the idea that caused it. I wouldn’t have defeated it or banished it or come to terms with it and buried it. I would have put it in a closet and waited for it to come back out some day. I would have silenced it, knowing it could hurt me, and lived in fear of the day it would come back and hurt me again. And each time, my ability to deal with it would be called into question.\n\nSome may think I’m suggesting we never say anything bad, ever. Some may think I’m suggesting we let hatred run wild and never confront it. I think it’s plain to see that I’m not a fan of fear and as I believe all hatred descends from fear, I’m very much for confronting these sorts of things. But the answer to that confrontation is freedom.\n\nWe have the freedom to confront ideas. We have the freedom to criticize them. We have the freedom to reject them and we have the freedom to dismiss them from our presence, if we must. But we cannot justify using freedom to deny freedom. We must let idiots speak. We must let wounds bleed. We must let the hatred and the agony and the panic in someone’s words make themselves known. We do not always have to listen, but we cannot demand them be silent.\n\nWhat we do, in its stead, is present a new idea.\n\nWe are writers. Nothing is real to us until we put them into words on paper (or on a blank white screen, anyway). This is how we confront our fears. When we silence, when we censor, we give into those fears. We devote ourselves to that fear, rather than to expression.\n\nCensorship is a triumph of fear. It is sometimes understandable why someone might give into that fear. It is sometimes understandable that the exhilaration that comes from temporary release of fear and pain can be liberating. It is sometimes understandable that people who feel powerless may find comfort in exerting some amount of control.\n\nBut these are fleeting. And nothing compared to the lingering shadow of fear that will haunt us when these things we try to silence come back to us. And they will.\n\nI suppose this blog post is me confronting my own fear. For in writing this, I am afraid.\n\nI’m afraid of retribution for what I’m writing here. I’m afraid of being ignored entirely and merely screaming into a void. I’m afraid that these words will hurt someone else. I’m afraid that someone will want to hurt me over these words.\n\nBut this, too, is a fear I could not live with. This is a fear whose specter would always be at the corner of my eye and just over my shoulder, a constant reminder that I had given into it and it only had to wait until it could come back and test me again. I would still be afraid, but I’d be safe.\n\nAnd all it would cost me is just not writing.\n\nWhich is a fate unthinkable.\n\nSo I had to write this.\n\nDo not give into fear. Do not let it triumph. Do not seek to censor and harm yourself. Do not seek to silence and harm others.\n\nDo your best. Never stop writing. Never stop thinking.\n\nRead dangerously.\n\nHappy Banned Books Week.",
  "latent_17332": "Clam Cancer Spreads Along Eastern Seaboard\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pat Wellenbach/AP Pat Wellenbach/AP\n\nNot every clam is, as the expression goes, happy as a clam. Even shellfish, it turns out, can get cancer. And it just might be that this cancer is spread from clam to clam by rogue cells bobbing through the ocean, scientists reported Thursday in the journal Cell.\n\nYou might be surprised to hear that clams can get blood cancer. \"But the fact is they have a circulatory system, and they can get leukemia,\" says Stephen Goff, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Columbia University.\n\nThe leukemia kills the clams, but Goff says it poses no risk to people who eat clams, like the soft-shell clams that are harvested along the Eastern Seaboard. \"I love them,\" he says. \"They're what you get as fried clams and steamers.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael J. Metzger/Cell Press Michael J. Metzger/Cell Press\n\nBut Goff's relationship with clams has just changed dramatically. He usually studies viruses that cause cancer in mice. Recently he was contacted by Carol Reinisch, a biologist at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. She studies leukemia in soft-shell clams, and she asked Goff to look for signs of a cancer-causing virus in these clams.\n\nHe didn't find a virus, but what he found instead was a shock. Each of the cancer cells he looked at, in clams from New York to Prince Edward Island, Canada, had a similar genetic fingerprint. That strongly suggests the cancer is spread when these cells replicate and spread through the water, he says.\n\n\"We know the cells can survive in seawater quite long,\" Goff says. \"And we can only guess that they would be picked up somehow by another healthy clam.\"\n\nThis could be because clams feed by filtering enormous volumes of seawater. They might simply siphon up these free-floating cancer cells and literally catch cancer.\n\nThere are only two other cancers known to spread by cells, like this. One is devastating populations of Tasmanian devils, meat-eating marsupials in Australia. Another is spread sexually in dogs. Goff thinks this might be the third example.\n\n\"It's very clear that something unusual is going on here,\" says Michael Lesser, a marine biologist at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nBut he says this isn't an open-and-shut case. Nobody has yet done the critical lab experiment to show that this cell-based transmission actually occurs. He wants firsthand evidence that a clam, by eating a cancer cell, can actually contract the disease.\n\nScientists who study these clams are eager to get going on these experiments, Lesser says, to see whether they can prove this transmission is actually happening.\n\nHowever this turns out, Goff says, surprises like this can really move science forward.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the idea that when something really intriguing comes along, it's great to follow your lead and see where it's going to take you,\" he says.\n\nThis opens up a host of questions about how diseases might spread through the marine environment. And it might have implications for human health as well.\n\n\"Learning how these cells are evolving, learning how they manage to spread will be very interesting,\" Goff says. \"I think it could inform our understanding of how metastasis occurs.\"",

  "latent_17407": "Peter Bart and Mike Fleming Jr. worked together for two decades at Daily Variety. In this weekly column, two old friends get together and grind their axes, mostly on the movie business.\n\nBART: This is the moment when all the top stars are feverishly pitching their summer blockbusters on the talk-show circuit. It’s a stressful exercise: Every shoot has to be flawless, every director inspired. Adding stress this summer is the fact that many critics already seem to be playing favorites. They favor the talking animals over the actors.\n\nConsider the excellent critter dialogue in The Secret Life Of Pets, Finding Dory, The Jungle Book, The Angry Birds Movie, Zootopia, King Fu Panda 3 and so on. The performance of Max the Dog in Pets is arguably more profoundly empathetic than Matt Damon’s in the new Jason Bourne. He’s voiced by Louis C.K. I liked the snake voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Jungle Book – she was more fun than Scarlett’s live-action Lucy. Besides, stars seem more relaxed and amusing in their talk-show pitches when they’re promoting anthropomorphical animal performances. Until now, five of the top 10 grossing movies have featured talking animals, so there’s a reason to be cheerful.\n\nDisney\n\nFLEMING: Animated films have certainly dominated the summer, to the point where, I wonder, would a cartoon adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The BFG have fared much better than the VFX-heavy feature that failed at the box office despite the pedigree of director Steven Spielberg and reigning Oscar winner Mark Rylance? All the animated movies you mentioned were slam-dunk options for families with children. But maybe BFG‘s premise — lovable giant kidnaps sassy adorable orphan, who spends the whole picture running from a gnarly bunch of behemoths who are trying to eat her and other kids — became a feathered fish to adults trying to figure out if their youngsters would be haunted by nightmares. Dahl was an edgy writer; my kids loved his stories, but some we had to stop reading because the imagery was so disturbing. You knew that wasn’t going to happen with the lovable Dory or Pets. It is getting so hard for Hollywood to figure out what franchise fare might work, and the failures have been alarming enough to wonder if the habits of moviegoers have changed forever because of all the other choices offered in this digital age where it becomes harder than ever to create reasons for people to leave their homes. A well-done animated film will always have a built-in audience of parents who want to give their children a thrill.\n\nI spent the last few days seeing Star Trek Beyond, Suicide Squad and Jason Bourne. I predict a rally coming for live-action summer films here; David Ayer’s Suicide Squad has a lot of the irreverence and fun you saw in Deadpool and didn’t see in Batman V Superman, and it should be a monster hit for Warner Bros; Justin Lin’s Star Trek Beyond and Paul Greengrass’ Jason Bourne plugs you right back into why you loved these franchises in the first place, moving each forward in interesting storytelling ways. They should be winners for Paramount Pictures and Universal, respectively.\n\nBut the tentpole business will only get harder, going forward, in creating clear-cut reasons why a movie is a better option than the free options available through outlets like Netflix and TV, including the coronations of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton at the conventions. Then there is the Summer Olympics. Ghostbusters is a funny movie, and it had a harder road than it would have a decade ago; it was weighed down by the “controversy” over whether the primary roles should have been played by women, even though it was the only way that movie was going to get made. Bill Murray wasn’t coming back to rehash the original, and the silence was deafening when Sony kept sending him scripts and got no response from the actor.\n\nThis tentpole uncertainty is why there has been such a stampede to collar rights to franchise fare like Pokemon. My sources told me last week that Legendary Pictures is moving toward a deal to acquire that property for live-action treatment. Demand has been powered by that Pokemon Go app that has been so popular it catapulted part-owner Nintendo’s stock up 25%. You hope the fervor for that new iteration of the 30-year pocket monster franchise endures for the time it takes to make and release a picture, but it certainly has captured the fancy of the masses. Also interesting was this recent massive auction won by Legendary, which will pay $3.5 million to Adam McKay to write, and substantially more to direct Bad Blood, a film about embattled Silicon Valley startup blood-testing company Theranos. Jennifer Lawrence is attached to play its founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes was just banned for two years from operating a lab because of unsafe practices, and the company’s precipitous fall from a $4.5 billion valuation has made it a cautionary tale. Lawrence’s bankability and McKay’s Oscar-winning success in making another cautionary tale, The Big Short, made Bad Blood a stampede that started with nine offers before Legendary won rights to make a movie in the $40 million-$50 million range. You really need that kind of a hook these days, to rise above all the clutter.\n\nBART: If the critics are admiring the talking animals, they’re having a tougher time critiquing Woody Allen and Café Society. No one wants to knock a Woody Allen movie. It’s just that after watching 46 of them, they’re finding it difficult to find something new to praise. Or to avoid saying that they’ve seen most of the scenes play out in years past. Or that they know most of Woody’s one-liners by heart. When one character in Café Society says, “life is a comedy written by a sadistic comedy writer,” most of us ask ourselves, “in what Woody movie did I hear that before?” None of this is daunting to Woody. He’s casting his 47th even as you read this. And his prospective actors are thinking, “my lines may seem recycled, but I’m going to love delivering them anyway.”\n\nFLEMING: That is another movie that got chewed up by a press narrative that began in Cannes. The narrative was hijacked by a rehash of abuse allegations against the filmmaker that were investigated years ago but never prosecuted. They reared up again, despite a lack of any new evidence. Movie makers and marketers seem to have less control than ever of the narrative in the democratized world of social media.\n\nThat includes the upcoming Summer Olympics, where the focus has been less on sports and more on things like the Zika virus, or bacteria-infested sewage in the waterways where marathon swimmers and rowers and triathletes will compete to the high risk of their long-term health. Body parts washed up in the waters in Rio on the beach where the volleyball competitions will be held. Numerous athletes have bailed on the grounds that Brazil is ground zero for the mosquitoes spreading Zika, even as the country’s health experts argue minimal risk because it isn’t high season for these flying virus-spreading bugs. One look at the potential horrors of that virus in newborns is enough to give pause to anyone planning to start a family, whether it’s athletes or broadcasters and media that will be covering what was always viewed as a plum assignment. Add the growing move toward banning Russia from competing because of a doping scandal, and the heightened security in the wake of brazen terrorist activities, and this could be an Olympics where the narrative is about everything but athletic achievement. Whether that is good or bad for ratings remains to be seen.\n\nOn another front but related to unwieldy media narratives, it sure seems that after a masterful career crafting the message for a litany of Republican presidents, Fox News chief Roger Ailes risks losing control of the narrative surrounding the sexual harassment allegation charges brought against him by fired Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson. He seemed to have the matter in hand initially with a strong denial by the network, followed by testimonials from Fox News fixtures under his employ, and an appeal to keep the trial out of the public eye by putting it into arbitration. You’ve saw little or no coverage in Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post, a tabloid that feasted on these kinds of stories when it was David Letterman or 60 Minutes‘ Steve Kroft in the cross hairs. And you saw most Fox News stars except its biggest talking head Bill O’Reilly, who chimed in late, and Megyn Kelly, leap to Ailes’ defense, undoubtedly because O’Reilly settled a $60 million sexual harassment suit against his producer Andrea Mackris a few years ago that makes him a dubious character witness. It seems carefully choreographed, but I wonder if this campaign to bury Carlson has backfired. Brit Hume, for instance, wonders in tweets why Carlson didn’t come forward until she was fired. I don’t know if those testimonials are true that New York Magazine unearthed, but all of the women who said they rebuffed rather crude and overt sexual advances, said their careers suffered or ended, as a result. If this stuff is true, the expectation that any woman would voluntarily speak up is ridiculous because it would have been a career-ender. That prospect is the only power that a serial harasser would hold over a woman. Again, I don’t know Ailes at all or whether any of this is true, but it’s hard to argue that the volume of allegations made against Bill Cosby reached a critical mass that obliterated his reputation, even though none of those allegations have been convincingly proven.\n\nCosby broke the color barrier on primetime television, something that has been completely obscured because of the litany of tawdry testimonials made against him. If more women come forward with sordid allegations about Ailes, Peter, do you think that he could possibly survive this, even if it’s he-said, she-said Rashomon stuff? After Rupert Murdoch’s sons James and Lachlan shook up its stable film division with the coronation of Stacey Snider at the expense of entrenched chief Jim Gianopulos and other film division heads, they seem unlikely to stand on ceremony. How much patience will they have if more Ailes tales surface in the coming weeks?\n\nBART: I would be wary about making predictions on the fate of Roger Ailes. Fox News is a major profit center and we are entering a period when the revenues are rolling in. Secondly, it’s always impossible to analyze a company that is undergoing generational change. Who knows where the power rests in the Land of Murdoch? I’ve had dinners with Ailes and his wife; it’s great fun to talk about journalism and the media with him, less fun to talk politics. Ailes is a survivor and a showman.\n\nOn a lighter note, you interviewed Paul Feig and asked whether, in this world where everyone on social media is waiting to be offended, could a movie like Blazing Saddles even get made? The fact that filmmakers of sequels seem so dependent on recycling comedic ideas and characters from the past would have especially annoyed the great Billy Wilder. It was Wilder who was most defiant practitioner of original and politically incorrect comedy. Who else would have built a comedy around a guilt-free French hooker (Irma La Douce) or elicited laughs from the black-market activities of American soldiers occupying 1946 Berlin in A Foreign Affair? Even The Apartment was a send-up of corporate mores. Wilder’s best work came in the 1940s and ’50s when comedies about adultery and corporate hypocrisy were considered dangerous. That led Wilder once to declare, “the entire movie industry is in intensive care.” Wilder was a brilliant wordsmith, but he encouraged actors to contribute their comedy bits. “You can tell a good actor by looking at his script,” Wilder once told me. “If he’s no good the script will be neat. If he’s talented like, say, a Charles Laughton, his script will be so filthy it looks like a herring has been wrapped in it.”\n\nI was once invited to a meeting with Wilder and Jerry Weintraub when Weintraub was president of UA. He’d begged Wilder to see a new UA comedy that wasn’t working and perhaps fix it. The great filmmaker told Weintraub: “Your movie is a piece of shit. I could tell you how to make it a smaller pile but it would still be shit.” Weintraub wasn’t used to that sort of candor. He thanked Wilder and said he didn’t need his input.\n\nFLEMING: Feig said these trends ebb and flow in movies, and you saw it when superhero pictures were getting too noble and boring and then came irreverent successes like Guardians Of The Galaxy and especially Deadpool, and now Suicide Squad. I don’t think Mel Brooks could get Blazing Saddles made right now, honestly, not with all the N-words and other stereotypes he lampooned. It just doesn’t feel like the right time, and I imagine he’d see it that way, too. We will get to a place eventually where a movie like that will come out of left field, succeed in a big way, and then we’ll see more.\n\nMeanwhile, I get to escape all the madness by heading to San Diego for Comic-Con. Wait, they reinstated the Zombie Walk after the terrible traffic tragedy two years ago, and I always wonder as costumed attendees come with menacing looking fake weapons they dutifully line up to have inspected before they parade them through the convention center. Oh, my.",
  "latent_17485": "September 18, 2015\n\nby Canadian Manufacturing.com Staff\n\nTORONTO—Ontario is hurtling forward with its plan to take Hydro One public.\n\nThe company has filed a preliminary prospectus with the Ontario Securities Commission and other Canadian security agencies in preparation for its initial public offering.\n\n“The prospectus, approved by the Province and the company’s Board of Directors, provides a comprehensive overview of Hydro One, including its operations and its outlook,” the Ontario government said.\n\nThe Ontario government has moved forward with plans to offer private investors ownership in the transmission and utility company amid both strong showings of support and bitter criticism from detractors. The sale will begin with an IPO for 15 per cent of the company.\n\nHydro One serves as a local electricity distributor for 1.3 million customers. Previous reports say the government hopes to raise $9 billion from the partial sale.\n\nOntario’s 2015 budget requires the provincial government remain the new company’s largest shareholder with a minimum 40 per cent ownership. Additionally, no other shareholder or group of shareholders would be permitted to own more than 10 per cent.\n\nAlso significant, Hydro One will continue to have no role in setting electricity rates; rate-setting is the responsibility of the independent Ontario Energy Board. In preparing for the sale, the government has introduced legislation that would strengthen the regulatory powers of the OEB to protect ratepayers and investigate complaints.\n\n“Hydro One will now move forward to file an Amended & Restated Prospectus, following the OSC review, and will begin to undertake marketing activities and financial advisor consultations to help set a final share price for the Initial Public Offering, which the government intends to complete in November,” the government said.",
  "latent_17486": "Whoever coined the phrase “It’s always darkest just before dawn” is a philosophical fucking genius… or a shitty scientist, since it’s not technically accurate. Either way, it sure is metaphorically true.\n\nWhat you’re about to read is a true story. The names and dates have not been changed to protect anyone, because fuck it. I would like to share the following candid details of the last 8 years of my life with you in hopes that somehow it will encourage you to make positive life choices.\n\nYou see, I believe that every one of us manifest and live in our own personal heaven or hell. I’m not talking about white clouds and pearly gates, or fire and brimstone; I mean that we make a series of conscious and subconscious choices every minute of every single day that result in us being in the state of existence that we are in at any given moment. Some people believe these choices are guided by God, some believe that nature is taking its course, but one thing that we all can probably agree on is that free will comes into play.\n\nAs an example: You can choose to close this page right now and never read another word of this blog, or you can choose to continue… nobody is stopping you from doing either. The consequences of either decision are not serious, but I do encourage you to press on because this shit is about to get really embarrassing in a second.\n\nOk, enough hype… let’s get started.\n\nI broke up with my last girlfriend 8 years ago and have spent the last 8 years a single man… And when I say “single”, I mean that I have not gotten past the first date with anyone in 8 fucking years – nearly 1/4 of my life.\n\nThe fucked up thing is I chose this.\n\nI have made one irrational decision after another over these past 8 years to essentially cock-block myself. And for what? Mostly because I was so egotistic and delusional in my mid 20’s that I actually thought I deserved a super model/comedian/astro-fucking-physicist who could leap tall buildings with a single bound and perfectly grill me a medium rare steak with her laser eyes. My standards for date-able women were through the goddamn stratosphere.\n\nWhen I broke up with my last girlfriend, I thought at the time that it was because I was in my mid 20’s and afraid of commitment. She was talking weddings and babies, and I just freaked out one day and called the whole thing off. I told her that I didn’t truly love her, I never could, and that she would be better off finding someone who can. Harsh, I know, but I was completely turned off by the thought of us growing old together, and I didn’t want her to waste any more time or tears on me. I did care about her, and simply considered it a dose of “tough love” for both of our sake.\n\nNow I realize that fear of commitment was not really the problem. The problem was that she simply wasn’t good enough for me. That might sound terrible, but looking back, that’s what I was really thinking. I considered myself better looking, smarter, and more talented; so in my mind, she didn’t have enough to offer. Honestly, I still believe this to be true, but I ended up taking it to a whole new extreme, as I often do. The relationship lasted for four years, though, because she treated me like a king, and the sex was steady and took little to no effort to initiate. Does that sound like true love to you?\n\nOh, and did I mention that I haven’t had sex in 8 years either? Because I haven’t had sex in 8 years either.\n\nI didn’t want sex clouding my judgement while on this ridiculous mission to find this unrealistically “perfect” woman, so I have remained abstinent. My plan was to simply avoid all sexual contact of any kind until I felt 100% comfortable with who I was and what I could contribute to a relationship, then find this “dream woman”. I concede, part of the reason was to avoid hurting another woman by letting her fall in love with me before totally shitting all over everything that she believed to be real, but mostly I was just being selfish.\n\nSure, I could be getting laid by random skanks – I’m a decent enough looking guy who’s capable of creating an online dating profile and paying for dinner – but that’s just not how I am wired. I was cursed with this nonsensical need to feel stuff about a girl before I’m willing or able to have sex with her. I’m a guy who doesn’t seem to get that his primal purpose on this Earth is to procreate, not have feelings.\n\nThe first couple of years into “My Epic Quest to Die Alone” (as I now call it), I was perfectly happy being alone and abstinent. I had 3 girlfriends from ages 15-26, with very little downtime, and desperately felt like I needed a break from the shackles of a relationship to smoke pot and play video games all night, every night. No longer was I going to let some girl plan my Saturday for me. Fuck that business! Regular sex was just not worth the price of freedom anymore. Too many men make decisions with their penis that tie them down, and I was no longer going to be one of those idiots… one of those loved, sexed, happy idiots…\n\nEventually, of course, the loneliness started creeping in. It started as just a Friday night thing, on my birthday, or when I had a really good day that I wanted to share with someone who would be happy for me; but eventually I found myself longing to be held, kissed and loved, more deeply than I ever imagined.\n\nAfter 4 or 5 years of this, I developed a numbness to those sissy feelings. I would go about my day like a soulless ant, moving from task to task without ever really thinking about being loved or held again. Sure, I had some super fulfilling hobbies, like smoking pot and playing video games, but I had come to terms with the fact that I was going to die alone, and was simply existing.\n\n“Foreveralone”, as they call it on the internet. The title was normally reserved for people who have no chance (in their mind) of having a significant other because they are physically hideous and socially inept. It’s a seemingly impossible endeavor to them, so at some point in their lives they just gave up trying. I, on the other hand, was just being a fucking idiot; sabotaging my own love life at every turn in the name of freedom and refusing to settle.\n\nBefore I set out on “My Epic Quest”, I was so obliviously headstrong that I actually thought depression – clinical depression – was nothing more than a product of a weak mind. “Pffft… I certainly don’t have a weak mind”, I’d tell myself. I was seriously convinced that all depressed people needed to do was simply “snap out of it” and go find happiness.\n\nThen, 6 years in, my dog (and best friend I ever had, Petey) died in my arms, I was laid off from my job, and I quit a pack-a-day cigarette habit cold turkey; all over a span of about 3 months.\n\nMy life was now a steaming pile of shit and I had nobody to blame but myself. No girlfriend, no job, no sex, no money – my savings was blown on moving across the country and back for a “dream job” that I quit after only 3 months because it “didn’t feel right”. I ballooned up to over 270 lbs. at 6’3”, and like many introverts, only had a couple of friends. Aside from the new puppy I adopted to fill the void left by Petey’s passing, I was completely alone and absolutely miserable.\n\nAh… so, THIS is what depression feels like… I fucking hated it.\n\nWhen Petey died, I made a promise to him and myself: The next dog I get would have the coolest little life I could possibly give him. I made a number of mistakes with Petey in his early years, some of which I believe contributed to the incurable liver disease that he eventually died from, so I owed it to him. After 14 months of unemployment, I started working again, and I refused to let my puppy (Bob) share the same daily routine of sitting at home waiting for me to return, so I found full-time dog daycare for him.\n\nThat’s where I met Rose.\n\nThe first time I saw Rose, my heart bungee jumped through my body. I felt my stomach knot up and my knees weaken as it traveled down to my toes, back up into my chest and wedge itself in my throat, briefly preventing me from speaking, then back down again for another trip. Not just because she has a pretty face and a tall, slender frame; but also because she has the aura of an old, weathered soul that only comes from fighting and winning some serious battles in her life and lives past. Attractive? Check… Check PLUS.\n\nI had spent about 7 years talking to women asexually up to this point, so when I met Rose I was not at all prepared and had no fucking clue how to talk to her. I spent the first few interactions uncomfortably laughing at her jokes and fumbling over the few words my stupid brain could manage to spit out. Every time I left the daycare after seeing her, I left feeling like a complete idiot. I’d get in the car and sigh to my dog, “Well, Bob, I really fucked that one up… AGAIN…”\n\nThere were other problems too; I really liked this daycare facility for Bob, and thought Rose was 10 or so years younger than me; so rather than screw it all up by being the fat, creepy, older guy who hits on the pretty, young girl behind the counter, I worked really hard to suppress my feelings for her.\n\nThen came a charity dinner to benefit a cause we both held dear, sheltered animals, and I was invited by the daycare owner to join their party. I knew that meant Rose was going to be there, so I was very nervous leading up to that night, but when I arrived I was absolutely petrified. I was thrown a little curve ball too; it seemed a friend of the daycare owner was trying to hook me up with her daughter. I was flattered, but not at all interested, so when we filed into our seats I slowly slithered my way back to Rose so that I would be seated next to her and across the table from the matchmaker’s daughter. Success! I managed to sit right next to Rose and had nobody on my other side, so she got my undivided attention. “Now, just don’t fuck this up”, I told myself.\n\nI totally fucked it up.\n\nAs usual with Rose, I was fumbling through the conversation, sweating like crazy. The only thing I did right that night was ask a lot of questions, so I really got to know her better. But of course, at the end of a pleasant night of getting-to-know-you chit chat, I couldn’t muster up the courage to ask her out. I walked to my car with my head down, furious with myself. That’s when I knew that I needed to do something. I wasn’t sure what that something was, but waiting around wasn’t getting me anywhere, so I had to make some changes.\n\nEven if I were to take the leap and ask her out that night, I had very little to offer. I was overweight, depressed, broke, and a total pothead at the time. That wasn’t the real me. I was someone that I didn’t like, so why would she like me? I needed to be someone who a girl like this would want to get to know better; someone I was proud of. As my boot camp Drill Instructor would scream, “It’s time to unfuck yourself!”\n\nIt was, indeed, time to unfuck myself.\n\nOver the next 10 months or so I worked really hard to get back to a healthy weight. I stayed on a strict low carbohydrate diet, walked a few miles every day, and toned up with body weight exercises at home. I also quit smoking pot, and made an effort to contribute to society in a positive way by mentoring young people online – everything from parental dispute advice to suicide watch.\n\nI was finally becoming someone I was proud of. Not just back to the old me, but a new and vastly improved version of me. Remember, before “My Epic Quest” began, I was a selfish, arrogant asshole.\n\nThen one day Rose sent me a Facebook friend request. “JACKPOT!” I thought. This was my chance to really get to know her. Oh, but I was not prepared for what I discovered as her Facebook friend.\n\nIt turns out this girl is not only beautiful, smart, funny, strong and caring, but she had just finished up her Business degree requirements, and I discovered by reading her blog posts that she is an incredibly gifted writer, so she’s driven and talented too. I damn near expected to find out she has laser eyes at this point… “Ok, that’s the final straw”, I actually said out loud to Bob. “If I don’t ask this girl out, I will be kicking myself for years… maybe forever. It’s time to make my move.”\n\nI started out by liking her status updates and blog posts, leaving encouraging comments that she seemed to appreciate. Everything else aside, I really love her writing, so it was very easy to be encouraging. I probably laid it on a little thick, but she doesn’t get much feedback, and I wanted her to know that I really think she has a serious talent and like her work a lot.\n\nI eventually mustered up enough courage to send her a private Facebook message with the intention of striking up a conversation. “So why don’t I see you at (Bob’s daycare) much anymore?” I asked. This led to a four hour online chat that was exactly what I had longed for with her. We laughed, I cried (over my dead dog, give me a break!), and we revealed much more about ourselves and our past than I ever expected when I sent her that quick message. At the end of that epic chat session, I finally asked her out.\n\nShe said yes.\n\nI did it. I stopped waiting around for my life to magically come together on its own and made shit happen. I totally unfucked myself. Not for Rose, but largely because of her. She inspires me to be a better person and I’ll always be grateful for that. Will we live happily ever after? Who the hell knows… My real “quest” was never to land an amazing girl like Rose; it was to be the kind of guy who I am proud of.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\n(Late edit: I actually ended up changing her name after she read this post and told me that she was uncomfortable with her real name being used. Sorry, Rose!)\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_17546": "This story originally appeared on Entrepreneur.com.\n\nAs a serial entrepreneur, I’ve had my share of good and bad business partners. One experience in particular started out pretty good because this person had lots of industry knowledge and connections. We literally could walk into just about any account and the prospect would buy our services. It was great, at least for a while. Then personality conflicts started and it was no longer fun or productive and it quickly went downhill from there.\n\nSo what went wrong? The biggest problem was not knowing him very well. Rather than taking the time to do the due diligence on him, the focus was on the chance to grow a company quickly and profitably based on his knowledge of the industry and my knowledge of the product. We had never worked together before so leadership style or values were an unknown. However, once we started working together, it quickly became clear that his way of doing business was totally different in terms of employees, customers and money. I see this a lot when working with clients now. It looks great on paper but issues arise when put into practice and personalities react to various situations.\n\nJust like a marriage that starts off all hearts, roses and dreams, a partnership can quickly turn into heartbreak, anger, lawsuits and bankruptcy.\n\nBefore you even think of pulling the trigger with a business partner, contemplate whether you even need one at all. If you decide it is a good idea, make sure you get the best match to your own values, goals, leadership style and skills. Because once you become partners, it is vastly more difficult to undo the partnership than it is to create it.\n\nFollowing are eight points to consider to avoid a bad partnership.\n\n1. Trust.\n\nThis is first on the list for a reason. Bottom line, do you trust this individual with your personal bank account. If the answer is “no,” think twice. As partners, every dollar you spend proportionately affects your personal check book.\n\n2. Friendship.\n\nIf the person is a good friend, make sure that their goals, values and responsibilities are aligned to yours. Don’t assume just because you get along as friends that they are. Take a look at their personal life and how stable it is. Personal problems are difficult and can easily complicate their professional life. If there is any doubt, don’t do it.\n\n3. Trial run.\n\nSelect a person you have experience with at work, at a nonprofit or on a project. You should know if they are a team player and how they react in difficult situations. If you have no experience with a potential partner at all, do a trial run for a specified period of time before finalizing the partnership.\n\n4. Partner, employee or consultant.\n\nDon’t partner with someone just because you can’t afford to hire them. It is better to hire them as a consultant than to give away a part of your company or to find out later that he/she is not a good partner for you.\n\n5. Varied strengths.\n\nMake sure you and your partner’s strengths are in different areas. If you have two people who are good at sales and no one who is good at executing on an operational level, it will be more challenging than you think. It is much better to bring someone in who will compliment your strengths. In order to grow profitably, keep some balance.\n\n6. Balanced responsibilities.\n\nBoth parties need to agree up front what their responsibilities are in the company and stick to them. If one person keeps trying to take over and do everything or ends up doing very little, then the partnership will start to unravel and feelings of resentment will fester.\n\nMore from Entrepreneur:\n\n7. Money.\n\nJust like in marriage, money is always one of the major problems in a business partnership. Therefore, agree in the beginning how you will use the funding you raise and how the profits will be distributed.\n\n8. Valuation/contracts.\n\nDecide on a formula to determine the value of the company should one partner decide to leave to avoid disagreements. Buy/Sell agreements are incredibly useful for discussing all possibilities and how they will be handled before they become a reality.\n\nWhy is all of this so important? Because a great business can be severely damaged by a bad partnership and never reach its full potential. Starting a business and/or a partnership is an emotional experience. When doing your due diligence, set your emotions aside and make sure everything lines up and has the potential at staying aligned.",

  "latent_17848": "Hanson lab / Delft University of Technology\n\nAlbert Einstein once told a friend that quantum mechanics doesn't hold water in his scientific world view because \"physics should represent a reality in time and space, free from spooky actions at a distance.\" That spooky action at a distance is entanglement, a quantum phenomenon in which two particles, separated by any amount of distance, can instantaneously affect one another as if part of a unified system.\n\nNow, scientists have successfully hijacked that quantum weirdness -- doing so reliably for the first time -- to produce what many sci-fi fans have long dreamt up: teleportation. No, not beaming humans aboard the USS Enterprise, but the teleportation of data.\n\nPhysicists at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, part of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, report that they sent quantum data concerning the spin state of an electron to another electron about 10 feet away. Quantum teleportation has been recorded in the past, but the results in this study have an unprecedented replication rate of 100 percent at the current distance, the team said.\n\nThanks to the strange properties of entanglement, this allows for that data -- only quantum data, not classical information like messages or even simple bits -- to be teleported seemingly faster than the speed of light. The news was reported first by The New York Times on Thursday, following the publication of a paper in the journal Science.\n\nProving Einstein wrong about the purview and completeness of quantum mechanics is not just an academic boasting contest. Proving the existence of entanglement and teleportation -- and getting experiments to work efficiently, in larger systems and at greater distances -- holds the key to translating quantum mechanics to practical applications, like quantum computing. For instance, quantum computers could utilize that speed to unlock a whole new generation of unprecedented computing power.\n\nQuantum teleportation is not teleportation in the sense one might think. It involves achieving a certain set of parameters that then allow properties of one quantum system to get tangled up with another so that observations are reflected simultaneously, thereby \"teleporting\" the information from one place to another.\n\nTo do this, researchers at Delft first had to create qubits out of classical bits, in this case electrons trapped in diamonds at extremely low temperatures that allow their quantum properties, like spin, to be observed.\n\nA qubit is a unit of quantum data that can hold multiple values simultaneously thanks to an equally integral quantum phenomenon called superposition, a term fans of the field will accurately associate with the Schrödinger equation, as well as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that says something exists in all possible states until it is observed. It's the same way quantum computing may one day surpass the speeds of classical computing by allowing calculations to spread bit values between 0, 1 or any probabilistic value between the two numbers -- in other words, a superposition of both figures.\n\nWith quibits separated by a distance of three meters, the researchers were able to observe and record the spin of one electron and see that reflected in the other qubit instantly. It's an admittedly wonky conception of data teleportation that requires a little head scratching before it begins to clear up.\n\nStill, its effects could be far reaching. The researchers are attempting to increase that distance to more than a kilometer, which would be ample leeway to test whether or not entanglement was a consistent phenomenon and that the information was traveling faster than the speed of light. Such experiments would more definitively knock down Einstein's disqualification of entanglement due to its violation of classical mechanics.\n\n\"There is a big race going on between five or six groups to prove Einstein wrong,\" Ronald Hanson, a physicist leading the research at Delft, told The New York Times. \"There is one very big fish.\"\n\nUpdate at 10:08 p.m. PT: Added photos from Delft University and the research team's explanatory YouTube video.",

This is much worse than that. It is self-harming. All this measure does is restrict our own negotiating team's room to manoeuvre. The Europeans must be watching us in disbelief. It is like a gunman walking out for a duel, only to watch his opponent shoot his own limbs off one by one.\n\nThe ability to petition for an extension of Article 50 is in the interest of the smaller party. The larger party - the EU - will retain its legal and trading arrangements the day after Brexit in the same form they were in the day before. But we do not. Therefore it is perfectly likely that we will need some kind of extension. Maybe trading talks are still ongoing. Maybe the voting in the European parliament to authorise the agreement is taking longer than usual.\n\nOr maybe it'll be something smaller and shorter. We currently have no customs checkpoints with France for agricultural goods. Until they are built, they cannot be sent to the continent, where most of our food exports go. It is easy to imagine a scenario in which the French had not finished constructing those checkpoints and needed more time. We would want to grant that time to protect British farmers. And now we have made it harder for us to do so.\n\nThere are countless tiny little bits of our regulatory infrastructure that need to be taken care of ahead of Brexit day or they balloon into massive problems. Our passenger data sharing arrangement with the US comes under EU rules, for instance. If that's not transferred over, no flights can take off from the UK to America. There are countless thousands of problems like this, little legal bits and pieces with big ramifications which can slip under the radar and might only be noticed at the last minute.\n\nWe might need to extend Article 50 for a long time to continue trade talks. This is very likely. Or we might just need to extend it for two or three days, or a couple of weeks, to give us some maneuverability as we try to get a massive load of regulatory and trading systems into place for the deadline. What May and David Davis have just done makes that much harder.\n\nThis is lunacy. There is no conceivable argument for it being in the national interest. It is the kind of demand we would expect from our negotiating partner to put us on the spot, not one we would inflict on ourselves. We've turned into a nation of sado-masochists.\n\nThis is a ghastly spectacle of political hysteria and self-interest. The Brexiters in the Conservative parliamentary party don't seem to be responding to reason at all anymore. Their only interest is in the perpetual proof of faith-like commitment to an impossible national dream. And they have taken the leadership hostage.\n\nLook how they hold a gun to its head. Once Priti Patel stepped down, Iain Duncan Smith spent the day touring TV studios telling May she had to appoint another hard Brexiter to replace her. Not someone who understood or cared about international development, of course. It was completely irrelevant that the new international development secretary had this quality. They just had to really, really believe in Brexit.\n\nMay, as ever, submitted to the Brexiter demands and installed Penny Mordaunt. She is thought of particularly highly by the Brexiters because during the campaign she was prepared to lie - or, if you are being generous, commit to a systematic act of aggressive sophistry - by claiming that Turkey was about to join the EU and that Britain had no veto to stop it.\n\nThis did not ruin her career. Quite the opposite. The fact she was prepared to bend objective reality to the goal of Brexit helped propel her to where she is now. It is a kind of initiation ritual for ministerial office in Brexit Britain.\n\nIt is this line of thought that gets us to where we are now. A Cabinet selected on the basis of its religious adherence rather than its competence and a prime minister actively sabotaging the national interest to prove her worth to a cabal of lunatics in the parliamentary party.\n\nIan Dunt is the editor of Politics.co.uk.

Please wait, submitting your vote...\n\nMojo Jojo, Princess Morbucks, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and HIM join forces to create the supervillain group called \"The Beat-Alls\". This episode has many references to The Beatles.\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot\n\nTownsville's top four super villains have had it with getting crushed by The Powerpuff Girls, so they head to their house with different weapons (Mojo Jojo with a giant robot; Princess with her technological powers; Fuzzy carrying a huge rock; and HIM using demonic superpowers). Their argument disturbs the girls, who fly out to warn them to keep it down. But Mojo, HIM and Princess all act at once, and zaps the Girls with their blaster rays, before the Girls could even react. The force of the combined blast pushes the Girls down to the ground, screaming in agony. Fuzzy watches their torment for a while unsure of what to do next. Then he picks up the rock and throws it on top of them. To their astonishment, the villains realize that they have finally beaten the Girls. They resolve to work together, reasoning that this is the key to their success and create a team called The Beat-Alls.\n\nThe Powerpuff Girls subsequently try to stop them from robbing a bank but are no match for the Beat-Alls' group tactics. Mojo Jojo zaps them with his laser-gun; HIM spits a burning acid on them; Princess Morbucks electrocutes the Girls with her own laser-gun. As the Girls scream in agony, Fuzzy Lumpkins throws a heavy rock on top of them, defeating the Girls once again.\n\nThe team of villains defeats The Powerpuff Girls repeatedly until at last, the girls stop attempting to save the day, leaving The Beat-Alls free to continue their rampage. Back at The Powerpuff Girls' home, the Professor observes the girls despondency and offers some words of encouragement, suggesting that they break up the villainous supergroup. While robbing another bank, Mojo Jojo sees a ladder, which he climbs to find a magnifying glass through which he can read a tiny note reading \"This Is A Stick Up.\" At first enraged, he then sees the writer—a white-clad chimp named Moko Jono—and falls in love. But The other Beat-Alls become angered when Mojo Jojo is constantly accompanied by Moko and begins wearing white clothes and participating in her odd \"performance crimes.\"\n\nMojo and Moko's irritating antics soon lead to the breakup of the Beat-Alls. Without Mojo, the remaining Beat-Alls attempt to continue terrorizing Townsville; the Mayor calls the Girls. In a last desperate attempt to stop the Powerpuff Girls, the remaining three Beat-Alls attack them. HIM zaps the Girls with his acidic spits while Princess tortures them with her electric lasers. At first, the combined effects of the acidic spit and electric shocks knock the Girls down; but they soon recover and proceed to bring down the Beat-Alls who are no match for the Girls. The Beat-Alls are finally defeated once and for all.\n\nWalking in another part of town, Mojo and Moko see signs reading \"Beat-Alls Are Over.\"\n\nThe girls arrive to apprehend Mojo, and with the help of a zookeeper friend, they reveal the shocking truth about Moko: She is a performing chimp called Michelle (Mee-Shell), who had been recruited to help stop the Beat-Alls. The devastated Mojo is sent off to jail once again.\n\nCharacters\n\nQuotes\n\n[first lines] Mojo: The city of Townsville. (looks out from his observatory) I hate you.

Jojo's first love, Moko Yono, is a reference to John Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono. The shouting scene, showing how the Beat-Alls got separated, is a reference to the actual separation of the Beatles. Ironically, Yoko Ono was blamed by many fans for the break-up of the Beatles, while Moko Yono was responsible for the Beat-Alls splitting up since she was really undercover working with the Girls.\n\nIn the scene where the Chief of Police is speaking, his name is \"Sgt.

Sources familiar with Nokia's plans have revealed to The Verge that Nokia's tablet will include HDMI and USB ports and a 10.1-inch display that's similar to Microsoft's Surface RT screen. Nokia's tablet will also include cellular connectivity and we understand that AT&T will be one of the first to stock it in the US.\n\nWe're told that the large majority of Nokia's focus with its tablet is on a battery-equipped cover. Nokia will release a special cover for the tablet that envelops it like a book. Clicking into place, the cover provides a keyboard and a kickstand for the tablet. Nokia has also built a battery into the cover that can be used to power the tablet once it runs low on energy. Two USB ports on the case will also provide additional connectivity. We understand that the main tablet will have a 10-hour capacity with fast charging that boosts the battery capacity to 50 percent in a short period of time.\n\nOur sources have revealed that the Finnish company is planning to build a small number of the tablets initially, with a view to potentially building a Windows 8 device later. Nokia's first tablet will run on an ARM chip with Microsoft's new Windows RT operating system. Recent reports have suggested that Nokia may unveil its tablet at Mobile World Congress in February.\n\nWe reached out to Nokia to comment on its tablet plans.

  "latent_18254": "On October 4–6, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will be in Brussels for a long-planned visit to Belgium. The trip occurs in the midst of a major international crisis, as Russia is getting in on the act in Syria and asylum seekers continue to surge toward Europe. The visit also comes at a very troubled time in Turkey, where on November 1 a parliamentary election will be held amid a spiral of violence and a sharp deterioration of the rule of law.\n\nThis makes for a rather difficult agenda when President Erdoğan meets European Council President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Parliament President Martin Schulz in Brussels.\n\nMarc Pierini Pierini is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, where his research focuses on developments in the Middle East and Turkey from a European perspective. More > @MarcPierini1\n\nFighting terrorism, especially the insurgent Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), will be a key feature of President Erdoğan’s narrative. He is fighting a major offensive against the PKK and has the legitimacy to counter the group. No EU leader will say otherwise, as the PKK is on the EU’s list of terrorist organizations. Yet, the current escalation in the conflict comes after almost three years of a so-called Kurdish peace process launched by the president himself, during which time Turkey’s security forces showed considerable restraint in dealing with the PKK, even when provoked.\n\nPresident Erdoğan will find EU leaders skeptical on two counts. On the one hand, it is obvious that demonizing all the Kurds of Turkey, threatening local Kurdish politicians and journalists, torching or ransacking the offices of the Kurdish-rooted Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) across the country, and disseminating hate speech are political tactics that run the risk of tearing Turkey’s social fabric apart.\n\nThis worries the EU and should worry the Turkish president too. Fighting terrorism is one thing; trying to kill off a democratically elected Kurdish-rooted party and muffling critical voices by all imaginable means is an entirely different proposition. In Brussels, President Erdoğan will find support for the first aim but none at all for the second. EU leaders will stress the need to return to dialogue with Turkey’s Kurds because a military solution is elusive and highly risky for the country’s future.\n\nMore generally, since 2013, a clampdown on the media, business, judges, and anybody critical of Turkey’s leadership has resulted in a dramatic deterioration of the country’s rule of law architecture. This brings to a halt the rapprochement of Turkey’s political framework with that of the EU.\n\nOn the other hand, it is now apparent that after two months of intensely fighting terrorism, Turkey has focused heavily on the PKK but has largely neglected to strike the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nPresident Erdoğan will be told that the EU has a simple expectation of Turkey in the field of counterterrorism: Ankara should seal off the remaining 80–100-kilometer (50–62-mile) stretch of the Turkish-Syrian border still controlled by the Islamic State, in compliance with Turkey’s participation in the international coalition against the militant group. For the Islamic State, this border is still the only gateway to the world, for ammunitions, jihadists, and smuggled oil exports. It is high time to put an end to this ambiguity.\n\nPresident Erdoğan will also bring up his idea of a safe zone in this area and propose a last-minute round of consultations between the EU, the United States, and Turkey. Apart from its political motivation—namely, stopping the westward advance of the Syrian Kurds—the idea of a safe zone is eminently risky. Such a zone would invite strikes from the revamped air forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or possibly even the Russian air force. The EU should not support this flawed proposal.\n\nAnother issue high on the agenda will be the refugee crisis. No doubt, the Turkish president will stress the generosity of his country in welcoming some 2 million Syrians, of whom 12–15 percent are in state-run camps. He will receive a proper applause for this effort, but if he complains about the EU’s stinginess, he might be reminded that in 2011 his administration refused EU assistance in forms other than blank checks.\n\nThis time around, following the September 23 European Council meeting, the EU will offer a larger package to Turkey—not in blank checks but via the UN refugee agency and the World Food Program, together with a request for genuine cooperation.\n\nDealing with the refugee crisis is no longer about parading one’s generosity or lack thereof, but about handling a number of critical issues in Turkey in a decisive manner. Among these issues is the shameful presence of human traffickers who roam freely around Turkey, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars to send people on perilous journeys across the Mediterranean.\n\nAnother problem is the massive counterfeiting of Syrian passports in Turkey: Germany estimates that 30 percent of the Syrian passports checked by German authorities are forged. Further priorities include the need to screen migrants for refugee status on Turkish soil, which would allow for a safer onward journey, and the importance of coordination with Greece and Bulgaria on the transit of refugees.\n\nJoint work is urgently needed, not just to keep refugees on Turkish soil, but also to restore some order and humanity in this disastrous crisis. There is no room left for Turkey to go it alone, as it elected to do from 2011 onward; it is time to share responsibilities. This is not about the EU versus Turkey, it’s about both playing a constructive role—together.\n\nIn a tense regional environment—with Russia taking military action in Syria, Iran assuming a stronger role in both Iraq and Syria, and Syrian consulates dishing out passports without many controls—the exodus of Syrian (and other) refugees to Europe via Turkey is posing extremely serious challenges for both the EU and Turkey.\n\nIn such a context, Ankara’s political, economic, and security anchor in Europe and the West matters more than ever. This calls for Turkey to assume a responsible attitude on both the domestic and the international scene.",

Of course, the fey \"gourmet\" varieties - thicker, hand-cooked \"artisan\" crisps with flavours such as Aged Stilton and Ambassador's Port - are still considered acceptable by the food Nazis, provided they're served in a bowl at a cocktail party, surrounded by organic vol-au-vents and snobs. That's because our food neurosis is actually snootiness in disguise.\n\nConsequently, the cheap end of the crisp market has to pull stunts to distract you from the crushing social disgrace involved in actually purchasing a bag. Walkers' latest wheeze is a fun competition. Stage one: they ran adverts inviting the public to suggest exotic new taste sensations. Stage two: they chose six finalists, released them into the wild, and asked the public to vote for their favourite. Stage three: the votes are counted and the top flavour becomes a permanent member of the Walkers line-up. We're currently in stage two.\n\nTo lend the enterprise some gravitas, on the Walkers website you can watch kitchen surrealist Heston Blumenthal discussing the new flavours as though he genuinely believes they're edible.

It was a mission that would take me to the very heart of a newsagent's and back. Here are my capsule reviews of the six competing varieties:\n\nBuilder's Breakfast\n\nThere's some confusion over the exact contents of the Builder's Breakfast. On the website, Heston claims they taste of \"sausages, bacon, eggs and beans\", whereas the packet itself lists \"bacon, buttered toast, eggs and tomato sauce\". This would imply that even Walkers don't know what they've got on their hands, possibly because the crisps themselves taste of stale fried egg and little else. It captures the feeling of sitting in a greasy spoon, being dumped via text while your food repeats on you. Depressing.\n\nCrispy Duck and Hoisin\n\nA fairly accurate rendition, although if you close your eyes they taste like the standard Roast Chicken flavour might if the \"chicken\" in them had been killed with a hammer made of compacted sugar. This is probably something Heston actually does in his restaurant.\n\nFish and Chips\n\nSounds like a good idea, but think about it: FISH CRISPS. Consequently they smell vaguely infected. Actually eat one and it's like kissing someone who's just eaten a plateful of scampi. Halfway through they belch in your mouth.\n\nOnion Bhaji\n\nThe most convincing flavour, but they taste watered-down; as though Heston boiled one tiny bhaji in a swimming pool full of Evian, and then dipped some potatoes in it. It's like a lame TV movie about onion bhajis, starring Adam Woodyatt, with a soundtrack consisting entirely of library music, broadcast directly on to your tastebuds.\n\nCajun Squirrel\n\nSelf-consciously \"wacky\" and attention-grabbing entry. Walkers are keen to point out that \"no squirrels were harmed in the making of this crisp\", which is a pity because I had chucklesome visions of thousands of live, screaming squirrels being bulldozered into an immense bubbling cauldron in front of a party of horrified schoolchildren. The flavour itself is truly vile: if they'd called it Squirrel's Blood, everyone would've believed them. They taste precisely like a tiny cat piping hot farts through a pot-pourri pouch into your mouth.\n\nChilli and Chocolate\n\nExcreted Battery Acid, more like. A boring lunatic with halitosis explains the smell of charred wood to your tastebuds. It's vaguely like the smell you get when you bleed a radiator, but sharper, more disgusting, and worryingly \"human\". They should've called it \"Dirty Protest\" instead.\n\nSo there you have it. They're uniformly horrible. Worst of all, none are a patch on, say, standard Salt and Vinegar, which has been around since the Cro-Magnon era. Obviously, they should've chosen more ambitiously. Since the squirrel flavour doesn't actually contain any squirrel, they could unleash other tastes you're vaguely curious about, but would never actually eat, like Cyanide and Lemon, or The Late Marilyn Monroe. If they'd bitten the bullet and genuinely released a flavour called Dirty Protest, people would queue round the block to try it, provided the packet carried a prominent guarantee that it was merely a simulation, not the genuine article. (For the record, according to The Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices by Brenda Love [ISBN 0 349 10676 2], \"faeces supposedly has a charred or sour flavour but otherwise tastes similar to whatever was consumed\". So now you know.)\n\nOr maybe they could've worked on flavours that evoked a time and mood instead of mimicking an existing substance. Who could resist Wartime Romance (cigarettes, lipstick, and railway station)? Or Studio 54 (cocaine, sweat, and Bianca Jagger)? Even Medieval Times (mud, gibbet and wet tunic) would be worth trying.\n\nBut no. They didn't dare to dream. So in summary: don't vote for any of them. Spoil your ballot paper instead. Because that's what they've done to these innocent potatoes. The bastards. The absolute unconscionable bastards.\n\n• This week Charlie finished the seventh series of The Shield: \"A brilliant final reckoning.\" He also spent about 97 hours desperately washing the taste of crisps out of his mouth: \"The combined effect of all those flavours is like eating 15 bad orchestras made of tinfoil and grease.\"",
  "latent_18465": "BROOKSVILLE — Another dog has been euthanized by mistake at Hernando County Animal Services, and this time public safety director Mike Nickerson is in the hot seat for the error.\n\nNot only does he face discipline, but in a memo to Nickerson and to Spring Hill Fire Rescue Chief Mike Rampino on Friday, County Administrator Len Sossamon temporarily assigned Nickerson to oversee Animal Services on a full-time basis so he can implement all of the recommendations made in a recent audit of the operation.\n\n\"To permit Chief Nickerson to focus on running the Animal Services Division, I am temporarily relieving him of his oversight of Hernando County Fire Rescue,'' Sossamon wrote.\n\n\"Chief Rampino will immediately assume administrative oversight over Hernando County Fire Rescue. This assignment will be in addition to his current duties.''\n\nThe county's and Spring Hill's fire-rescue services are in the process of being merged.\n\nOn Sept. 7, workers at the county animal shelter confused one reddish-brown mixed breed dog with another, euthanizing a dog that had come in just two days earlier rather than one that had already been put through the screening process and been selected for euthanasia.\n\nImmediately after Nickerson found out about the mistake, he notified county officials and the volunteers at the shelter who have been working to decrease euthanasias by finding people and rescue organizations to take more animals.\n\nHe told the volunteers: \"As I am involved and at least partly at fault in the error, I will be providing a full disclosure of the facts to the county administrator . . . and asking that he or his designee investigate and handle any disciplinary action necessary.''\n\nSossamon assigned the investigation to Ron Pianta, the county's land services director, and Jerry Haines of Human Resources.\n\nIn a four-page memo released late Friday, Pianta and Haines determined that continuing problems with a short staff, procedures that have not been implemented consistently, and confusing identification processes for animals all contributed to the mistake.\n\nThe Animal Services workers used different information when identifying dogs for euthanasia. In this case, Animal Services officer Michael Steele used the kennel number to identify the dog chosen for euthanasia and not the animal identification number. The problem was that the dog had been moved to a different kennel, and the newly arrived dog had been put in its place.\n\nSteele, who was one of the Animal Services officers slated to move over to the Sheriff's Office in the new fiscal year, has resigned.\n\nHe is also the officer who earlier this summer was reprimanded and suspended for accidentally leaving a kitten locked inside his truck for more than 40 hours.\n\nThe kitten survived the ordeal, only to be euthanized several days later because it was feral.\n\nSossamon said Friday that the latest investigation showed that the same problems for which Animal Services has been criticized in recent audits and reports continue. Because of the continuing problems, he said he couldn't justify discipline for anyone at the shelter other than Nickerson.\n\nAlthough the full extent of the discipline will not be decided until early next week, Sossamon acknowledged that there have been some bad management decisions at the shelter and not enough momentum toward making needed changes.\n\nSossamon said more attention is needed to fix day-to-day procedural issues at the shelter. Another change, which employees said they had asked Nickerson to make several times, will be to move euthanasias to the start of the day, before the public is in the shelter.\n\nBy euthanizing animals at the end of the day, \"that puts a lot of pressure on folks to rush through,'' Sossamon said.\n\nThe issues at Animal Services first blew up in April, when volunteers made public the story of Zeus, an 8-month-old dog that was surrendered to the shelter, then euthanized just 12 minutes later.\n\nThe outcry prompted the county to seek an extensive audit of Animal Services. The report, released last month, found that the shelter did nothing technically wrong in the Zeus incident. But it said the operation was rife with other problems, ranging from too few staffers to a lack of procedures.\n\nAt a town hall meeting several weeks ago, Nickerson described some of the things he hoped to do to improve Animal Services. Although it was expected that those details would be finalized this month, the proposal is now scheduled to come to the commission in October.\n\nNickerson declined to comment Friday, saying he wanted to see Sossamon's disciplinary process through to the end.\n\nAnother question about his future with the county is raised by an item on the agenda for Tuesday's County Commission meeting. Commissioners will consider advertising for a new director of integrated fire-rescue and public safety services.\n\nSossamon said with the merger of the county and Spring Hill fire-rescues operations, there is a need for someone to oversee the final stages of consolidation and then run the new service.\n\nThe job will be open for anyone to apply, including Nickerson, Rampino, members of either of the chief's staffs, as well as outside applicants.\n\nBarbara Behrendt can be reached at [email protected] or (352) 848-1434.",
  "latent_18676": "Europe's prisons have become a \"breeding ground\" for Islamic State and Al-Qaeda militants, with a report finding almost two thirds of European \"jihadists\" were previously involved in violent crime.\n\nThe report, released by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at London's King's College, warned of the development of a \"new crime-terror nexus\" in which criminal networks in prisons and in communities gave way to recruitment into militant groups. Prisons, in particular, are a major hub for such groups.\n\n\"Prison is becoming important as a place where a lot of networking happens,\" said Peter Neumann, director of the ICSR and co-author of the report.\n\n\"Given the recent surge in terrorism-related arrests and convictions... we are convinced that prisons will become more – rather than less – significant as breeding grounds for the jihadist movement.\"\n\nThe generation who have gone to join IS is, in contrast to previous generations, heavily drawn in Europe from criminal backgrounds. The report, which is drawn from profiles of 79 recent European militants found that 57 percent of them had previously been incarcerated and that 65 percent had been involved in violent crime.\n\nThis contrasts with previous generations of Islamic militants who were recruited from religious establishments or universities and often came from relatively well-established middle-class families.\n\nAlthough some analysts have previously spoken of the importance of foreign funders of groups like Al-Qaeda and IS, the report also emphasised that individual attackers in Europe often derived their income from petty crime and that attacks such as those in Paris in November 2015 had cost in total less that 10,000 euros ($11,000).\n\nNeumann also raised the issue of prison reform, citing failing prisons in particular as a breeding ground for radicalisation.\n\nAuthorities losing control of prisons\n\n\"Radicalisation often happens in prisons that are overcrowded, where essentially prison authorities have lost control over their own facility - and the first and most important recommendation is for prisons to be orderly and safe, because it's unorderly and unsafe prisons that allow these conditions to exists,\" he said in response to a question from Middle East Eye.\n\nIn the last five years around 5,000 western Europeans have travelled to the Middle East to join groups such as IS and the Syrian al-Qaeda affiliate.\n\nFor some, joining these groups offers a form of \"redemption\" for their crimes, researchers said.\n\nAli Almanasfi, a British-Syrian from London who fought in Syria after serving a jail term for violent assault, was cited in the report as saying: \"I want to do something good for once. I want to do something pure.\"\n\nAccording to Neumann, the findings point to a shift in the way IS operates.\n\n\"We think IS no longer aspires to be a very theological organisation. It embodies the brutality, strength and power that these young people who were often members of gangs are looking for,\" he said.\n\n\"It basically tells them 'you can continue to do all the things you did before, but now you can get into heaven'.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by AFP.\n\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.",

  "latent_18965": "North Korean state newspaper the Rodong Sinmun published pictures of what appear to be a “miniaturized” nuclear device on Wednesday, adjacent to a Hwasong-13 (KN-08) ballistic missile that could be used to deliver a weapon.\n\nThe pictures – if true – are the first photographic evidence Pyongyang has presented related to the state of North Korea’s nuclear warhead technology.\n\n“It is gratifying to see the nuclear warheads with the structure of mixed charge adequate for prompt thermo-nuclear reaction,” state media outlet the KCNA reported Kim Jong Un as saying upon inspecting the missile facility.\n\n“The nuclear warheads have been standardized to be fit for ballistic missiles by miniaturizing them,” Kim reportedly continued, after meeting with local nuclear scientists at an undisclosed location.\n\nA MOCKUP?\n\nHowever, two observers said the pictures might not be of an actual nuclear warhead.\n\n“It’s possible the device seen in the photographs is a mock-up,” said NK News Intelligence Director John Grisafi.\n\n“However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t closely modeled on the actual design North Korea is developing, similar to how North Korea showed mock-ups of the Hwasong-13 (KN-08) while actually developing said missiles.”\n\nSuh Kune-yull, a nuclear scientist from Seoul National University, said the warhead shown in the pictures was at a very premature state of development when compared to modern standards.\n\n“One thing is for sure, the bomb seen on the media is a mock up,” Suh said. “If you look at the mirrors attached to the warhead, there are only around 30 to 40 of them. This shows that the warhead is still in a very premature state, and its explosive power would be relatively low by today’s standard.”\n\nSuh said hundreds of mirrors would need to be mounted on the warhead, precisely and exquisitely concentrated to stimulate maximum explosive power on one spot inside the device.\n\n“The mirrors are used as reflectors to send explosive power and neutrons back to one spot that is round the size of a single nanometer. This requires a very high level of scientific accuracy.”\n\nBut Suh said the arrangement of mirrors shown on the warhead looked coarse, estimating that the device would be at the very baseline of plutonium warhead development, far from either a fusion or hydrogen bomb, as North Korean claimed January nuclear test.\n\nTIMING OF PHOTO\n\nThe photographic development comes just two days after North Korea’s traditional ally Russia denounced recent threats from Pyongyang to conduct “preventive nuclear strikes” against its opponents, calling the threats “absolutely impermissible.”\n\nNorth Korea’s threats followed the tightest ever UN sanctions to be placed on Pyongyang, following a dramatic start to 2015 for the Korean peninsula.\n\n“The timing of this revelation was almost certainly intentionally planned to follow recent developments such as the nuclear test, satellite launch and consequential sanctions,”Grisafi continued. “Pyongyang may be seeking to ratchet up tensions similarly to spring of 2013.”\n\nBut North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stressed in Wednesday’s report that nuclear weapons development are part of a permanent national strategy, not a temporary counter-action against the rapidly changing international situation.\n\n“(Nuclear weapons) are the most just and reliable way of preventing the country from a nuclear war disaster,” said Kim.\n\n“If the U.S. imperialists infringe upon the DPRK’s sovereignty and right to existence with nuclear weapons, DPRK will never hesitate to make a preemptive nuclear strike at them.”\n\nCrucial details regarding Kim’s visit, such as the precised time and place, were not revealed by state media, as is customary in reporting about the leaders’ visits.\n\nMain picture: Rodong Sinmun",
  "latent_19213": "The school year began on Thursday morning with a protest at the Shevah Mofet high school in Tel Aviv against plans to turn it into an educational facility for asylum seekers, a decision that also led to a clash between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai.\n\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter\n\nThe Tel Aviv municipality announced last week that starting the next school year, the school, with 75% of its students coming from outside Tel Aviv, will stop accepting students who are not residents of the city. This will be done to make room for students who live in southern Tel Aviv—most of them children of asylum seekers and illegal migrants—to attend the school.\n\nThe school's students and teachers decided to protest the decision, calling out \"You don't close a school with 100 percent graduation rates.\" They waved signs that said: \"We won't evacuate our home\" and \"Don't replace a winning team.\" The protest ended at 10am, allowing classes to begin.\n\nStudents protest at Shevah Mofet (Photo: Lior Paz)\n\n\"There is a bad atmosphere, but on the other hand we also know how to put this aside and begin the school year,\" said Max Sivan, the principal of Shevah Mofet. \"This isn't just a school. There's a culture here, a long history, including a history of international achievements. This needs to be protected, this is a national asset. It's not just another school. I'm willing to take in any student, but don't ruin what we have.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his objection to turning the school into \"an educational institution for infiltrators,\" supporting the position of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman.\n\nThis angered Tel Aviv Mayor Huldai, who responded with a harsh statement. \"Unfortunately, despite the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality's requests to the prime minister, he chooses to release messages like a common internet commentator, instead of dealing with the problem of foreigners that he himself was among those responsible for,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu visiting a school in Tamra on the first day of school (Photo: Zohar Shahar)\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office responded to this, saying \"The Tel Aviv mayor and municipality need to be ashamed of the of the fact such an excellent educational institution is set to close, and for the inappropriate language of their statement. Thanks to the prime minister's policy, over 20,000 infiltrators willingly left Israel over the past decade. The prime minister will continue with this policy.\"\n\nThe Tel Aviv municipality responded to that, by saying \"it was him (Huldai) who nurtured Shevah Mofet, as a way to help the immigrant population—and this he had done without help from the government.\n\n\"Huldai believes a different place can be found so Shevah Mofet can continue its praiseworthy activity, and there has already been a request made to the Education Ministry and the Amal school chain on the matter. Such a solution will not come to be on Facebook, and that was the reason for the mayor's harsh response.\n\n\"The municipality understands the parents' concerns, but the school is not going to close its doors in the coming years anyway, and all students currently attending it could graduate. There is also no objection to having the school continue its operations from another location.\"\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Huldai accompanies his grandson on the first day of school (Photo: Motti Kimchi)\n\nA close confidant of Huldai accused Netanyahu of \"not even knowing the facts. We don't know where the 20,000 infiltrators that left thanks to the prime minister's policies left from—certainly not from Tel Aviv.\"\n\nCulture Minister Miri Regev, of Netanyahu's Likud party, decided to join in on the exchange of accusations, opining that \"Huldai has abandoned the neighborhood and its residents.\"\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett sided with Huldai, telling Ynet on Thursday morning that \"It's important to clarify that there is no demographic change at the school at the moment. There are certain intentions or ideas from the municipality in that regard. The goal we all stive for is to keep Shevah Mofet running in the same way as it has been so far. On the other hand, we're obligated to follow the law and provide education.\"\n\nElvyra Kolihman, a member of the school's parents' committee, explained the decision to hold their protest on the first day of school. \"We want to stress that until the mayor sits with us and we reach an agreement that the school won't change in the coming years—the fight will continue. This is a fight for the future of the school. We want to ensure that every child in the State of Israel that wants to go to this school—and feels like this is the best education—could do so. This is an excellent school that must not be closed or change its way of operations. The prime minister made it clear that the best solution is to leave the school as it is, and that's what should happen.\"\n\nParents also protest at Shevah Mofet (Photo: Avi Mualem)\n\nStudents also took part in the protest. \"We're protesting because we don't want them to change our school,\" says Itay Morbiya, who is starting his final year of high school. \"I want my brothers to have the same education I had, with teachers who don't give up on you. I have friends who come here from Ashkelon and Ariel because they want to succeed; they want a good high school diploma. We shouldn't ruin this.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, dozens of protesters arrived in south Tel Aviv to demonstrate against Huldai, calling him a \"traitor\" and carrying signs with his photo and the writing \"Criminal.\" The protesters eventually took to burning photos of the mayor.\n\nProtesters burn signs with the likeness of Mayor Huldai (Photo: Yariv Katz)\n\nProtesters burn signs with the likeness of Mayor Huldai (Photo: Yariv Katz)\n\nOn Thursday morning, the CEO of the Ort school chain Tzvi Peleg turned to the head of the Tel Aviv municipality's Education Department, Shirley Rimon, suggesting a framework for Ort to take in asylum seekers' children this year.\n\n\"Ort Israel believes in giving equal opportunities in education to every child in Israel,\" Peleg said. \"We're prepared to take in these students.\"",

Ryan projects that the federal government will spend $4.6 trillion less over the next decade.\n\nBut in order to get to this balanced budget, Ryan relies on deficit reductions that were pushed through by President Barack Obama over loud protests by Ryan and his House GOP colleagues.\n\nFirst, Ryan's budget will keep the $716 billion in Medicare cuts included in Obamacare as a way to balance the budget. So Ryan keeps the savings, but gets rid of the reform part.\n\nAs First Read notes, Ryan campaigned vigorously against the Obamacare Medicare savings at the Republican vice presidential candidate last year, and even attacked the cuts in his convention speech.\n\nRyan's budget also assumes all of the revenue from the fiscal cliff deal, which raised income tax rates for individuals earning more than $400,000 per year.

It is located near the Elbe river in the historic center of Dresden, Germany.\n\nIt is one of the burial sites of the House of Wettin, including Polish monarchs.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe church around 1840\n\nThe Hofkirche stands as one of Dresden's foremost landmarks. It was designed by architect Gaetano Chiaveri from 1738 to 1751.[1] The church was commissioned by Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland while the Protestant city of Dresden built the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) between 1726 and 1743. Whilst the general population was Protestant its rulers were Catholic. The Catholic Elector built the cathedral for his own use and for the use of other high-ranking officials, connecting it to his home, Dresden Castle, with an ornate high level walkway.[1]\n\nThe church was badly damaged in February 1945 during the bombing of Dresden in the Second World War. It was initially restored during the mid-1980s by the East German government. It was further restored in the early 21st century following reunification, including the rebuilding of the bridge to the castle. Today it is the cathedral of the Diocese of Dresden-Meissen. Free entry is permitted during the daytime.\n\nThe cathedral features a carefully restored organ, the last work of the renowned organ builder Gottfried Silbermann. It also contains a Rococo pulpit by Balthasar Permoser.\n\nBurials [ edit ]\n\nIn the crypts the heart of King Augustus the Strong is buried along with the last King of Saxony and the remains of 49 other members of the Wettin family, as well as the remains of people who married into the family, such as Princess Maria Carolina of Savoy, wife of Anthony of Saxony.\n\nThe oldest of four crypts, the Founders' Crypt, holds the tombs of King Augustus III of Poland, one of very few Polish Kings to be buried outside the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, and last Queen of Poland Maria Josepha.

What is far more important is what has happened this week and what will happen after the policy conference. We are going to continue to come together against hate. We are going to argue that what Mr. Trump calls PC, is not a bad thing, it is what we Jews call … being a good person.”\n\nTrump is slated to speak at the influential group’s policy conference on Monday evening — and his speech at AIPAC caused him to not appear at a since-canceled GOP presidential debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. That debate would have been moderated by the Fox News Channel, but after Trump pulled out, he was joined by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the only other remaining GOP presidential candidate, was added to the AIPAC schedule after failing to bait Trump into skipping AIPAC and going to the debate.\n\nSome of the conference attendees aren’t thrilled with Trump’s AIPAC appearance — Paskin most notable among them.\n\nPaskin, who was polite in the interview, promised that, unlike recent outbursts at Trump speeches, the walkout would be “respectful and dignified.”\n\nWhen challenged whether walking out was the best way to create a respectful dialogue, Rabbi Paskin told Breitbart News: “People have been debating that with me all day. ‘If you are asking for respectful dialogue then how can you walk out?’ I’m not expecting respectful dialogue with Mr. Trump, I don’t think he has any interest in that. I would certainly be open to it; I’d be honored to share my concerns with him, but I don’t think he wants to hear them.”\n\nMore than 1,700 people have joined the protest’s Facebook page in the last week, but Rabbi Paskin admits that many will not want to miss Trump’s speech — so the protest might not be as successful as he hopes.\n\n“It is very hard to stay away from a Donald Trump speech,” Paskin told Breitbart News. “He is a very engaging and dynamic speaker. It’s quite a spectacle, and I wouldn’t be surprised if some people who said they were going to participate want to stay to listen to what he has to say.”\n\nTrump’s speech at AIPAC will come after he meets earlier in the day with several senior congressional Republicans, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), in a meeting at the Jones Day law firm offices at which Trump attorney Don McGahn is a partner. Sen.

He said it would provide an “affirmative defense” for sufferers of intractable epilepsy. This means that if patients happened to be arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, they could produce their certificate to the courts at least 10 days before trial and walk without any charges.\n\nA question was raised on the Senate floor about the difference between a prescription for marijuana and a recommendation, because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved such medical marijuana treatments. But Norment pointed out that the bill refers specifically to recommendations and certifications from doctors rather than a prescription.\n\nThe oils, like THC-A, reportedly have anti-inflammatory qualities, among other healing properties, but without the same psychoactive effects as THC.\n\nHB 1445 was sponsored by Del. Dave Albo, R-Springfield. The House had unanimously passed the bill on Feb. 10.\n\nSen. Dave Marsden, D-Burke, sponsored an identical companion bill – SB 1235.

  "latent_19660": "NSA Chief Says We Warned France Of Russian Cyber Attacks.\n\nNSA chief Admiral Mike Rogers said Tuesday, that Russia was behind the hack of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's campaign team and US Cyber Security agency had informed to France officials.\n\nThere are approximate Nine gigabytes of data including emails and document from Macron's campaign were leaked online by Cyber criminals on Friday.According to FT \"We had become aware of Russian activity,” said Admiral Michael Rogers, NSA director. “We had talked to our French counterparts prior to the public announcements of the events that were publicly attributed this past weekend, and gave them a heads-up: ‘Look, we're watching the Russians, we're seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure’.”We're all trying to figure out how can we try to learn from each other.“You see every nation-state engage, they’ll penetrate a system, they will look to not just extract but study it, understand it, see where it connects to, can they use that as a jumping-off point to get to somewhere else,” he said. “I’ve seen nation-states engaged in the activity in the US where they clearly are interested in a long-term presence, not just extracting data.”According to Washington Times Last year, the U.S. intelligence community documented what appeared to be Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic National Committee staff emails and the private emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta.Adm. Rogers said NSA learned of Russian efforts to compromise U.S. political institutions in the summer of 2015 and warned the FBI and the Pentagon.Last weekend, in the final days of the 2017 French presidential election, the eventual winner, Emmanuel Macron revealed that his campaign had been hit by a massive cyberattack.Citing the French election hack, the committee chairman, Sen. John McCain, asked Adm. Rogers if U.S. Cyber Command and the NSA had seen a reduction in Russian cyberattacks.“No, I have not,” Adm. Rogers replied, adding that the U.S. must be more assertive in calling out Russian cyberattacks. “They need to know we will publicly identify this behavior.”",
  "latent_19681": "When Winchester produced its famous 1873 lever-action rifles and carbines, Colt wasted no time in chambering its single-action Army revolver in Winchester’s calibers from .44-40 down to .32-20. There are times when the quick handling and easy portability of a handgun is of paramount importance for self defense, but when faced with dire threats cowboys knew it was much better to have a repeating rifle. A handgun and longarm in the same caliber was a winner on the American frontier. From a self-defense standpoint, today’s shooters can find a practical, cost-effective, modern parallel to the 19th century Colt/Winchester pairing in Hi-Point carbines and pistols. Hi-Points are chambered in popular pistol cartridges such as .45 ACP, .40 S&W, 9mm Luger and soon .380 ACP, and the .40 S&W and .45 ACP model carbines and pistols even share a common magazine. I tested a model 995ts carbine and C9 pistol chambered in 9mm and was favorably impressed.\n\nIt is known that you can get a Colt Defender pistol and Model 6951 AR-15 type carbine in 9mm; however, this combination will cost you about $2,000. The Hi-Points I tested cost less than $500! That puts Hi-Points into a unique niche as the least expensive centerfire firearms on the market. There is a lot more to the differences between Colts and Hi-Points than price, so to narrow the focus of the discussion, I will evaluate the Hi-Points as personal home-defense firearms. In this respect, based on my testing, Hi-Points represent an exceptional value.\n\nBe careful not to make the mistake of assuming inexpensive means poor quality. Hi-Point firearms are engineered to be inexpensive. When I disassembled them, I was struck by the clever way parts were designed to serve multiple purposes and the use of highly efficient manufacturing techniques like metal stamping, zinc alloy casting, metal injection molding, button-rifled barrels, powder coating and injection-molded plastic. The martial spirit of the highly effective Soviet PPSH-41 submachine gun and the clandestine American FP-45 Liberator pistol of World War II are channeled through the Hi-Points. All of these firearms let the ease of manufacture and effective function dictate their form.\n\nAn important consumer byproduct of the care taken in designing the Hi-Points is that the production cost of parts is so low, the firearms are warranted forever. Not just for the original owner, but every owner (the instruction sheet with older production guns may still indicate the warranty is limited to the original purchaser, but the distributor at MKS assured me that is not the case). If any of Hi-Point’s firearms has a problem, it will be repaired by the factory free of charge. From my research, they are living up to their promise, and their reputation is excellent.\n\nIf Hi-Point’s design has a negative, I believe it is the trigger pull. The one I tested initially was heavy and erratic. Sometimes it let go crisply; other times it creeped one or two times before it released the sear. This trigger spoiled a lot of groups. I think the crux of problem is that by design, each pull of the trigger is doing a lot more than just releasing the sear. When you take the gun apart you’ll see what I mean. It is what it is, but take heart! If your trigger is stiff and creepy like a zombie, I found that dry firing the action a thousand times, like I did while I watched a TV show, improved mine significantly.\n\nThe 995ts carbine is a good choice for targets from 15 to 50 yards. It is probably effective at ranges greater than 50 yards, but if you are shooting at someone that far away, it may prove difficult to make a case for self defense in court. It comes with a 10-round magazine and mine had a very handy factory two-magazine clip. This clip attached to the web of the stock allowing me to carry 30 rounds total, in and on the gun. The buttstock had a recoil-absorbing butt pad that was probably more important with the .45 ACP version than it was with the 9mm I tested. The carbine was pleasant to shoot and the military aperture sights were easy to adjust and use. This model has plenty of surprisingly rugged polymer tactical rails to mount all of your accessories and they make a nice-looking vertical foregrip and muzzle-brake, which I did not test.\n\nThe carbine used in this test had several hundred rounds through it before I formally evaluated it. I’ve been using it during our local Zombie Shooters United competitions in central Kentucky for over a year and it has never malfunctioned in competition. I do recall, when I first zeroed it for 25 yards, that the trigger pull was quite heavy. However, during my test for this story the trigger seemed a lot better.\n\nAs one would expect, ammo matters. The best of the three different loads I tested was remanufactured semi-target-grade, 124-grain, full-metal-jacket ammunition from AwesomeAmmunition.com. The average 50-yard, open-sight group from five separate five round strings was 2.25 inches, which is pretty darn good for a pistol cartridge at that range. The velocity through the carbine’s 16.5-inch barrel was 1,143 feet per second and was measured 12 feet from the muzzle.\n\nOf the 115-grain full-metal-jacket factory ammo I tested, Winchester Target was clearly the better of the two. It was close behind Awesome Ammunition’s magic beans, with an average group size of 2.98 inches and 1,332 fps. The Winchester groups were more than an inch tighter than another popular low-cost factory ammo. This pattern of performance held for the C9 pistol too. Awesome Ammunition was the most accurate, this time a 124-grain, jacketed hollow point, followed by Winchester and the other famous brand, coming in at a distant third place.\n\nDon’t expect the C9 pistol to shoot like a Colt Gold cup. It’s no target pistol, but it will be head-shot accurate at 7 yards and center-mass effective to 25 yards. I was able to easily put five shots through a green bean can at 7 yards with one hand after I broke in the trigger. When I bench tested at 7 yards, I found the same Winchester load I used in the carbine, printed groups averaging 1.62 inches and had a velocity of 1,104 fps. That cluster of 25 test rounds left a ragged hole in the target which you could cover with the bottom of a soda can. That’s pretty impressive for a $140 pistol. As a point of interest, I shot groups with this same load benched from 25 yards both before and after I broke in the trigger and the difference was dramatic. Breaking in the trigger shaved 2 inches off the group size, dropping it from an average of 9.74 inches to 7.75 inches.\n\nThe Hi-Points are heavy guns, but they are reliable, bargain priced, decent shooters and all American made. Without a doubt, they will be the best home-defense guns you will ever own for the money. ASJ\n\nApril 22nd, 2015 by Danielle Breteau",
  "latent_19723": "Transgender Law Center praised the U.S. Department of Education for releasing guidelines today that make it clear transgender and gender nonconforming students are protected from discrimination under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in schools.\n\n“We hear from hundreds of students each year who simply want to be themselves and learn at school,” said Masen Davis, Executive Director of Transgender Law Center. ”Sadly, many schools continue to exclude transgender students from being able to fully participate. Now, every school in the nation should know they are required to give all students, including transgender students, a fair chance at success.”\n\nIncreasingly, courts and federal agencies are making clear that transgender and gender nonconforming people–people who do not conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity–are covered under laws that protect people from discrimination based on sex. In 2012 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ruled, in a case brought by Transgender Law Center, that transgender people are protected from discrimination in the workplace under Title VII, the parallel federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in employment. In 2013 the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights and U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division settled a lawsuit brought by a transgender student against the Arcadia Unified School District for denying him access to the same facilities and activities as other boys. The settlement referenced the EEOC ruling.\n\nTransgender Law Center is currently representing Seamus Johnston, a former honors student at the University of Pittsburgh, in his sex discrimination lawsuit against the university. Mr. Johnston is a transgender man. During his three years at the University of Pittsburgh, he consistently lived as male and used men’s restrooms on campus. He has also changed most of his identity documents to reflect his male gender. The University allowed him to enroll in a Weight Lifting for Men class in the spring and fall of 2012. In the fall of 2012, however, the University suddenly informed Mr. Johnston that he was no longer permitted to use the men’s restrooms or locker rooms on campus unless he obtained a new birth certificate reflecting his male gender. When he continued using the men’s facilities, the University engaged in a campaign of persecution against him, having him arrested and criminally prosecuted, and eventually expelling him, causing him to lose his full scholarship.\n\n“This case illustrates how important laws like Title IX are to protect transgender students from discrimination,” said Ilona Turner, Transgender Law Center’s Legal Director. “Today’s guidance from the Department of Education makes it crystal clear that under federal law, schools cannot exclude transgender students from the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in school.”\n\nSchools seeking sample policies to ensure all students, including transgender students, are able to fully participate at school should refer to the California School Board Association’s model policy available here. The policy was released in February of 2014 to help schools comply with both Title IX and the School Success and Opportunity Act, or AB 1266, a California law that makes sure schools know their legal obligation to make sure transgender students are able be themselves and participate at school.\n\nThese recent developments in the law have been a success for students like Zoey, a 12-year-old transgender girl from the Los Angeles area who transferred out of her school after administrators there refused to acknowledge her as a girl or allow her to use the girls’ restroom. Her mom, Ofelia Barba, says that the law makes it easier for her daughter to go to school and be herself. “I love my daughter and want the same things for her that other parents want for their children,” Barba said. “I want what’s best for her, for her to be happy, and for her to be able to do well in school. No one wants to see any kid singled out and excluded from school because of who they are.”\n\nThe Department of Education’s new guidance is available below.\n\nDownload (PDF, 867KB)",

  "latent_20153": "PARIS—The golden domes would look at home on Moscow’s Red Square. There are five of them, onion-shaped and glistening in the sun, each one bearing a cross—potent symbols of the Russian Orthodox Church. But here in front of them flows the Seine River. Behind them rises the Eiffel Tower. Down the street is the French foreign ministry, known as the Quai d’Orsay.\n\nThat much you can see.\n\nWhat French and other Western intelligence agencies have been concerned about as they watched the building go up over the last six years is what you don’t see when you look at the just-inaugurated Holy Trinity Cathedral and Russian Orthodox Spiritual and Cultural Center.\n\nFrench journalist Nicolas Hénin in his new book La France Russe notes that the building abuts an apartment used (at least until recently) by the French Secretary General of Defense and National Security, as well as the mail service of the French presidential palace.\n\nAn inter-ministerial note on the state of France’s intelligence agencies cited by Hénin observed that the cathedral domes, made of composite materials, could hide sophisticated listening devices, and since the “cultural center” enjoys diplomatic immunity, there’s no obvious way to get inside to look.\n\nAccording to other sources, the French are now employing active countermeasures, just in case, and several Western embassies and enterprises have checked to make sure there is no line of sight contact between them and the domes.\n\nIt’s a strange spectacle, an obvious outpost of Mother Russia, even if all its aspects are benign, which was assumed to be the case when then-President Nicolas Sarkozy approved its construction in 2010. But since then, “benign” has become a word hard to associate with the Kremlin. So when Russian President Vladimir Putin was supposed to open the center here this month, the current French president, François Hollande, said he wouldn’t attend, and if he talked to Putin at all, his office declared, it would be about war crimes in Syria. Putin decided to postpone his visit more or less indefinitely.\n\nPerhaps this seems like crazy neo-Cold War paranoia. High-tech spookery hiding behind onion domes on the Left Bank? Yet almost anything seems possible at a time when Putin has been using every conceivable means at his disposal to extend Russian influence and disrupt or discredit Western democracy in Europe, and, indeed, in the United States.\n\nIf there is a new cold war chill, it’s coming from the east. Putin, faced with a badly flagging economy and potential domestic discontent, is actively preparing his people for nuclear Armageddon, while in the United States, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, an avowed admirer of Putin’s “leadership,” warns that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s talk about standing up to him will lead to “World War III.”\n\nAs The Economist pointed out last week, inside Russia,“The two main pillars of the Soviet state, propaganda and the threat of repression, have been restored.” The infamous KGB, which was humiliated and broken up 25 years ago, “has been rebuilt as the main vehicle for political and economic power.” Meanwhile, “reactionary restoration at home has led to aggression abroad,” with hybrid warfare against Georgia and Ukraine, and intimidation of the little Baltic states. All this even as Moscow has “attempted to undermine Euro-Atlantic institutions, backed right-wing parties in Europe,” and, as the The Economist, too, avers, “tried to meddle in America’s presidential elections.”\n\nIf Putin’s aggressive stratagems are a fairly recent revelation to Americans (or, at least, those Americans willing to pay attention), the basic tactics are old news in France and much of the rest of Europe, where Moscow has been active for a long time helping to underwrite with money and propaganda the wave of populism sweeping the Continent.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Russia has established ties with far-right parties in Eastern Europe, including Hungary’s Jobbik, Bulgaria’s anti-EU Attack movement, and Slovakia’s far-right People’s party.\n\nThe Eastern European far-right parties have returned the love, whether by supporting the 2008 Russian war against Georgia or by vocalizing support for Putin, as the Bulgarian Attack party has. In 2012, Attack’s leader, Volen Siderov, even popped over to Moscow to ring in Putin’s 60th birthday. Siderov also threatened to withdraw his party’s support from the coalition government if it supported further sanctions against Russia, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\n\nHowever, in recent years Russian influence has been moving west. In a 2014 report, the Budapest-based research institute Political Capital argued that Russia’s meddling in political affairs of the European far right has become a “phenomenon seen all over Europe.” And earlier this year, The Telegraph reported that American intelligence agencies were planning a review of secret Russian funding of several European political parties. The specific parties weren’t named, but it is believed that European far-right groups such as Jobbik, the Northern League in Italy, and Greece’s Golden Dawn are among those to be investigated for having received Russian cash.\n\nMost conspicuously, in 2014, after Russia took the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and fueled a wider war in the east of that country, provoking heavy international sanctions, one prominent member of Marine Le Pen’s National Front went as an observer of the dubious Russian-Crimean referendum and pronounced it “legitimate.” A few months later, a Kremlin-controlled bank found €9 million ($10 million) to loan the cash-strapped Front, and at the beginning of this year the party treasurer admitted he was looking for another €27 million from the movement’s friends in Moscow.\n\nConsidering all this, one senior Western intelligence official told Hénin the idea that the domes of the new Russian Orthodox cathedral on the Seine are covers for electronic eavesdropping is “the stuff of fantasy!” But that’s only because the Russians have so many tools at their disposal in France and the West. The cathedral complex “is much more symbolic,” said the official. The Russians would have to be “absolutely stupid to install a listening capacity there,” he said.\n\nAnd “absolutely stupid” they absolutely are not.\n\n***\n\nNicolas Hénin, the author of La France Russe, is not just another hardworking journalist. The 40-year-old Frenchman has spent much of his career covering the Middle East and had an especially close view of totalitarian brutality when the so-called Islamic State held him hostage for 10 months in 2013 and 2014. Among his fellow captives was American journalist James Foley, the first U.S. hostage to die by the ISIS knife. Hénin’s book Jihad Academy tells the story.\n\nWhen we talked last week about Russian actions in France, Europe, and the United States, the horrors of ISIS-land were in the background, but relevant still, since the infamy of ISIS is exploited by the Russians as a tool for their own ends. But more about that a bit later.\n\nWe met at Hénin’s request in Place de la République beneath the huge statue of Marianne. This was probably just a matter of convenience for Hénin, but literally and figuratively we talked in the shadow of the symbol of the French Republic where so many huge demonstrations against terror and oppression have gathered in recent years.\n\nFor more than an hour, we drank cappuccinos on the edge of the square in a café called Fluctuat Nec Mergitur, “storm-tossed but not sunk,” the ancient Latin motto of the city of Paris that became the watchwords of resistance to terror after the horrific attacks here on Nov. 13 last year. So there was a certain irony in our discussion of Putin’s twisted but often effective messages to the West.\n\n“The key is to say we are declining countries because we don’t have moral values anymore,” Hénin explained. The message the Russians bring—a message they insinuate anywhere they can—is that “we are too open to ‘foreign’ influences”: too much immigration, too much Islam, too many LGBT rights, too much America. And not enough Russia, it would seem.\n\nThe story in France has its own particularities, but anyone who has watched the Trump campaign—which was once managed by Russian-crony-funded consultant Paul Manafort and continues to exploit Russian-hacked intelligence about the Democratic Party, including very probably the drips out of WikiLeaks—must see some striking similarities.\n\n“In France, the Russians have a multi-faceted approach,” said Hénin. “If you are leftist, they will play on your anti-Americanism. If you are a businessman, they will attract you with the promise of huge contracts. If you are military, they will say, ‘We are the only ones in the modern world who know what it means to show muscle.’ If you are Christian, they will say, ‘We are sharing your fight against the secularism of the world.’”\n\nThus a figure like Marine Le Pen fits admirably into the Russian strategy. She may well be sincere when she says, as she did in an interview in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, “Strategically there is no reason not to deepen relations with Russia. The only reason we don’t is because the Americans forbid it.” But then again, it seems she wasn’t asked about the money from Moscow. When she has been, she blames the French government for making it impossible for her to get loans in her own country.\n\nIn any case the Russian criteria for supporting politicians in Europe and the United States, whether with money or propaganda or both, is not ideological in the old communist sense. It is, rather, based on the much older and more basic techniques of what used to be called “rabble-rousing.”\n\n“A populist,” says Hénin, “has no political program as such. Their only approach is to say, ‘You are angry and you should be even more angry and I am the boss of the party of angry people. We will fire you up and once you are extremely angry you will vote for me because… I am the boss of the angry people.’”\n\nThe fury of the masses then disrupts and discredits the whole democratic system. Thus, Le Pen herself may never win the presidency of France, says Hénin, but “she is dictating the agenda to the old right, and to the moderate right.” Indeed, one now hears even Socialist President François Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls starting to parrot National Front positions.\n\n***\n\nIf one is to understand the Russian game in the West, it’s important to understand the way Putin tells his people they’ve been gamed by the West, feeding their fury and resentments. Presenting himself as the boss of the angry people in his own country, he has heightened hysteria and pared away freedoms to the point where Russia “has long since ceased to live by the rule of law,” as French academic Cécile Vaissié noted in her recent book, Les Réseaux du Kremlin en France.\n\nPutin saw his own power and the power of his allies in the old Soviet bloc challenged by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and other “color revolutions” over the last quarter century, and concluded these were not the work of popular discontent and a desire for Western economic and political freedoms, but conspiracies by the American and European secret services.\n\nLikewise, while we have heard a great deal recently about Russian hacking—most likely Russian government-supported hacking—of emails and other communications, we’ve heard rather less about the hacking of high-level Russian communications by ill-defined groups like Anonymous International and a collective that calls itself Shaltai Boltai, or Humpty Dumpty in Russian.\n\nMuch of the information about Marine Le Pen’s National Front getting Russian money as a seeming quid pro quo for supporting the Crimea invasion in 2014 came from this group, for instance. It also carried out impish attacks like the hacking of Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev’s Twitter account in August 2014, when his 2.5 million followers thought they saw him tweet: “I’m resigning. I’m ashamed of this government’s actions. Forgive me.”\n\nAgain, it’s very unlikely that Putin thinks this is just the work of anarchic folks working out of their basements. He knows he has set up vast “troll farms” and cyber war operations ready to play dirty tricks on his rivals. He would assume the Americans and their allies have done just the same.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, not to put too fine a point on it, warned Putin face to face at a summit in September that the United States had a greater defensive and offensive capacity in cyberspace than Russia could command, and would use it.\n\nBut Hénin argues against an illusion of equivalency. As he put it, “Putin will do shit and try to make people believe ‘the shit we do is because you do shit, too.’”\n\nThus if the Americans talk about the atrocities in Syria, Putin will bring up atrocities in Yemen to try to minimize his own crimes. And a lot of people buy that. “So, now,” says Hénin, in the French press you see, ‘Mosul will be another Aleppo,’” suggesting the American-supported offensive against ISIS in its Iraqi stronghold will be as savage as the Russian-backed Syrian offensive in a city where ISIS has virtually no presence.\n\nThat just isn’t so. “It is different when you systematically try to wipe out a population or force them into exile by destroying infrastructure, starting with hospitals,” says Hénin, who knows the situation on the ground all too well.\n\n***\n\nWhat direct lessons are there for Americans in the French and European experience with Russia?\n\n“They want to use us against you,” says Hénin. “They want to use some of your own people against you. They want to identify the weaknesses inside.”\n\nAccording to Hénin, the Russian leadership does not believe there is such a thing as a “civil society”—government of the people, by the people, and for the people. “But they believe that societies can be manipulated.” They focus on certain groups they think are easily swayed.\n\n“They don’t believe in public opinion, they only believe in public manipulation,” says Hénin. “In the U.S. the group they mainly work on is angry white men.”\n\nAnd then, added to the question of anger, there is the matter of terror.\n\nLooking at the alleged Russian involvement with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the WikiLeaks drips, one might think the Kremlin has just about reached the bottom of its bag of dirty tricks. But the French know firsthand that’s far from the case.\n\nOn April 8, 2015, a devastating cyber attack targeted the French international television network TV5 Monde. All of its channels suddenly showed black screens and on the network’s social media accounts viewers found a message from the “CyberCaliphate.”\n\nThis was just three months after the French people had responded to the horrific terror attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by proclaiming, “Je suis Charlie,” I am Charlie. Now the supposed CyberCaliphate proclaimed beneath the image of a man whose face was wrapped in a keffiyeh, “Je suIS IS”—I am the Islamic State (mixing French with English acronyms).\n\nFrench government agencies were at first reluctant to attribute the attack, but by June of last year private cyber security firms had linked it to a group known by several different names: Pawn Storm, APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, and Fancy Bear—the same group identified hacking into the Democratic National Committee.\n\n“Analysis of the data showed proof that the lines of code were written on Cyrillic keyboards, mainly during Moscow office hours,” writes Hénin.\n\nOne can imagine those cubicles and computer screens, and the click of the keyboards. All very 21st century. All very anonymous. But back in the 1940s, the British author Graham Greene had an appropriate name for such a place. He called it “The Ministry of Fear.”\n\nOne might think of that now, even here in Paris, looking at the golden domes and high walls of the Russian Orthodox Spiritual and Cultural Center.",
  "latent_20202": "Today, the world economy is in uncharted territory.\n\nNever before has the developed world carried this much debt. Never before have the central banks of those same countries expanded their balance sheets so much. Never before has so much sovereign debt been outright monetized. Never before have major financial institutions been officially designated as “too big to fail” and thereby been granted special license to assume gigantic risks.\n\nDr. Lacy Hunt, economist and current executive vice president of Hoisington Investment Management Company, expects the macroeconomic situation to get worse from here:\n\nThe main problem is that we have too much debt. We have too much of the wrong type of debt. That’s not very well understood.\n\nThe great Austrian economist, Bohm-Bawerk, said that Debt is an increase in current spending in lieu of a decline in future spending. Fisher modified that a bit and he said that it ultimately depends on whether the debt is productive or not. If the debt generates an income stream to repay principal interest, then you're OK, you don’t have a down cycle later on. But unfortunately as the debt levels have risen higher, more and more of it has become consumptive in nature or financial speculation; neither of which will generate a sustaining income stream to repay principal and interest. That’s the difficulty: there’s a light side to credit and debt, and there’s a dark side.\n\nNow it’s been emphasized that business loans and consumer loans are going up this year. There have been articles about how credit standards are being lowered to make mortgages and automobile loans. The banks have confidence. And the percentage of subprime automobile loans has returned to the peak of a decade or so ago. The problem is that there’s a dark side. Martha Olney at California Berkeley wrote a book a number of years ago called Buy Now, Pay Later. You take on debt to buy now, but you have to pay later. Many presume that you never have to pay later -- but that’s a faulty assumption. That’s the difficulty that we have, and we’re trying to solve an indebtedness problem by taking on more debt.\n\nNot only is that the problem in the United States, but it’s also the problem around the rest of the world. We’re all trapped in this debt sclerosis. U.S. public and private debt is about 346%; it’s been rising now for three quarters, we no longer de-leveraging here. And the Eurozone, in all in the 17 countries there, the debt figures are a hundred percentage points higher; higher still in the UK. And then in Japan, public and private debt is about 650%. What’s significant is that the countries with the higher debt levels are performing the worst, which is very consistent with the academic studies. I mean Europe is in the process of triple dipping. Japan remains mired in difficulty; their economy declined in the first half of the year.\n\nOver-indebtedness is the basic problem. And we don’t really have a way out of it because monetary policy is not really suited to address such a problem.",
  "latent_20269": "In reporting on President Trump’s appointment of H.R. McMaster to the post of national security adviser, the New York Times referred to Lieutenant General McMaster as a “military strategist.” Precisely what this phrase is meant to convey is not entirely clear. In profiling McMaster, the Times does not credit him with having originated some Big Idea akin to Alfred Thayer Mahan’s theory of seapower or Billy Mitchell’s conception of strategic bombing.\n\nIn all likelihood, Times editors use the phrase “military strategist” loosely to mean something like “a soldier who thinks.” Or more crudely, “not a knuckle-dragger.” Or “preferable to the cretin who Trump just fired.” By conferring on McMaster the title of military strategist, the Times signals its approval.\n\nOf course, the responsibilities of the position to which McMaster now ascends extend well beyond mere military matters. The national security adviser operates—or should operate—in the realm of “grand strategy.” In this rarified atmosphere, preparing for and conducting war coexist with, and arguably should even take a backseat to, other considerations. To advance the fundamental interests of the state, the successful grand strategist orchestrates all the various elements of power. While not shrinking from the use of armed force, he or she sees war as a last resort, to be undertaken only after having exhausted all other alternatives.\n\nThis distinction between military strategy and grand strategy is more than semantic. Maintaining it is crucial to successful statecraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the case of nineteenth-century Germany. Von Moltke the Elder was a gifted military strategist. Bismarck was a master of grand strategy. The collaboration between the two, with the Iron Chancellor in the role of senior partner, created the modern German state. Once Wilhelm II handed Bismarck his walking papers in 1890, however, the distinction between military strategy and grand strategy was gradually lost. The results became apparent after 1914. In the person of Erich Ludendorff, war absorbed statecraft, with the fall of the House of Hohenzollern the least among the many catastrophes that ensued.\n\nU.S. national security policy in the present century bears more than passing resemblance to that of Germany a century ago. Our various armed conflicts, campaigns, interventions, and punitive expeditions occur on a blessedly smaller scale than the operations orchestrated by the Groβer Generalstab at Ludendorff’s behest. Yet as was true in the case of Germany, the clarity of political purpose informing our military endeavors in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 has eroded with the passage of time. Today it has been largely lost. Like German militarists in 1917, American militarists in 2017 fight on because they lack the capacity to imagine an alternative. In policymaking circles, war has become a habit.\n\nThe question is whether H.R. McMaster can play a role in breaking that habit, as President Trump in his weird, inconsistent way has suggested he intends to do. To put it another way: Can General McMaster restore the distinction between grand strategy and military strategy and re-subordinate the latter to the former?\n\nLittle reason exists to suggest that he will do so—indeed, whether he is even inclined to make the effort. That he is an accomplished practitioner of his chosen craft is unquestionably the case. McMaster is a resourceful and demanding military leader. As a field commander, he has exhibited impressive tactical skill. As a staff officer he has filled high-profile assignments both at home and abroad, winning favorable attention of General David Petraeus, among others. Like Petraeus, McMaster has demonstrated a knack for courting journalists and members of Congress.\n\nFor all that, he remains a professional soldier, not a global visionary. For the past two years, McMaster has devoted himself to contemplating about the future of the United States Army, not the future of the international order. On Russia, he appears to be a neo-Cold Warrior, favoring the recommitment of U.S. ground forces to Europe, a prospect welcomed by an army that today finds itself searching for a raison d’être. On matters ranging from East Asian stability, Israel-Palestine, Iran, nuclear weapons, climate change, and cyber-challenges, his views are less clear.\n\nMcMaster’s reputation as a thinker does not derive from his expressed views on matters of basic policy. Instead, it rests almost entirely on a book that he published as a young officer nearly two decades ago. The book (now once more rocketing to the top of the Amazon rankings) is called Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Lies That Led to Vietnam. Based on the dissertation that McMaster wrote pursuant to earning a PhD in history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, it remains today one of the most important books ever written about that benighted conflict—a savage indictment of dishonesty among top U.S. civilian and military leaders during the 1960s.\n\nOn the battlefield, McMaster has demonstrated exemplary courage in the face of the enemy. For my money, he displayed even greater courage, albeit of an intellectual sort, in publishing his book.\n\nThe story he tells is an ugly one of civil-military distrust and shared contempt. To conduct the Vietnam War on the terms they wanted, President Lyndon Johnson and defense secretary Robert McNamara sought to marginalize the Joint Chiefs of Staff, even while going through the motions of soliciting their advice. In return, the chiefs went through the motions of playing along, confident that ever deeper U.S. military involvement in Vietnam would eventually oblige Johnson and McNamara to fight the war their way. Out of this cynical exercise in mutual manipulation came a debacle that ended in costly and catastrophic failure.\n\nThe message of Dereliction of Duty was crystal clear: The Vietnam-era Joint Chiefs of Staff dishonored themselves and their profession. In doing so, they betrayed the ordinary soldiers for whose well-being they were responsible. When dealing with matters of basic policy, therefore, the paramount obligation of senior military officers is honesty—blunt, candid truth-telling.\n\nMcMaster’s book generated widespread acclaim and rightly so. For a young officer to publish such a scathing indictment of four-star generals and admirals carried career risks. But McMaster’s timing turned out to be just about perfect.\n\nBy the late 1990s, when Dereliction of Duty appeared, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their peers, all of them Vietnam veterans, were in the mood for patricide. They welcomed the criticism that McMaster heaped on their predecessors from the prior generation. After all, their war—the Gulf War of 1990-1991, in which McMaster himself had performed heroically—had been done right. So at least it seemed at the time. In the officer corps, Dereliction of Duty became required reading.\n\nThrough an ironic twist of fate, McMaster now finds himself called upon to fill the role of blunt, candid truth-teller for his generation of military officers—and to do so while serving a commander-in-chief who gives little evidence of valuing those qualities. Yet circumstances demand more than mere straight talk. Only by transcending the role of “military strategist” will General McMaster succeed in doing what duty plainly requires: identifying a course that leads away from permanent war and imparts to what remains of U.S. grand strategy a semblance of coherence.\n\nAndrew Bacevich is The American Conservative’s writer-at-large.",

  "latent_20552": "Mark Hughes reports from Baku, as the championship protagonists collide in a thriller\n\nEverything that went wrong for Daniel Ricciardo – hitting the wall in Q3, getting his Red Bull’s brake ducts blocked with debris in the early laps – were merely blessings in disguise. What they did, in combination with typically brave and incisive moves upon each of the restarts, was win him the race. A random, crazy race with three safety cars, a bit of road rage from the championship leader Sebastian Vettel against his chief rival Lewis Hamilton that lost him the win (as Hamilton later had an unscheduled stop to rectify a loose headrest) and a collision between the two Force India drivers that may in hindsight have lost them a 1-2. Pipped for second place on the line by a recovering Valtteri Bottas (who had been a solid last and a whole lap down at one point), was a remarkable result for the Williams rookie Lance Stroll, another teenage podium finisher just a year after the first.\n\nThis wasn’t a race of strategy or performance but a random one of chance where it was all about playing well the cards you’d been dealt. Ricciardo and Stroll played theirs perfectly on a day when many did not. Bottas used the crash-bang circumstances to rescue his day from his own lap one misjudgement. He was, in fact, one of several who might have won, but didn’t either because of misfortune (Hamilton, Räikkönen, Sergio Pérez, Max Verstappen, Felipe Massa) or misjudgement (Vettel, Bottas, Esteban Ocon).\n\nIt was a great spectacle but other than underlining once again how Ricciardo can pounce upon the slightest sniff of a chance to root out unlikely victories, the race probably meant little. But for the loose head restraint, Hamilton would likely have won regardless of the fortunes of the others. Of more significance to the season than the actual result was how the intensified heat and niggle between Hamilton and Vettel, Mercedes and Ferrari, has injected an edge of rancour to the 2017 contest.\n\nQualifying\n\nHamilton’s 66th pole, backed up by the other Mercedes of Bottas, with Ferrari more than 1sec adrift on the second row – by far its biggest qualifying deficit of the season to date – formed a striking picture, but was just the final playing out of a volatile set of circumstances around the highly unusual Caspian street track. The main variables were as follows:\n\nTyre performance\n\nGetting the super-sensitive 2017 tyres – here in super-soft and soft compounds – to work around such a smooth, low-grip track was proving exceptionally difficult. The circuit, which through the cobbled old town section that comprises much of the middle sector features blocks of tarmac bolted down to the usual cobblestones and which therefore doesn’t retain much of a core temperature, gains and loses heat extremely responsively according to the ambient. So Saturday morning’s practice was held on a track of 57deg C, but by the 5.48pm start of Q3, it was down to 42deg C. That completely altered the behaviour of the tyres, making setting up the cars extremely difficult – in a variety of ways differing from car to car. Even without that complication, the combination of soft and super-soft requires the biggest set-up change of all the compound transitions in Pirelli’s range. Ultra-to-super does not give much of a balance change, nor does soft-to-medium. But super-to-soft is problematic, even without volatile track temperatures.\n\nOn Friday Ferrari and Red Bull were on top of this challenge and Mercedes was struggling, Hamilton in particular – just as was the case for him on the low-grip surfaces of Sochi and Monaco in the ‘diva’ Mercedes W08. But the Mercedes engineers played a blinder between Friday and Saturday in devising a set-up that got around the worst of these traits. On a track that was generally even hotter than the day before, suddenly the Merc was switching on its tyres. For the first time this season, the Ferrari was not, for reasons not immediately apparent but more clear in hindsight (more of which later). The Red Bull was still well-balanced but had other problems that prevented it being the class of the field it had looked on Friday.\n\nPower deployment\n\nSo, with its tyre problems fixed, Mercedes could enjoy the full benefits of its still superior power harvesting and deployment. This track, at 3.7 miles, is way too long for the engines to be able to deploy full electrical power on demand for the whole lap and they will ‘de-rate’ at some points on the track. The most efficient way of spreading the available deployment is a complex equation around here, but the Mercedes seemingly retains an advantage over the other engines in its harvesting efficiency and therefore the available extra power over the lap, something that most conventional length tracks – where everyone can use the full deployment on demand – does not reveal. So along the super-long (1.4 mile) ‘straight’ that follows the coastline, the Mercedes would de-rate later than the others. Just like last year, the advantage of the Mercedes engine was exaggerated by the traits of this track, particularly when run in the highest power mode.\n\nAero conundrum\n\nWith its Monaco-like sequence of tight turns in the first and middle sector but a super-long straight, Baku offers an either/or downforce choice. Either you run Monza-like wings (like Ferrari and Red Bull) for the straight and struggle through the tight twists or you do as Mercedes did and choose higher wing levels to help you in the first two sectors and live with the penalty in the straight. It’s easier to make the Mercedes choice, of course, when you have superior power (see above). Critically, on a low-grip track, the higher downforce settings helped with turning on the sensitive tyres – perhaps partly explaining why Ferrari was suddenly struggling to get the tyres turned on. The day before they had been trialling new parts but for Saturday reverted to the Montreal spoon-profile low-downforce rear wing (and balancing front wing settings) – and that’s when it suddenly began to struggle generating tyre temperatures. Also, a shorter wheelbase car like the Ferrari invariably creates more drag for a given downforce than a longer one like the Mercedes, so further pushing Ferrari into a choice that in hindsight took it out of the one-lap tyre window.\n\nOil burning clarification\n\nDuring pre-season testing at Barcelona the FIA responded to a query from Red Bull asking if it was permitted to use oil in the combustion process. Teams use this process when they wish to have banned what they suspect another team is doing. The FIA responded at that time with Technical Directive 004-17 that quite specifically said oil burning would not be allowed. But the issue has refused to go away. Post-Canada, some cars (all with the same make of engine) were found to have anomalies and so a new directive (TD22) went out to the teams on the Tuesday preceding Baku.\n\nThe advantage of oil burning is twofold. Having the piston rings tight enough that oil stays out of the combustion chamber under power but loose enough that oil is sucked up into there by the vacuum created off-throttle allows the oil to lubricate and cool the combustion chamber off-throttle. This in turn would allow a more aggressively lean fuel mixture to be used without detonation when under power for a short burst in qualifying mode. Secondly, burning oil off-throttle would allow an improvement in fuel consumption, which could be used either to light-fuel or to have more power over the race distance.\n\nThe FIA’s Technical Directive TD22 stated. “We wish to remind you that, as previously stated in various meetings and re-emphasised in TD/004-17, we consider the use of oil as fuel to be prohibited by the Technical Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, the only fuel that may be used for combustion is petrol, and the only permitted characteristics of that petrol are clearly set out in Article 19 of the Technical Regulations. Even though the Technical Regulations do not directly specify the permitted characteristics of engine oil used in F1, we would consider any attempt to use additional components or substances in oil for the purpose of enhancing combustion as a breach of the Technical Regulations.”\n\nThe Mercedes, Renault and Honda powered cars showed no particular downturn in competitiveness…\n\nPost-red-flag dash\n\nRicciardo crashed his Red Bull into the Turn 6 barriers late in Q3, bringing out the red flags. Up to this point Bottas had been fastest, with Hamilton having set a couple of purple sector times but sliding wide at Turn 16. With a little more than three minutes remaining they all lined up at the end of the pitlane ready for a late ‘do-or-die’ dash. Much like what happened here last year. Without the time for the usual extra tyre prep lap, Hamilton nailed it perfectly, more aggressive in getting the tyres up to temperature than Bottas (whose fronts didn’t come in fully until mid-lap). “My last lap in Montreal was pretty special,” said the elated pole-winner afterwards, “but I think this one topped it… I thought maybe once I’d matched [Senna] the hunger would fade but I was hungrier than ever today.” Bottas, almost half-a-second slower, was visibly disappointed with the way the red flag had seemingly turned the tables between him and his team-mate.\n\nKimi Räikkönen, third fastest but 1.1sec adrift of Hamilton summarised it as: “The biggest issue is the tyres. It’s a bit on edge, they kind of work a little bit… if you get them working well it makes a massive difference. Today was a bit more tricky than yesterday.” They were sentiments echoed by Vettel, fourth-fastest a tenth or so behind, the difference accounted for by his having to run an old engine with 3,400 kilometres on it after his intended unit had broken and sprung a water leak in practice that morning.\n\nRed Bull under-delivered, given how quick the RB13 actually was here. Its excellent mechanical grip was paying off in the first two sectors, allowing it to retain decent grip there despite a super-skinny rear wing that helped it on the straight. Max Verstappen – quickest in both Friday practices as Mercedes struggled, but crashing at the end of the day – reckoned third on the grid was feasible, but had to be content with fifth after losing gear synchronisation part-way through the lap and having already turned the engine down after Q2 because of a rev limiter problem. Ricciardo’s crash left him down in 10th, allowing the Force Indias and Williams teams to get between his team-mate and him.\n\nSergio Pérez – another to crash on Friday – took sixth for Force India, a scant few hundredths faster than team-mate Esteban Ocon. They were 0.6sec clear of Williams, but had Lance Stroll repeated his impressive Q2 time, that would have been just 0.2sec. Following a test at Austin in the 2014 car, Stroll had arrived at a better, more Massa-like, set-up and was plenty confident around here. He was one of the few not to suffer some sort of incident and made Q3 with ease, comfortably out-pacing Massa in Q2. Once there, he was compromised by where he was when the red flags came out. Massa had to resort to used tyres for the last-moment dash and placed ninth.\n\nToro Rosso (Kvyat ahead of Sainz) took 11th and 12th ahead of Magnussen’s Haas, Hülkenberg’s electrics-compromised Renault and Wehrlein’s Sauber of those making it as far as Q2. Out in Q1 were Alonso’s McLaren, Grosjean’s Haas (horrendous braking problems again), Ericsson’s Sauber and Vandoorne’s McLaren. Jolyon Palmer took no part in qualifying, his Renault having caught fire from a fuel leak in morning practice, melting the wiring loom. The engine penalties for the McLarens (40 for Alonso, 35 for Vandoorne) put them at the back.\n\nRace\n\nThe choreography that triggered the multiple safety cars can be traced back to Vettel locking up slightly into Turn 1 as he sliced aggressively down Räikkönen’s inside. He was almost into the back of Hamilton as he did this. Keen to avoid contact with his team-mate, Räikkönen’s compromised momentum on the run up to Turn 2 played its part in Bottas trying for a gap there that tempted him to take too much inner kerb and thereby throwing the Mercedes into the Ferrari. Bottas punctured and headed slowly for the pits where he would fall a lap down. Räikkönen continued with front wing damage and was zapped by Pérez and Verstappen. Behind the damaged Ferrari ran Massa, Ocon and Stroll.\n\nA piece of Ferrari debris lodged itself into one of Ricciardo’s front brake ducts as he passed the scene, unsighted in ninth place. Over the next few laps the team watched his front brake temperatures rise worryingly high. They kept him out as long as they dared, to give the pack a chance to spread and therefore not lose him so many places, but knew it was inevitable he’d be coming in soon.\n\nHamilton had the legs of Vettel in these early stages, already almost two seconds clear at the end of the opening lap, the pair pulling ever-further clear of the dicing Pérez and Verstappen. By the time Ricciardo was brought in on lap five, Hamilton led Vettel by 3.3sec. Ricciardo rejoined on the more durable soft compound, in 17th place, the intention being now to run to the end. Only Vandoorne, Grosjean and Bottas were behind him.\n\nOn the ninth lap Kvyat – who had run wide at Turn 1 in the opening seconds and caused team-mate Sainz to spin in avoidance as he rejoined – pulled the Toro Rosso off from 12th with a sudden electrical shutdown of the Renault motor. Three laps later and Verstappen – who had been pushing Pérez hard for third – suffered another Renault failure, this time a sudden loss of oil pressure. He took it hard, coming on the back of his Canada disappointment.\n\nSafety car 1: Kvyat’s car was at an awkward place for retrieval, on the exit of Turn 12, and after some delay the safety car was deployed. This came at the perfect time for almost all the field to pit, swapping their super-softs for softs on which to get to the end. Ricciardo went the other way, exchanging the softs he’d briefly been on for the faster super-softs. They exited and circulated in a tight bunch behind the rumbling Mercedes coupe in the order of Hamilton, Vettel, Pérez, Räikkönen, Massa, Ocon, Stroll, Hülkenberg, Magnussen and Ricciardo, the latter having jumped past Alonso. A couple of laps earlier he’d passed both Sainz and Ericsson in one slipstreaming move into Turn 1.\n\nRestarts are tricky for the car in front here because the super-long straight makes them vulnerable to being slipstreamed. Hamilton played it very cannily in defence, catching Vettel by surprise after backing up the pack. Seb was forced to defend hard from Pérez into turn one. Both Massa and Ocon speared past Räikkönen while further back, Ricciardo played it perfectly in attack to jump past Magnussen, with Hülkenberg and Stroll next in his sights.\n\nSafety car 2: But before Ricciardo could attack them, the safety car was out again – this time for debris littered in several parts of the track. The cars were brought through the pits to avoid the carbon shards in Turn 1, after which the safety car prepared to come in at the end of lap 19.\n\nOnce its lights had gone out – indicating that the leader no longer needs to stay within 10 car lengths and can back off so as not to get trapped behind it before the safety car line – Hamilton stopped accelerating through Turn 15, as Vettel was tight behind him trying to avoid Hamilton getting the jump on him again. Vettel was accelerating just as Hamilton had backed off and the classic rear-end traffic accident ensued, carbon slivers of Ferrari front wing plucked off against the Mercedes diffuser. Vettel was furious, believing Hamilton had brake-tested him (data seen by the stewards confirmed he had not touched the brakes). Vettel then pulled alongside and swerved hard into Hamilton’s side in a clearly deliberate manner, daylight briefly visible beneath the Ferrari’s right-front wheel. It was an extraordinary outburst in the competitive heat of the moment, Vettel’s fierce temper revealed again, just as in Mexico last year or Istanbul 2010.\n\nHamilton was only briefly distracted and proceeded to get the jump on his rival through Turn 16 and was unopposed down to the first turn, with Pérez again attacking the Ferrari, and Massa taking a look too. Ricciardo beautifully judged another Turn 1 move, this time past Hülkenberg, as Magnussen tried also to pass the Renault. The Force Indias rubbed wheels through Turn 1 and Ocon took a look down the inside of Pérez up to Turn 2 and – just as with Bottas on Räikkönen earlier – the inner kerb threw him across the track and into the side of the other car. As the Force Indias limped out of there, Räikkönen ran over their debris, instantly puncturing his left-rear tyre. As he too headed pitwards, much of the Ferrari’s floor was destroyed, leaving a further debris trail. It looked like both Force Indias and Räikkönen would be retiring as the safety car was scrambled once more. It was at this point that Alonso suggested over the radio to race director Charlie Whiting that a red flag would probably be safer, given the amount of debris. Fernando might have been influenced in his thinking by how his down-on-power car was defenceless down the straight each time the safety car bunched up the field. Whatever, the red flag was shown and the cars queued up in the pitlane in race order. The safety cars had been particularly good news for Bottas, enabling him to unlap himself. Ferrari and Force India used the delay to rebuild their damaged cars, though inadvertently infringed the rules with Räikkönen and Pérez in where they were working on them with three minutes to go, leading to later penalties, which took them out of the running. Ocon’s damaged front suspension had been replaced and he’d be good to continue. As Räikkönen was pushed to the bottom of the pitlane in order to rejoin, he pointed out to the team that he would be needing a steering wheel! Someone was dispatched to get one and it was quickly fitted…\n\nThe stoppage had allowed Vettel’s front wing to be replaced but the stewards were meanwhile looking at his barging incident with Hamilton. With everyone now changed onto super-softs, the race got underway again behind the safety car, which pulled off at the end of the lap. With the Force Indias now at the back, Massa was in third but complaining of severe vibrations – a rear damper on the Williams had broken. This just made Ricciardo’s task even simpler as they all rushed up to Turn 1. Stroll moved down his team-mate’s inside, but the Red Bull streaked inside them both. It was effectively the race-winning move, albeit only for third place in this moment. Impressively, Ricciardo had told Helmut Marko during the delay that he’d be able to do this upon the restart.\n\nHamilton – with some slight diffuser damage from the Vettel hit – again pulled away from the Ferrari, but his upper cockpit surround and headrest panel could be seen not to be properly fixed. He tried in vain to re-attach it himself, but the team was eventually advised by race control that he must stop to have it attended to. Just as that was playing out it was announced that Vettel would be taking a 10sec stop-go penalty for his earlier road rage incident. In other words, Ricciardo would soon be leading the race from Stroll – and they weren’t words anyone had expected to be saying coming into the weekend. Massa pulled in to retire on lap 25, convinced he could have won. Hülkenberg, up to fourth, plucked off the Renault’s right-front wheel on the tricky Turn 8 wall and was out, promoting Magnussen.\n\nHamilton came in on lap 31, Vettel two laps later. The delay in fixing the Merc’s headrest meant Vettel emerged just in front after his penalty, the pair back in seventh and eighth, just more than 20sec behind the leader with 18 laps to go. As Ricciardo edged away from Stroll, Magnussen’s briefly third-placed Haas was soon passed by the recovering Ocon and Bottas (into Turn 1, with Bottas doing a double pass on the Haas and Force India), as Vettel and Hamilton closed down on them all. The Ferrari’s pace was seriously good by this stage of the race as Vettel tried everything to stay out of Hamilton’s DRS range. Alonso had been easy meat on the straight for the likes of Ocon, Bottas, Vettel and Hamilton and was soon under pressure from Sainz.\n\nVettel got by Magnussen into Turn 1 on the 39th lap, Hamilton following through into the next corner. Three laps later Vettel went by Ocon into Turn 1, getting some breathing space as it took Hamilton another lap before going around the Force India's outside there a lap later in a brave move. They were catching Bottas, but not quite quickly enough to be with him before the end. Valtteri though was on course to be up with Stroll by the last lap. The rookie had stayed impressively calm and consistent, a very different driver to just a few races ago, but it was a Williams versus a Mercedes. It was going to be very close.\n\nRicciardo went just as fast as was needed to keep temperature in his old tyres and took a remarkable victory, Red Bull’s first of the season, while Stroll was only just slipstreamed on the line for second by Bottas. Vettel set the race’s fastest lap and remained out of Hamilton’s reach to the end ahead of Magnussen, Sainz, Alonso and Wehrlein (the latter having earlier made light contact with Sauber team-mate Ericsson).\n\nDaniel Ricciardo made his in-lap giggling, “like a schoolboy.” It had been that sort of race.",

This means, that is it is possible to add a layer of software that will allow you to run 32bit software without changes to either Slackware64 or these 32bit packages. Furthermore, the multilib-enabled Slackware64 can compile 32bit binaries, if you add the right software to it. This README contains instructions on how to use the packages in this directory to create a multilib Slackware64. A more extensive documentation is available on the Slackware Documentation Wiki, http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:multilib where you will also find the main mirror locations for downloading these packages. The exciting thing about Slackware64, is that you do not have to compile all these basic 32-bit packages from scratch. You simply take them from the 32-bit Slackware package tree! Further down, I will explain how you can take a 32-bit Slackware package (say, the \"mesa\" package) and strip/re-package its content into a \"mesa-compat32\" package that you can install onto your 64-bit Slackware computer straight away. Enabling multilib ================= Fast-track (examples assume slackware64-14.2 ... change to your needs). All of the following commands should be executed as the 'root' user: * In the location where you found this README, download the subdirectory with the name that corresponds to the Slackware version you are running. For Slackware64 14.2 for instance, you would run the following command: # lftp -c 'open http://slackware.com/~alien/multilib/ ; mirror -c -e 14.2' and then change into the new \"14.2\" directory which has been created on your computer: # cd 14.2 * First, you will upgrade your 64bit Slackware gcc and glibc packages to their multilib versions by running the command: # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new *.t?z in the directory you just changed to (the \"14.2\" directory in our case). This will upgrade gcc and glibc packages, and also install a new package called \"compat32-tools\". * You are now going to install 32-bit compatibility packages to support all the 32-bit programs you may want to run (roughly 60 MB of packages, not all that much really!). These packages are located in the subdirectory called \"slackware64-compat32\" which you also downloaded with the \"lftp\" command shown above. Run this command: # upgradepkg --install-new slackware64-compat32/*-compat32/*.t?z * This procedure will also work if you already had a multilib setup and have upgraded your Slackware to a newer release (new compat32 packages will be installed and existing ones will be upgraded). * Done! You need to reboot because of the glibc upgrade. In more detail: The following packages are replacements for - not additions to - standard Slackware packages. You use the \"upgradepkg\" program to upgrade to my multilib versions of gcc and glibc. You will need these in order to run, and build, 32-bit software on your 64-bit Slackware computer: ==Slackware64 13.0== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - gcc-g++-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - gcc-gnat-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - gcc-java-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - gcc-objc-4.3.3_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.9_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.0.txz - glibc-i18n-2.9_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.0.txz - glibc-profile-2.9_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.0.txz - glibc-solibs-2.9_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.0.txz - glibc-zoneinfo-2.9_multilib-noarch-5alien_slack13.0.txz ==Slackware64 13.1== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-g++-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gnat-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-java-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-objc-4.4.4_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.11.1_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.1.txz - glibc-i18n-2.11.1_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.1.txz - glibc-profile-2.11.1_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.1.txz - glibc-solibs-2.11.1_multilib-x86_64-5alien_slack13.1.txz - glibc-zoneinfo-2.11.1_multilib-noarch-5alien_slack13.1.txz ==Slackware64 13.37== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - gcc-g++-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - gcc-gnat-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - gcc-java-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - gcc-objc-4.5.2_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.13_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-i18n-2.13_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-profile-2.13_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-solibs-2.13_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-zoneinfo-2013d_multilib-noarch-7alien.txz ==Slackware64 14.0== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-g++-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gnat-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-go-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-java-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-objc-4.7.1_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.15_multilib-x86_64-8alien.txz - glibc-i18n-2.15_multilib-x86_64-8alien.txz - glibc-profile-2.15_multilib-x86_64-8alien.txz - glibc-solibs-2.15_multilib-x86_64-8alien.txz - glibc-zoneinfo-2013d_2013d_multilib-noarch-8alien.txz ==Slackware64 14.1== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-g++-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gnat-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-go-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-java-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-objc-4.8.2_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.17_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-i18n-2.17_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-profile-2.17_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-solibs-2.17_multilib-x86_64-7alien.txz - glibc-zoneinfo-2013d_multilib-noarch-7alien.txz ==Slackware64 14.2== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-g++-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gnat-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-go-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-java-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-objc-5.5.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.23_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - glibc-i18n-2.23_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - glibc-profile-2.23_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz - glibc-solibs-2.23_multilib-x86_64-4alien.txz ==Slackware64 current== * The gcc compiler suite: - gcc-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-brig-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-g++-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gfortran-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-gnat-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-go-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz - gcc-objc-8.2.0_multilib-x86_64-1alien.txz * The GNU libc libraries: - glibc-2.29_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - glibc-i18n-2.29_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - glibc-profile-2.29_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz - glibc-solibs-2.29_multilib-x86_64-2alien.txz ======================================================================= There is one more package (compat32-tools); you install it using the \"installpkg\" program: * The compat32-tools package is a \"32-bit toolkit\" (containing scripts that facilitate the creation of 32bit packages): - compat32-tools-3.7-noarch-18alien.tgz * The above packages cover the essentials for getting ready to run and compile 32-bit software on Slackware64. But in order to be able to actually run software, you need a \"layer\" of additional 32-bit support libraries as well. These libraries are taken from standard Slackware 32-bit packages using the scripts that are part of my \"compat32-tools\" package. * You use the \"massconvert32.sh\" script for this conversion; Suppose you have downloaded a local copy of 32-bit Slackware, and it is available in the directory: /home/ftp/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2 then you would run the command: # massconvert32.sh -i /home/ftp/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2/slackware\" and the result is a number of subdirectories in your current directory, containing \"compat32\" packages which you can install directly (they will not conflict with your 64-bit packages). * You can also instruct the \"massconvert32.sh\" script to download everything you need from an external Slackware mirror, if you do not have (or do not want to download) a complete local copy of Slackware: # massconvert32.sh -u http://slackware.mirrors.tds.net/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2/slackware\" * Or if you are lazy you can just download the \"slackware64-compat32\" directory in which I provide all these converted packages for you. It is a subdirectory of the directory that contains the multilib gcc and glibc packages. Adding 32-bit programs ====================== The scripts in the \"compat32-tools\" package need some explanation. The package installs a detailed 'README' in the /usr/doc/compat32-tools-*/ directory that will help you on your way. Basically, you get three scripts to run: - /etc/profile.d/32dev.sh This is the same script that also comes with Slamd64 and which configures an environment that you need for compiling 32-bit software (by preferring the 32-bit compilers and libraries over their 64-bit versions) - /usr/sbin/convertpkg-compat32 This script takes a 32-bit Slackware package and converts it to a '-compat32' package that you can install (using \"installpkg\") on Slackware64, alongside a 64-bit version of the same software. - /usr/sbin/massconvert32.sh This script contains an internal list of essential 32-bit Slackware packages. It uses the previously mentioned \"convertpkg-compat32\" script to grab every package on its internal package list, and converts them into '-compat32' packages. You will end up with about 60 MB of packages that you must install next, using the command \"upgradepkg --install-new\". These 'compat32' packages create a 32-bit compatibility layer on top of Slackware64. The \"massconvert32.sh\" script can either download these 32-bit packages from an external Slackware mirror, or else it can use a local Slackware mirror if you have one in your LAN. Optionally you can specify an output directory for the newly created packages; by default they will be created in your current directory. Running 32-bit programs ======================= Running a 32-bit program is easy after the above system preparation - just download, install and start it. You may find that you still miss a 32-bit Slackware library; in that case, use the \"convertpkg-compat32\" script to convert the original 32-bit Slackware package and install the resulting 32bit compatibility package on Slackware64. Compiling 32-bit programs ========================= In case you need to compile a 32-bit program (wine and grub are two examples of open source programs that are 32-bit only) you first configure your shell environment by running the command: . /etc/profile.d/32dev.sh Note the 'dot' in front of the filename - that is actually part of the commandline! It will change or create several environment variables so that 32-bit versions of binaries are preferred. Once you are done compiling 32-bit software, you should logout of your root shell in order to get rid of the modified build environment. In this changed environment, you will be able to use standard SlackBuilds to build 32-bit packages for Slackware64. There's a couple of things to keep in mind: (1) You have to define the ARCH variable as 'i486' because even on your 'x86_64' computer you are compiling a 32-bit program! This is related to the triplet of '$ARCH-slackware-linux' which is normally used in the 'configure' command. (a) As an exception, you will have to compile the 'wine' package with 'ARCH=x86_64' because you will install this package directly on your multilib computer without converting to a 'compat32' package. (2) If you want to install this 32-bit package on Slackware64-multilib, you will have to convert it to a 'compat32' package: # convertpkg-compat32 -i /path/to/your/fresh/foo-VERSION-i486-BUILD.tgz # upgradepkg --install-new /tmp/foo-compat32-VERSION-x86_64-BUILDcompat32.txz Keeping your multilib up-to-date ================================ If you use slackpkg to keep your Slackware uptodate, then you may benefit from adding slackpkg+ (http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+.html), an extension to slackpkg which allows you to manage package updates, not just for Slackware, but also for 3rd party repositories which adhere to the Slackware repository format. The Multilib repository is compatible with slackpkg+, and its configuration file has instructions on how to enable multilib repository support. If you do not use slackpkg, then your best option is to keep a local mirror of the multilib repository for your Slackware version, and regularly run: # cd /path/to/multilib/slackware_version_dir/ # upgradepkg --install-new *.t?z # upgradepkg --install-new slackware64-compat32/*-compat32/*.t?z If you do use slackpkg but do not want to add slackpkg+ then you need to do the above but also take precautions so that slackpkg does not remove or replace the multilib packages. Add these lines to /etc/slackpkg/blacklist to prevent this behaviour: [0-9]+alien [0-9]+compat32 Acknowledgements ================ A lot of thanks should go to Fred Emmott, who created Slamd64, the original unofficial 64-bit fork of Slackware. Although Slackware64 was not based on Fred's work, I still learnt most of what I know about setting up the 32-bit part of a multilib Linux from his writings that are found in Slamd64. Cross Linux From Scratch. The CLFS Wiki (http://trac.cross-lfs.org/wiki/read#ReadtheCrossLinuxFromScratchBookOnline) is a 'must-read' if you want to understand how to port Linux to a new architecture. I took several ideas, concepts and patches from them when creating Slackware64 from scratch, and again when I created my multilib gcc/glibc packages from scratch (my README on this multilib-from-scratch is available in the ./source directory).

  "latent_20590": "The UN Commission on the Status of Women - a body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women – has been the subject of massive criticism for its recent decision to elect Saudi Arabia, a country notorious for its rampant violation of women’s rights, as its member. Press TV has talked to Catherine Shakdam, director of Shafaqna Institute for Middle Eastern Studies, as well as Lawrence J. Korb, former US assistant secretary of defense, to get their opinions on this issue.\n\nCatherine Shakdam believes that the election of Saudi Arabia to the UN women’s rights commission is not only an “insult” to women across the world, but also to humanity.\n\nShe also said given the fact that Saudi Arabia has been promoting the “objectification of women in the most despicable manner,” the idea of having it decide or even debate women-related issues is “completely ludicrous.”\n\nThe analyst also emphasized that the very ideology of Wahhabism “profoundly rejects\" women and their rights.\n\nShakdam further stated that electing Saudi Arabia to any council discussing human rights or women-related issues is “criminal” and “dangerous,” adding that it should be banned and criticized to the highest degree.\n\n“The United Nations is no longer an institution that people can back and recognize as being legitimate,” she said, claiming that the world body is being “bought” and “owned” by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe analyst further expressed hope that the United Nations would wake up and decide not to be owned by Riyadh and to remember the oath it took when it was created which is to protect the innocent, and to stand for international law and human rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawrence J. Korb, the other panelist on the program, said that electing Saudi Arabia to protect women’s rights does not make a great deal of sense, adding that it is going to “hurt the credibility of the UN.”\n\nHowever, according to Korb, countries which voted for Saudi Arabia to be elected to the UN Women’s Rights Commission were possibly hoping that “once the Saudis got on there, they would begin to move in the right direction”.\n\nThe analyst also agreed that the Saudis’ attitude towards women is not something to be very proud of, but predicted that given the higher percentage of educated women in Saudi Arabia today, it is going to be very hard for Riyadh to continue its current practices.\n\nKorb further expressed hope that getting on the UN council would help the Saudis realize what a “foolish” and “counterproductive” policy they are embracing with regard to women.",

  "latent_20720": "Over the years, there have been a lot of efforts to create games that make learning how to program a computer simple and fun, with widely variable results. But indie developer Primer Labs seems to have hit on something special with Code Hero, a first-person shooter that teaches JavaScript and UnityScript programming by letting players fire bits of code that actually affect the environment. The group recently reached its Kickstarter funding goal of $100,000 for the project, and is still looking for last-minute donations to help fund a multiplayer mode.\n\nDespite the name, Code Hero is much more like Portal or Minecraft than Guitar Hero, according to its creators, but \"instead of making blocks or portals, you shoot Javascript\" that executes when it hits its target. Bits of code can do anything from moving a platform down ( position.z-=2 ) to blowing up stuff ( add(ForceTransform(1000000)) ). \"Editing code is actually a lot of fun when you look at it from the perspective of a game you can play with it,\" Primer Labs' Alex Peake said in the game's Kickstarter introduction.\n\nThe team has been \"eating ramen or worse\" to make a beta version of the game, which got an amazing response at last year's Minecraft-focused Minecon convention in Las Vegas, Peake said. Despite the ambitious nature of the project, the $100,000 budget goal was designed to fund the team of four programmers and two artists for six months of work. They hit that goal with roughly two days left before tonight's funding deadline, thanks to a sudden surge of promotional interest from sites like reddit. Now the team has set a new target of $200,000 in funding so it can hire an experienced Unity developer to help create a multiplayer mode.\n\nBackers can get access to the final game with a donation of as little as $1, a price Peake says was set so low because \"we're not about the margin or the cost or the monetization—we're about the programmerization.\" The Kickstarter page laments the fact that, despite the enormous impact of computers on society and the world, \"less than 1 percent of humans can code.\"\n\nIndeed, the team can be a bit grandiose in its ambitions to change the world through its game. \"We believe in a world where knowledge becomes playable, and we believe it's not up to us to make it, it's just up to us to teach you to make the games that need making, to change the things that need changing, so we can create the world we wish to see by coding the change we wish to see in the world,\" Peake says in the video introduction.\n\nThe funding success makes Code Hero one of only a handful of game-related Kickstarter projects to raise a six-figure sum through the service, including the still-growing, $2+ million raised by Double Fine for its adventure game project. While that's still next to nothing in the world of AAA game development, it's further proof that new funding models can help bring ambitious, offbeat games to life, as long as there's a provable demand from the players.",

  "latent_21243": "Morello\n\nScruffy\n\nC3 Sound\n\nSquidmoX\n\nUdyr\n\nLyte\n\nSoraka's future Rework\n\nMorello\n\n\"Because this was something we really realized when working on Kassadin of how problematic it tends to be. There's more here, LeBlanc, Talon, etc, but we're trying to address them AS they become problems so we don't have these \"wait, wtf, why are you nerfing Talon?\" issues.\n\nSince we learn as we work on stuff, we tend to evolve our understanding of root causes on these issues over time - especially as player skill improves, and exposes things that were more manageable before.\n\nAs for the damage changes, I'll have to ask Statikk - I only was really involved in the conversation around E. That might be to lower burst and increase total damage, but I do get that it risks TankRaka being insane.\"\n\n\"Valid feedback - I think the rework needs to solve \"how does Soraka become healthy\", which is prioritized for this year unless all Hell breaks loose. These nerfs should be targeted at unfightable mid-lane, and hitting the things that make her particularly oppressive there.\n\nOne approach on these \"busted\" characters is the Kass/Grags approach we like. Nerf in the short term while we get the rework out as soon as it makes sense. Since we're actively working on a shipping plan for Soraka, this would be part of that.\"\n\nMorello\n\n\"Couldn't agree more. It's prioritized to be done this year as part of the gameplay reworks we're doing.\n\nWe really bolstered this team up in the last few months - to the point they're the same size and scope of the Champions team. This is because there's so many like Soraka that need love - and that takes a concerted effort between art, design, engineering, sound and QA. Soraka is one of the most overdue champions to us because of both healing's identity in League and how long she's been in the game.\n\n100% with you here, and acting on it as we speak. It won't be out before the next few patches, but it's in the plan for releases this year.\"\n\nMorello\n\n\"In this, we agree :)\"\n\n\"We'd like to try to make healing work - this is extraordinarily difficult to make rich or interesting to anyone but Soraka. My stance on this is still really unhopeful, but we're exploring that first.\n\nI know of non-caster models in which healing can work, but feel that violates Soraka too.\"\n\n\"\"Infuse healer\" is one of my favorite models (in GW1, this was the most interesting healer strategically). It creates windows and big moments while still feeling very \"healer.\"\"\n\n\"I'd be talking about as a rework as an infuse healer. It'd require a new kit to support (and likely a way to recover health with risk).\"\n\nMorello\n\n\"It's kind of hilarious to see what the \"intent\" argument is. There is a thing to call us out on here, and it's that we've been chicken-shits (me included) about doing this rework because we know it's not going to be \"here's a Soraka buff!\" We've remedied that :)\"\n\nUrgot needs love too.\n\nRiot Scruffy\n\n\"Just because Urgot isn't currently in progress doesn't mean we've forgotten about him. It's really the hardest thing having so many champs that need love, but we would rather do them one at a time and focus on quality rather than rush them all out too fast.\n\nWe will definitely get to him in time, keep reminding us.\"\n\nRegarding a global ult dialog for Karthus VU\n\nC3 sound\n\n\"Global dialog is something we don't do very often, outside of say, Nocturn's Ult. If he had a one word Iconic line like DARKNESS, then it may be different. However, he has many lines for the ult, and most are much longer than just 1 word. One thing to consider is that by allowing global VO, it would be subjecting other players to hear someone else's full length VO lines whether they wanted to hear them or not. We definitely hear the feedback, and will give it a round of deliberation! Thanks for the feedback everyone!\"\n\nWarning about third party skin selling sites\n\nSquidmoX\n\n\"Hi everyone - just wanted to chime in here.\n\nI work in Player Support and we see these skin sites all the time. I urge everyone here\n\nto be EXTREMELY CAREFUL before interacting with any of these sites.\n\nVery often they are scammer sites and have acquired their skin codes through illegitimate means. We see cases all the time where players give sites like this their money and then never see the skin, or worse, provide their account to the scammers and lose it forever.\n\nUse common sense, and think twice before giving your personal information to someone you don't know. :D\"\n\n\"Selling skins is a violation of our terms of use, so I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWith regards to bringing the old skins out of the vault, this happens periodically. For example, with the recent launch of the SKT skins, we brought back the TPA skins from Season 2. Ditto for Harrowing, we brought out the older skins to join Haunted Zyra.\n\nWe want these skins to feel exclusive and limited, that's why they may only be available for a limited time. They celebrate a specific point and time in League's history. Snowstorm Sivir or Lunar Goddess Diana wouldn't feel as special if you could purchase them year round. Sure we may make more money by making them more available, but we aren't about what makes the most money. We're about what creates the best experience for the players.\"\n\n\"The Championship skins were used to celebrate the World Finals for each season. Given how limited they were, I doubt they will come back.\n\nBut you have to think of it this way, if you attended Worlds last year and received your Thresh skin, how would you feel if at a later date it was just available for purchase? I do realize that this begs the question, what about those who couldn't attend Worlds. I can't promise anything, but Riot is aware of this problem and thinking about how we can create skins and content that don't alienate players.\"\n\nNo June Advance Sale Schedule\n\nUdyr\n\n[ Tweet 1 ] \"we need to look at the results from May. June will return to the previous sale announcements\"\n\n[ Tweet 2 ] \"that being said, if results from May don't show any problems, we'll hopefully switch styles\"\n\nLyte on Chat Restrictions\n\n\"The team's been monitoring the forums pretty heavily seeing if some of the early restricted chat experiments may have had some false positives; in your case, it was very easy to pull up chat logs in the past where you called players \"noobs,\" repeatedly told players to report someone, and using language like \"wtf are you doing.\"\n\nIn the games, sometimes you retaliate and act toxic towards other players who are also toxic, but just because someone else is like that doesn't make it OK for you to be. In fact, in many of these types of games, both you and that player ended up with restricted chat games because you're creating a terrible experience for the (up to) 8 other players in the game.\n\nEDIT ::: Note that there's some confusion about the above and what is considered negative. The player in question had numerous (hundreds) of examples of spamming negative language and being extremely negative in games. We try as much as possible not to simply copy-paste the worst examples of a player to not create a witch-hunt mentality.\n\nPlayers obviously are not handed a penalty just for saying the above 3 lines.\"\n\nLyte\n\n\"There were other examples that I just didn't feel like displaying. Calling someone noob or spamming report or throwing \"wtf u doing\" everywhere might not deserve a ban, but that's why the player received a few games of restricted chat and can still enjoy the game. If a person was throwing death threats out, the penalty would be different.\"\n\n\"It's a great question, and one that I think needs more context. As others have mentioned, there's a difference between \"wtf\" once in a game, and:\n\n\"wtf what are you doing\"\n\n\"wtf this yasuo noob\"\n\n\"report him pls\"\n\n\"****, do you even know how to play\"\n\n\"what the fuk, uninstall\"\n\nSecondly, those examples were just a very small (1%) of the things that were flagged. As much as possible and especially in recent months, we've tried not to copy-paste a player's chat logs or their worst offenses because it creates a witch-hunt mentality. So, when I responded to the player with some general trends, they were an average chat log--players don't need to see copy-pastes of the player's entire list of offenses.\n\nTo the original point, what do we expect out of players? Well, 95% of players were not affected by Tribunal bans, and about 95% were not affected by chat restriction experiments so far--clearly, most players are perfectly fine in matches and have no problem staying within bounds.\n\nWe're not out to get offensive language, and we don't expect players to tip-toe around or offensive language. Many players say \"****, missed that skill shot!\" or \"****, close fight, we almost had that!\" and no one gets punished for such language.\n\nEveryone that got hit by restricted chat bans recently clearly crossed the line. Whether it was the repeated nature of the language or the severity of the language, something triggered the system way beyond the norm of what your typical \"teen\" game should have.\n\n\"We'll look into revealing some context and information around some of the experiments in the future. We're trying a lot of different things while Tribunal is being upgraded, and \"automated\" was probably the wrong word to use.\n\nBy \"automated,\" we simply meant that it is possible for a penalty to be handed out more quickly after a negative action. Sometimes in the Tribunal a negative action would happen and it'd be a month before the player received a notification or feedback about it.\n\nTo give you brief glimpse into what one experiment is testing, first, we have to understand that the Reporting system is different than the Tribunal system. The Reporting system's sole job is to calculate a player's report accuracy, and a lot of fancy math has gone into the system to make sure that a report is only taken into account when it is accurate. So, if a player is a consistently negative player themselves, their reports might be worth less because the system may consider them a bad judge of others' behaviors. If a player troll reports and gets their 3 friends to troll report, the system will completely toss the reports out. All of the experiments that use reports benefit from the above system to make sure that players aren't able to just abuse someone with random reports.\n\nSecondly, we have a system that's been analyzing millions of chat logs, and become quite good at detecting whether a conversation in a game is negative or positive. I presented some of this work at the previous Game Developer's Conference. It's an interesting system because the more chat logs you feed the system, the more accurate it becomes at determining whether a player communicates more positively or negatively than the average player in League of Legends.\n\nAs you can imagine, by combining reports, Player Support reviews, the chat log analysis and in-game metrics in different forms, we can do some pretty interesting (and accurate) experiments. In addition, when it comes to the player experience, we're always quite conservative with penalties. Let's say (for today's example) that a player can have a score between 1 and 100, where 100 is super awesome and 1 is super not awesome. Even though we might all agree that players 25 and below deserve a penalty, we've set all our experiments to be very conservative initially and penalize players 5 and below (as an example) so that we can slowly gauge the accuracy of the systems before we expand the thresholds.\n\nAnyways, happy to figure out with the team which experiments would be cool to talk to players about in the future but for now, we're hoping that players are seeing an improved in-game experience.\"\n\n\"This is certainly a possibility, and something we've discussed; however, we have a lot of initial experiments in mind that we want to test out first and see what works best. If we end up needing a way for negative players to communicate with their team that isn't sufficient with the current chat restriction design, we can figure out a better solution.\n\nI think many players forget that this isn't a full mute. A lot of studies went into restricted chat design to determine what is the right amount of chat 'resources' to give a player, and if players used their chat resources only for team play, they actually can manage pretty well. The current design forces negative players to consider whether they value teamplay (and winning!) more than being verbally abusive.. and we find that most players opt to use their chat resources for positive communication and end up winning more games than they did before.\"\n\nLyte\n\n\"Happy to discuss the accuracy because after reviewing a large sampling of the initial chat restrictions, the accuracy is greater than 99.9%--meaning, we didn't need to overturn or remove any chat restrictions.\"\n\n\"Happy to go into detail about the numerous sampling methods that are used to determine the accuracy of a system. We often use methods that are far more stringent than scientists use in academia because every action we take impacts a player's experience.\n\nFor the early experiments (even way back when Tribunal first started), we reviewed and used multi-party reviews for 100% of cases. We even had numerous test-runs where multiple people had to review cases independently, then debate the cases where there were disagreements.\n\nWhy assume that we 'only reviewed a few cases?'\"\n\n\"There's a lot of reasons why something might be close to 100% accurate. I didn't say 100% because it's impossible for a system to have no errors unless we hand-checked every single case.\n\nHowever, let's say that the system only hands out penalties to 100 people at a time, and 99 of those cases are reviewed by at least 1 Player Support staff each time. In that case, if there are no false positives, we can say that the system was almost 100% accurate... or 99.9% accurate.\n\nOr, let's say that we're using a language analysis model that is highly sophisticated and analyzes millions of chat logs and determines the worst 1% of players that exhibited the most verbal abuse. If we then handed out chat game restrictions to the worst half (so the worst 0.5%) of the players, we can safely say that we probably did not have many false positives.\n\nThere's many, many ways you can have a system that's close to 100% accuracy. It all depends on the methodology and the context.\"\n\nLyte\n\n\"I think you're suggesting that if we were confident with our systems, we'd just ban players instead?\n\nWe actually use restricted chat bans because they are more effective than game bans. We find that game bans nudge a lot of players to create smurf accounts and simply shift their negative behaviors to low levels and overall, that's a worst experience for the community.\n\nDuring restricted chat design testing, we tested several variants to ensure that the typical player had enough chat resources to communicate effectively with their team. The current setup (with smart pings) is decent for team communication for most players, although we acknowledge that junglers have a bit more difficulty in the current setup.\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that many restricted chat players are actually winning more games than they were before being in restricted chat; so, I'm not as convinced as you are that the mode is hurting the rest of the team as much as you might believe.\"\n\n\"Quote:\n\nHey Lyte, I have a few questions.\n\n1. are we able to see if we're on restricted chat?\n\n2. is there a way to see where I stand as a player on the bar of toxicity? I generally try to keep it cool, but I have had my moments of retaliation or string of poor ranked games.\n\n3. do you monitor champ select chat, and is there a correlation between communication in champ select and performance in game? 1) Yes, you'll get an in-game notification and see a progress update after each game.\n\n2) No, unfortunately progress like this makes it very easy for players to \"skirt the line,\" and be negative until the point they are close to the line then drop their act until they are further from the line.\n\n3) Yes, Champion Select chat is monitored and there's definitely a correlation between level of communication in Champ Select and in-game performance of a team.\"\n\nLyte\n\n\"New Tribunal is a ways out, we're working on some experiments (like the ones mentioned here) in the mean time to test several ideas that may end up being incorporated into the new system.\"\n\nThis morning's red post collection featuresbriefly discussing the futurerework scheduled for later this year,notinghasn't been forgotten,weighing in on the idea ofUlt's VO lines being global,with a warning on 3rd party skin selling sites,confirming no advance June sale schedule, anddiscussing the recent wave of chat restrictions.Continue reading for more information! hoped on the forums to chat about the 4.8 changes to's & her future rework.He started off by explaining why her silence needed changes.He continued , mentioningrework ( which has been mentioned in the past ) is tentatively scheduled for later this year:In another thread directly asking about a rework for Soraka,In response to comments that \"everything needs to change\" aboutHe continued , talking a bit about keeping her focused on healing:Later he commented on an \"infuse healer\", a model where the healer transfers HP to another target instead of only a heal.He continued As for ill feedback that Riot wantsto \"slowly die\",When asked aboutexclusion from the \" Champion Update...

(NASA)\n\nIt is a much-maligned rocket, derided for its high cost and criticized for its foreign-made engine. It is caught up in a congressional fight that gets uglier by the week and has now touched off a high-profile Pentagon investigation.\n\nAnd yet when the Atlas V is fully fueled and on the launch pad, it is all business and routinely reliable, delivering its fiery thrust liftoff after liftoff. Late Tuesday night, it continued to bolster its impressive box score, launching the 62nd consecutive time without a failure, the 106th straight successful launch for the United Launch Alliance.\n\nAside from the statistics, Tuesday’s launch, under contract from NASA, was an important one. It put an Orbital ATK Cygnus spacecraft into orbit, en route to the International Space Station, where it will deliver food, supplies and science experiments, including “gecko grippers,” which would study how gecko-like adhesives could work in space.\n\nIt was the second time the Atlas V came to the rescue for Orbital ATK, which saw its Antares rocket blow up in late 2014. While a new Antares is being developed, Orbital ATK has relied on ULA to launch its spacecraft to orbit. And those successful flights have helped restore confidence in NASA’s decision to contract out the cargo resupply missions to the station.\n\nBut Tuesday’s launch came on the same day the Pentagon inspector general announced it would investigate the national security contracts that have been ULA’s lifeblood. Meanwhile, ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is staring down the great disruptive force known as Elon Musk, who threatens to eat into its business. Musk’s SpaceX won the right to compete against the ULA for the lucrative national security launch business, ending ULA’s years-long monopoly on the missions.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has also taken aim at the company, attempting to limit the use of the Russian-made engine that powers the Atlas V. He believes that the United States should not have to rely on the Russians to launch national security payloads, such as communications and intelligence satellites, at a time when there is heightened tension between the two countries.\n\nNot everyone at ULA appreciated the senator’s efforts, and one let it be known at a recent talk, which was recorded and posted on the Internet. During his presentation, Brett Tobey, an engineering executive, said that McCain “basically doesn’t like us” and that the Pentagon was “trying to figure out, how do we silence McCain?”\n\nHe also added that the Pentagon was upset that ULA did not bid on a recent contract after it had “bent over backwards to lean the field to our advantage.”\n\nThat touched off a firestorm, with McCain calling on the Pentagon to investigate. Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter referred the matter to the IG, which said Tuesday that it had launched an investigation that would seek to determine whether the contracts for the launches were “awarded in accordance with” federal regulations.\n\nTory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, said the comments “were not aligned with the direction of the company, my views, nor the views I expect from ULA leaders.” And Tobey quickly resigned.\n\nAn hour before midnight Tuesday, however, the Atlas V seemed unaware of all the controversy swirling around it. And when mission control counted down from T-minus 10, it did what it has so many times before, launched without failure or delay, as ULA’s executives cheered it on.\n\nShe's screaming down range at 3000 mph — Tory Bruno (@torybruno) March 23, 2016\n\nIt's what we live for https://t.co/10YaJea3pt — Tory Bruno (@torybruno) March 23, 2016",

  "latent_21702": "Sarah Jeanette Connor[1] is a fictional character in the Terminator franchise. She is one of the main protagonists of The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator Genisys, as well as the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The character develops from a timid damsel in distress victim in the first film to a wanted fugitive committing acts of terrorism, and a hardened warrior and mother who sacrificed everything for her son's future and is on the verge of losing touch with her own humanity. As of the fifth film, she is reimagined as a young, headstrong heroine determined to take control of her own destiny.\n\nSarah was portrayed most notably by Linda Hamilton in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day; as well as by Emilia Clarke and Willa Taylor as a younger Sarah Connor in Terminator Genisys and by Lena Headey in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.\n\nTerminator film series [ edit ]\n\nVery little is known about Sarah's life prior to May 12, 1984. The Terminator does not specify her age or birth date, although according to the original script (available on the Special Edition DVD), she was 19 years old. The film was primarily set on May 12–14, 1984; according to the script, her birth date would be between May 15, 1964, and May 11, 1965.[citation needed]\n\nIn Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah's psychologist states she is 29. The film takes place when John (born February 28, 1985) is 10, placing Sarah's birth date between March 1, 1965, and February 25, 1967, making her either 17, 18, or 19 during The Terminator. Many of the franchise's hardcore fans and writers of \"Terminator\" novels have speculated Sarah's exact date of birth is November 13, 1965, because this date is compatible with her given age in The Terminator and her stated age by the end of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles in the final episode \"Born to Run\".[citation needed]\n\nThe tombstone shown in Terminator 3 reads 1959–1997. This birth year would make her 24 or 25 during The Terminator. She and John were living \"off the grid\" in her adult years, routinely using false names, birthdates, inter alia. Her tomb was really a weapons cache. She dies of leukemia sometime after \"Judgment Day\" (August 29, 1997). Terminator 3 changes John's age in the second film from 10 to 13, introducing contradictions in the films' dating that cannot be reconciled to one timeline.\n\nIn Terminator Genisys, Sarah was 9 in 1973, which would make her 19 or 20 during the events of the first and the fifth films, and would place her birth sometime in 1964.\n\nThe Terminator [ edit ]\n\nIn The Terminator, Sarah Connor is a Los Angeles college student and waitress who is pursued by a relentless android killer, the Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Model 101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). She learns she is in danger from a televised report of two identically-named Los Angeles women who were shot to death earlier that day. She is rescued from the Terminator by time-travelling soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who says in the future an artificial intelligence called Skynet will be created by military software developers to make strategic decisions.\n\nThe program becomes self-aware, seizes control of most of the world's military hardware (including highly advanced robots), and launches an all-out attack on human beings. John Connor eventually leads the remnants of the world's military and survivors, The Resistance, to victory, only to discover Skynet had invented a means of time travel and sent an android killer back in time to destroy John Connor's mother before he is born. John Connor is Sarah's future son; he sends back a trusted sergeant, Kyle Reese, to protect his mother. During their brief time together, Sarah falls in love with Kyle, who tells Sarah she would be responsible for training John in the skills and tactics he would use to fight Skynet.\n\nKyle protects Sarah from the Terminator and they flee together. Initially, she is unaware that Reese has been in love with her. While they are avoiding the Terminator, Kyle and Sarah have sex that results in John's conception. Kyle dies fighting the Terminator in a Cyberdyne factory. Sarah crushes the Terminator in a hydraulic press. Kyle's sincerity and courage inspires her to develop the skills and abilities that make her a suitable mentor and teacher to John. After these events, Sarah becomes a fugitive and begins making a voice recording for John to give to him later in life. While recording the tape, a boy takes a photograph that he sells to her; John will give this to Kyle in the future.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day [ edit ]\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is set eleven years after the events of The Terminator. Sarah and her son John (Edward Furlong) have been separated; John is now ten years old and living in a foster home with Todd and Janelle Voight, and Sarah has been institutionalized. In the years between the films, she has become a muscled, ferocious warrior. After the death of Kyle Reese, Sarah takes his warnings and the responsibility of raising her son to heart. Her fixation on the disaster and her fanatical desire to keep John safe has made her mentally unstable and very violent, which is aggravated by her fear and hatred of the T-800. She lives off-grid to protect herself and John. Sarah lived as an outlaw and tried to teach her son the skills he would need to lead the resistance. She is captured and sent to hospital after trying to blow up a computer factory. Several times at the hospital, she has tried to improve her behavior in hope of getting to see her son, but her caregivers do not believe her. Her activities and claims of fighting evil robots from the future led to her being deemed incurable.\n\nSarah only seemed to confirm the judgment of psychiatrists by committing acts of violence against hospital staff. She tries to escape multiple times; during her final escape attempt, Sarah encounters two Terminator models; the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a liquid metal android sent back to kill her son; and the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) that was sent back by John's future self (Michael Edwards) to protect them. When she initially encounters the T-800, she flees in terror and is almost captured by the hospital staff, but she goes with the android. They escape in a police car after knocking the driver unconscious. Sarah finds it nearly impossible to accept the T-800 is benevolent; throughout the film she remains hostile towards it. John develops a bond with it, resembling a father-son relationship. In the director's cut of the movie, Sarah has an opportunity to destroy the machine's CPU. She nearly does so but John persuades her they need its help.[2] While in Mexico, Sarah loses her hostility towards the machine.\n\nAfter having a nightmare about Judgement Day occurring, Sarah tries to murder Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), a computer researcher who works at Cyberdyne Systems and is destined to build the microprocessor that will become Skynet. In doing this, she loses touch with her humanity, becoming similar to the Terminator itself. She finds she cannot kill Dyson in front of his family. Shortly afterwards, John and the T-800 arrive; they and Sarah persuade Dyson to stop his research and destroy all recovered remnants of the first Terminator. After the T-1000 is defeated, the T-800 lets itself be destroyed with the help of Sarah despite John's protests. Sarah gains respect for the T-800 and offers her hand in friendship before its final sacrifice. Because of this event, Sarah looks to the future with renewed hope.\n\nAlternate ending [ edit ]\n\nThe alternate ending for Terminator 2: Judgment Day available on the Ultimate Edition DVD and the Skynet Edition Blu-ray shows Sarah alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is an elderly grandmother and John is a Senator in a world in which Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines [ edit ]\n\nIn Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Sarah Connor has died from acute myeloid leukemia in 1997 after a three-year battle with the disease. She is mentioned by John (Nick Stahl) and the T-850 (Schwarzenegger). She lived long enough to see the 1997 \"Judgment Day\" pass without incident, and was cremated in Mexico where her ashes were spread out to the sea. Never truly believing they had beaten Skynet, her friends store a cache of weapons in a casket for John to find in the event that Judgment Day was not averted and the Terminators returned, in accordance with her will.\n\nTerminator Salvation [ edit ]\n\nLinda Hamilton reprised her role as Sarah Connor in voiceovers warning of the future war in the form of taped recordings for John (Christian Bale) delivered throughout Terminator Salvation.[citation needed]\n\nTerminator Genisys [ edit ]\n\nIn Terminator Genisys, Sarah is portrayed by Emilia Clarke. The film's director Alan Taylor's daughter Willa plays Sarah's nine-year-old self. The story takes place in an alternate reality to the continuity of the first four films due to Skynet's (Matt Smith) actions throughout the timeline.[citation needed] Therefore, Clarke's Sarah is an alternate timeline variant of her counterpart portrayed by Linda Hamilton. However, Clarke briefly portrayed the original timeline version of Sarah via a photograph in 2029 prior to the timeline's alteration.\n\nAs the result of Skynet sending a T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun) to an earlier point in Sarah's life in 1973 in an attempt to eliminate John Connor, Sarah is nine when her parents are killed by it during camping at Big Bear Lake. Sarah is found and raised by a reprogrammed T-800 Model 101 (Schwarzenegger) sent by an unknown party to be her guardian after her escape.[3] Clarke's Sarah integrates elements of both Linda Hamilton's portrayal and Edward Furlong’s portrayal of John in Terminator 2: Judgment Day; young Sarah teaches the android, which she calls the Guardian, how to be more human and forms an emotional bond with the T-800, regarding it as a surrogate father after her parents' deaths.\n\nAfter the T-1000's attack, Sarah learns from the Guardian of her assailant's motive and about her destiny as John Connor's (Jason Clarke) future mother and the Resistance's war against Skynet. After learning that her counterpart trained herself as a formidable warrior after the events in the original timeline's 1984, Sarah is fascinated by her variant and instructs the Guardian to train her to receive the skillset to match her parallel in her preadolescent age. However, Sarah also despises her alternate self because of her counterpart's role in John Connor's conception and hates living under her shadow. Because she was trained in combat since childhood, Sarah is not helpless by the time she turned nineteen in addition she is headstrong, assertive, and audacious. She is not dependent upon Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) after his arrival from the original future timeline, but rather is fighting alongside with him. With the help from the Guardian and Reese, Sarah lures the T-1000 into a trap filled with hydrochloric acid. Sarah initially resents her relationship with Kyle being dictated by fate, she gradually falls in love with him. She also questions John Connor's morality; she is aware that, in the original timeline, her alternate future son deliberately sent his own father back to ensure his own existence at the cost of Kyle's life (not knowing that John was following his mother's instruction), and thus causing Sarah to be afraid of John's character and not trusting him. Because of her training, Sarah gains extensive knowledge of Skynet, and replicates its time machine with her mentor. Despite having destroyed the T-1000, Sarah plans to time travel and destroy Skynet in retaliation for it sending the T-1000 and the original Terminator (Brett Azar with Schwarzenegger's digitally de-aged face). She sees averting Judgment Day as the ideal alternative preferably than conceiving John with Reese, despite knowing her alternate future son was a savior in the original timeline's post-apocalyptic future.\n\nDiscovering the date of Skynet's initial attack has changed from 1997 to 2017, Sarah and Kyle travel 33 years into the future to stop Skynet; they fight to avert its impending rise, and against an alternate version of John—who has been compromised by Skynet and changed into a nanocyte-cyborg T-3000—with the help of the Guardian. Sarah's encounter with the T-3000 reinforces her notion that John is corrupt, rather being his enemy than to be his mother. After John's defeat and the prevention of Skynet from spreading to every computer servers worldwide, the trio prepares to face an unknown future, unaware that Skynet is now self-aware in Cyberdyne's underground facility.\n\nTerminator 6 [ edit ]\n\nWith the rights to revert to series creator James Cameron in 2019 production is under way for a stand-alone sequel to be produced by Cameron and directed by Tim Miller. Linda Hamilton is set to return to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in the film.\n\nTerminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles [ edit ]\n\nIn the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, an alternate sequel to the first two films, Lena Headey portrays Sarah Connor. This version of Sarah is an alternate future version of her film series counterpart; her appearances in the first two Terminator films are considered part of this continuity.\n\nProduction background [ edit ]\n\nIn November 2005, 20th Century Fox announced that it would produce a television series called Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles featuring the adventures of the title character and her son in the years after Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[4] In November 2006, it announced that Lena Headey had been chosen to play Sarah.[5] The choice of Headey was criticized by several fans and critics, who said she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular character portrayed by Hamilton.[6] The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times,[6] The Boston Herald,[7] and The Guardian,[7] as well as in online forums.[7]\n\nSeries creator Josh Friedman auditioned over 300 actress for the role; he said he was looking for was someone \"who embodied that spirit and who was believable in that role and not just some glammed up, Hollywood, actressy thing\".[8]\n\nAfter a friend recommended English actor Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape and thought she was \"a tough, tough woman\".[8] Having seen The Terminator when she was a teenager,[9] Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character; she said, \"Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and see it with fresh eyes\".[10] When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said, \"I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way I would play that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her ...\"[11]\n\nFirst season [ edit ]\n\nIn 1999, four years after the events of the second film, Sarah and John Connor are living undercover after being blamed for the murder of Miles Dyson and is engaged to paramedic Charley Dixon. Fearing discovery and the certainty of a stable life, they flee again. On his first day in his new school, John is attacked by a T-888 Terminator posing as a substitute teacher called Cromartie. He escapes with the help of Cameron Phillips, a Terminator that resembles a teenage girl, sent back in time by the future John to protect him. Sarah hears of the shooting and rushes to the school but is captured by Cromartie, who uses her to lure John into a trap. Again with the help of Cameron, they flee to a bank where resistance members have hidden the parts of a time machine. As Cromartie attacks them, the trio disappear into the year 2007.\n\nCameron suggests to Sarah their primary mission should be to stop Skynet, estimated to go online in 2011. Sarah argues against this, but Cameron tells her she would have died from cancer in 2005. The three characters try to evade discovery and find the origins of Skynet. In the third episode of the series, Sarah seeks to avoid getting cancer; she trains her body and takes vitamins and medications.\n\nSarah's relationship with Cameron has been repeatedly antagonistic and they share a mutual distrust. As Sarah attempts to teach Cameron the value of a human life, Cameron argues the importance of their mission to thwart Skynet's creation even if killing is necessary. During battles with Terminators programmed to kill the Connors, Sarah and Cameron often find themselves working together. Also, since Cameron is the only other person who knows of her cancer situation, Sarah often approaches her for advice in the matter.\n\nIn the episode \"Queen's Gambit\", she discovers that her dead lover Kyle Reese has a brother named Derek, who is also a time-travelling Resistance agent. She hopes to save Derek from being klilled by androids. Sarah tells John about his true identity and he seeks help from her former fiancé Charley Dixon to save his uncle's life. Despite her knowledge of his connection to Kyle, Sarah continues to distrust Derek because she is aware that he killed Andrew \"Andy\" Goode, one of the creators of Skynet. Despite their mutual distrust, there is some attraction between them.\n\nSecond season [ edit ]\n\nIn the second season, Sarah worries about contracting and dying of cancer. She meets John's new friend Riley Dawson, and is concerned their friendship risks the family's safety from Skynet and Riley's safety. Sarah and Derek help Charley rescue his wife from Cromartie, but she dies in a bomb explosion. Sarah shelters a young boy named Marty Bedell who is being hunted by a T-888 because he shares his name with a future high-ranking member of the human resistance. An attack from Margos Sarkissian leaves John traumatized. Sarah takes the blame of Sarkissian's death for John, which Derek and Cameron later discover when John and Sarah argue. their relationship changes; John cannot let go of his guilt for killing Sarkissian; Sarah realizes that she cannot always protect her son. She seeks counseling from family psychiatrist Boyd Sherman but discovers his role in Skynet's future.\n\nSarah is kidnapped by Cromartie, but she is rescued by John and James Ellison, an FBI agent who was earlier determined to bring her to justice. Along with Derek and Cameron, they plan to lure Cromartie into a nearby church; they kill and bury it and plan to destroy it later. Sarah smashes its CPU; her stress after the battle results in nightmares and sleepwalking. She visits Dr. Sherman again but is unable to be honest with him. Sarah remembers seeing a three-dotted symbol in her dreams. She has seen this before; it was left by a dying Resistance soldier in her basement. Her obsession with the symbol leads her to Dakara Systems, a technology company whose logo includes it. There, Alexander Agagi II is developing an artificial intelligence program named \"Emma\". Realizing she has been chasing the wrong lead, Sarah's stress becomes uncontrollable and she smashes mirrors in her bathroom. Derek thinks Sarah is losing her sanity.\n\nAt a UFO convention, which Sarah attends to investigate the three-dotted sign, she meets a woman named Eileen, who is really Alan Park, a scientist who specialized in Light Detection and Ranging. Fearing for his life he underwent sex reassignment surgery. He thinks he is being targeted by his former employer, and that drone sightings in the Mojave Desert are a government conspiracy. Sarah takes him to a hypnotherapist named Dr. Barbara Morris, to unravel his memories to reveal the location of the facility. An assassin arrives during the session and murders Morris and Park. Sarah has recorded the session; Park's clues lead her to a warehouse. As she entered the building, she finght and apparently kills a man named Ed Winston, who has wounded her leg. Inside the warehouse, she sees three bright dots in the sky; they are hauls of a Hunter-Killer craft from the future. She kidnaps and forces a doctor to remove the bullet from her leg, and then tells Derek to destroy the evidence of her hospitalization to prevent the authorities and the machines from learning her identity and tracking her. After Derek finds her, Sarah decides to tell him about his relation to John, but he already knows. The family arrives at a company town, Charm Acres, looking for survivors of the warehouse explosion. At the end of their search, Sarah, John, Derek and Cameron see the Hunter-Killer drone.\n\nEd Winston has survived being shot by Sarah. Following a lead from Charm Acres, Sarah visits the factory where Winston kidnapped her and subjected her to hallucinogenic drugs to find out why she bombed the factory and the identities of her accomplices. After enduring Winston's physical and psychological torments, Sarah breaks free and attacks and shoots him in the head, killing him. She is arrested by the police, beaten up and taken to jail.\n\nSarah is rescued from jail by John and Cameron; she accompanies them to go see the T-1001 impersonating Catherine Weaver, where it is suggested that she is building something like Skynet, hoping to defeat it. Before Sarah can find out more, the prototype Hunter-Killer assaults the building and the group escape. In the building's basement Cameron gives her A.I. chip to Weaver's creation, which is now stored in the exhumed body of Cromartie, who takes it into the future. John finds Cameron's empty shell lying in the basement and a repeating message on the computer monitors reading, \"I'm sorry, John\". John discovers he cannot let her go. In an attempt to save both Cameron and Weaver's creation, both John and Catherine go to the future after the Cromartie shell, while Sarah remains in the present to continue the fight.\n\nAttraction [ edit ]\n\nT2-3D: Battle Across Time [ edit ]\n\nLinda Hamilton reunited with James Cameron and other cast members from Terminator 2 to produce this theme park attraction for Universal Studios. In the attraction, set 6 years after the events of the second film, Sarah and John break into Cyberdyne Systems during a presentation by Kimberley Duncan to prevent the creation of Skynet. However, the T-1000, once again portrayed by Robert Patrick, follows them and nearly kills them. Seconds before their deaths, they are saved by the T-800, once again portrayed by Schwarzenegger. Then, Sarah sends John and the T-800 to the future to destroy Skynet itself while she stays behind to finish blowing up Cyberdyne. The T-1000 follows them. Eventually, John and the T-800 finish their task in the future, and John returns to Sarah in the present. During production, James Cameron states that Sarah is killed by the T-1000, which is why the T-1000 was able to follow them into the future.

At the moment they are charged tariffs when they import electricity into their home or export it back to the grid.\n\nThe government has realised that this rule must change because it deters people from using power more flexibly in a way that will benefit everyone.\n\nThanks to improvements in digital technology, battery storage and renewables, these innovations in flexibility are already under way with millions of people across the UK generating and storing electricity.\n\nThe new rules have been designed to cash in on this.\n\nThe government will set up a \"battery institute\" to fund firms seeking major breakthroughs in battery research and development.\n\nIts critics say it has been slow to support the burgeoning battery industry - and has allowed South Korea, Japan and China to take a lead.\n\nThe tiny energy savings of millions of people and firms will be pulled together into packages by traders, who will offer substantial chunks of energy saving to the National Grid at the click of a computer.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Under the new system you should be able to tell your machine to do the washing when the sun comes out, to take advantage of solar power\n\nSo instead of predicting peak demand then building power stations to meet it, energy managers will be able to trade in Negawatts - negative electricity.\n\nIn a speech made in Birmingham, Business Secretary Greg Clark outlined further a £246m investment in the UK's industrial strategy, with energy at its heart.\n\nHe gave details of a competition for innovation in battery technology, which he says will help make the UK a world leader in battery design and manufacture.\n\nNicola Shaw, executive director of National Grid, previously told BBC News that between 30% and 50% of fluctuations on the grid could be smoothed by households and businesses adjusting their demand at peak times.\n\n'Moment of change'\n\n\"We are at a moment of real change in the energy industry,\" she said.\n\n\"From an historic perspective, we created energy in big generating organisations that sent power to houses and their businesses.\n\n\"Now we are producing energy in those places - mostly with solar power.\"\n\nAn Ofgem source told BBC News the current rules on trading energy are not fit for the digital age because they often discourage people using energy flexibly.\n\nThe rules were made before the digital revolution and before the boom in variable renewable energy.\n\nHacking fears\n\nIndustry figures talk about the seismic change that's sweeping them along.\n\nAt a recent UK conference, energy managers were asked which of them could foresee the shape of the industry in a decade; only half a dozen people raised their hands.\n\nSome will urge a degree of caution amongst the enthusiasm: the more the energy industry embraces the digital age, the more vulnerable it will be to hacking.\n\nRecent reports suggest that Russian hackers may already have tried to compromise the system.\n\nOfgem says the new rules will put measures in place to combat interference.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nWhen it was his turn to ask a question at Tuesday’s Senate hearing on Stand Your Ground laws, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his voice and spoke cautiously about the pain Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, must feel. But then he got to his point. Addressing Fulton, who had traveled from Florida to express her opposition to the spread of these laws, Cruz sought to downplay the significance of her message.\n\n“I understand, for the family, you’re simply mourning the loss of your son, and I understand that,” he said, “but there are other players that are seeking to do a great deal more based on what happened that Florida night.”\n\nCruz, his Republican colleagues, and the witnesses they’d summoned before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, had a different point to make: Stand Your Ground laws—which allow a person to kill another if he feels his life is endangered—benefit black people if you hold the data up to the light and squint a little. And those who would say otherwise are using race as a cudgel to force through their anti-gun agenda. “With whom do we stand?” Cruz asked. “I for one believe we should stand for the innocent against aggressors.”\n\nCruz, who threatened a filibuster to block gun control legislation in the Senate last spring, argued that Stand Your Ground laws actually help black people, because black defendants are more likely to have a killing ruled justifiable by a jury. (Black defendants who cited SYG were successful 55 percent of the time, according to Cruz’s statistics; white defendants who made the same claim were successful in 53 percent of the cases.) Fulton and Lucia McBath, another witness whose son, Jordan Davis, was shot by a man who is expected to claim the Stand Your Ground defense, had plenty of evidence to the contrary, but Cruz and his allies talked right past them.\n\nJohn Lott, a pro-gun researcher who has chided President Barack Obama in the pages of National Review for failing to speak out against black-on-white violence, offered more data to support Cruz’s theory that blacks gain from SYG laws. “If you’re going to concentrate on the fact that relatively few people who kill blacks are going to be convicted, you have to realize that most of those people who aren’t being convicted are blacks,” he said. “Ninety percent of blacks who were killed in cases where Stand Your Ground was invoked as a defense were killed by other blacks.” Lott was suggesting that the limited data available could be read to suggest that African Americans were benefiting from SYG laws.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), who was appearing as a witness, started off his prepared remarks by informing the room that he had once defended a black man who was being tried for murdering “an unarmed naked man.” But he didn’t present any statistics to back up Cruz’s argument.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and witnesses, however, cited studies from Texas A&M University and the National Urban League that highlighted the stark racial disparities in Stand Your Ground laws and picked up on what Cruz missed: The greatest determining factor in whether your SYG claim will hold up is the race of the victim. According to a study commissioned by the National Urban League, homicides were “justifiable” in 49 percent of cases in which a white man shot a black man compared to just 8 percent of cases in which the roles were reversed. Other studies have found similar results. Here’s a chart that John Roman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, created using data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation:\n\nTuesday’s hearing was originally supposed to be held on September 17, but was postponed because of the mass shooting at Washington Navy Yard. A hearing on gun laws, bumped because of a mass-murderer with a gun. That’s not a metaphor, just a thing that happened.",

  "latent_22293": "\"How long have you been this way?\" my mother asked. I was 18, and she'd just discovered that I'd been pretending to go out with my friend Courtney when in reality I was seeing a boy named Jason, whom I'd met in college.\n\n\"I've always been this way,\" I said, red-faced and sniffling.\n\n\"That's not true,\" she responded. She asked if there was somewhere else I could go.\n\nShocked, I asked, \"Are you throwing me out?\"\n\nMy dad stepped in and said, \"We're not throwing you out.\"\n\nBut they proceeded to ban me from leaving the house except to go to school. I was allowed no contact with my friends. She took away my phone and my car keys. When Jason called a few days later, he was told to never call again.\n\n\"From now on you'll act normal,\" my mother said. \"From now on you'll be normal.\"\n\nFor weeks afterward, my mother sat on the couch, wrapped in a quilt, and didn't say a word to me. Every night of my life until that point, she'd told me that she loved me before she went to bed. That night she didn't. A year passed before she told me that she loved me again, but by then I'd learned that a parent's love could be conditional.\n\nAs the years passed, our relationship fell into a routine. Twice a year I fly home and stay for a week. We sit in different rooms, watching different TV shows. When she drives me to the airport, she cries and says she wishes I would stay.\n\nShe and I speak on the phone three times a week so that she can be assured that I'm not \"lying dead in a ditch somewhere.\" Three times a week we hash over repeated themes. Work. The weather. Our family. We've unconsciously agreed that these are the safe subjects. The comfortable ones.\n\nAs traumatic as coming out was, I thought that once I was out, there'd be no more evasions or duplicity. I could finally be myself. But the opposite was true. When I came out as a teenager, she made it clear that she didn't want to hear about that part of my life. So I grew accustomed to changing pronouns and omitting big chunks of my history when I related it. Romances. Relationships. Heartbreaks. Friendships. Dreams.\n\nEven now, nearly 17 years later, I can say, \"Carlos and I went out for breakfast.\" But I can't say, \"Carlos is my boyfriend.\"\n\nLast year I met Carlos' parents and was shocked by the contrast. They are warm and welcoming. He held my hand in front of them and called me \"babe.\" They hugged me and took a family picture with me in it. The whole visit I was bewildered, because all I could do was imagine my own family, dour and rigid. It is impossible to imagine them meeting Carlos, much less accepting him with open arms.\n\nHis mother sends me Christmas presents and asks after me, and my own mother can't even acknowledge his existence.\n\nHe brings me so much happiness, and I want to share that with the people who raised me. But after years of silence, I didn't even know how to bring it up. So I sent my mom a picture book. Photos of how he and I met. Our friends. The vacations we've taken. The two of us hiking. Eating. Him waiting for me at the finish line when I ran the Seattle Marathon. Anniversaries. A photo of us smooching. Eyes closed. Smiling.\n\nI sent the book with a handwritten inscription that said I hope one day we'll be able to talk about all of my life, and not just the part that she is comfortable with.\n\nI found myself in the awkward position of coming out a second time. I thought that if the world could change so much in those 17 years, then surely my mother could, too. I thought if she could see what my life was like, the other half that we don't speak about, then maybe it wouldn't be so alien. Maybe we could actually have a real conversation about something meaningful. Maybe she could see me, all of me, and have the opportunity this time to accept me.\n\nFor weeks I waited for a response, but she didn't say anything.\n\n\"So I got your book,\" she says, finally, during one of our Sunday conversations.\n\n\"Isn't it cool?\" I ask, happy that she finally brought it up. I hold my breath, nervous about how she's going to answer.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" she says. I can hear the miles between us. The pastures and farmland. The highways and dirt roads. The cities and skyscrapers. \"You're an adult, and you can live your life any way you want, but I don't want to know about it.\"\n\n\"But I want to be able to share who I am with my family,\" I say, feeling as if I've been punched.\n\n\"I've got enough stress right now,\" she responds. \"I just want things to keep going the way they are.\"\n\nSo that was that. I don't hold her narrow-minded ideals against her. I don't know how hard it must be for a parent in a small, rural Texas town to raise a gay son. What disappoints me is that her attachment to these ideals is more important to her than having a meaningful relationship with her only child.\n\nThis time, when we end our conversation, she says, \"I'll call you Tuesday... I love you.\"",

  "latent_22654": "Neural Nets + VR = Magic!\n\nSam Snider-Held Blocked Unblock Follow Following Nov 1, 2017\n\nA gif demonstrating how a Convolutional Neural Network can be used for a VR level editor type interface.\n\nSeriously … It’s like Harry Potter.\n\nTLDR; video here.\n\nA while back, I wrote my first blog post in series about the intersection of AI, Creativity, and 3D content generation. This blog post is a continuation of that series.\n\nMy dream VR application is ultimately a seamless extension of my imagination. Sure it’s a lofty goal, but it is my intuition that machine learning techniques can help make this idea a reality.\n\nSpecifically, this blog post explores the use of convolutional neural networks to dramatically change interaction design in VR.\n\nDesigning VR in VR\n\nAnyone that has designed a VR application will tell you that working in traditional 2D mediums will only get you so far. In order to make VR, you need to be in VR.\n\nHowever, since VR is such a new medium, the industry supporting VR creation is also new. Companies like Unity and Epic are creating VR level editors, however they end up feeling just like VR desktops, menus upon menus entrenched in design principles for 2D mediums.\n\nA demonstration of a VR editor.\n\nFor me, the process of creating a VR environment in real time needs to be fast and effortless. But how do we create such a system without making use of 2D menus?\n\nWhat if we could draw what we wanted? What if instead of having to navigate through a series of options, the system can understand what I need?\n\nEnter Machine Learning\n\nIf you think about it, by entering into a VR environment, everything you do within that environment is being translated into data. Everything you look at, every twitch of your arm, every action you take can potentially be recorded.\n\nDystopian cyberpunk ramifications aside, this is quite compelling from a ML standpoint because what any ML model needs is lots of quality data. For the purposes of this blog post we’ll be looking at how convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be used for gesture recognition designed to replace current 2D menu design principles.\n\nCNN’s have a remarkable ability to recognize data that has any sort of spatial relationship, i.e. images. What if we could use this ability to create interfaces that figure out what you want?. For instance, instead of picking a prop from a long list of items, what if I just sketched it out?\n\nI’m definitely not the first person to think of this. I’m essentially talking about Google Quick Draw or AutoDraw in VR. In fact companies like Adobe are already exploring this type of effect in their products. Check out this recent demonstration of ProjectQuick3D. While I’m not actually sure that these implementations use a CNN or something else, functionally it is the same.\n\nMy First Model\n\nAs a first step, I took three classes from the Quick Draw dataset, and used them to train a simple CNN. For the architecture, I took a basic MNIST example since the data for MNIST and Quickdraw is very similar.\n\nDrawing a circle creates a sphere, while drawing a triangle creates a cube. For those that are detail oriented, I’m sorry, drawing a triangle on a trackpad is much easier than drawing a square :(\n\nAs a proof of concept, I started with 2D interface on my MacBook Pro. The network is trained on circles, squares, and triangles. The idea being that when a user draws a shape, an associated shape will be instantiated in 3D.\n\nKnowing that the basic principle worked, it was time to take the whole thing into VR!\n\nI decided to go with Leap Motion because I wanted the interactions to feel natural and effortless. While the tracking of leap motion wasn’t as precise as say a Vive controller, I found that once I accounted for Leap’s tracking quirks, the interactions felt very fluid.\n\nA simple model with classes for “tree”, “bush”, and “flower”\n\nSo this was super cool, and it was quite surprising how well it worked. But here’s where I ran into the first problem with my assumptions.\n\nDrawing was a very frictionless interaction, however only the first time you do it. For instance, imagine having to draw a tree sketch for every tree in a virtual forest. Some additional UI thinking was required.\n\nWhat if instead of drawing a tree, I drew a square? In other words what if I mapped each object to a primitive shape?\n\n“Circle” = “Bush”, “Square” = “Tree”, “Triangle” = “Flower”\n\nThis made the interaction easier, quicker, and very satisfying. However it’s easy to imagine how you could run out of primitive shapes quickly. Perhaps you could use numbers, but then we’re moving away from the idea of an effortless conjuring of a 3D object. If you have to remember an arbitrary mapping, it’s too hard.\n\nMy next step was to separate the drawing and placing mechanic. Switching modes is done by tapping different spheres aligned with my wrist. Above my hand is an icon indicating which object I have currently selected. This allows me to quickly and intuitively choose a new object and quickly and effortlessly place it.\n\nSwitching things up with a very hacky interface. Here you can see drawing and placement as two separate interaction modes.\n\nIt was time to really dive in CNN’s and start making a custom model that could use more classes. Since I’m still a ML newb, I used a relatively small data set of 11 classes. After manually playing around with the architecture for a day or two, I stumbled upon Hyperas, a library that would help automate my architecture optimization. The final model I used was this:\n\nThis resulted in above 95% accuracy for evaluation set. Now I had more classes, meaning I could magically pluck more objects out of thin air. However, since the classes from Quick Draw are seemingly arbitrary, I was left with a rather random model.",

  "latent_22915": "A Player Is Not without Honor Except in His Own Town (The Hometown Effect)\n\nMy Twitter, if you feel like getting updates on new blogs and other things: twitter.com/Vermanubis\n\nJesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.\" - Mark 6:4, NIV\n\nThough far from being a blog about religion, the Bible does have this eerily apropos sentiment about a phenomenon in Smash 4 that is seldom discussed. I call this phenomenon the “Hometown Effect.”\n\nWhat’s the parallel here? Let’s read this passage in the Sm4sh hermeneutic: “A top player is not without prestige except in his own region, among his own PR and in his own tournaments.”\n\nSo, what do I mean by all of this? Consider the following player stats:\n\nFatality: 2nd at Civil War; losing record against Hyperkirby this season who is ranked 4th on their PR.\n\nLocus: Multiple top-level out-of-region results, far exceeding any other in his region; ranked 2nd to Big D in British Columbia.\n\nCaptain Zack: Top 20 PGR player; 2nd on PR to Samsora, to whom he habitually loses but in equal measure outperforms out-of-region\n\nAll of these players, with their high-profile results, would be expected to unequivocally dominate their local regions; but they don’t. Many of them are either not first on their PR or have losing records to those lower-ranked than they are and whose projections for major events would be far below those against whom they have a winning record.\n\nAs largely inconsistent and strange as Smash 4 can be, there must still be some kind of explanation for this. Why do some players dominate out-of-region but struggle in-region?\n\nShort answer: Hometown Effect. Long answer: in a game as unforgiving as Sm4sh is with respect to the time you’re allotted to adapt and formulate counterplays, 4 stocks generally only gives enough time to construct a model of your opponent that is impoverished at best. You simply do not have enough time to comprehend the player behind the character in such a short time, at least, not such that any idiosyncrasies you pick up on become expressly utile. Rather, your baseline is that which is portable and independent of player-specific predilections: MU knowledge. Now, imagine you have all the time in the world to study, acclimate, and adapt to both a character as well as the individual playing them.\n\nThis being said, I would argue, and the data, I feel, would back me up, that while relying on player knowledge is impractical in a short-term context (that is, you don't have the time to figure small details out about the person as a player) it is ultimately knowledge that is exponentially more actionable and effective than general MU knowledge. MU knowledge, on the other hand, is actionable in the short-term since it’s represented by a pre-fabricated model that you don't need to learn extemporaneously, but is not nearly as actionable as player-specific knowledge. It is, however, portable, in that it's useful knowledge you can translate among any number of players; it's just not as useful as knowledge of that specific player.\n\nThis, I believe, explains why we see the sorts of things we do demonstrated by the data snippet above. When you’re in your hometown, people not only come to learn the MU; they come to learn you. It means far more to understand how someone fights than to understand with what they fight. In a national context, you don’t have the time to build a complete picture of whomever you’re playing; only to narrow down how they might behave and try to sort of stuff them like a Thanksgiving turkey into whatever pre-existing template you might have. In your hometown, not only do you have to navigate the usual obstacles of the game, but you must also cope with the added weight of what everyone already knows about you; with history. It's one thing to be exploited as a character; it's an entirely different thing to be exploited as a player.\n\nSo, in this sense, many of us can sympathize with the pop-punk cliche: we really want to get out of our hometown; there’s nothing for us here. There’s precious little glory in fighting old ghosts who know us so well when we could be carving the names of slain titans in our stone tablet for commensurate effort. When you have the advantage of time and ignorance, avenues that were previously unavailable to you against those in your hometown become available once more. Just like moving away from your actual hometown, you're given a fresh start; an opportunity to reinvent yourself without the baggage of years bygone. You can express yourself as a player without the cumbersome burden of being known.\n\nAs usual, if this blog didn't give you an exotic form of cancer, you didn't suffer a marked loss in IQ from it and maybe even liked it, then I frequently make updates on my Twitter and you can follow me here: twitter.com/Vermanubis\n\nThis blog post was written by a SSB World community member.

  "latent_23178": "Fear, not data, motivates sunscreen users, research shows\n\nWhen it comes to using sunscreen, fear of developing skin cancer has a greater influence than information about statistical likelihood of developing the disease, says UB's Marc Kiviniemi. Photo: Douglas Levere\n\n“The findings suggest that clinicians might want to think more about feelings when encouraging people to use sunscreen.”\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. – We’re often told that worrying can be harmful to one’s health. But University at Buffalo researchers say that when it comes to preventing skin cancer, a little fear is good for you.\n\nIn a study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, the UB researchers found that fear and worry about skin cancer had a bigger influence on people’s use of sunscreen than information about the statistical likelihood of developing the disease.\n\n“Most health behavior studies don’t account for the more visceral, emotional reactions that lead people to do risky behaviors, like eat junk food or ignore the protective benefits of sunscreen,” says Marc Kiviniemi, lead researcher and assistant professor of community health and health behavior in the UB School of Public Health and Health Professions.\n\n“This study is important because most of what we do in public health communications focuses on spreading knowledge and information. By not addressing emotions, we’re potentially missing a rich influence on behavior when interventions don’t address feelings.”\n\nKiviniemi’s study analyzed data from a nationwide study conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Nearly 1,500 randomly selected participants with no personal history of skin cancer were asked about their sunscreen use, and questioned to gauge their perceived risk and worry for getting skin cancer.\n\nFrequency of sunscreen use varied, with 32 percent reporting ‘‘never’’ using it, and 14 percent ‘‘always’’ using it. Education was associated with increased sunscreen use and men and non-White participants were both less likely to use sunscreen.\n\nIn each case, however, worry more directly influenced people’s behavior than informational findings, and increasing degrees of worry were associated with increased sunscreen use.\n\n“Our research looked at the interplay of emotions and facts in decision making– that is, how do cognitive and affective risks jointly work to influence behavior?” says Kiviniemi. “The nature of their interrelation as an influence on behavior has not been examined until this study.”\n\nUB researchers say that affective risk – fear and worry about a health issue, in this case skin cancer – and cognitive risk – the informational component – are both known influences on people’s health behaviors.\n\nHowever, they are often treated separately or are pitted against one another as “rational” versus “irrational” influences, says Kiviniemi.\n\n“These findings show that clinicians might want to think more about feelings when encouraging people to use sunscreen,” says Kiviniemi. “In addition to providing educational information about risk, encouraging people to consider how they feel about cancer and how worried they are about it might inspire preventive behaviors.”\n\nWhile ultimately public health professionals can use the results to design better intervention tools, researchers are still a few steps away from understanding how to shape fear so that it is beneficial, rather than paralyzing, adds Kiviniemi.\n\nKiviniemi will conduct further research to examine the same relationship between risk perception and behavior in other types of health behaviors, such as colonoscopy screening and condom use.",
  "latent_23219": "UPDATE 22/2/17 2:50pm: AMD has officially revealed Ryzen 7 - three eight-core/16-thread processors - effectively confirming the leaks discussed below, though prices have shifted slightly. The top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X costs $499, Ryzen 7 1700X is $399, while Ryzen 7 1700 costs just $329. As expected though, AMD is significantly under-cutting Intel's Core i7 6900K with similar performance, while putting serious pressure on the i7 7700K and i7 6800K.\n\nAMD has also revealed that further optimisations have resulted in a chip that outperforms its predecessor to an even greater degree. Previously, an IPC (instructions per clock) boost of 40 per cent was mooted - an increase of 52 per cent is delivered in the final product. AMD has also released more of its own internal benchmarks, showing the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matching the single-core performance of Intel's $1000 Core i7 6900K, with multi-core performance pulling ahead by nine per cent. Meanwhile, the cheaper Ryzen 7 1700X beats the Core i7 6800K by 39 per cent in the Cinebench multi-core benchmark, pulling ahead of the 6900K by four per cent.\n\nRyzen 7 1800X and 1700X feature a 95W TDP, while the lower clocked Ryzen 7 1700 is remarkably frugal for an eight-core chip at just 65W (again verifying previously leaks). Pre-orders start today, and the processor will be available to buy from March 2nd. Reviews for Ryzen 7 will be published on the same day. In amongst the press materials, AMD also provided a die-shot of the full, eight-core processor, which we've reproduced below - click on the thumbnail for a higher resolution image. Expect to hear more about Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 soon.\n\nOriginal story: It's been 11 years since Intel released its first Core 2 Duo processors and a decade since the arrival of the epoch-making Core 2 Quad. It's been a period of complete domination, with multiple AMD architectures failing to break Intel's monopoly on the x86 market. But within weeks, the red team's Ryzen line will be with us, new leaks are arriving by the day and they all tell us the same thing - the price to performance ratio looks astonishing.\n\nRecently, we ran an article on the immediate future of CPU technology - and the prognosis wasn't hugely optimistic. Intel's Kaby Lake saw frequencies pushed to their limits, with no new fabrication node to move onto and no changes to the core architecture whatsoever. The products remain excellent in performance terms, but innovation is stagnant. We wondered how Ryzen could shake things up, bearing in mind that the only processor we'd seen appeared to be targeting Intel's octo-core i7 6900K - a $1000 CPU. It seemed reasonable to assume that AMD would target this premium market first before moving onto mainstream processors, but the reality is now clear: Ryzen is set to be a major disruptive force with highly aggressive pricing across the entire stack. Multiple leaks are suggesting that AMD's top-tier Ryzen processors start at $320 - in the same price range as the Core i7 7700K.\n\nAMD isn't stopping there, as the entire product stack has leaked, from the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X, right down to the Ryzen 3 1100. The naming convention is clearly intentional; the stack is designed to line up with and compete against Core i3, i5 and i7 mainstream Intel processors. We expect a launch soon based on the top-end Ryzen 7 octo-core parts, but when the full stack is on the market, we should see AMD offering more cores, more threads and more power - assuming that the red team's claims and demos are borne out in real-world testing. Leaked benchmarks certainly look promising.\n\nRyzen: the AM4 platform If you decide to opt for Ryzen, you're going to need a new motherboard based on the new AM4 platform. Five different chipsets are in the works here, starting at the enthusiast-grade X370, featuring advanced overclocking and more PCI Express lanes for handling more high-bandwidth storage devices. X370 is the only chipset designed to support multi-GPU set-ups. The B350 chipset pares back PCI Express lanes, lacks multi-GPU but otherwise offers everything you need for a good Ryzen-based gaming rig, while the A320 chipset further pares back expansion options and PCI Express lanes, and omits overclocking. For small form-factor rigs, AMD has prepared the X300 and A/B300 chipsets. Expansion options are more limited on the small form-factor and the biggest difference here is that only the X300 supports overclocking. From our perspective, essential information we are missing at the moment concerns memory overclocking. We expect it to feature on X370/X300 and B350, but the picture isn't very clear right now.\n\nStarting at the top-end, Ryzen 7 offers twice the number of cores and threads as the Core i7 7700K, with prices in the same ballpark. AMD's more budget-orientated Ryzen i3 faces off against Core i3, offering a pure quad-core part, apparently with prices starting at just $129, if the leaks are to be believed. But it's Ryzen 5 where things get interesting for gamers - there we see a mixture of six-core/12-thread and four-core/eight-thread processors for Core i5 money. This is the gamer's heartland, and the arrival of a well-priced six-core CPU that can compete with Intel is significant for reasons we'll go into shortly.\n\nCPU Cores/Threads Base Clock Boost Clock XFR Clock Price Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 4.0GHz+ $495 Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 3.4GHz 3.8GHz 3.8GHz+ $389 Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 3.0GHz 3.7GHz - $319 Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 3.3GHz 3.7GHz 3.7GHz+ $259 Ryzen 5 1500 6/12 3.2GHz 3.5GHz - $229 Ryzen 5 1400X 4/8 3.5GHz 3.9GHz 3.9GHz+ $199 Ryzen 5 1300 4/8 3.2GHz 3.5GHz - $175 Ryzen 3 1200X 4/4 3.4GHz 3.8GHz 3.8GHz+ $149 Ryzen 3 1100 4/4 3.2GHz 3.5GHz - $129\n\nLooking at the leaked stack, there are some interesting stats to assess. We have base frequencies for each processor, along with turbo clock (an auto-overclock designed to operate within TDP - Intel has something very similar) plus a new variable: XFR clock. The idea with XFR is that attaching a custom cooling solution gives the processor further auto-overclocking headroom, and that's intriguing, because AMD has confirmed that all Ryzen processors can be overclocked - there are no K chips or equivalent here, which begs the question of what the difference is between X and non-X processors. Not included in the table is a further line of 'Pro' chips - and quite what sets them apart isn't clear, though support for enterprise features seems like a reasonable guess.\n\nSo on paper at least, Ryzen is looking sensational in terms of price vs performance, and various leaked synthetic benchmarks have appeared showing the architecture competitive with Intel's eight-core behemoths, such as the Core i7 5960X, based on the Haswell architecture - and its Broadwell-based successor, the Core i7 6900K. Which leads us onto two questions: firstly, how will gaming performance pan out, and secondly - just how is a much smaller company able to undercut Intel so massively? Has Intel really been ripping us off over the last decade?\n\nTo address gaming performance first, two variables are at play - IPC (instructions per clock) and frequency. Having fast single-thread performance compared with high clock speeds tends to be vey important for gaming, which explains why the Core i7 6700K managed to narrowly beat out both the six-core i7 5820K and the eight-core 5960X in our gaming CPU face-off last year. Two generations of IPC improvements along with higher clocks - remarkably - proved to be far more beneficial than more cores. Based on AMD's own tests, still to be confirmed outside of controlled conditions, Ryzen has single-thread performance on par with Intel's older Broadwell architecture and the stated clocks are lower than the new i7 7700K.\n\nOur analysis of the Core i7 6700K up against six-core and eight-core Haswell-based Intel CPUs. Remarkably, the Skylake chip beats out both of them in most cases. With that in mind, despite a clear core/thread deficit against Ryzen, we still expect the 6700K and 7700K to put up a good fight against the AMD newcomers.\n\nTitan X OC (Average FPS) i7 6700K/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 5820K/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5820K 4.6GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X 4.4GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 88.4 89.3 84.2 84.6 84.4 84.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA 124.4 124.7 119.4 120.8 124.4 125.5 Grand Theft Auto 5, Ultra, no MSAA 89.4 92.7 79.0 86.7 81.9 90.3 Far Cry 4, Ultra, SMAA 120.4 125.9 92.0 104.5 84.8 95.4 Shadow of Mordor, Ultra, FXAA 141.0 142.9 139.6 139.5 139.9 139.9 The Witcher 3, Ultra, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 105.8 106.4 103.4 103.4 103.5 103.8\n\nIt's only a supposition for now of course, but if the top-tier Ryzen chip behaves like an Intel octo-core chip as AMD suggests, the chances are that the Core i7 7700K will remain the overall fastest gaming CPU on the market through sheer frequency, if nothing else. However, if we look at our results overall, the lack of variation between the six-core and eight-core Intel chips is telling - and the 6700K's lead is hardly earth-shattering. Very, very little divides them and it may suggest that those six core/12 thread Ryzen 5 chips could offer monstrous value, particularly if clocks can be pushed beyond 4GHz. Kaby Lake can hit 4.8GHz easily via overclocking - right now we just don't know how far Ryzen can be pushed. Being fast is important of course, but offering enhanced value is where AMD could really make a difference here.\n\nIn all areas, Ryzen is looking highly promising - TDP is looking extremely promising suggesting excellent power efficiency, while AMD's core is actually 10 per cent smaller than Intel's. The question is, are there any chinks in the armour? Can a company with an R&D budget a fraction of Intel's really compete? Well, we do know that there are some compromises in the Ryzen design. For example, Ryzen's support for AVX instructions is 128-bit in nature, meaning two cycles are required to achieve what an Intel core does in one. However, Intel's bargain basement Pentium G4560 has no AVX2 support, and this appears to have little impact on gaming performance.\n\nRyzen also compromises in another area, which leads us on to the second point we previously raised - has Intel been ripping us off, safe in the knowledge that until this point it has had no competition? It's fair to say that the firm has leveraged its position (particularly on the six, eight and ten-core enthusiast CPUs) but it would be remiss of us not to point out a key difference between Ryzen and Intel's mainstream Core processors: the presence of an integrated GPU. Take a look at an Intel die-shot and you can see that the graphics component takes up a huge amount of space that adds to the cost of production, whether you use it or not. Ryzen has no dedicated on-die GPU, as you can see in the image below, meaning that the same space can be used for more cores and cache.\n\nFor producers of low-end, non-gaming PCs, Ryzen may not prove so attractive as they will need to add bespoke graphics hardware to their builds - at least until AMD's new wave of APUs appear. However, it's happy days for the players: the integrated graphics chip is rarely used on a PC build dedicated to gaming - effectively making it dead silicon - so why not beef up CPU power instead? And let's not forget that even if gaming doesn't fully utilise those additional cores, that's not to say that they won't be used at all. Streamers often prefer the quality found from software video encoding, and dedicating a couple of spare cores to h.264 encoding without impacting gameplay performance can be very useful. On top of that, a PC has many uses outside of gaming too - it's hard to believe that Ryzen won't be highly attractive to video content creators, for example.\n\nOur first look at the Ryzen die - this is the quad-core config we'll see in the Ryzen 3 and some of the Ryzen 5 processors. Note how much space the 8MB of L3 cache takes up on the die.\n\nPotentially, there's much to get excited about here in just how much performance we're getting for the money here - even for the budget gaming PC builder. At the absolute bottom end, the Pentium G4560 still looks unassailable, but assuming Ryzen can indeed match up to an Intel Broadwell processor, the entry-level Ryzen 3 1100 should offer superb gaming performance up there with a modern i5, even before we factor in the overclocking potential of the chip.\n\nThere are also other factors to consider too - such as AMD's track record in providing gamer-friendly features on entry-level motherboards. We recently benchmarked an Athlon X4 860K on a bargain basement FM2+ board as part of our Pentium G4560 review. CPU performance wasn't exactly great, but the board itself allowed for easy multiplier overclocking and supported fast RAM - two elements reserved only for the most expensive chipsets on Intel boards. We really hope to see these aspects continue onto the next generation of cheaper AMD platforms. Of course, the limitation of all of AMD's prior platforms has been lack of upgradability - but that's a thing of the past with the new AM4 boards, which should allow for easy upgrading between all Ryzen parts and the upcoming APUs too.\n\nNew processors, new architecture, new platforms, DDR4 support - Ryzen potentially catapults AMD back into contention in the x86 space for PC gaming and more. Assuming the pricing and configuration details we've seen pan out - and there is close convergence in all of the recent leaks - Ryzen could have a profound impact on the price of a highly creditable gaming PC. And for those still holding on to their 2500Ks and 3570Ks, perhaps this potential leap in price vs performance might finally convince those users to upgrade.",

  "latent_23449": "Artificially Limiting the Blocksize to Create a “Fee Market” = Another Variety of Lifting the 21 Million Bitcoin Cap\n\nBitcoin Economics Blocked Unblock Follow Following Nov 19, 2016\n\nNote: This article has been kindly translated into Chinese. (中文链接)\n\nArtificial blocksize caps are a market intervention just as egregious as the Fed setting the interest rate, with equal damage to Bitcoin’s sound money properties — rendering the 21M BTC cap meaningless.\n\nBitcoin backers have grown accustomed to thinking of Bitcoin as “inflation-proof” because of the iron-clad issuance schedule for its monetary tokens, culminating in the famously final total of 21,000,000 BTC sometime in the next century. Libertarians and other sound money advocates immediately recognize why Bitcoin is revolutionary, once they are able to grasp the nature of money as a ledger and how that makes Bitcoin truly as good as gold.\n\nYet the real epiphany hits when the former goldbug sees the script get flipped: Gold itself is in fact just a low-tech “sneakernet” ledger where unfakeable, scarce pieces of metal are traded as proof of ledger holdings instead of cryptographic signatures. Bitcoin simply upgrades this process with more reliable scarcity into faster, lighter, hideable, deniable, teleportable, unforgeable money. Libertarians hail it as a true sea change in personal liberty and the very fabric of society with the potential to disintegrate existing power structures at the seams.\n\n“You’ve got to get a piece of this landgrab,” they say. “You’ve got to secure your portion of the ledger early on, before everyone jumps in.”\n\nThe key word here is scarcity.\n\nBut why? What benefit does scarcity in the form of a 21-million coin cap really confer? Of course, the answer goes, if a significant number of bitcoins could be issued contrary to the original schedule, over and above 21 million, its sound money property would be in jeopardy. It would be no better than the Federal Reserve with its willy-nilly inflationary policies.\n\nYet here one detail has been skipped over. Issued to whom? As everyone knows, the new Bitcoins are issued to the miners — thereby diluting the value of all bitcoin holders’ bitcoins slightly — as a reward for their services to the network. Said another way, bitcoin holders who have “secured their percentage of the ledger in this epic landgrab” forfeit a small part of that percentage to the miners every time a block is mined.\n\nFor instance, the Winkelvoss twins came out as owning 1% of the entire Bitcoin ledger as of early 2013. At the time, this figure represented about 100,000 BTC, because there were a little over 10,000,000 BTC issued. Now there are 16,000,000 BTC outstanding, meaning their stake in the current ledger has fallen to a little over 0.6%, a 40% loss in the proportion of the total ledger they own — a 40% shrinkage of their total land ownership of the slowly accreting Bitcoin island, as the traditional analogy goes.\n\nThe Bitcoin Island (any resemblance to Ireland is entirely coincidental). Winkelvossia is set to shrink another 25%, yielding a quarter of its remaining lands to the miners by the year 2140.\n\nThat 40% loss wasn’t just “inflated away.” It went to the miners. Thus it is equally valid to view the situation as follows:\n\nThe Bitcoin island didn’t really grow; there isn’t really any inflation so to speak. There is just a miner tax. The island is the same size, but the Winkelvoss twins lost 40% of their property size to the miners. This is of course no problem, as they knew all this going in! However, I hope the reader can see that this is just as accurate a conception as the more familiar one. Why view it this way, though? Because it is more revealing as to what is actually going on.\n\nSeen this clearer way, the block reward (now 12.5 BTC per block) is indeed a miners’ subsidy for their services. Since it was known from the beginning, this is all perfectly in keeping with the predictable issuance schedule of sound money. A certain known percentage of your stake in the Bitcoin island will go to the miners on a known schedule.\n\nThe other fact that was known from the beginning was that miners are allowed to charge fees to include transactions in a block. This is an additional yielding of landmass to the miners as is understood by all. It was always understood that this was necessary to incentivize miners to include transactions, as well as to scale mining subsidy as fee-paying transaction volume grew, since higher volume of high-priority transactions would mean Bitcoin had become a bigger deal economically and therefore needed even more protection from attack.\n\nIn the early days, critics were quick to point out that the miners could charge whatever fees they wanted to. Some socialists who don’t understand how economics work even contended the miners would charge exorbitant fees, like $500 per transaction, and people would be forced to pay. Was that not essentially an infinitely expandable additional miners’ subsidy?\n\n“What meaning did the 21M cap have if miners could assess arbitrarily high fees on your ‘digital gold’ and you have to just stand there and take it?” they naively asked.\n\nFortunately most Bitcoiners are familiar with the counterintuitive aspects of free-market economics: unfettered competition among miners results in a bidding war. Even if some miner were to charge $500, other miners would undercut each other in a continual price war, the lowest bidder taking the entire pot of accumulated transaction fees. In this way, transaction fees reach the market clearing rate, where the fee rate on a given transaction approaches the marginal cost to a miner of including it in the next block. This isn’t a perfect system in terms allocating system expenses, but it certainly works to prevent price gouging. Again, Econ 101: any miner trying to charge even a little bit more for the exact same service will just be undercut by another miner and lose that potential income.\n\nTherefore, in the final analysis, Bitcoin holders could rest assured that their savings — their percentage of the total Bitcoin island landmass — would be a predictable percentage at a predictable time, and furthermore that the tolls exacted when they move their money will be reasonable as they will be determined solely by free market competition. Perfectly predictable holdings and an un-gameable free market in fees that ensured fees were tied to actual miner costs. This was sound money incarnate.\n\nEnter the blocksize cap.\n\nThe hard-coded cap on the maximum allowable size of blocks in the Bitcoin network stands at 1MB, and as everyone following the blocksize debate knows, this number had no discernable effect on fees per transaction until recently. You can be sure this fact isn’t itself a point of controversy precisely because one school has continually lamented it and the other school has continually lauded it. However, as is also a matter of record (and basic economics), rejoiced at by the former school and lamented by the latter, the fees per transaction have risen markedly since the transaction volume has started filling up the 1MB blocks.\n\nNo longer is the price per transaction determined by the free market, but instead by a hard-coded limit that intervenes in the market. This results in more money being paid to the miners for their services per transaction than otherwise would have.\n\nHere I must make a gentle note to non-economists: this doesn’t mean more total money went to the miners, a common error — for the same reason that a 5-star steak restaurant doesn’t make more total money than McDonald’s. There are less total transactions than there would otherwise have been, as people start to economize, which is again an intended effect of the school of thought that celebrates this “fee market” (note that a free fee market already existed, hence this one should be distinguished by calling it something like an “artificial fee market” or a “developer-regulated fee market,” much like the many government-regulated markets out there in a standard mixed economy). This isn’t any kind boon for the miners, any more than it would be a boon to McDonald’s if the government came in and told them they have to triple all their prices.",

  "latent_23788": "KUTUPALONG CAMP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Aid agencies have to step up operations “massively” in response to the arrival in Bangladesh of about 400,000 refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar, and the amount of money needed to help them has risen sharply, a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday.\n\nRohingya refugees wait for the food to be distributed by local organisations near Balukhali makeshift refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, September 13, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nThe exodus of Muslim Rohingya to Bangladesh began on Aug. 25 after Rohingya militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp. The attacks triggered a sweeping military counter-offensive by security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar which the U.N. rights agency said was a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.\n\n“We will all have to ramp up our response massively, from food to shelter,” George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency, told Reuters during a visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.\n\nThe United Nations said on Tuesday 370,000 people had crossed into Bangladesh but Okoth-Obbo estimated the figure was now 400,000. He declined to speculate on how many more might come.\n\nBangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingya, who fled earlier conflict in Myanmar including a similar security crackdown in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state in response to militant attacks in October.\n\nMany of the new arrivals are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season.\n\n“We have an emergency within an emergency with conditions in existing camps,” he said, pointing to a mud-clogged road in the camp.\n\nLast week, the United Nations appealed for $77 million to cope with the crisis but Okoth-Obbo said that would not now be enough.\n\n“The appeal that was issued of $77 million on behalf of the aid agencies was based on the situation as it was roughly about two weeks ago,” he said.\n\n“There were only 100,000 people then. We are already four times that figure now. The funds need clearly is going to continue.”\n\nHe declined to say how much he thought was needed.\n\nHe also declined to say if he thought aid agencies were getting proper access to the conflict zone in Myanmar, though he said it was important to ensure that people were safe where they were.\n\n“Of course, also that access is provided to all the responders to provide humanitarian assistance,” he added.\n\nMyanmar has restricted most aid agency access to the north of Rakhine. Some officials have accused aid agencies of supporting the insurgents.\n\nOkoth-Obbo said he agreed with the Bangladeshi position that the most important solution was for the refugees to be able to return home in safety.\n\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Tuesday the refugees would all have to go home and Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable them to do so.\n\n“Under difficult circumstances this country has kept its borders open,” Okoth-Obbo said of Bangladesh.\n\n“All of us should support that and ensure that the response is strong.”\n\n(Story corrects paragraph 2 reference to ethnic cleansing, not genocide.)",
  "latent_23869": "By Vanessa Beeley*\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Government forces, a traffic infringement justifies the massacre of over 1000 Muslims who were performing the religious ceremony of ushering in the new month of Maulud, honouring the birth of the Prophet Mohammed of Islam [pbuh].\n\nIn a statement on Sunday the army said: “The Nigerian Constitution guarantees the rights of any group of persons and Sheikh El Zakzaky’s followers to hold a peaceful march or procession unhindered, but it also guarantees other people’s rights of way on public highways.”\n\nClaims of an attempted assassination of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Tukur Buratai or even of the alleged attacks by the Islamic sect on the military convoy are rendered questionable by the sheer lack of reported casualties on the military side and the shockingly disproportionate loss of life and bloodshed among the Islamic Sect supporters and leaders.\n\nIf indeed, this were a simple fracas over “right of way on a public highway” which resulted in the shooting of unarmed Muslims, why then did the same Nigerian government armed forces attack Hussainiyah, the sect’s headquarters later the same evening, hours after the initial clashes? Why did they deliberately target high ranking members of the Shi’ite Islamic movement and execute Hamad Zakaky, son of the movement leader Sheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky. Why did they attack and wound the Sheikh’s wife, Zeenat? Why did they shoot the Sheikh himself, four times in his hands, publicly humiliate and arrest him? Why, if this was not a premediated act of aggression and suppression, had the Army ensured the presence of camera teams at both attacks and why were women and children not spared the murderous hail of bullets?\n\nThese are all questions that the mainstream media should be asking, yet this massacre has been swept under the carpet of indifference by Western media.\n\nSheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky is a man of peace, unity and vision. These qualities alone represent a threat to the hegemony and neo-colonialist strategy of the Axis of Empire in Africa and would justify the repeated attempts to suppress and inhibit the growth of his Shia Muslim movement and his popular, unifying influence that transcended the borders of Nigeria and was taking root in many countries on the continent.\n\nTo more fully understand this violent targeting of the Sheikh and the Islamic Movement, we must take into consideration, both the historical and more recent influences upon Nigeria.\n\nChina has been an evolving partnership in Nigeria, investing heavily in the development of infrastructure and fixed assets, refineries and factories. In a role diametrically opposed to the traditional plundering partnerships of the US and other neo-colonialists with sovereign nations, China contrarily seems to have a genuinely vested interest in the stability of Nigeria to support a mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship reliant upon the growth and profitability of Nigeria itself.\n\nThis concept adopted by China of a symbiotic expansion & growth, is an anathema to the US neo-colonialism in the region, and particularly in Nigeria. The presence of China in a country so abundant in oil, uranium, diamond, mineral & timber resources is an acute thorn in the side of the US carpetbaggers who have perceived the Continent’s largest economy & oil producer to be their bread basket and theirs alone.\n\nIt is logical, rational and reasonable to speculate that Boko Haram is effectively another terrorist trade name, brought into existence, to destabilize a region that is daring to jailbreak from US colonialism and to explore alternative bi-lateral trade pathways that deviate from the US regional “road maps”.\n\nBoko Haram’s presence, has a threefold purpose:\n\nIt successfully elevates the Nigerian army to defender of the “meek” against the “terror” threat and provides cover for any violent opposition suppression. It gives the US justification for “boots on the ground”, military support for anti Boko Haram aka pro US factions, and the ubiquitous drone strikes against the alleged “terror” strongholds, a devastating strategy already observed in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen to name a few. It ensures the fragmentation, sectarian division, and fracturing of unity and a state of perpetual chaos which will seismically derail China’s investment in Nigeria’s physical and economic infrastructure essential to their US exclusive growth.\n\nSheikh Zakzaky had alluded to this very terror “patent” in his reaction to the suicide bomb attack on the Shia Arba’een procession in Kano on the 27th November 2015. Over 24 died and many were injured in further violent targeting of the minority Shia community in Nigeria.\n\n“We know the names of the contractors and those contracted to commit the massacre, their identity is not hidden from us. Therefore we cannot be cowed by an imaginary Boko Haram tale, let them tell it to the fools and ignorant. They should know that they are dealing with those with foresight, wisdom and intelligence, and above all with the real religion”.\n\nThis statement struck at the very heart of the US/NATO, Israeli and GCC strategy in Nigeria and threatened to undermine their architecture of “terror” foundations. The Sheikh made it clear that Boko Haram were none other than gangs of mercenaries, hired contractual killers, being unleashed to foment sectarian violence and an atmosphere of fear and division where only US appointed, backed and controlled “saviours” would emerge victorious.\n\nWhen we consider the sheer numbers of gangs and rival gangs, extremist factions and sects emerging inorganically and globally, we can begin to connect the dots. All have as their purpose, the sowing and reaping of rapacious violence, the construct of division, the provocation of turmoil, the incitement of hatred and fear. All are posing as the enemies of Imperialism whilst serving Imperialist agendas. All fulfil roles of humanity- averse abomination and simultaneous US alliance proxy forces percolating from one target region to the next.\n\nGrey Wolves, FSA, ISIS, DAESH, Al Qaeda, Khorasan, AQAP, Jabhat al Nusra and Boko Haram [to name a few], are they all nothing more than trade names, successfully managed brand images, logos and IDs all emanating from the US/NATO, Israel and Gulf State holders of the patent on terror and their associated marketing agents and concept creators?\n\nSheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky also challenges another malevolent bastion of Nigeria’s landscape, the powerful pro- Israel lobby whose growth and expansion in Nigeria had been hugely facilitated by former President and Christian Zionist, Goodluck Johnathan. Nigeria is now home to Africa’s largest Israeli Jewish community [15, 000 in 2014].\n\nThe Sheikh is a steadfast and vociferous opponent of the illegal state of Israel and an uncompromising defender of freedom for Palestine, and the right to return for Palestinians living in Diaspora since the 1948 Nakba. His son Hamad, who was reportedly murdered during the 12/12 attacks had been with us at the Global Campaign to Return to Palestine 3rd Annual Conference being held in Beirut and had only left us on the 11th December, one day before he was to be targeted by the pro-Israel Government forces.\n\nHamad’s final recorded speech before his untimely death had been one that supported and celebrated the Al Quds Day rallies and protests particularly in Nigeria and Pakistan where lives have been routinely lost in the battle to honour and protect the core identity of the Palestinian struggle, Al Quds. Hamad had, himself, lost his three brothers, Ahmed, Hamid and Mahmood during one such rally in 2014 when hundreds of the Islamic Movement supporters were also mown down during another Nigerian army attack on unarmed solidarity demonstrators for the Palestinian cause.\n\n“I would like to give a message to Pakistan’s brave nation, especially to those families who have sacrificed the lives of their loved ones and to those whose loved ones were martyred in Quetta during Al-Quds’ rally. I am proud that my brothers were martyred in Al-Quds’ rally and they gave their lives for supporting Palestinians”.\n\nThese were Hamad’s last words to the world before the 12/12 bloodbath in Nigeria stripped one more son from the family of Sheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky, Hamad gave his young life in the service of peace & freedom. A life that was unrecognised by Western or even Palestinian media on the day he died.\n\nمرورگر شما از ویدئو پشتیبانی نمی‌کند.\n\nفایل آن‌را از اینجا دالود کنید: video/mp4 video/mp4\n\nPaul Larudee of Free Palestine had this to say about a young man who impressed all who met him at the Beirut conference with his quiet humility and unassuming humanity:\n\n“Such a sweet and intelligent young man, very quiet and unassuming. Made me want to know him better.\n\nAccording to him Boko Haram is just another group of terrorist thugs, thriving like ISIS through infusions of money and arms from both outside and inside Nigeria. Our tax dollars at work. Why does the greatest evil always seem to rise to the top of our societies, while the poor and the meek are always ready to help others? Is evil the only way to rise to a position of strength?”\n\nInto this maelstrom of lawless and Machiavellian meddling in Nigeria we can add one final component without which the neo-colonialist frontlines would not be complete: the Saudi Wahhabi agents of Islamic “change” who are the subterranean source of Muslim extremism and religious fanaticism; the funders and suppliers of the brand name proxy forces, deployed to whip up the “terror” frenzy wherever it is required to destabilize or unhinge unity that may jeopardize Empire’s intent.\n\nWith ultimate irony, it is Riyadh that is self- appointed to combat the terrorism created in its image, by forming a coalition of 34 predominantly Muslim nations, Nigeria included, with the predictable exclusion of Iran, Syria and Iraq all of whom are involved in battling the Saudi NATO sourced terror hordes on the ground.\n\nIn direct contrast with this deliberate policy of divide and conquer, Sheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky is a man of religious respect and tolerance, he embraces Christians, Sunnis and Sufis alike despite his Shia centric movement and its ties with Tehran, which naturally represents an additional and perceived monumental threat to US/NATO and Saudi/Israeli regional hegemony.\n\nThe Islamic Movement is also renowned for its reformist policies, prioritizing education and establishing Islamic schools incorporating secular subjects in addition to Quranic teaching. Hospitals and health clinics have been set up where care is free for those without the means to pay for it. The Sheikh has deterred his supporters from shedding their own blood to commemorate the shedding of Imam Hussein’s blood and redirected them to donate this blood to local hospitals, thus saving lives in memory of their beloved Imam Hussein.\n\nThe Western media silence over the Zaria massacre is indicative of their collusion in this mass killing of innocents and proof of the role they play in exacerbating global sectarian division at the behest of their Washington, Tel Aviv and Saudi donors and backers.\n\nThe initial silence of the Palestinian community, the media, the NGOs, the solidarity organisations is less expected and more worrying given the Islamic Movement’s steadfast support of the Palestinian cause and opposition to the illegal State of Israel.\n\nThis is a missed opportunity for the unity of peoples suffering from the same symptoms of neo colonialism, regardless of creed, sect or religion. Al Quds represents the identity, not only of Palestinians but of the entire Arab world. Those who defend it from Israeli occupation are those who are enduring their own form of occupation by the patented terror armies: Nigeria, Pakistan, Yemen, and Syria. As these nations unite behind Palestine to prise loose Israel’s jaws from the third most sacred site for the Muslim Ummah, Palestine is needed to unite behind those who give their lives for Palestine and thus for Humanity. It is this unity that will resolve the ancient theological disputes that are permitting the externally induced sectarian fault lines to widen and deepen.\n\nWe live in a world where those who are honoured are the sowers of discord and the reapers of mayhem, the state sponsored agents of chaos. We no longer honour the true heroes, we honour an illusion called power and greed. The state media apparatuses serve only to keep historic Fitna (sedition) wounds festering and the “NGO complex” pied piper plays the tune of stake-holding in human suffering, created in advance by the Empire’s composers of death.\n\nLeaders, visionaries, like Sheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky show us the way to a new world, one that is driven by justice and progress, dependent upon compassion, communication and unification. They show us that courage, universal respect & humility is needed to evade the dystopian future that is being forced upon us by the ruling elite. It is these men of integrity who resist corruption and maintain their morals and fundamental principles despite their own personal suffering and loss, that we should honour and aspire to emulate.\n\n“Reason with this: Who is carrying out senseless killings in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon? They are the same people carrying out attacks here, and we know them. We cannot be cowed” ~ Sheikh Ebrahim Zakzaky.\n\nEND.\n\nThanks to:\n\nDan Glazebrook: https://www.rt.com/op-edge/323656-deadliest-terror-boko-haram/\n\nWSWS: http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/05/30/nige-j12.html\n\n21st Century Wire: http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/12/14/gladio-global-gangs-and-counter-gangs-in-europe-ireland-iraq-and-now-in-syria/\n\nPlfpakistan: http://www.plfpakistan.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47167:hammad-zakzakys-message-to-pakistani-nation-a-day-before-his-martyrdom&catid=4:general\n\nElbinawi.wordpress.com: https://elbinawi.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/why-they-targeted-sheikh-zakzaky/\n\nVanessa Beeley is a photographer, writer, peace activist and volunteer with the Global Campaign to Return to Palestine.

  "latent_23897": "At some point, every guy wonders how to get a girlfriend.\n\nIf you’re ready for a girlfriend, you typically fit into one of two categories:\n\nYou don’t have a ton of experience with women and want to lock down a girl You’re tired of sleeping with tons of different girls, and want to make a deeper connection with one girl\n\nIf you’re in the first category, you face challenges like attracting new girls, learning great dating fundamentals, and learning not to be desperate in your girlfriend search.\n\nIf you’re in the second category, you face challenges like learning to put the “player lifestyle” on pause, learning relationship game, and finding a girl who fits your “whole package” (versus one you just enjoying having sex with.)\n\nIn reality, no matter what type of guy you are, you’ll have to overcome some challenges.\n\nSo today, I’ll give you a roadmap for how to get a girlfriend. This roadmap will help you overcome just about all the challenges you’ll face when it comes to getting a girlfriend. What’s more, it’ll help you manage the relationship so she sticks around and even gets addicted to being with you.\n\nLet’s get into it…\n\nBonus: and learn the 5 conversation mistakes that put you in the friendzone.\n\nHere’s How to Get a Girlfriend: 13 Steps That Make Her Want You…\n\n1. Let Go of the Girls from Your Past\n\nWe’ve all got that one “girl who got away”. She was amazing and awesome and everything you wanted. But now, she’s gone and you can’t seem to let the idea of her go.\n\nBut here’s the thing: If you want to get a quality girlfriend, you first must let go of all of the girl(s) from your past.\n\nYou see, by holding on to the idea of this girls (and the chance that it could one day magically work out with her), you subconsciously close yourself off from having chemistry with other women. You end up comparing every girl to your idealized version of this past girl (which is impossible to match up to), and when she doesn’t match up, you write her off, or don’t try to cultivate a deeper connection.\n\nI’ve noticed that whenever I finally “let a girl go”, I end up meeting another awesome girl almost immediately – like within weeks. By letting go of one girl, I leave room for another awesome one to come into my life.\n\nIf you’re struggling with letting go of girls from your past, check out these two articles:\n\n2. Know What You Want in a Woman (And Don’t Settle)\n\nMost guys don’t know what they actually want in a woman, aside from a pretty face, a nice ass, and some sexy curves.\n\nIf they find a girl who looks good, is good in bed, and has a fun personality, that’s usually enough to get them to settle down.\n\nBut this kind of thinking will get you in trouble, especially when it comes to getting a girlfriend you actually like.\n\nInstead, you should sit down and think of what you actually want in a woman.\n\nWrite down 3-4 “must-have” traits. If a girl is missing any of these, you should rule her out of being your girlfriend\n\nWrite down 4-5 “nice-to-have” traits. The more of these a girl has, the better\n\nKeep these in mind when meeting and dating women. Ask her the right questions that will reveal these traits.\n\nThis will help you avoid getting into a relationship you really shouldn’t be in, as well as a lot of heartache, pain, and fighting down the road.\n\nI’ll also note that very few guys actually do this. For example, I have one friend who is very Christian. He knew he wanted a Christian girl, but constantly kept going for girls who weren’t very Christian and just kind of “overlooked” it. It always turned out terrible in the long-run, and I was there to tell him, “BRO, I told you so!”\n\nHe finally got the point, and now exclusively goes for Christian girls. His relationships are now a lot more fulfilling, happy, and long-lasting.\n\n3. Don’t Be in “Girlfriend Search Mode”\n\nSometimes guys email me and say, “Dave! I just want to know how to get a girlfriend!” I usually laugh because it’s obvious that these guys are in “girlfriend search mode.” In other words, they’re desperate to get a girlfriend.\n\nIt reminds me of a quote I heard years ago (I think it was from Mark Manson)…\n\n“If you desperately want a girlfriend, then you probably need to have sex with 50 girls. If you want to have sex with 50 girls, then what you probably need is a girlfriend.”\n\nWhen you’re “on the hunt” for a girlfriend, women will immediately pick up on this and it’ll make you seem needy. You’ll be the one chasing them instead of the other way around.\n\nInstead of “girlfriend search mode”, you should take a different approach.\n\nYou should have the goal of meeting more women you connect with, and seeing where it goes from there. If a relationship develops, that’s cool – if not, that’s cool too. You know you can make a connection with another girl and take it from there.\n\nThis approach will prevent you from jumping into something serious with a girl you’re not all that crazy about. It’ll also lead to a more healthy relationship whenever you do get into one.\n\n4. Fine-Tune Your Conversation Skills\n\nIf you don’t know how to talk to girls, you won’t be able to connect deeply enough to have a relationship with them.\n\nAnd so, you need to fine-tune your conversation skills. Luckily, you’re in the right place for that, as I have a shit-ton of content about how to talk to girls and have better conversations. Hell, I even wrote a best-selling book about how to talk to girls.\n\nHere are some tips to help you fine-tune your conversation skills:\n\nKeep the conversation focused on the girl\n\nUse emotional conversation topics like these\n\nAvoid the common conversation mistakes that turn women off\n\nAsk her the right questions\n\n5. Start Getting Your Shit Together\n\nAny random schmuck with some game can bring home a high quality girl on any given night. But keeping her around for the long-term is a different story (that’s why so many guys are left scratching their heads when wondering how to get a girlfriend).\n\nIf you aren’t at least trying to get your shit together, don’t expect to maintain relationships with high quality girls.\n\nThink about it: a Victoria’s Secret model is not going to date a dude with a shitty job who’s still living with his parents.\n\nBut here’s the beautiful thing: You don’t actually need to have your shit together right now. But you do need to at least be working towards that.\n\nWomen want to see that you have potential, drive, and purpose. They don’t want a dude who’s going through the motions of life with no control or plan.\n\nSo, how can you start getting your shit together?\n\nSet strong goals for yourself and actually pursue them\n\nDo whatever you can to get out of your parents’ house\n\nStop working shitty jobs you hate (and consider quitting them and getting freedom in your life)\n\nHit the gym and workout consistently\n\nHang around with higher quality guys who are following their own purpose\n\nLearn new skills and make more money\n\n6. Learn to Flirt Like a Pro\n\nFlirting is the way you arouse a girl’s interest and make her picture the two of you together romantically. It’s essential to your conversations with women, and also keeps you out of the friendzone.\n\nMost guys don’t flirt well because they’re afraid to take risks. They don’t want to show their cards and make the girl make a decision about whether she likes them. But if you want to flirt like a pro, you need to take some risks.\n\nThose risks involve teasing a girl, getting physical from the outset, and even dropping in the occasional sexual innuendo.\n\n7. Develop Your Sexy Vibe\n\nThis ties into flirting like a pro. If you don’t have a sexy vibe, you won’t be able to flirt with her in a sexy way.\n\nAnd so, it’ll be a lot harder to have sex with women, which in turn makes it much harder to date them.\n\nYour sexy vibe is made up of 2 components:\n\nThe Surface level (what she can see). These are things you can physically do right now to have a sexy vibe around women. Under the hood (your mindset and characteristics). These are things you must develop and internalize over time\n\nSurface level stuff includes things like walking slower, talking slower, holding eye contact, and having a sexy simile.\n\nUnder the hood stuff includes things like assuming attraction and building your charisma.\n\nFull a full guide on this, check out this article: How to Have a Sexy Vibe Around Women\n\n8. Learn How to Have Great Sex\n\nYou can have all the fundamentals down and be a super cool guy. But if you don’t know how to fuck a girl the right way, don’t expect any girls to stick around for long… at least, not any high quality girls.\n\n(And if she does stick around, she’ll most likely be getting some D on the side.)\n\nOn the other hand, great sex can literally get a girl addicted to you.\n\nHere are some sex fundamendals to help you improv in the sack:\n\nUse the right positions (a mix of maximized and minimized skin-to-skin contact)\n\nBe more dominant (pull her hair, spank her, tell her to get into positions instead of asking)\n\nUse foreplay\n\nBuild your stamina so you can fuck her for at least 30 minutes to an hour consistently\n\n9. Put Yourself in Position to Meet Girls You Have Chemistry With\n\nChemistry makes dating fun. The more of it you have with women, the more exciting and fulfilling your dating life will be. Plus, you’ll have the best, most emotionally charged sex with the women you have chemistry with.\n\nWhat’s more, girls you have chemistry with make for the best girlfriends. That natural spark is there from the beginning, and you can’t really fake it or manufacture it (though you’ll meet a lot more girls you have chemistry with if you have your dating fundamentals down).\n\nSo, how do you put yourself in position to meet women you have chemistry with?\n\nDo activities that align with your passions and interests. Aim for activities that 1) interest you and 2) match up with the interests and passions of the type of women you want.\n\nAim for activities that 1) interest you and 2) match up with the interests and passions of the type of women you want. Find your ideal mating market , aka the place where you have the best chances of meeting your ideal type of girl and achieving your definition of dating success (for me, that’s proven to be Mexico City and New York).\n\n, aka the place where you have the best chances of meeting your ideal type of girl and achieving your definition of dating success (for me, that’s proven to be Mexico City and New York). Develop the “approach habit”. Basically, whenever you see a girl you find attractive, get in the habit of walking towards her and at the very least making a simple approach, like “Do you know where the nearest Starbucks is?” As it becomes habit, you can be more direct and tell her you think she’s attractive and that’s why you had to say hi.\n\n10. Solidify Your First-Date Strategy\n\n(I teamed up with my buddy David De Las Morenas from HowToBeast for this video)\n\nBefore you can make her your girlfriend, you need to have the first date. And so, you should solidify your first date strategy.\n\nYou should aim to lead her, move quickly, and end your first dates in sex. This will give you the best chance at seeing her again and potentially making her your girlfriend.\n\nHere are some tips to solidify your first date strategy (other than those in the video above):\n\nAssume she’s the type of girl who has sex on the first date\n\nAsk her the right questions to connect with her\n\nGet the logistics in your favor (i.e. set up the date close to your place)\n\n11. Build It Gradually\n\nOnce you actually start hanging out with her over the course of a few dates, aim to build things gradually.\n\nYou should hang out with her 1-2 times per week MAX for at least the first couple of months. Then, you can gradually move up to 2-3 times and so on.\n\nThe beginning of the relationship is where the expectations are set, and also where the growth begins. If you start off hanging with her 3-4 times a week from the beginning, there’s not really much room for growth after that. And once she feels like the growth has stopped, things will start to stagnate. Plus if you try hanging with her less after that (like moving from 4 days a week to 2 days a week) she’s going to feel like something is wrong with the relationship.\n\nYou might also want to hold off on doing tons of adventurous and fun stuff right at the beginning. Again, this sets the expectation. So unless you have enough adventurous and fun stuff to last you each week throughout the length of the relationship, it’s better to gradually build up to this type of stuff over time, and instead opt for relaxed dates like dinner at your place, movies, etc. This will help you keep the excitement going later on.\n\n12. Always Be Leading\n\nAs a man, you need to know how to lead women. It doesn’t matter if you just met her at the bar or if you’re married to her – you need to always be leading and taking initiative (this is one of the most important aspects when it comes to how to get a girlfriend).\n\nThat means you take the lead on making plans (though you can obviously be open to her suggestions), lay the ground rules for the relationship early on, manage her emotions, and generally be moving the relationship in the right direction.\n\nThis will keep both of you happy. It’ll help you avoid being the pussy-whipped guy who is more or less his girlfriend’s bitch, and it’ll also allow her to relax and go along for the ride with you.\n\n13. Don’t Be Phased By Her B.S.\n\nEvery girl is at least a little crazy some of the time. Women are more emotional than us men, and they like to argue emotionally. Plus, the hotter she is, the more she’ll usually test you by doing seemingly crazy shit.\n\nThe key though, is to not be reactive to it. The weak man is very affected by the B.S. his girlfriend dishes out. It worries him, ruins his day, and makes him supplicate to his woman and try to “fix” the situation.\n\nBut instead, you should remain calm, remind yourself that “bitches be crazy”, and let her go through her little episode without making you lose your cool. She’ll come to her senses in a little while and realize she was being a little crazy. And the more she realizes her craziness doesn’t get a reaction out of you, the less she’ll have crazy episodes (though these crazy episodes will always happen at least sometimes).\n\nWrapping Up How to Get a Girlfriend…\n\nMost guys end up with girls they’re not all that crazy about. They settle, and it’s kind of sad.\n\nBut you don’t have to have that same fate. You can get a girlfriend you actually like if you follow the right steps.\n\nTo recap, here’s how to get a girlfriend and make her want you in 13 steps:\n\n1. Let go of the girls from your past\n\n2. Know what you want in a woman (and don’t settle)\n\n3. Don’t be in “girlfriend search mode”\n\n4. Fine-tune your conversation skills\n\n5. Start getting your shit together\n\n6. Learn to flirt like a pro\n\n7. Develop your sexy vibe\n\n8. Learn how to have great sex\n\n9. Put yourself in position to meet girls you have chemistry with\n\n10. Solidify your first-date strategy\n\n11. Build it gradually\n\n12. Always be leading\n\n13. Don’t be phased by her B.S.\n\nAnd remember: take your time with new girls. Don’t rush into things, but instead build it gradually. That’ll help you have much more fulfilling relationships with your future girlfriends.\n\nWhat’s been the biggest thing stopping you from getting a girlfriend?

Gen H.R. McMaster, said on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"\n\n\"What terrorism is is the use of violence to incite terror and fear, and of course it was terrorism.\"\n\nMcMaster's words went further than Trump's did on Saturday, when Trump was widely criticized by members of both parties for placing blame on \"many sides\" for violence that was sparked by a white nationalist rally and for not specifically naming and condemning the racist groups involved.\n\nMcMaster said the president intended to denounce the racists.\n\n\"He condemned hatred and bigotry on all sides, and that includes white supremacists and neo-Nazis,\" McMaster said. \"I think it's clear — I know it's clear in his mind and ought to be clear to all Americans: We cannot tolerate, obviously, that bigotry, that hatred that is rooted in ignorance, ignorance of what America stands for, what America is.\"\n\nBut McMaster also offered very vague answers when asked more than once whether he can work with Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, since considerable friction between the two advisers has seeped into the public.\n\n\"I am ready to work with anybody who will help advance the president's agenda and advance the security, prosperity of the American people,\" McMaster answered.\n\nAsked whether Bannon is someone who does that, McMaster didn't specifically answer.

Mr. Johnson was also cited for a marked lanes violation.\n\nDudley District Court Judge Neil G. Snider ordered Mr. Johnson to remain alcohol free with random testing, and a pretrial hearing was set for Oct. 28.\n\nA prosecutor requested $10,000 bail, in part because the state could not impose a condition that Mr. Johnson wear an electronic monitor with a “Sobrietor” device that ensures he doesn't drink alcohol. That's because he resides in Connecticut.\n\nAbout 9:30 p.m. Wednesday night, all town emergency departments responded to a report that a Ford pickup had struck a house at 159 Lower Gore Road, a police report said.\n\nThe truck was resting on the front steps, police said.\n\nA group of people gathered outside, including homeowner Spencer P.

  "latent_24836": "They came in pursuit of what Gerard Piqué called “perfection” and, once again, they left the distinct sense this is the team that takes football to its highest levels. Lionel Messi and his exquisitely gifted team-mates put on a masterclass at times. They did not seem to care they were facing reputedly the best defence in the competition and it was a thrilling way to complete the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and now the trophy that means more to this institution than anything else.\n\nIt was not quite perfection, perhaps, bearing in mind that spell in the second half when Álvaro Morata equalised and suddenly, for the first time, Andrea Pirlo and Paul Pogba were emboldened to think they could take control in midfield. That, however, was only a small chunk out of the night. Juventus simply could not cope otherwise with the most devastating forward line on the planet and, on the balance of play, Barça should really have made it a more stress-free occasion before Neymar soothed any lingering nerves with his stoppage-time goal.\n\nBarcelona’s Luis Suárez, Leo Messi and Neymar too good for Juventus Read more\n\nThat was the final kick of the night but the more important goal came off Suárez’s right boot on 68 minutes, following in after Messi’s shot had come back off Gianluigi Buffon and firing the rebound high into the net. That was Buffon’s one mistake of a night when there were other moments to remind us of his enduring brilliance. Yet there was no way his team-mates could leave him so exposed so many times and expect to get away with it. Either Juventus chose a bad night to forget their defensive structure or Messi et al were just too piercingly brilliant. Or maybe a bit of both. Either way, it was remarkable to see how many times a Juventus side with 27 clean sheets this season looked so vulnerable and overrun.\n\nMessi did everything but score. Andrés Iniesta has now set up goals in three different Champions League finals and what a way for Xavi Hernández to usher himself out of the club he has served with such distinction. Xavi came on as a substitute and it was Ivan Rakitic, the man keeping him out, who scored the opening goal. After the final whistle, there was a lovely moment when Xavi and Pirlo came together in an emotional embrace, knowing they would never play for these clubs again. Soon afterwards, Piqué could be seen taking a pair of scissors to the net and leaving with it as his personal souvenir. The tickertape came down and Barça soaked in their fifth European Cup, bringing them level with Bayern Munich and Liverpool.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jubilant Barcelona fans gather at Las Ramblas boulevard to celebrate their team beating Juventus 3-1 in the Champions League final\n\nPresumably, they were just kidding with everyone when Javier Mascherano gave the ball away inside the opening minute and then seconds later fumbled the ball out of play from a misplaced Sergio Busquets pass. For a very brief period a few of us wondered whether a team of serial champions might not actually be immune to nerves, after all. But it was a deception – and we were ridiculous to think it.\n\nAfter three minutes, Messi collected the ball and drove a sumptuous pass 20 yards to his left. Jordi Alba turned it inside to Neymar and the momentum was building: a blur of passing and movement and pinball speed. Iniesta had eluded Arturo Vidal and was running into the penalty area. Neymar’s pass was beautifully weighted and the way Iniesta still had the presence of mind to slip the ball inside to Rakitic rather than shooting himself was just another snapshot of this team’s ethic. Every outfield player bar Luis Suárez had been involved in the exchange of passes and, by half-time, the only possible complaint for Barcelona was that their early domination had not transferred into the hard currency of goals.\n\nGianluigi Buffon and Juventus veterans find destiny favours Barcelona Read more\n\nBuffon made outstanding saves and screamed at his defenders. Messi was passing the ball like there was a computer chip in his boot and Dani Alves slipped the ball through the gap in Vidal’s legs. The nutmeg is football’s most patronising put-down – and Barça’s speciality. For a few moments – only a few moments – even Pirlo looked panicked.\n\nThe bianconeri took a long while to shake their head clear and their equaliser 10 minutes into the second half felt almost like a jolt. Claudio Marchisio’s backheel was one of the night’s outstanding moments. Stephan Lichtsteiner, overlapping from right-back, ran on to the ball to set up Carlos Tevez and the rebound fell perfectly for Morata once Marc-André ter Stegen had blocked the initial effort. From six yards, the former Real Madrid player could barely miss.\n\nFor a while, Juventus had their opponents rattled. Suárez’s quick instincts turned everything back in Barça’s favour and, after that, there was always the risk that Juventus would leave themselves open in their search for an equaliser. The truth is they had played that way all night. Even at the start of the second half Barcelona were allowed the freedom to launch a five-on-three attack.\n\nJuventus 1-3 Barcelona: Champions League final player ratings Read more\n\nTwo minutes after Suárez’s goal, a header from Neymar beat Buffon again but was ruled out because the ball had thudded off his forehead on to his outstretched hand. The little Brazilian was a constant menace. His goal was an emphatic left-foot finish, after the Juventus defence had been outnumbered again, and that was the moment the tension was replaced with euphoria.\n\nBarcelona had produced something exhilarating, but what else did we really expect?",

  "latent_24867": "SEOUL, Dec. 23 (Yonhap) — Unionized pilots at South Korea’s largest flag carrier Korean Air Lines Co. continued their 10-day strike on Friday aimed at demanding better pay and improved working conditions.\n\nSome 190 pilots out of the total 2,300 at Korean Air took part in the second day of the strike scheduled to end Dec. 31.\n\nUnder a 2010 revision to the aviation law, up to 20 percent, or some 460, of the unionized pilots could have taken part in the strike. However, the union said it decided to minimize the number out of concerns that a greater number taking part could cause great inconvenience for passengers or undermine the overall safety of flights as those who continue working would be forced to work overtime.\n\nThe union has said the strike itself, at least partly, sought to help improve the safety of Korean Air flights.\n\nThe first walkout by Korean Air pilots in 11 years came after year-long negotiations over a wage increase failed.\n\nThe company continues to insist on a 1.9-percent raise, while the pilots demand a 29-percent hike, down from their initial demand of 34 percent.\n\nThe pilots insist such a high increase was necessary to end what they called a steady departure of experienced pilots to foreign airlines, especially those in China, which are said to pay up to three times higher than their South Korean competitors, including Korean Air.\n\nThey said job positions left by experienced pilots have been filled with young, inexperienced aviators, which in turn has led to an apparent drop in the overall safety of Korean Air flights.\n\n“The requested increase rate is a rather symbolic figure that represents our demand to bring the working conditions of Korean Air pilots to those of international standards,” the union has said.\n\n“We have repeatedly expressed our intention to call off the strike should the management offer even 1,000 won (US$0.84) more than their initial offer, but our request has ultimately been rejected.”\n\nOver the 10-day strike, only an average of two international flights will be cancelled per day, with a total 24 international flights set to be called off over the period. The number represents only 2 percent of 1,293 previously scheduled international flights, the company said earlier.\n\n“We greatly regret the fact that the pilot union has decided to go on strike, completely ignoring the inconvenience it will cause our passengers. But we will work to bring this to an end at the earliest date possible through continued discussions with the pilot union,” Korean Air said in a press release.",

He added that it would continue in this manner until certain bargaining demands from the province are withdrawn or until the union determines further actions are required.\n\nWhat are the issues?\n\nThe Ontario Public School Boards Association (OPSBA), which bargains with teachers, says staffing and workload provisions have not kept pace with changes in the classroom.\n\nOPSBA says on its website that the collective agreement with teachers must \"address declining enrolment, equity and inclusion [and] application of technology.\"\n\nBut the union says the demands tabled by OPSBA and the province include provisions that could increase the number of students in classrooms, direct how teachers spend their preparation time and rescind \"fair and transparent\" hiring practices.\n\n\"OPSBA wants the ability to determine how teachers teach,\" said Hammond in an earlier statement.\n\nWhat are teachers still doing?\n\nAccording to a bulletin, which was circulated by the union and obtained by CBC News on May 8, ETFO members will continue to teach, take attendance and \"provide extra help\" to students.\n\nThey will also maintain contact with parents \"during the instructional day\" and provide school administrators with student marks for the June report card.\n\nParticipation in extra curricular activities and field trips will continue for now.\n\nWhat aren't teachers doing?\n\nHowever, teachers will not fill out comments on those report cards, according to the same bulletin.\n\nTeachers will also not attend staff, divisional or ministry of education meetings. They will not conduct any reading, writing or math assessments — unless the teacher deems them necessary to report on student progress.\n\nTeachers will not participate in ministry webinars, activities or professional development workshops.\n\nThe union says its members will also abstain from any activity connected to the province's Education Quality and Accountability Office, which conducts standardized tests in key subjects to students in Grades 3, 6, and 9.\n\nThe bulletin describes these efforts as \"phase one\" of the union's work-to-rule plan, but Hammond would not say what subsequent phases might look like, or when they might roll out.\n\n\"We don't want the other phases to roll out,\" he told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"We have not set a timeline for any of those things.\"",
  "latent_24911": "NEW YORK – While skimming tens of millions of dollars from U.N. levies imposed on airline travelers, the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Health Aids Initiative worked closely with a pharmaceutical company in India to distribute “drastically substandard” generic antiretroviral drugs to Third World countries that had no chance of helping HIV/AIDs patients, according to a Wall Street analyst.\n\nAs WND reported Wednesday, over the past six weeks, Charles Ortel shared with WND, prior to publication, the results of his six-month, in-depth investigation into what he characterizes as an elaborate scheme devised by the Clintons to enrich themselves. WND reported Thursday the Clintons appear to have personally profited from an airline-ticket levy program run by the U.N. group UNITAID that used the Clintons’ international prestige to “leverage” manufacturers of prescription quality drugs and health-care products and sell them to developing countries at a discount price.\n\nIra Magaziner, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of the Clinton Health Aids Initiative, known as CHAI, approached the Indian company, Ranbaxy, in 2002 to negotiate a deal. It allowed CHAI to assume a controlling position to administer the airline-ticket levy program through UNITAID, a program of the U.N.’s World Health Organization in Geneva.\n\nCHAI proposed to Ranbaxy that “they could put the developing countries together to form a sort of ‘buying club’ that could “ramp up economies of scale and lower cost,” according to Professors Ethan B. Kapstein of Arizona State University and Joshua W. Busby of the University of Texas at Austin in their Cambridge University Press 2013 book “AIDS Drugs for All.”\n\nAnother scandal with Hillary Clinton at the center is uniquely exposed in Aaron Klein’s “The REAL Benghazi Story: What the White House and Hillary Don’t Want You to Know”\n\nA Kaiser Health News “Morning Briefing” dated Nov. 21, 2003, reported former President Bill Clinton “visited Indian generic drug Ranbaxy Laboratories’ pharmaceutical plant in Gurgaon, India, to show support for Indian companies that have agreed to manufacture low-cost generic antiretroviral drugs for nationwide HIV/AIDS treatment plans in four African and more than 12 Caribbean countries.”\n\nClinton hooks up with UNITAID and WHO\n\nAccording to the UNITAID website, CHAI, established by President Bill Clinton in 2002, approached UNITAID, created in 2006, “to reach groups in developing countries that were neglected by HIV drug markets,” resolving to combine forces in 2008.\n\nThe UNITAID-CHAI joint venture’s goal was to combine UNITAID’s innovative financing that relied on levies charged on airline tickets in participating countries with CHAI’s entrepreneurial approach to getting international pharmaceutical companies to produce antiretroviral, or ARV, drugs throughout the developed world at prices discounted because of the massive scale of the market.\n\n“The deal positioned the Clinton Foundation to have access to hundreds of millions of dollars from what amounted to a tax imposed on millions of average airline passengers,” explained Ortel.\n\n“The Clinton Foundation financial reporting strongly suggests the Clintons were able to skim off for their personal use tens of millions of dollars from the funds WHO sent to CHAI from UNITAID levies,” Ortel said.\n\n“The scam was perfected,” he concluded, “when a key player in developing the CHAI ‘discount generic drug’ strategy touted as revolutionary by Bill and Hillary Clinton, namely Ranbaxy in India, achieved their ‘economy of scale’ by selling drugs the company knew were so drastically substandard that the Ranbaxy ARV products had no chance of curing any HIV/AIDS patients taking the drugs in the third world countries to which the Clinton Foundation delivered them.\n\n“It seems in hindsight a textbook case of reckless and wanton neglect,” Ortel stressed.\n\n‘It’s just blacks dying’\n\nRanbaxy on May 13, 2013, pleaded guilty to seven federal criminal counts of selling adulterated drugs with an intent to defraud.\n\nThe company failed to report that its drugs didn’t meet specifications and made intentionally false statements to the government.\n\nRanbaxy agreed to pay $500 million in fines, forfeitures and penalties, the most ever levied against a generic-drug company.\n\nA Fortune magazine article in May 2013 by investigative reporter Katherine Eban titled “Dirty Medicine” detailed the Ranbaxy pharmaceutical scandal.\n\nThe article captured the moral bankruptcy of Ranbaxy through a conference call Dr. Kathy Spreen, Ranbaxy’s executive director of clinical medicine, had with a dozen company executives in which a participating Ranbaxy executives dismissed concern that the company was producing defective drugs.\n\n“Who cares? It’s just blacks dying,” the executive said, according to Fortune.\n\nFortune further reported a decision by Ranbaxy to withdraw all seven of its ARVs tested by Vimta Labs from WHO prequalification, as announced by the WHO Nov. 9, 2004, was dishonest.\n\nRanbaxy executives plotted to blame the problem on fraudulent tests run by one rogue contractor without disclosing further problems that may have made it more difficult, if not impossible, to re-establish WHO approval of Ranbaxy ARV drugs tested by labs other than Vimta.\n\nLess than a year later, on Aug. 16, 2005, Ranbaxy managed to get the World Health Organization to reinstate the seven ARV drugs to the WHO prequalification list. The company did it simply by convincing the WHO that Ranbaxy management had solved the problem by replacing Vimta Labs with “globally recognized contract research organizations” assigned to conduct independent tests of the ARV drugs Ranbaxy had produced in its “WHO-approved plants.”\n\nThe Fortune magazine exposé, however, made clear Ranbaxy never stopped the subterfuge until forced to do so by the Department of Justice settlement in 2013.\n\nFortune reported Ranbaxy “manipulated almost every aspect of its manufacturing process to quickly produce impressive-looking data,” including forging standard operating procedures to hide from health inspectors the truth that Ranbaxy never stopped substituting “cheaper, lower-quality ingredients in place of better ingredients, to manipulate test parameters to accommodate higher impurities, and even to substitute brand-name drugs in lieu of their own generics in bioequivalence tests to produce better results.”\n\nThe Fortune article further exposed “systematic fraud in Ranbaxy’s worldwide regulatory filings” designed to hide that the majority of products filed in Brazil, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Romania, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and African nations “have data submitted that did not exist or data from products and from other countries.”\n\nFortune noted Ranbaxy “not only invented data but also fraudulently mixed and matched data, taking the best results from manufacturing in one market and presenting it to regulators elsewhere as data unique to drugs in their markets.”\n\nFor its HIV drugs, Fortune concluded Ranbaxy “had used ingredients that failed purity tests and blended them with good ingredients until the resulting mix met requirements,” such that “a mélange cold degrade or become toxic far more quickly than drugs made from the high-quality materials required.”\n\n“The Ranbaxy tragedy,” Ortel pointed out, “was that even after the Clintons had reason to suspect Ranbaxy was producing defective ARV drugs for HIV/AIDS patients in Third World countries.\n\n“Yet, CHAI continued to allow Ranbaxy to sell Ranbaxy ARV drugs into the stream of pharmaceuticals that flowed to desperately poor suffers, as if there were no problem.”\n\nClintons endorse Ranbaxy\n\nA UNITAID press release May 17, 2011, announced that since 2008, the CHAI partnership with UNITAID had “achieved price reductions that will generate global savings of at least $600 million over the next three years, making HIV treatment more widely available.”\n\n“With more than nine million people worldwide in need of HIV/AIDS treatment, we must see rapid action to increase people’s access to treatment,” Clinton said in the UNITAID press release.\n\n“Over 70 countries and 70% of the HIV-infected population have access to the prices my Foundation negotiated; so these new price reductions, which have been agreed to by a wide range of suppliers, will provide millions of people with increased access to better, cheaper and more convenient first and second-line drug regimens,” Clinton continued. “We have helped almost four million people gain access to life-saving medicine, and I’m proud that we can now reach millions more.”\n\nWhat Clinton neglected to mention was that since the formation of the CHAI partnership with UNITAID in 2008 through the date of the 2011 press release, Ranbaxy ARV drugs were on the list of CHAI-provided HIV/AIDS drugs available for distribution in Third World countries.\n\nFortune made clear the Ranbaxy scam of producing adulterated ARV drugs was known to Ranbaxy executives as early as 2004. It was made public in a U.S. Justice Department court filing in 2008 but not stopped until January 2012, when the Justice Department placed Ranbaxy under a sweeping consent degree the Justice Department described as “ground breaking in its international reach.”\n\nThe UNITAID May 15, 2013, statement mentioned in the last paragraph that Ranbaxy was among the CHAI/UNITAID “key suppliers of ARVs.”\n\nA CHAI-produced “Antiretroviral (ARV) Price List” dated May 2011 that includes Ranbaxy on the list of approved drugs boasted: “The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) supports national governments to expand high-quality care and treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS. CHAI offers reduced prices for antiretrovirals (ARVs) to members of its Procurement Consortium.”\n\nYet, in a visit to Mumbai April 11, 2013, Bill Clinton praised Ranbaxy for its role in assisting his Clinton Foundation in leading efforts to treat AIDS patients by agreeing 10 years earlier to cut the price of its ARV drugs sold in developing nations.\n\n“I told myself that never again will I come to India without saying a thank you,” drawing applause from 600-plus people who included “some of India Inc.’s leading CEOs, businessmen, and strategists,” the Economic Times reported.\n\nDespite Ranbaxy being in the process of finalizing the $500 million settlement with the Department of Justice, Clinton was as enthusiastic during his 2013 to India as he was 10 years earlier, when on Nov. 21, 2003, he was there to announce the Ranbaxy deal.\n\nIn 2003, Clinton used a Ranbaxy R&D facility in New Delhi to hold a press conference with Prime Minister Atai Bihari Vajpayee and several representatives of the Indian government to announce the Clinton Foundation had just reached an agreement with Ranbaxy to sell to HIV/AIDS patients in the developing world.\n\nIn the speech, Clinton bragged the Clinton Foundation in conjunction with Ranbaxy aimed to make low-cost ARV drugs in the countries of South Africa, Rwanda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Haiti, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and the Eastern Caribbean States with the goal of making ARVs available to “some 2 million people around the world in the next four to five years.”",

I knew where all the sweet spots and hottest areas were. Now, I am figuring it out all over again! That’s half of the fun I guess. On this round of experimentation, I weaved some bacon together and wrapped it around a Pork Loin.\n\nPork Loin is one of my favorite things to grill. If you do it right it comes off so tender! They are actually really simple to do as well. I like to season mine with a basic Pork Seasoning. I used a State Fair Seasoning from a local guy that is awesome. I rub it down and then I wrap the bacon weave around it. Depending on flavor, I sometimes like to sprinkle some of the rub on the bacon as well.\n\nI fill my chimney up with Lump Charcoal and I get the coals going. Once they are ready, I dumped the coals to 1 side of the grill. My temp goal is about 350 to 400 degrees. I like to throw some wood chips (dry) on the coals before I add the meat so that first couple rotations under the lid are really smokey. You can really see the smoke\n\nI like to lay the pork loins right on the edge of the coals and as the coals die down, I move the loins closer over the top. With the lid on and vents open, I like to let the Pork sit for about 4 minutes or so and then I rotate it around. I do this about for about 15 minutes or so or until the internal temp of the Pork Loin hits about 145 to 150 degrees. Pull it off the grill and let it sit for about 10 minutes to rest.\n\nSlice it up and enjoy!",

  "latent_25586": "Photo: MEMS Industry Group Jack McCauley\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m one of those extremely motion sensitive people who, so far, haven’t found Virtual Reality to be a friendly environment. People keep telling me that faster refresh rates and higher resolution displays have gone a long way to eliminate VR sickness for many people—but you couldn’t prove it by me.\n\nJack McCauley, the co-founder Oculus VR who now spends most of his time in his own R&D laboratory in Livermore, Calif., says that’s because VR sickness is not all about the display. This week in Napa, Calif., McCauley addressed the MEMS Executive Congress—a gathering of people who run the companies that design, build, use, and invest in MEMS technology. He said the problem is head-tracking: current VR systems just don’t do a good enough job.\n\n“High refresh rates and high render rates do not relieve motion sickness, they only add unnecessary cost to VR systems,” he stated on a slide.\n\nMcCauley, who left Oculus shortly after its 2014 acquisition by Facebook, is a tinkerer (he was officially named a “Junior Tinkertoy Engineer” by Tinkertoy at age nine). And inventing through tinkering is how he intends to solve the head-tracking problem.\n\nGiving attendees a peek at his cluttered Livermore laboratory, as well as a peek into his thought processes, McCauley said that MEMS are the key to solving the head tracking problem. “If you are a MEMS manufacturer and you aren’t involved with VR, you should be,” he said. But it wasn’t just the basic motion tracking sensors he was talking about.\n\nIndeed, all of the VR headgear coming out relies on sensors, like three-axis gyroscopes, to detect head motions including micro adjustments in posture. But these sensors don’t necessarily know that the wearer is moving about a room, particularly if he’s doing so without moving his head much. Motion tracking based on these head-mounted sensors might get better as people begin to add algorithms that describe the kinematics of the body; that’s going to take a lot of research, McCauley indicated. But in the meantime, an easier way to fix this shortcoming is to add an external camera that looks for markers on the headgear. That’s what McCauley says he did in building the webcam-based tracking system for the Oculus DK2.\n\nBut a camera-based approach, McCauley said, has a fundamental limitation: It pushes way too much data to the processor, and the system just can’t keep up. The image analysis software has to evaluate at least 60 frames of video per second, extract position info, and then give it to the VR software, which then estimates a little bit ahead of where the player was in order to render the next image. “You can only run that so fast,” he said.\n\nA better approach, McCauley determined, is that used in the HTC Vive, due to ship to consumers next year. The Vive tracking system, which the company calls Lighthouse, relies on two infrared laser scanners placed in the room, and photo sensors on the Vive headset that register the passing of the laser beam.\n\n“The computation is simple,” McCauley said. “No frame buffer, no processing to speak of; you just calculate the timing.”\n\nThe Vive system, however, has limitations. It uses motors to move the mirrors that direct the laser beams; they end up sweeping the room about 100 times per second.\n\n“I want to run at 1 kilohertz,” McCauley said. He decided motors wouldn’t get him there, so he turned to looking at MEMS mirrors. Here’s where the tinkering came in. He took apart a laser printer to look at the motor assembly, then took apart a picoprojector that used MEMS mirrors to steer beams. He determined that MEMS scanning is a far better approach.\n\nIt’s a work in progress.\n\n“I’m going to use a couple of MEMS mirrors and a laser,” he said. “It will be portable; I will be able to stick it on the wall and walk around in my [VR] play volume.”\n\nHe’s also been thinking about another big problem with VR: improper audio modeling—but his speaking time was up, so he took those thoughts with him back to his lab.",
  "latent_25928": "j-j-j-jQuery. It’s on everyone’s lips, right? You love it or you hate it, or you’ve never tried it but you love it, or you’ve never tried it but you super-hate it. Yeah, we know.\n\nWell, PJ and I launched FamSpam a bit ago and made the bold move of powering all the jabbascript with jQuery. We even wrote our own Facbeook-style lightbox library in jQuery (Facebox). So while this is a Ruby blog, indulge me for a moment as we dance with Ruby’s ugly-cool half-sister: Javascript.\n\nwhatQuery?\n\nThere are a bajillion posts about jQuery, all of which introduce you gently, so I will be brief: jQuery is all about a single namespace and kickass querying. (Get it?)\n\nOur buddy Hpricot, you may remember, was heavily influenced by jQuery’s selector syntax. Which was, in turn, heavily influenced by CSS selectors. As such, some of this may look familiar:\n\n$('#id').hide() $('.class').css('height', 20) $('#posts li > a').addClass('dark')\n\nAnd so forth. One of the fun things is that any of those $() queries may return 0, 1, or more elements—yet the code stays the same. That’s right: our css() call would affect the height of all matched elements. Same with the addClass. But, if nothing is found, it’ll all silently fail. jAwesome!\n\nniceQuery()\n\nWhile some of the recent “jQuery vs <insert_framework_here>” blog posts might not be so nice, jQuery itself certainly is: it (mostly) easily works alongside other libraries. That means you can start dipping your toe into the jSauce while your Prototype or MooTools code doesn’t suspect a thing.\n\nIt’s easy:\n\njQuery.noConflict()\n\njQuery('#id').hide() jQuery('.class').css('height', 20) jQuery('#posts li > a').addClass('dark')\n\nMy above examples would now be written like this:\n\nThe noConflict() call causes jQuery to defer ownership of $() to Moo or Proto, leaving your current js intact. How thoughtful. Check more at the comprehensive doc site.\n\nchainQuery()\n\njQuery is all about chaining, in a big way. Here’s an example from FamSpam:\n\nvar person_email = $(this).parent().find('#person_email').val()\n\nPretty self explanatory. The find is scoped to the receiver, in this case the parent of the current element.\n\nAnother cool chain:\n\n$('#invite_error').show().text('Please enter an email and a name.')\n\nHrm, we should probably put text() before show(), yeah? I love these kind of questions!\n\nFinally, a slightly more advanced chain:\n\n$('#facebox .body').children().hide().end(). append('<div class=\"loading\"><img src=\"'+$s.loading_image+'\"/></div>')\n\nGet it? The end() reverts the most recent ‘destructive’ (read: find) operation. So we start with the .body, then find its children, then hide its children, then go back to .body and append some html. Slick, I think. Real slick.\n\nLike I said, the doc site is super great.\n\nujsQuery()\n\nOkay, here’s the segue: jQuery has unobtrusiveness built in. And it feels smooth. Real smooth.\n\nHere, a snippet straight from FamSpam’s javascript:\n\n$('.reset_invite_form').click(function() { $('#new_person').resetForm() $('#invite_another').hide() $('#invite_another > span').remove() $('#new_person').show() return false })\n\nPretty simple, right? And clear, to boot. What we do is slip this code inside of a function passed to $(document).ready(), which will be run when the, erm, document is, uh, ready.\n\n$(document).ready(function { $('.reset_invite_form').click(function() { ... stuff ... }) })\n\nLike this:\n\nSo on and so forth. We attach Facebox to links the same way:\n\nif ($.facebox) $('a[rel*=facebox]').facebox()\n\nIf the Facebox plugin is loaded, we find any links with a rel of “facebox” and convert them from normal links into jsery’d Facebox links. Easy as pie.\n\nWhich brings us, of course, to the segue.\n\nspamQuery()\n\nHow are we using jQuery on FamSpam? jRails? Something custom? By hand?!\n\nYeah, well, by hand. We add all our behavior unobtrusively using the method detailed above. As far as I know, there’s no javascript in our html. If there is it’s on the run. For its life.\n\nIf you want to peep around, the js is (predictably) right here: http://famspam.com/javascripts/application.js.\n\nSomething to note: as of writing (1.2.2), jQuery doesn’t play nicely with Rails’ respond_to. But, hold the phone, it’s okay: a simple fix. Right here:\n\njQuery.ajaxSetup({ 'beforeSend': function(xhr) {xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\", \"text/javascript\")} })\n\nYou’re now ready to rock.\n\nOh, one more thing before we move on: if you want some ajax-flavored will_paginate, check out this short guide. It was mentioned in another post, and now it’s mentioned here.\n\nplugQuery()\n\njQuery, you see, has a wonderfully simple plugin system. We take full advantage of it by using a few choice plugins. Here’s a taste to wet your pallet.\n\nThe most essential plugin is the jQuery Form Plugin. With it, you can unobtrusively convert normal forms into ajax forms. The (obvious) advantage of this is graceful degradation, which is very kind but also very courageous.\n\n$('#new_person').ajaxForm(function() { alert('Atta boy!') })\n\nSeriously. Simple. And just so perfect for Rails—all the form’s attributes stay the same, including its action and method, just now it’s submitted through ajax. respond_to and jQuery are so in love it’s making me sick.\n\nAnother plugin we use is the Tablesorter. While we don’t have much tabular data on the promo or family sides of FamSpam, our admin interface is full of it. Want to sort your families by number of members? Conversations? Photos? It’s one line of code with this plugin. Sure, we’ll have to do some more complicated server-side sorting as our database grows, but this does the trick so quick right now.\n\n$('#sorted_table').tablesorter()\n\nSee?\n\nAnother plugin we really love is the anti-aliased rounded corner plugin. Unfortunately this is not the most popular rounded corner plugin for jQuery, and that’s a shame. A damn shame. Because it’s definitely the best. We use it on the home page and other places we thought could use some class.\n\nAs usual, it’s dead simple once installed:\n\n$('.corner').corner()\n\nYou don’t have to be so generic with it, but we like to be.\n\nFinally, the brand new autocomplete plugin by ReinH and wycats is simple, small, and slick. See a pattern here? We’re using this on our admin site and couldn’t be happier. It speaks JSON, baby. Sign me up.\n\nthatsitQuery()\n\nThanks for letting us stray for a moment from our normally dreary discourse. Got any other cool jQuery tips or treats? Leave ‘em in the comments.\n\nOh, a parting gift. More code to chew on: our tour.js. We use it to power the FamSpam tour. Enjoy.",
  "latent_25938": "Do violent video games cause violent behaviour in people?\n\nThe answer is as of yet unclear, and there is much ongoing debate as to whether video games increase aggressive tendencies or cause antisocial behaviour. It is hard to say that any study or research paper has conclusively answered that question. Perhaps the common anecdotal correlation between violent people and their playtime in violent games is actually the result of violent people being drawn to violent games, and not that the games cause the behaviour.\n\nLet’s instead discuss why video games tend to be so violent. There’s no question that violence sells; just take a look at the global top selling games this week at vgchartz. At the time of writing, the top 10 selling games this week are:\n\nEvery single game listed above features fighting and/or killing as a core gameplay mechanic. The top seller on this list, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, features the roguish action hero protagonist Nathan Drake murder countless baddies in his adventures. Doom, coming in at second, is a game that is famous for its bloody violence and excessive gore.\n\nIowa State University professor Douglas Gentile is a developmental psychologist who has spent years studying the effect of violent video games on young children and adolescents. He theorises that violent games tap into a primal survival instinct that we as humans have for the most part left behind.\n\n“There are two things that force us to pay attention,” Gentile says. “One is violence; the other is sex. Whenever either of those are present in our environment, they have survival value for us.”\n\nIn our modern society, violence has less of a significance in our lives than it did for our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Video games could provide an outlet for experiencing those primal instincts within a safe environment.\n\nVideo games are about escapism into a world where a player can interact and do whatever they so choose. They allow gamers to experience and do things that they otherwise wouldn’t be able to do, like explore fantasy worlds, drive a racing car, fight fantastical dragons, or go on a murderous rampage through a city. Violence is largely frowned upon by modern society, and so gamers can turn to video games as a way to live out those primal instincts that they can’t do in real life.\n\nThis is why Grand Theft Auto V is such an immensely popular success; the game essentially drops a player in a massive open-world city, and allows them to do whatever they want. This is where the concept of player agency comes in; GTAV isn’t really a violent game, but given the option to, most players will naturally want to do the things that are taboo in our society, without any real-life consequences.\n\nYou could conceivably spend the entire game playing golf and taking strolls on the beach, just as you could play as a psychotic murderer with no respect for red lights. GTAV could be called the perfect example of a game that gives the player full agency in a world of options with no consequences.\n\nI took the time to collect some more data from the vgchartz archives, looking at the top 15 best selling games from 2006-2015, and counting how many of those 15 featured violence as a core feature.\n\nI didn’t include the 2016 data in the graph because it’s not over yet, but so far, all but one of the 15 top selling games this year feature violence. The data reveals what could be considered an unsettling trend in video games towards more violent mechanics.It is important to note however that during 2006-2011 the Nintendo Wii and DS was at their peak in popularity, meaning that the charts were dominated by family-friendly titles such as Wii Sports and Nintendogs. Perhaps as graphics continue to get more realistic and immersive, the violence that we so love becomes that much more attractive. Or perhaps there’s a more complicated reason as to why games are becoming more violent in general.\n\nGame developers and producers make these violent games for two reasons:\n\nDevelopers want to make money and people pay money for violent games. Developers are also gamers, and as such they make games that they enjoy.\n\nThat’s not to say, however, that in all cases game developers make their games violent for the sake of it. Rather, in most cases the violence is just a necessary feature to create the type of game that they are making. For any story or piece of interactive media, there has to be a conflict to engage the viewer, and violence is a common and simple way to create conflict.\n\nInevitably, as people get used to playing violent games, they will want to play more violent games in order to scratch that itch. The trend is that people who start playing violent games won’t stop, and people who already play violent games won’t go back to playing non-violent games. In this way, the number of people overall who are interested in buying and playing violent games increases, thus companies will create a supply to meet that demand.\n\nThe nature of video games as a media form is that they build off of past games, in mechanics, conventions, and themes. So when developers go to create games, they will tend to build experiences that are similar to what they know and love. As more and more violent games get played, more and more violent games will get made.\n\nBy Johnathan Reid, for MAS110.\n\nWord count: 964\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_26113": "About a month ago we reported on the goings-on at Moneyglass, where the Winterfell set stands. Though we did point out “construction work at Moneyglass is par for the course,” the remodeling for season eight appeared to be particularly extensive at the castle’s walls — as if they were getting the set ready for a defensive battle sequence… Now, we may have not seen a White Walker around yet, but a new photo gives us a clear view of the nearly finished set — and the set expansion is even greater than we thought!\n\nBased on previous photos, we speculated the walls and gate towers were being refurbished, but now, thanks to Roy Dowie, it’s clear the work went beyond that:\n\n@paulorossradio being a Got fan have u seen this in Moneyglass pic.twitter.com/tOySPkiDGN — Roy Dowie (@spud1818) October 17, 2017\n\nFor starters, the outer walls now include crenellations, which are not only new for the Moneyglass set (though other parts already had them) but also for the fictional castle, which was always depicted with simpler battlements on the outer walls. For comparison:\n\nThe towers, on the other hand, have always been there when we watch the show — but not on the set, or not entirely: though there were foundations, the top of the gate towers and the guard towers were achieved via VFX. If they are bothering to actually build the crenellated walls and towers, that can only mean we’ll see actors interact with these defensive fortifications for the first time. The addition of so much snow piled up on the outside of the walls also points to that side being filmed, which has rarely been done.\n\nAll of this leads me to one inescapable conclusion: the production is getting the set ready for an attack. Though it’s something we all imagined, nonetheless it’s worthy of note now that there is actual evidence — Winterfell is getting sieged.\n\nAs an aside, two fun little interviews have surfaced, one of them with Paul Kaye, who plays Thoros of Myr — or rather played him, until a really pissed off bear got in the way:\n\n“[M]y ruckus with the zombie polar bear was filmed in Belfast,” Kaye tells Den of Geek. “I was fighting with some guy in a green suit holding a flaming wheelbarrow. It couldn’t get further from what ends up on telly!” he says, echoing the honesty of fellow cast member Rory McCann, who made us all laugh with “No, you’re not [a bear]; your name’s Toby!”\n\nIf the formation of the Brotherhood without Banjos wasn’t telling enough, Kaye exalts the camaraderie that was formed between the so-called “Magnificent Seven” during all those weeks in Iceland and Wolf Hill Quarry in Northern Ireland: “I’ll miss the boys. We all got on so well. Rory McGann [sic] and Richard Dormer and Kit [Harington] and Kristof [Hivju], Joe Dempsie… we all got on brilliantly. A great little gang.”\n\nFinally, for Digital Spy, Kit Karington gets emotional about the end of Game of Thrones:\n\n“Thrones is coming to the end at the right time for me, and everyone involved in it,” Harington claims. “I was exchanging emails with [showrunners] David [Benioff] Dan [Weiss] last night and we were all getting very soppy and emotional with each other.”\n\nBut it’s not all sadness: “It will be liberating, just the thought of having a whole year free — you shoot for six months, but half of the projects you might want to do will have started shooting before that six months is over. There’s a lot of things you can’t do. I’m looking forward to finishing, and eight years is the right amount of time. I wouldn’t want it to go on any longer than it has. I have other ideas I’d like to look at producing,” he says, in reference to the new show in which he is the star and producer: “I found the producing side of Gunpowder fascinating. I would like to do more of it. I’ve found it’s opened up a different side of my creative brain, which I’ve really enjoyed.”\n\n“Game of Thrones is coming to a very quick end, which I’m feeling emotional about,” he admits. “I’ve learned working with the Thrones producers what the job involves.”\n\nI don’t know about learning to be a producer, but I think we all share Harington’s bittersweet feelings about the show coming to an end. We all want the satisfaction of a resolution, but that also means there is no more Game of Thrones!",

  "latent_26282": "When Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was stunned.\n\nHis previous dealings with the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had led him to believe the British would never dare risk war with Germany.\n\nThe Nazi dictator turned to his foreign minister, Joachim Von Ribbentrop and said simply: \"What now?\"\n\nAs historian at the Imperial War Museum, Terry Charman, told BBC News Online: \"Hitler wanted a war but he didn't want the war he got.\"\n\nTwo days earlier, on 1 September, Hitler had unleashed his massed tanks, planes and infantry on Germany's weaker neighbour Poland.\n\nIt was the move that finally sparked World War II - one of the largest conflicts in human history.\n\nWhile German troops tore across the border, using faked Polish attacks on the German radio transmitter at Gleiwitz as their excuse for invasion, divisions of SS troops prepared to follow behind the regular army.\n\nAs Polish towns and cities burned under the ferocious attacks of the Nazi dive-bombers, Poland's allies Britain and France hesitated.\n\nMemories of World War I\n\nThe 3,000 French tanks and their 75 infantry divisions remained silent on Germany's western border, while in Britain children were being bundled into trains, taking them away from their parents and homes in the cities to the countryside - considered out of the reach of Nazi bombers.\n\nThe scars of World War I laid heavy on the two nations, but however reluctant their governments were to go to war against Germany once more - Hitler's cynical invasion of Poland ultimately forced their hands.\n\nWith his policy of appeasement in tatters, the British Prime Minister, Sir Neville Chamberlain teetered on the brink of declaring war. It was the last thing he wanted.\n\nBut in the face of a revolt from members of his Cabinet and a growing feeling in the country that Hitler must be tackled he had little choice.\n\nMr Charman told News Online: \"The public mood was such that Chamberlain would have probably been lynched if he had tried publicly to get out of his obligations to Poland.\"\n\nFrance in the front line\n\nIf the British government was unwilling to go to war so were Poland's allies, the French.\n\nWith the British Army capable of putting just two divisions in the field the French were painfully aware of their role. As Mr Charman says: \"If any fighting was going to be done on the Allied side in September 1939 it was going to be done by the French.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Britain the blackout had already begun, the fleet had been mobilised, Winston Churchill had been offered a post in the Cabinet and large public gatherings had been banned.\n\nGas masks were being distributed and the public had already been given information on how to prepare for air-raids. The wireless offered advice on how to make the most of tinned foods - fresh food would soon be in short supply.\n\nWith German attacks on Polish cities becoming increasingly violent, on Sunday 3 September Britain finally presented Germany with an ultimatum.\n\nWhen the British Ambassador to Germany took the document to the German foreign ministry at 9 o'clock that Sunday morning the Nazi Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop was absent.\n\nThe ultimatum\n\nThe ultimatum, which gave Germany two hours to withdraw its troops from Poland, was handed in to a lowly interpreter.\n\n\"Not for a moment did the Nazis give the document any serious consideration,\" says Mr Charman.\n\nWith no positive response from the Germans it was left to Chamberlain to announce to the British people over the radio that as of 11 o'clock 3 September 1939, the British Empire was at war with Germany.\n\nThe French declaration of war followed five hours later.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand and India all declared war on Germany on the same day - the other major nations of the British empire, South Africa and Canada, had declared war within the week.\n\nBut Ireland, America and Japan all declared their neutrality.\n\nUS neutral\n\nIn one of his famous fireside chats the American President Franklin Roosevelt made plain his country's intention to keep out of the war.\n\nBut though he refused to join the fight against the Nazis immediately, he told the American people that although the US would remain neutral in deed the people did not have to remain neutral in their hearts.\n\nWithin minutes of Chamberlain's declaration of war, air raid sirens sounded across London. The public, for the first time, rushed for the safety of the shelters, waiting for the all clear to sound.\n\nLuckily it was a false alarm. But the casualties in Poland were real enough.\n\nAlready thousands of soldiers and civilians had died at the hands of the Nazi war machine, but Poland was just the beginning.\n\nBy the time the war ended in victory for the Allies in 1945 nearly 50 million men, women and children from across five continents had died.",

For the English composer, see Denis King\n\nDenis (Portuguese: Dinis or Diniz, IPA: [diˈniʃ]; 9 October 1261 – 7 January 1325 in Santarém), called the Farmer King (Rei Lavrador)[1] and the Poet King (Rei Poeta), was King of Portugal and the Algarve. The eldest son of Afonso III of Portugal by his second wife, Beatrice of Castile, and grandson of king Alfonso X of Castile (known as the Wise), Denis succeeded his father in 1279. His marriage to Elizabeth of Aragon, who was later canonised as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church,[2] was arranged in 1281 when she was 10 years old.\n\nDenis ruled the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves for over 46 years and is remembered as a major contributor to the formation of a sense of national identity and an awareness of Portugal as a nation-state. He worked to reorganise his country's economy and gave an impetus to Portuguese agriculture. He ordered the planting of a large pine forest (that still exists today) near Leiria to prevent the soil degradation that threatened the region and as a source of raw materials for the construction of the royal ships.[3] He was also known for his poetry,[4] which constitutes a major contribution to the development of Portuguese as a literary language.\n\nReign [ edit ]\n\nThe royal couple\n\nIn 1290, Denis began to pursue the systematic centralisation of royal power by imposing judicial reforms, instituting the Portuguese language as the official language of the court, creating the first university in Portugal, and ridding the military orders in the country of foreign influences. His policies encouraged economic development with the creation of numerous towns and trade fairs.[5] He advanced the interests of the Portuguese merchants, and set up by mutual agreement a fund called the Bolsa de Comércio, the first documented form of marine insurance in Europe, approved on 10 May 1293.[6][7] Always concerned with development of the country's infrastructure, he encouraged the discovery and exploitation of sulphur, silver, tin and iron mines and organised the export of excess production of agricultural crops, salt, and salted fish to England, Flanders, and France.[5]\n\nDenis signed the first Portuguese commercial agreement with England in 1308, and secured a contract in 1317 for the services of the Genoese merchant sailor Manuel Pessanha (Portuguese form of the Italian \"Pezagno\") as hereditary admiral of his fleet,[8] with the understanding that Pessanha and his successors should provide twenty Genoese captains to command the king's galleys,[9] thus effectively founding the Portuguese navy.[10]\n\nIn 1289 Denis had signed an agreement with Pope Nicholas IV, swearing to protect the Church's interests in Portugal. When Pope Clement V allowed the annihilation of the Knights Templar throughout most of Europe on charges of heresy, Denis created in 1319 a Portuguese military order, the Order of Christ, for those knights who survived the purge.[11][12] The new order was designed to be a continuation of the Order of the Temple.[13] Denis negotiated with Clement's successor, John XXII, for recognition of the new order and its right to inherit the Templar assets and property.[14]\n\nCultural pursuits [ edit ]\n\nStatue of Denis at the University of Coimbra\n\nDuring Denis' reign, Lisbon became one of Europe's centres of culture and learning.[15][16] The first university in Portugal, then called the Estudo Geral (General Study), was founded with his signing of the document Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis in Leiria on 3 March 1290.[17] Lectures in the arts, civil law, canon law, and medicine were given, and on 15 February 1309, the king granted the university a charter, the Magna Charta Privilegiorum.[18] The university was moved between Lisbon and Coimbra several times, and finally installed permanently in Coimbra in 1537[19] by order of King John III.\n\nAs a devotee of the arts and sciences, Denis studied literature and wrote several books on topics ranging from government administration to hunting, science and poetry, as well as ordering the translation of many literary works into Galician-Portuguese (Portuguese had not yet fully evolved into a distinct language), among them the works attributed to his grandfather Alfonso X. He patronised troubadours, and wrote lyric poetry in the troubadour tradition himself. His best-known work is the Cantigas de Amigo, a collection of love songs as well as satirical songs, which contributed to the development of troubador poetry in the Iberian Peninsula. All told, 137 of the songs attributed to him, in the three main genres of Galician-Portuguese lyric,[20] are preserved in the two early 16th-century manuscripts, the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana.[21] A spectacular find in 1990 by American scholar Harvey Sharrer brought to light the Pergaminho Sharrer, which contains, albeit in fragmentary form, seven cantigas d'amor by King Denis with musical notation.[22][23] These poems are found in the same order in the two previously known codices.\n\nAdministration [ edit ]\n\nCross of the Order of Christ, a symbol that adorned, among others, the Portuguese caravels during the Age of Discoveries\n\nAs heir-apparent to the throne, Infante (Prince) Denis was summoned by his father Afonso III to share governmental responsibilities. The country was again in conflict with the Catholic Church at the time, Afonso having been excommunicated in 1277, and only being absolved in 1279 when he acceded to Rome's demands on his deathbed.[16][24][25] Consequently, the church was favorably inclined to reach an agreement with the new monarch upon his accession to the throne.\n\nIn 1284, however, Denis emulated the example of his grandfather and father, and launched a new series of inquiries to investigate the expropriation of royal property; this was to the detriment of the church. The next year he took further steps against ecclesiastical power when he promulgated amortisation laws.[26] These prohibited the church and religious orders from buying lands, and required that they sell or forfeit any they had purchased since the start of his reign. Several years later he issued another decree forbidding them to inherit the estates of recruits to the orders.[27]\n\nIn 1288, Denis managed to persuade Pope Nicholas IV to issue a papal Bull that separated the Order of Santiago in Portugal from that in Castile, to which it had been subordinate.[28] With the extinction of the Knights Templar, he was able to transfer their assets in the country to the Order of Christ, specially created for this purpose.\n\nDenis was essentially an administrator and not a warrior king. He went to war with the kingdom of Castile in 1295, relinquishing the villages of Serpa and Moura. In 1297, he signed the Treaty of Alcañices with Castile, which defined the current borders between the two Iberian countries,[29] and reaffirmed Portugal’s possession of the Algarve. The treaty also established an alliance of friendship and mutual defense, leading to a peace of 40 years between the two nations.\n\nDenis pursued his father's policies on legislation and centralisation of power, and promulgated the nucleus of a Portuguese civil and criminal law code, protecting the lower classes from abuse and extortion. These edicts survived in the Livro das Leis e Posturas (Book of Laws and Postures),[30][31] and the Ordenações Afonsinas (Afonsine Ordinances), proclaimed during the reign of Afonso V.[32][33] These are not legislative \"codes\" as we understand them today, but rather compilations of laws and customary municipal law, as amended and restated by the Portuguese crown.[34]\n\nAs king, Denis travelled around the country to resolve various problems. He ordered the construction of numerous castles, created new towns, and granted the privileges due cities to several others. He declared in 1290 that 'the language of the people' was to become the language of the state,[35] and officially known as Portuguese.[36] Denis also decreed that Portuguese replace Latin as the language of the law courts in his kingdom.[37] His wife Elizabeth donated much of the large income generated by her lands and properties to charities,[38][39] inspiring Denis to help improve the life of the poor and found several social institutions.[40]\n\nThe frequent procedural issues that arose when he issued his decrees increasingly occupied Denis in his quest to frame the common law as being within the scope of the crown's jurisdiction, and in exercising royal power in the realm. The restrictions he placed on the actions of alvazis (local council officials), judges, as well as proctors and advocates in the courts, show that a merely nominal power of the monarchy over all the inhabitants of the kingdom, as was typical in the Middle Ages, was not compatible with his effort to assert a royal prerogative to scrutinise legal procedures, or moralise on the exercise of justice. The appointment of magistrates clearly marks the start of the process of the crown claiming territorial jurisdiction, thus expanding the royal domain, along with the growing importance of Lisbon as the nation's de facto capital.[41] The preference for Lisbon as a venue of the royal court was accentuated during Denis's long reign. There was as yet no official capital of the country, but Lisbon's location, as well as its advanced urban, economic and commercial development, made the city the most viable choice for a national centre of administration.\n\nIts geographical situation between the ancient divisions of the country, i.e., the north and the south, enhanced Lisbon's status as the most practical centre for an emergent united Portuguese nation, the south now receiving as much royal attention as the north and becoming the residence of the monarchy. Their different characters created a realm where the two regions complemented each other. The great manors were closer together in the north, and the vast dominions conquered from the Muslims in the south, as well as the large areas of unclaimed land there, expanded the domain of the crown, and much of the territory of the extreme south came under the control of the military orders.[42]\n\nDenis promoted development of the rural infrastructure, earning the nickname of \"the Farmer\" (o Lavrador).[43] He redistributed land,[44] founded agricultural schools to improve farming techniques,[45] and took a personal interest in the expansion of exports. He set up regular markets in a number of towns and regulated their activities. One of his principal achievements was to protect agricultural lands from advancing coastal sands by ordering the planting of a pine forest near Leiria.[46] which also provided a source of raw materials for construction of a naval fleet.[3] This forest, known as the Pinhal de Leiria (Leiria Pinewood), still exists, and is an important conservation area.[47]\n\nLatter years and death [ edit ]\n\nThe latter part of Denis' generally peaceful reign was nevertheless marked by internal conflicts. The contenders were his two sons: Afonso, the legitimate heir, and Afonso Sanches, his bastard son, who quarreled frequently among themselves for royal favour. At the time of Denis' death in 1325, he had placed Portugal on an equal footing with the other Iberian Kingdoms.\n\nAfonso, born in Lisbon, was the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not Denis' favourite son, the old king preferring Afonso Sanches, his illegitimate son by Aldonça Rodrigues Talha.[48][49][50] The notorious rivalry between the half brothers led to civil war several times. Elizabeth would serve as intermediary between her husband and Afonso during the civil war of 1322–1324.\n\nThe Infante Afonso greatly resented the king, whom he accused of favoring Afonso Sanches. Denis had little popular support in the war because of the many privileges he had granted to the nobles in the last years of his reign, while the infante had the support of the county's cities; these circumstances were rooted in the longstanding conflict between the upper and lower classes of Portuguese society. Repulsed to the town of Alenquer, which supported the Infante, Denis was prevented from killing his son through the intervention of the Queen. As legend holds, in 1323, Elizabeth, mounted on a mule, positioned herself between the opposing armies on the field of the Battle of Alvalade in order to prevent the combat. Peace returned in 1324 when Afonso Sanches was sent into exile and the Infante swore loyalty to the king.[51]\n\nRemains of the medieval Monastery of Saint Denis in Odivelas\n\nKing Denis died on 7 January 1325 at Santarém,[52] and was buried in the Monastery of Saint Denis in Odivelas, near Lisbon.[53] Afonso then became king, whereupon he exiled his rival to Castile, and stripped him of all the lands and fiefdoms bestowed by their father. From Castile, Afonso Sanches orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown. After he failed several times to mount an invasion of Portugal, the brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by Afonso IV's mother Queen Elizabeth.[54]\n\nAppraisal of reign [ edit ]\n\nBearing in mind the many centuries that separate Denis from the present, an impression of his personality can be gathered from the historical record: he was determined, even obstinate, in his attempts to systematically centralise the government and consolidate royal power.[55] For example, he launched general inquiries (Inquirições gerais) at a remarkably accelerated pace to investigate land ownership and identify cases where abuses were committed.[56]\n\nDenis revealed early on his ability as an effective strategist in the pursuit of his goals, and as an innovator of proactive legislative policy. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that his administrative decisions were not made randomly or without consideration of his ideal of a well-governed nation. The wide range of his policies is indicated by a few examples: the concomitant creation of new towns and trade fairs, the fortification of the country's borders and the increasing dependence of the military orders on the royal power. He was recognized as an intelligent, perceptive ruler with demonstrated success, both by contemporaries and by later historians.\n\nDenis was not lacking in political skill. Being adroit in negotiation and a student of human nature, he knew how to go about \"opposing and appeasing alternately the secular and the ecclesiastical manorial interests. He confiscated the properties of the clergy, but made the concordat [of 1289] with the Portuguese bishops;[24][57] he restricted the comedoria (victuals) rights of the monasteries, but replaced those rights with a fixed annual sum of money. His actions were sufficiently [statesmanlike, and his political position was strong] enough, for him to secure the confiscation laws and check the erosion of the state patrimony\".[58][59] As administration of the royal properties became more efficient and he became richer, Denis gained fame for his wealth, even being mentioned in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.[60]\n\nNevertheless, Denis is described in contemporary chronicles as a wise and able ruler. Although most of the legislative work of his reign focused on procedural juridical issues, the purpose of much of this new legislation was to avoid excessive delays and court costs and to prevent abuse by attorneys and prosecutors.The personal determination that allowed Denis to achieve so much in the political realm could sometimes harden into obstinacy and arrogance. He was described occasionally as cruel, especially in family relations, shown for example in the way he dealt with his legitimate son and rightful heir, Afonso (never his favorite), and his wife, Elizabeth, to whom he turned over the children born of his infidelities,[61] leaving her the responsibility of their care and education.\n\nAn inescapable figure in the history of the Iberian Peninsula in the 13th and the beginning of the 14th centuries, Denis was first called \"father of his country\" (Pai da Pátria) by the historian Duarte Nunes de Leão in 1600.[62]\n\nPhysical Description [ edit ]\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, ancestor of Denis of Portugal\n\nThe historical sources of King Denis's time, as well as later authors, failed to provide any detailed physical description of the monarch. The information known comes from an accidental opening of his tomb during a restoration in 1938. It was discovered that the legend of a figure of towering height was not an accurate one as he was only about 1.65 metres (5 feet 5 inches) tall. Denis made his will when he was 61 and died at age 63. He apparently enjoyed excellent health throughout his life, as he traveled frequently, got involved in wars from an early age and at age 60 still hunted. He died with complete dentition,[63] a rarity for the time, something that even today continues to be fairly unusual.\n\nA distinctive feature of his physiognomy revealed by examination of the body was that his hair and beard were auburn. This is a curious fact, as he was the first of the Portuguese royal line up to that time to have that hair color. This genetic trait could have been passed on the maternal side, as his uncle Ferdinand, called \"La Cerda\", or \"the bristly one\", had red hair as well. Denis may have inherited the trait from Henry II of England, who was his ancestor on both the paternal and maternal sides, or even possibly from his maternal great grandmother Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen, granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (\"barbarossa\" means \"red beard\" in Italian).[64]\n\nMarriage and descendants [ edit ]\n\nDenis' only wife was Isabel or Elizabeth of Aragon, daughter of Peter III of Aragon. They married in 1288 and she bore him a son and a daughter. Like other monarchs of the time, he had several illegitimate children as well.[65]\n\nAncestry [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

As part of the attack, terrorists would seek to take hostages and perpetrate a bloodbath using firearms.\n\nThe information about the alleged plans came from a jihadist who is currently abroad and has reportedly contacted the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) several times in recent days. The jihadist apparently wants to abandon the group. The information provided by the jihadist informant was apparently the reason behind German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière's decision to hold a press conference on Wednesday warning of an imminent attack in the country.\n\nAccording to the caller, the terror cell is comprised of six people -- two of whom are believed already to have traveled to Berlin six to eight weeks ago, and are now staying in the city. Four other perpetrators -- a German, a Turk, a North African and a further man the jihadist could not identify -- are currently waiting to travel to Germany. The attacks are purportedly being planned for February or March.\n\nApparent Plans for Second Attack\n\nThe second warning backing de Maizière's concerns came from the United States. The US federal police, the FBI, sent a cable to the BKA two weeks ago noting another possible further attack. A Shiite-Indian group known as the \"Saif,\" or sword, is believed to have engaged in a pact with al-Qaida and to have sent two men to Germany to carry out an attack there.\n\nBoth were believed to be traveling to the United Arab Emirates on Nov. 22, where they would be supplied with new travel papers so that they could continue on to Germany. The suspects allegedly already posess visas for Europe's Schengen zone of visa-free travel. The FBI has named Mushtaq Altaf bin-Khadri as the man behind the attack plans.\n\nThe man believed to be trying to smuggle the would-be terrorists into Europe is 54-year-old weapons dealer Dawood Ibrahim, who the United Nations believes is a major backer of terrorism. He is considered to be one of the men behind the terror attacks perpetrated in Mumbai in November 2008. The FBI and Germany's BKA both consider the message to be extremely important.

  "latent_26677": "At its worst, the American Tea Party is a helter-skelter of conservative populism, a movement broadly united by small-government principles but more animated by a hatred of the current president. It lacks a coherent vision and prefers paranoid sloganeering and anti-establishment platitudes to a viable platform. At its most benign, the Tea Party represents what the late historian Samuel Huntington, in an insight more valuable than his more famous one about a \"clash of civilizations,\" once termed a \"creedal-passion period\" of American politics. That is to say, a cyclical phenomenon that occurs every few generations in Anglo-Saxon cultures and has its roots in the Protestant Great Awakening of the 1740s. Creedal passion periods, in other words, are manifestations of American Puritanism, that fatal shore upon which idealistic expectations invariably wash up.\n\nCreedal-passion periods are our homegrown utopianism, but they're borne of a persistent theme in American politics, one that Huntington diagnosed as an \"opposition to power, and suspicion of government as the most dangerous embodiment of power\". When opposition and suspicion reach a fever pitch because of economic or social transformations – a stock-market crash, a messy foreign entanglement or the integration of a previously marginalised minority – the result is another creedal passion period. Thus should we examine Jacksonian individualism of the 1820s and 30s, as well as the Populist-Progressive convulsions at the turn of the 20th century. The aftermath of these periods were apathy and a return to equilibrium, the humdrum history by which the American experiment is more characteristically judged. There's every likelihood that the Tea Party movement will peter out in the same way.\n\nThe 1960s were Huntington's case study, the subject to which he devoted his concept-defining 1981 book, American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony. In it, he cited the Students for a Democratic Society's programme that pinpointed the New Left's origins in \"moral values, which are held as absolute\", a startling observation only in light of the moral relativism that wafted in from Europe and took hold of the American left. But from here, the Reagan revolution and its \"moral majority\" grandstanding can be at least be glimpsed as an approaching corrective, marshalling its energies during the dormancy of the \"'Me' Decade\".\n\nEven the cultural outcroppings of creedal passion periods bear striking similarities to one another. What communes, hash and free love were to the 60s, heedless market speculation, cocaine and casual sex were to the 80s. Indeed, the area of convergence between the left and right during creedal passion periods is almost too expansive to be noticed in the midst of one. For instance, the failure of the federal government to live up to constitutional principles of individualism and civil liberty meant ending military conscription, a stated goal of the antiwar camp, but one that fell to its conservative nemesis – the Nixon White House – to implement at the state level. (Not that the White House got much credit for it.)\n\nPerhaps because the Tea Party is still in existence, its antagonists have been slow to note its rhetorical and substantive symmetries with the liberal-left's response to the Bush presidency. (Apologists for the Tea Party who do note these symmetries do so with the straight face of self-justification – irony not being a strong suit of a movement that asks the government to take its \"hands off my Medicare\".) The latter trafficked in comparisons of the chief executive with Hitler, conspiracy theories about the furtive \"truth\" of 9/11, the publication of a novel by a well-regarded author which envisaged Bush's assassination as being in the public interest and hysterical claims that the United States had, by acts of international folly, forfeited its primacy world affairs. The former traffics in comparisons of the chief executive with Hitler (or Stalin), conspiracy theories about the furtive origins of his birth, delusional pseudo-histories about every American war from the revolutionary to the cold that are designed to serve the Tea Party's interest, and hysterical claims that the United States has, by acts of international folly, forfeited its primacy in world affairs.\n\nWhat defenders of the Tea Party have failed to understand is that this movement, like every creedal passion before it, is liable to extinction by its own hand. This is never more so the case than when public curiosity morphs into public wariness and the movement gets defensive. The shooting of an American congresswoman by a man of doubtful mental health may have had nothing to do with the broadcasts of Glenn Beck or the unsuccessful senatorial candidacies of Christine O'Donnell and Sharron Angle. But the immediate suspicion that it might have, as well as its own rapid-response protests of innocence, are indicators of the Tea Party's actuarial odds. See also Sarah Palin's universally derided response to the Tucson shooting complete with an original use of the ancient term \"blood libel\".\n\nOne already detects the lowering of national blood pressure and hears mutterings about the indecency of dotting any kind of partisan map with rifle sites. Come to think of it, wasn't it a foreign-born socialist who said that politics enjoys a destructive relationship with the English language?\n\nHumdrum history impends again. If Whittaker Chambers could remark of the sleepy and nostalgic right of the 1950s, which pinned its hope on dismantling the New Deal, that it was a \"literary whimsy\" masquerading as a politics, then surely the Tea Party is something more ephemeral for these caffeinated and amnesiac times: a Twitter feed in search of an ideology.",

This is exactly what this post is about, showing you eight new useful features of VLC 1.0 that your faint eye can’t see otherwise.\n\nInstantaneous Pausing\n\n“Is this even a feature?”, say ex-vlc fanboys who have ported over to other media players. In fact, this is one of the many features that has been requested for such a long time. Instantaneous Pausing allows a user to pause any video the moment he/she hits the pause button, no more delays. It pauses at the exact frame(without skipping) which is quite impressive.\n\nLive Recording\n\nYup, you heard it right. The latest version now supports on-the-fly recording for all type of medias. In case you are wondering how to make recording easier, go to View menu and hit Advanced Controls. You will now see a Record button next to control buttons.\n\nFrame By Frame Playback\n\nSo you are watching a superhero movie with your friends and a huge explosion goes off. To enjoy it once again, you can now go over it frame-by frame with the frame by frame playback functionality. When you enable advanced controls from the View menu, apart from Record, Snapshot, and Loop buttons, you will find the Frame-by-Frame Playback button. Clicking it once will move your video to the next frame, pressing it again will move it to another frame ahead and so on.\n\nBefore VLC 1.0, if you had to take a snapshot of any part of the video the quickest way would be to hit snapshot button at the right time during the video. If you don’t get lucky, an alternative way is to try hitting the Pause button which will actually pause the video after missing few seconds. Frame by frame playback makes tasks such as snapshot much more easier.\n\nCustomizable Interface\n\nSo you don’t like the look, right? No problem, now you can customize the interface according to your own styles and needs. Simply head over to the View menu and hit Customize Interface. Now go ahead and select the buttons that you want, the position at which you want them, and much more. There are also some pre-configured Profiles that you might want to try out.\n\nAirTunes Streaming\n\nFor those who don’t know what is Airtunes streaming, it is a functionality for Apple’s Airport Express that allows you to play media files on your home stereo speakers. Originally it was developed to work with iTunes but now VLC has officially added the support for AirTunes streaming as well.\n\nIf you have Apple’s Airport Express properly installed, all you need to do is to load up your favorite media file on VLC Media Player, head over to the playlist, right-click the media file and hit Stream. Ofcourse you will need to tweak some basic settings later, but it works flawlessly.\n\nFull screen Interface/Minimal View & Better Video Scaling\n\nWhether you have an old 17” monitor or the latest 40” LCD, VLC Media Player will now scale your videos better in fullscreen mode. Don’t get confused between Fullscreen Mode and Fullscreen Interface, the former is the same old fullscreen when you double-click the video, while the later is the new functionality. Fullscreen interface and Minimal view, both can be accessed from the View tab and are important in their own terms.\n\n– Fullscreen Interface comes useful when you have to watch the video in fullscreen and at the same time want access to the menus. (Hotkey: Ctrl+H)\n\n– Minimal view comes useful when you want to watch the video in fullscreen mode and keep watch on other windows in the taskbar as well. (Hotkey: F11)\n\nFiner Speed Controls\n\nRemember the good old days when you were able to easily forward and reverse your movie in the VHS Player, such a functionality is back in the latest release of VLC but in a whole new way. Head over to the Playback menu and you will find all types of Speed Controls from faster/slower to jump forward/backward.\n\nNew Formats And New HD Codecs\n\nIf you are searching for a good video player that can play HD-DVD and Blu-Ray movies seamlessly, you just found one. The latest release of VLC brings many new HD codecs, formats, and adds some improvement to various Demuxers and Encoders. Now you can play Blu-ray and HD-DVD movies without any lag.\n\nNote: If you experience lagging while playing HD Movies, make sure that your hardware actually supports it before complaining about VLC to the developers.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nApart from the features that we have mentioned above it now also supports two new playlists: Windows Media Player Playlist(WPL) and Zune Playlist(ZPL). It also brings some core improvements to the subtitles and allows you to export the playlist in HTML format. Another important improvement has been made to the video when running in fullscreen mode, you can now zoom inside while keeping the black borders.

He then returned to the office six months later to find that his access to the building had been revoked.\n\nA press release issued by law firm Locke Lord states:\n\n“While on sabbatical, Mr Benzies discovered numerous deceptions on the part of Take-Two, Rockstar, Rockstar North Ltd, Sam Houser and Dan Houser, who sought to force him out of the company and terminate his portion of royalty payments based upon arbitrary actions by the company’s royalty Allocation Committee, a committee that may or may not have actually ever met.\n\n“As the lawsuit describes, based upon agreements in place, as one of three named Rockstar Principals, Mr Benzies is owed in excess of $150m in unpaid royalties.”\n\nThe dispute centres on a 2009 royalty plan signed by Benzies and the founders of Rockstar, Sam and Dan Houser, which he claims ensured he would have parity with the brothers.\n\nTake-Two Interactive, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has now filed a counter suit, claiming Benzies left the company of his own volition, and consequently is not entitled, “to any post-termination royalties”.\n\nAsked to comment on Take-Two’s counter, Christopher Bakes of Locke Lord, the chief litigator on the Benzies case, told the Guardian, “The short answer is that we believe the detailed and extensive factual allegations contained in Mr. Benzies’ Complaint amply address those contained in the somewhat sparse Take-Two Complaint.\n\n“Needless to say, Mr. Benzies believes the issues between the parties are far broader than as presented by Take-Two and Mr. Benzies’ Complaint reflects that.”\n\nBenzies is considered one of the key members of the Grand Theft Auto creative team, having been a producer on the series since the hugely successful third title, released in 2001, which saw development move from DMA design in Dundee to Rockstar North, based in Edinburgh.\n\nThe Locke Lord lawsuit claims that Sam and Dan Houser, were attempting to force Benzies out of the company and that there was “mounting resentment” between Sam Houser and Benzies. The lawsuit alleges that Sam Houser was angry when Benzies put his own name at the end of the production credits for GTA Online, a multiplayer mode for Grand Theft Auto V; traditionally Sam Houser’s name is the last to be displayed in the credits for Rockstar titles. The suit alleges that the Houser said Benzies “wanted to take over the company”.\n\nAccording to Benzies’s suit, Rockstar threatened to make “scurrilous allegations” against him if he continued to assert his rights. “This was a shocking development given that Sam Houser himself had orchestrated and encouraged a company culture involving strip clubs, personal photography of employees in sexually compromising positions, and other conduct grossly in violation of standard workplace norms.”\n\nThe Guardian has approached Rockstar and Take-Two for comment.",
  "latent_26982": "Iain Duncan Smith's flagship benefit reform has been severely criticised by MPs for failures that are expected to waste at least £140m of public money.\n\nThe universal credit scheme has been overseen by \"alarmingly weak\" management, with systems so lax that a secretary was allowed to authorise purchase orders worth £23m, according to the public accounts committee. In some cases it is unclear what suppliers have been paid for.\n\nMPs also voiced doubts about whether the project can still be fully delivered by the deadline of 2017 and described a pilot set up under Duncan Smith's guidance as inadequate and open to fraud.\n\nThe findings will cause some embarrassment for the welfare and pensions minister, who has insisted he will be able to deliver – on budget and on time – a working IT system for rolling up to six means-tested benefits into one.\n\nUniversal credit is due to be introduced in four years, with Duncan Smith saying it can ensure people are always better off in jobs and save £38bn by 2023.\n\nMargaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said the implementation of the system so far had been \"extraordinarily poor\".\n\n\"The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet-to-be-determined amount of public money,\" she said. \"£425m has been spent so far … It is likely that much of this, including at least £140m of IT assets, will now have to be written off. From the outset, the department has failed to grasp the nature and enormity of the task; failed to monitor and challenge progress regularly; and, when problems arose, failed to intervene promptly,\" she said.\n\nHodge also claimed that the pilot programme is not a proper pilot. \"It does not deal with the key issues that universal credit must address: the volume of claims; their complexity; change in claimants' circumstances; and the need for claimants to meet conditions for continuing entitlement to benefit,\" she said.\n\nThe escalating costs of the IT project were outlined by two witnesses who gave evidence to the committee. Mike Driver, the finance director general of the DWP, said as much as £161m could have been wasted, while Norma Wood, the head of the Major Projects Authority, agreed that the system would have to write off at least £140m.\n\nUnusually, the report has singled out the role of the Department for Work and Pensions' permanent secretary, Robert Devereux, for his failings in the management of the £2.4bn universal credit scheme.\n\nSenior managers including Devereux only became aware of problems through ad hoc reviews because inadequate management information and reporting arrangements had not alerted them that things were amiss, the report concluded.\n\n\"Given its huge importance to the department, the accounting officer [Devereux] and his team should have been more alert to identifying and acting on early warning signs that things were going wrong with the programme,\" the report said.\n\nDevereux was also criticised because he had not closely monitored the project, even after he knew of major problems.\n\n\"Governance arrangements were not remotely adequate, and the accounting officer discussed progress with the head of the universal credit programme only every two or three weeks,\" the report said.\n\nSenior Tories said Devereux's resignation would be accepted if offered.\n\nA Conservative source close to Duncan Smith said: \"Once again officials have been named and ministers have not, and that will make uncomfortable reading.\"\n\nIn September, Duncan Smith took a rare step for a cabinet minister and blamed civil servants for the IT failures that threatened to derail the scheme, telling the Commons: \"When I arrived I expected professionalism to be able to do this.\"\n\nThe union that represents Britain's senior civil servants has criticised the way that ministers now feel able to shrug off their responsibilities and blame staff.\n\nRob O'Neil, assistant general secretary of the FDA union, said: \"Ministers must accept their responsibilities for any difficulties in the delivery of the project. It is ministers who determine the priorities, time scales and resources available. It is unrealistic to expect simple solutions to complex problems.\"\n\nIt is understood that some Tory members of the public accounts committee argued at a meeting on Monday for further criticisms of Devereux to be included in the final report. However, these were not adopted following a discussion.\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery. We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls.\n\n\"We don't recognise the write-off figure quoted by the committee, and expect this to be substantially less,\" she said. A spokesperson for Duncan Smith said: \"Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems. He has every confidence with the team now in place, and that team includes Robert Devereux.\"",

  "latent_27474": "The BBC has been forced to remove an extremely bizarre and far-fetched travel article from its website which described Uighur Muslims in China’s far-western Xinjiang region as “Eastern European Muslims trapped on the wrong side of a line on a map.”\n\nThe piece was authored by freelance writer James Michael Dorsey and was published on Tuesday with the headline: “In China, the people who barely exist.” It describes the author’s apparent meeting with an elderly craftsman in Kashgar who could well be China’s most interesting man.\n\nWhile the article has been removed by the BBC, you can fortunately still read it in cached form. The rollicking tale begins with Dorsey setting the scene for his meeting with the craftsman on a street corner in what he refers to as “Xinxiang province.”\n\nI watched the old man for about an hour before I approached him. He sat on a dirty blanket on the street corner, bent like a sextant with age, rats scuttling in the gutter below his feet. That was his spot; I had seen so many like him throughout China, those without status who survive by their wits.\n\nHis clothes were tattered and his four-cornered hat identified him as a Uyghur, one of the displaced Eastern European Muslims trapped on the wrong side of a line on a map. China has declared Xinxiang province to be a “Uyghur Autonomous Area,” but that is only lip service to a minority that is scorned by the ruling Han majority. The Uyghur are Chinese on paper only.\n\nI watched him work with infinite care, carving with a tiny penknife. He was oblivious to the uninterested masses passing him by, focused only on his work. No-one stopped to buy or even look at his wares, delicate wooden combs, spoons and whimsical creatures. He was an artist by any reasonable standards, but his birth status had relegated him to the streets. His leathery skin looked like an aerial map of old dried river beds, and his whippet-thin arms ended in gnarled hands bulging with purple veins. They were craftsman’s hands that liberated beauty from old blocks of wood. In another time and place, he might have been a great sculptor, but in today’s China, he was but one of those who do not officially exist. These are the people I want to talk to.\n\nFrom there, the piece somehow only gets stranger and more painful to read. Dorsey writes that he approached the craftsman, drawing the attention of onlookers and the police, before asking the old man to accompany him to a tea house, where they drew even more attention…\n\nIn rural China, Westerners are a curiosity, especially those of us who stand over 6ft tall and weigh 200lbs, so my approach brought with it a crowd, and crowds always bring the police. I sat on his blanket, fingering his works, while he cocked his head studying this strange foreigner who was giving him face by sitting near him. Within a minute we were surrounded by a pushing mass of onlookers, including two young policemen who were obviously out of their league in dealing with such a situation. They seemed as curious about me as I was about the old man.\n\nHe spoke halting English with a strange accent, so, intrigued, I invited him to join me in a local tea house. I knew that under normal circumstances he would not be allowed to enter. But the Chinese get jittery in the presence of Westerners, especially those with cameras, and I suspected they would not challenge me if he entered as my guest.\n\nAll heads turned and eyes stared as we took seats on the patio, while necks craned to hear the strange language being exchanged between this unlikely pair. The waiter served my tea, but placed the pot on the table without pouring the old man’s, so I picked it up and made a show of pouring his, as a gasp of astonishment spread across the tables. Then to counter the local arrogance, I called the waiter back and ordered two bagels, knowing them to be a Uyghur favourite, and put them in front of the old man while the waiter glared. The two young policemen just stood, blankly staring, hoping no trouble would start.\n\nAt the table, Dorsey says that he learned the man’s name was “Bingwen” and asked to hear his story, believing that it was “one of those lost epics that fall through the cracks of society, lost forever except for chances encounters.” Bingwen agreed to tell the author his tale, which — what do you know — turned out to be one whopper of a story.\n\n“Bingwen” as photographed by James Michael Dorsey.\n\nBingwen, whose English apparently turned out to be less than halting, told Dorsey that he was born in Kashgar, the son of one of the last great merchants on the Silk Road. He said he was the sole survivor of a bandit caravan raid in the mountains of Afghanistan, smearing himself with blood and hiding underneath a dead camel until the looting was over.\n\nAfterward, Bingwen made his way to Kabul where he eventually found his calling as a woodworker, producing souvenirs for Soviet troops during the invasion. However, his life was turned upside down when one night three drunken soldiers broke into his shop and tried to have their way with the young girl who cleaned and cooked for him.\n\n“When he came to her defense, they beat him senseless with camel whips. He awoke the following morning in a pool of blood beside her lifeless body. He stared at her for most of a day, and that night he set fire to his studio and walked off into the hills to find the Mujahidin,” Dorsey writes.\n\nBingwen then became a fighter for a local warlord, killing Soviet soldiers and bringing back severed body parts as proof. But eventually, after being bayonetted and looking up at the stars in the night sky, he had a change of heart and instead became a hermit among the Buddhas of Bamiyan.\n\nAfter thinking things over for some months, Bingwen decided to head back home to Kashgar where he has since established himself as a humble streetside craftsman selling wooden knick-knacks to tourists and locals.\n\nAfter listening to Bingwen’s incredible life story, Dorsey concludes that:\n\nTravel has taught me that the world is full of Bingwens who go unnoticed every day. Everyone has a story worth telling. That is why I start conversations with strangers when I travel, because sometimes, something as simple as tea and a bagel can bring an epic tale in return.\n\nI am probably the only person who has ever heard Bingwen’s story, and I still wonder why he chose to tell it to me. Perhaps, I sometimes think, our meeting was just a part of some larger carving.\n\nThe piece was noticed by Kaiser Kuo, editor-at-large of SupChina, who wrote on Facebook that he couldn’t believe that “the BBC would run something with such a blatant factual error so high up,” referring to Dorsey’s assertion that Uighurs are somehow “Eastern European Muslims.”\n\nWe watched from a distance as people passed his blanket, some kicking his spoons away while others stepped on them. China has always been cruel to its people and indifferent to its poor, but being born a Uyghur is the bottom of the heap. One teenage punk grabbed a spoon and ran before the old man knew what was happening, but this was his life and you do not reach old age in this land without accepting abuse.\n\nPierre and I were both old China hands, used to being charged foreigners prices and having guns stuck in our faces, the price one pays for solo travel in a culture that feeds on paranoia. I could identify with the old man.\n\nIt was our last day in Kashgar and just for the hell of it Pierre and I had wandered to the public square in front of the big yellow mosque. It had been ten years since Pierre had met the old man on the same corner, whittling wooden spoons for a few pennies, never making enough to prosper, but obviously making enough to survive, which is in itself an accomplishment for the lower masses of China.\n\nAbout an hour later, the BBC’s Carrie Gracie responded to the Facebook post, “Just saw this. Will deal with it.” The article has since been removed from the BBC website.“I’m pretty sure this was written by the J. Peterman character from Seinfeld,” one Facebook user commented underneath Kuo’s post.The author of the piece, James Michael Dorsey , describes himself as “an explorer, author, and photographer who has traveled extensively in 42 countries.” Over the years, he has been published by numerous publications around the world and has written several articles for the BBC in the past few months including one about befriending an African king and another about visiting a village in northern Xinjiang that Genghis Khan’s horde rode through centuries ago.As pointed out by Austin Ramzy of the New York Times, James Michael Dorsey published a strikingly similar piece about a Kashgar craftsman in a February 2014 edition of webzine Perceptive Travel. While the article includes the same photo, cringeworthy writing and racism toward Han Chinese, it doesn’t mention anything about the old man fighting against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, or even him speaking a lick of English.Enjoy some more selections from the saga of Bingwen:\n\nApparently, Dorsey’s friend, Pierre, had bought spoons from the man a decade ago (paying ten times the asking price, because Pierre’s a nice guy). While they both sensed that the elderly craftsman had an incredible story to tell, they couldn’t actually find out because they didn’t speak Chinese (or Uighur) and the man didn’t speak English. Still, they decided to walk over and “give the man face.”\n\nBoth Pierre’s and my home are filled with the detritus of years of remote travel and I wanted my own artifact from this spoon carver. I wanted to shake his hand and tell him I travel to seek stories about people like him, stories from the collective memory of mankind that enlighten all of us, and I wanted a piece of this man’s life for my shelf at home that holds so many other stories brought back from the corners of this earth. But neither of us spoke Chinese so the words went unsaid. What we could do though was give the man face…\n\nBy this time a significant crowd had gathered and in China a crowd also brings the police. The two officers were visibly surprised to see Pierre and I at the center of this gathering and I have no doubt they would have been cruel to the old man had we round eyes not been there. Nothing rattles the bureaucratic goons of the Chinese hinterlands like the presence of an outsider. If you stand up to their ingrained bullying tactics they usually back down, often making fools of themselves. They simply do not know how to act around foreigners, terrified of the truth we may carry back to the outside world.\n\nThen, it was time for what Dorsey labels a “transformative transaction.”\n\nPierre and I each picked up a spoon, making a great display of admiring them. With people pushing and shoving to get close to this strange performance we made a point of pulling out a large roll of bills. With all eyes on him, Pierre began to count out money, slowly so all could see. As the count grew an audible murmur spread through the crowd. At about US$20, Pierre handed the wad to the old man, a fair price to us but a veritable fortune in rural China. We heard the incredulous comments needing no interpreter. “How could these foreigners give so much money to this old Uyghur?”\n\nWith that we both stood up, bowed to him deeply, and turned to walk away, leaving two gaping policemen and a stunned crowd of people on the corner.\n\nIt was a simple act, but in Kashgar it was open defiance against the status quo that only a foreigner could get away with. The old man was smiling from ear to ear.\n\nSomehow, the article gets worse from there with Dorsey labeling Han Chinese as “programmed automatons” unable to show respect to the old man.\n\nWe retreated across the street, into a store where no one could see us to watch what came next. The police who normally would have routed the old man with their batons were ordering people to walk around him, and everyone began to give him a wide berth. They were no longer trampling on his wares and in fact a few of them dropped money onto his blanket without taking any spoons. The Han are such programmed automatons that they would now show the old man respect, whether they felt it or not, understood why or not, simply because their masters had ordered it.\n\nOur simple act had given the man great face and that crosses all barriers in the paradox that is China.\n\nKashgar is a place of routines, where people go through the motions of life each day without really living because there are no other options. I am sure the story of two strange Americans honoring an old Uyghur spread quickly, changing with each telling while the facts recede into myth.\n\nToday the old man’s photo sits on my den shelf with his spoon, and that day is a story I relive over and over.\n\nIndeed, it does appear that, just like on the streets of Kashgar, when Dorsey does relive this story it also appears to change with each telling “while facts recede into myth” even further.",

Bosh had missed three of those matchups and Wade sat out another before all three finally faced each other in Cleveland's 102-92 home win Oct. 30.\n\nJames finished with 29 points in the season-series opener, while Wade had 25 and Bosh scored 16. Now Miami fans will get an opportunity to see the stars that became known as the \"big three\" play in person for the first time since James' departure.\n\n\"(This game) is very important,\" Bosh said. \"We want this game to be big and we have to do that by keeping up with our end of the bargain.\"\n\nJames has totaled 56 points in two games back at American Airlines Arena, but the Heat pulled out a 101-91 win on Dec. 25, 2014, and a 106-92 victory March 16. Wade certainly seemed motivated to face his old running mate, scoring a combined 63 with seven steals.\n\nThe Cavs haven't won in Miami since January 2010 before James bolted for South Beach.\n\nWade finished with 28 points in Thursday's 97-95 home win over Oklahoma City that kept the Heat (11-6) on top in the Southeast Division. Wade, who will turn 34 next month, has scored a combined 58 on 23-of-45 (51.1 percent) shooting in his last two games.\n\nMiami is getting it done on the defensive end, allowing Eastern Conference lows of 92.6 points per game and a 41.0 field-goal percentage. The club will try to contain not only James but Kevin Love after he had 24 points and 14 rebounds in the first meeting.\n\nThe power forward, though, has totaled 23 points on 8-of-25 shooting in his last two.\n\n\"They've got one on us already and we've got to return the favor,\" Bosh said.\n\nThe Cavs (13-6) fell percentage points behind Chicago in the Central following Friday's 114-108 overtime loss at New Orleans. They'll try to avoid their first three-game skid since dropping six straight in January as well as their fifth loss in six road games.\n\nCleveland is slumping offensively, shooting just 39.8 percent - including 31.1 from 3-point range - while committing 17.7 turnovers per game over its past three. James had 37 points, eight assists and seven boards Friday, while J.R. Smith added 18 on six 3s.\n\n\"What else was I going to do?\" said James, who may have to shake off some fatigue after playing nearly 45 minutes. \"I tried to make something happen for our team, be aggressive and see if I could make a push. And if not, at least I put in the effort.\"\n\nMiami's Luol Deng would normally play a key role in defending James, but his status is uncertain after missing the past four games with a hamstring injury.\n\nCopyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27651": "Maxwell M. Scherzer (born July 27, 1984) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2008, and later played for the Detroit Tigers. He has been an important figure in the both the Tigers' and Nationals' playoff presence, including Detroit's four consecutive American League Central titles from 2011−2014 and two of Washington's National League East titles. A power pitcher with a low three-quarter-arm delivery, Scherzer has achieved numerous strikeout records, while becoming the tenth pitcher in history to be awarded at least three Cy Young Awards, the sixth to record two no-hitters in one season, the fifth to produce more than one immaculate inning, and the fourth to strike out at least 200 batters in a season seven years in a row.\n\nThe Diamondbacks selected Scherzer, a native of Greater St. Louis, in the first round and 11th overall of the 2006 amateur draft from the University of Missouri. He is a six-time MLB All-Star, and the fifth pitcher to start an All-Star Game for both American and National Leagues. He is a winner of three strikeout titles, a four-time wins leader, and a four-time walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) leader. In addition to three Cy Young Awards, he also finished fifth in its voting in 2014 and 2015. One the most consistent hurlers of his era, he has made at least 30 starts each season from 2009–2018, and struck out at least 230 batters in each season from 2012–2018. Prior to the 2015 season, Scherzer agreed to a seven-year, $210 million contract with the Nationals, one of the largest in baseball history.\n\nDuring his major league debut, Scherzer established the record for most consecutive hitters retired in a relief appearance as a major league debut with 13. He became the third pitcher to start a season with a 19–1 win–loss record, on the way to winning his first Cy Young Award in 2013. In 2015, Scherzer became the sixth pitcher in Major League history to record multiple no-hitters in a single season, including the first with at least 17 strikeouts and no bases on balls, and the first to accrue a game score of 100 or more twice in one season.[1] On May 11, 2016, he tied the major league nine-inning strikeout record with 20, making him the second player to achieve both a no-hitter and 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning contest. In 2017, he became the third-fastest hurler to record 2,000 strikeouts, and the fourth to strike out 250 or more in four consecutive seasons. Scherzer has more strikeouts (2,449) than any pitcher in the 2010s. He recorded one immaculate inning each in 2017 and 2018.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nScherzer was born and raised in Chesterfield, Missouri, the son of Jan (Shirck) and Brad Scherzer,[2] and grew up a St. Louis Cardinals fan. He attended and played baseball, football, and basketball at Parkway Central High School in his hometown, where he powered through any gap in talent for the games with a fiercely competitive nature that would become a distinctive trademark throughout his athletic career. One of his strongest high school coaching influences was basketball coach Rick Kirby, who stressed fundamentals and was defense-oriented; Scherzer is also likely Kirby's most successful athletic pupil.[3] Marty Maier, then the Cardinals' scouting director, was impressed enough to select him in the 43rd round (1,291st overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. However, he did not sign, and instead attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, also known as \"Mizzou\".[4]\n\nOne of Scherzer's coaches at Mizzou, Tony Vitello, was tasked with helping to recruit him, and eventually helped him to pitch with more balance and control and to stop leaping at hitters, which frequently caused him to miss up and in to right-handed batters. Ever energetic, in his early baseball career Scherzer exerted so much effort in his windup that his \"head whip\" constantly caused his cap to fall off. He did not pitch the final 50 days of his freshman season, instead working out and doing long toss, while gaining velocity in the process. Vitello and head coach Tim Jamieson trained him in a drill to balance on his back leg with more coordination and not to fall over his front foot. Scherzer modified it and worked constantly over the following the winter, and returned his sophomore year to produce a 1.86 earned run average (ERA) and 131 strikeouts in 106 innings pitched over 16 games.[3] In 2005, he won the Big 12 Pitcher of the Year Award.[5]\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks chose Scherzer in the first round and 11th overall in the 2006 MLB draft, making him Mizzou's first-ever MLB first-round draft pick. On January 9, 2012, it was announced that Scherzer would be one of six new inductees to the University of Missouri Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.[5]\n\nProfessional career [ edit ]\n\nArizona Diamondbacks [ edit ]\n\n2006–2008: Draft and minor league career [ edit ]\n\nFollowing his freshman year at the University of Missouri, in 2004, Scherzer made his debut with the La Crosse Loggers of the Northwoods League (NWL), a collegiate summer baseball league. He went 2–1 that summer with a 1.91 ERA with six saves. He also struck out 50 batters in only 33 innings pitched. He was named a mid-season All-Star.[citation needed]\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks chose Scherzer in the first round with the 11th overall pick of the 2006 MLB draft. Mike Rizzo, the Diamondbacks' scouting director, marveled that Scherzer attacked hitters with a relentlessness that he had never seen. Eight pitchers were selected ahead of him, including Luke Hochevar (first overall pick), Brandon Morrow, Clayton Kershaw, and Tim Lincecum. Scouting reports criticized Scherzer for too violent of a delivery, but Rizzo and other Arizona scouts decided that \"the combination of his arm action and his pitching IQ and his attack mode ... we were calling him 'Mad Max' in the draft room. He came at you. He looked angry. He looked mad.\"[6]\n\nHowever, Scherzer and his agent, Scott Boras, at first failed to reach an agreement with the club. Thus, Scherzer began his professional baseball career with the Fort Worth Cats of the independent American Association. After appearing in three games, he signed a four-year, $4.3 million contract with the Diamondbacks.[7]\n\nHe began playing in the Diamondbacks organization in 2007 with the Single-A Visalia Oaks. He was promoted to Double-A Mobile BayBears after three impressive starts for the Oaks. During the 2008 offseason, he was named the fourth-best prospect in the Diamondbacks organization.[8] After a good start to the 2008 season in Triple-A Tucson he was called up to the Diamondbacks on April 27, 2008.\n\n2008–2009: Early major league career [ edit ]\n\nOn April 29, 2008, Scherzer made his MLB debut against the Houston Astros when he came on in relief and threw 4​1⁄ 3 perfect innings while striking out seven. While doing so he set the record for the number of consecutive batters retired (13) for a pitcher making his MLB debut as a reliever. The previous record was 12 set in 1962 by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Pete Richert. The seven strikeouts were one short of the major-league record for most in a debut relief appearance. The Pittsburgh Pirates' Barry Jones had eight on April 20, 1986. On April 30, 2008, the Diamondbacks announced he would be placed into the starting rotation, due to his impressive debut.[9] In his first appearance as a starter for the D-Backs, Scherzer allowed five runs (two earned) in four innings, while striking out five, taking the first loss of his major league career. He returned to the bullpen for much of the 2008 season. He started against the Cardinals on September 24 and lost for the fourth time in his career in a winless season, going five innings, allowing seven hits and four runs (two earned) while walking two and striking out four.[10]\n\nScherzer participated in the 2008 Arizona Fall League season as member of the Phoenix Desert Dogs.\n\nScherzer became a full-time starter in 2009, filling the fifth starter role in the starting rotation. He recorded his first major league victory in a 12–0 win over the Atlanta Braves on May 16, 2009. On May 26, Scherzer recorded his second win of his career. He finished the 2009 season with 30 starts, a 9–11 record, 4.12 ERA, and 174 strikeouts in 170⅓ innings pitched.\n\nAfter the 2009 season, Scherzer worked out in Fort Collins, Colorado, with the Colorado State University baseball team.\n\nDetroit Tigers [ edit ]\n\nOn December 9, 2009, Arizona traded Scherzer along with Daniel Schlereth, Phil Coke, and Austin Jackson to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team agreement that sent Ian Kennedy and Edwin Jackson to the Diamondbacks and Curtis Granderson to the New York Yankees.[11]\n\nIn Detroit, Scherzer materialized from formidable strikeout artist into an ace to team with fellow right-hander Justin Verlander to front the starting rotation together for a period of five seasons and four consecutive playoff appearances. Their achievements culminated in winning the 2012 American League (AL) pennant, only to fall to the San Francisco Giants in the World Series.[12] They missed the playoffs with a third-place finish in 2010, Scherzer's first season with the Tigers, but won the AL Central division each of the following four seasons.[13]\n\n2010 [ edit ]\n\nScherzer warms up before a game in 2010\n\nDetroit optioned Scherzer to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on May 16, replacing him with Armando Galarraga.[14] Shortly thereafter, Scherzer was recalled to the major leagues for good, going 6–4 in twelve starts with an ERA of 2.62 and 85 strikeouts in 75​2⁄ 3 innings.\n\nOn May 30 versus the Oakland Athletics, Scherzer accumulated 14 strikeouts in ​5 2⁄ 3 innings pitched. It was the fourth time in his career that he had 10 or more strikeouts in a single game. He allowed two hits, four walks, and hit a batter on his last pitch. That mark was tied for the most strikeouts in Comerica Park history with Jeremy Bonderman, and tied for second in franchise history behind Mickey Lolich, who had 16 strikeouts in one game. On July 26, Scherzer and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza dueled for a no-hitter into the sixth inning. After ​5 2⁄ 3 hitless innings, Scherzer lost the no-hit bid, shutout, and game after serving up a grand slam to Matt Joyce. Meanwhile, Garza opportunely secured the no-hitter in a 5–0 Tampa win. Scherzer struck out eight.[15]\n\nOn September 1 against the Minnesota Twins, Scherzer pitched into the ninth inning for the first time in his career. He gave up one run on four hits and one walk while striking out nine on 107 pitches, though he received a no-decision as the Tigers lost the game in the tenth inning.[16]\n\nScherzer finished the 2010 season with a 12–11 record, 3.50 ERA and 184 strikeouts. Despite spending some time in the minor leagues, his strikeout total was still good for tenth in the American League.\n\n2011 [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2011 season, Scherzer was the third starter in the rotation, and won six straight starts early in the year, being the first Tiger since Jeremy Bonderman in 2006 to accomplish this feat. Scherzer finished the season with a 15–9 record, and was third in the AL in home runs allowed (29), fourth in wild pitches, fifth in hits by pitch (10), ninth in winning percentage (.625), and tenth in wins.[17]\n\n2012 [ edit ]\n\nOn May 20, 2012, Scherzer struck out 15 Pittsburgh Pirates in seven innings, falling one strikeout short of tying Lolich's franchise record.[18] Scherzer surpassed the 200-strikeout mark for the first time, totaling 231 during the regular season to place second in the league to teammate Verlander with 239.[19] Scherzer's strikeout rate per nine innings (11.1) both surged into the double-digit range and led the AL for the first time. He finished the regular season with other then-personal bests in wins and winning percentage (16–7, .696). In four seasons spanning 2009−12, Scherzer went 52−38, 3.94 ERA, 1.302 WHIP, averaging 9.2 strikeouts per nine innings and 191 strikeouts per season.[20]\n\nDespite battling a late-season injury, Scherzer pitched successfully for the Tigers in the 2012 postseason, after they had won the AL Central division.[21] He made three starts, going 1–0 with a 2.08 ERA, while striking out 26 batters over 17​1⁄ 3 innings. The Tigers reached the World Series, for the first of Scherzer's career, and opposed the San Francisco Giants. He started Game 4, yielded three earned runs in 6​1⁄ 3 innings while striking out eight batters, and received a no-decision as the Tigers lost the game in extra innings, 4−3.[22]\n\n2013: First Cy Young Award [ edit ]\n\nAfter a win against the Tampa Bay Rays on June 28, 2013, Scherzer became the first Tigers pitcher to ever start a season 12–0, surpassing the 11–0 start from George Mullin in 1909.[23] With a win against the Toronto Blue Jays on July 3, Scherzer also became the first major league starter to begin a season 13–0 since Roger Clemens in 1986.[24][25] The streak ended with a loss to the Texas Rangers on July 13.[26]\n\nOn July 1, Scherzer was selected by player vote to represent the American League in the 2013 All-Star Game, his first major league All-Star selection. On July 15, Jim Leyland, who managed the AL All-Star team this season and was also the Tigers manager, announced that he had chosen Scherzer as the AL's starting pitcher. Entering the All-Star break, Scherzer had a 13–1 record, 3.19 ERA, 0.98 WHIP and 152 strikeouts in ​129 2⁄ 3 innings pitched.[27] He pitched a perfect 1-2-3 inning in the game, including striking out Joey Votto for one of three outs.\n\nOn August 8, Scherzer recorded his 1,000th career strikeout when he fanned Jason Kipnis of the Cleveland Indians.[28] With a win over the New York Mets on August 24, Scherzer became the third pitcher in major league history to start a season 19–1, following Clemens in 2001 and Rube Marquard in 1912.[29]\n\nOn September 20, after a 12–5 win over the Chicago White Sox, Scherzer became the first major league pitcher to reach 20 wins. Scherzer became the second Tigers pitcher to reach 20 wins since Bill Gullickson in 1991, following Verlander in 2011, and the 45th in Tigers history.[30] He finished the regular season at 21–3, with a league-leading 0.97 WHIP, 2.90 ERA, and a career-high 240 strikeouts. He was the only 20-game winner in the majors in 2013. Scherzer's stellar season earned him the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, receiving 28 of 30 first-place votes.[31] He also was the winner of the Players Choice Award for AL Outstanding Pitcher,[32] and the Baseball Digest Pitcher of the Year—bestowed annually to one pitcher in the major leagues.[33]\n\nScherzer cultivated a dominant performance in Game 1 of the 2013 ALDS versus the Oakland Athletics, recording 11 strikeouts and giving up just one hit through the first six innings, before surrendering a two-run homer to Yoenis Céspedes. He finished with seven innings pitched, giving up three hits, as he and the Tigers won the game, 3–2.[34] He struck out each of Josh Donaldson, Brandon Moss, and Josh Reddick twice.[35] Scherzer was in line to make a Game 5 start in the same series, but facing elimination in Game 4, manager Jim Leyland chose to bring him in as a reliever in the seventh inning. Scherzer gave up the go-ahead run in the top of the inning, but the Tigers regained the lead in the bottom of the frame. Scherzer then loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the eighth, but wriggled out of trouble by striking out Josh Reddick and Stephen Vogt, then getting Alberto Callaspo to line out to center field. The Tigers won the game, and Scherzer earned the victory to go to 2–0 in the series.[36]\n\nScherzer continued his brilliance into the 2013 ALCS against the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox. In Game 2, he no-hit Boston for ​5 2⁄ 3 innings before surrendering two hits and a run in the bottom of the sixth. He left the game with a 5–1 lead after seven innings, striking out 13. However, a quartet of Tiger relievers blew the lead in the eighth inning, and Boston won it, 6–5, on a walk-off single in the ninth.[37] Scherzer was the losing pitcher in the Tigers' 5–2 loss in Game 6, the deciding and final game of that series.[38]\n\n2014 [ edit ]\n\nOn January 17, 2014, Scherzer and the Tigers agreed on a $15.525 million salary for the 2014 season, avoiding arbitration for the third straight year.[39]\n\nOn May 5, Scherzer struck out nine Houston Astros batters in eight innings of a 2–0 victory. It was his seventh straight game from the start of the season with at least seven strikeouts, establishing a Detroit Tigers franchise record. The streak ended on May 10 against the Minnesota Twins, when he struck out six batters in six innings.[40] The Major League record for consecutive 7+ strikeout games to start the season is nine, accomplished by Bob Feller in 1946.[41]\n\nOn June 12, in his 179th career start, Scherzer consummated both his first career complete game and shutout in a three-hit, 4–0 win versus Chris Sale and the Chicago White Sox. Scherzer struck out eight batters and expended 113 pitches in the contest. It was the longest expanse any major league starter had gone without a complete game since 1900. On 18 previous occasions he had endured at least eight innings, including one for nine that eventually required extra innings to finish, precluding credit for a complete game.[42]\n\nOn July 6, Scherzer was named to his second AL All-Star team by way of manager John Farrell's selection.[43] He pitched a scoreless fifth inning, surrendered a double to Troy Tulowitzki, and struck out Yasiel Puig and Paul Goldschmidt. Scherzer earned the win for the AL.[44]\n\nScherzer finished the 2014 season with an 18–5 record, 3.19 ERA and 1.175 WHIP. New career bests prevailed, including in innings (​220 1⁄ 3 ) and strikeouts (252).[45] His 18 wins tied for the AL lead along with Corey Kluber and Jered Weaver.[46]\n\nMax made his only postseason appearance of 2014 in Game 1 of the ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles. He was tagged with the loss after surrendering five runs (all earned) in ​7 1⁄ 3 innings.[47]\n\nWashington Nationals [ edit ]\n\nScherzer pitching in 2015\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Scherzer agreed to a contract with the Washington Nationals, now led by Rizzo as general manager. The contract was for seven years and $210 million ($222.0 million today), and included a $50 million signing bonus to be paid out over 14 years, the largest deferral in MLB history. At the time, Scherzer owned a 91–50 W–L with a 3.58 ERA in seven seasons with Arizona and Detroit.[48][49] On January 22, it was reported that the contract also specified for Scherzer's salary to be $10 million in 2015, and $15 million in each of the next three seasons. It then increases to $35 million a year in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the seasons in which his deferrals begin. In addition, his contract also includes several award bonuses. He would receive $250,000 for winning a Cy Young, MVP or World Series MVP award, $150,000 if he's the MVP of the League Championship Series and $100,000 if he makes the All-Star team, wins a Gold Glove or wins a Silver Slugger award. The contract did not contain a no-trade clause.[50][51]\n\n2015: Two no-hitters [ edit ]\n\nScherzer made his regular season debut for the Nationals as their Opening Day starting pitcher versus the New York Mets on April 6, 2015. He struck out eight over ​7 2⁄ 3 innings in a 3–1 loss.[52] On June 14, 2015, he pitched his second career complete game, ceding one hit and one walk in a 4–0 shutout against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. He accrued six perfect innings before Carlos Gómez, leading off the seventh inning, fought off a 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) fastball for a bloop single to right field inches past the outstretched glove of second baseman Anthony Rendon. Scherzer's 16 strikeouts established a new personal best and a Nationals team record for one game, surpassing Stephen Strasburg's effort of 14 versus the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 8, 2010.[53] Rated with a game score of 100, Scherzer's was the 12th time in MLB history such a score or higher had been achieved.[54]\n\nSix days later, Scherzer no-hit the Pirates 6–0 at Nationals Park for his first career no-hitter. After retiring the first 26 batters, he came to within one strike of a perfect game, only to hit the 27th batter, José Tábata, who appeared to lean into the pitch.[55] Scherzer secured the no-hitter by retiring the next batter, Josh Harrison, on a fly ball. This was the 13th time that the 27th and presumably final batter disrupted a perfect game in progress.[56][57] The game score was 97, the second occasion on the season where Scherzer had achieved a game score of at least 97. It was a feat previously accomplished just twice, first by Nolan Ryan in 1990 and then Pedro Martínez in 2000.[58]\n\nThe 100th win of Scherzer's career occurred on June 26 in a 5–2 victory versus the Philadelphia Phillies, where he allowed both runs over eight innings. It was his third consecutive start where he did not allow any baserunners for the first five innings.[59] In June, Scherzer's ERA was 1.79[60] during which he was named NL Pitcher of the Month for the second consecutive month. Spanning his last three starts of June, he registered 24 consecutive scoreless innings, retired 52 consecutive batters without allowing a hit, struck out 33, and completed 26 of a possible 27 innings.[61]\n\nScherzer was selected to that year's All-Star Game via players' vote. However, he was unavailable for the game as he had already started on the Sunday before the All-Star break. Prior to that start, his season totals included a 2.12 ERA, 143 strikeouts, and two complete game shutouts.[62]\n\nOver a winless streak of seven starts beginning July 30, Scherzer allowed a 6.08 ERA, seven walks, 11 home runs, a .305/.335/.587 line against and struck out 53 in 40 innings pitched. He earned his 12th win of the season versus Miami on September 14 with eight shutouts innings in a 5–0 win.[63]\n\nOn October 3, Scherzer achieved his second career no-hitter, and second of the season, versus the Mets, striking out a new career-high 17 batters with no walks. The only base runner permitted was via a throwing error by Yunel Escobar in the sixth inning.[1] Several baseball analysts and pundits debated the game as one of the greatest pitching performances of all time, and perhaps the most dominant no-hitter ever pitched, based on the number of strikeouts, lack of walks issued or hit batters, and sheer mastery of the opposing batting order the third time through the lineup. At one point, Scherzer had struck out nine consecutive Mets, just one shy of the Major League record set by Tom Seaver in 1970.[64][65] It tied Ryan for most strikeouts in a no-hitter, was the first no-hitter produced with at least 17 strikeouts and no walks, and made Scherzer the sixth pitcher in MLB history to record multiple no-hitters in one season.[66] With a game score of 104, it was the second-highest achieved on record, and made Scherzer the first to achieve multiple game scores of at least 100 in the same season.[54][66] That game was singled out for the 2015 Esurance MLB Award for Best Performance.[67]\n\nOf Scherzer's three most brilliant performances that season, one tweet adduced that he \"was a bloop single, an over-sized elbow pad, and a throwing error away from throwing three perfect games.\" That description was nearly precise; however, in the June 14 contest versus Milwaukee, Scherzer also issued a bases on ball to Scooter Gennett after allowing Gómez' single—leaving Scherzer four batters short of three perfect games. Thus, he became the first to assemble three games scores of 97 or higher in one season since at least 1914. Ryan and Walter Johnson (1918) were the only two other pitchers to carry out three game scores of 95 or more in one season. In a season that also featured mammoth offensive accomplishments from NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Bryce Harper, the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff contention with a week remaining.[66]\n\nScherzer finished the 2015 season with a 2.79 ERA and 0.92 WHIP, while striking out 276 batters against only 34 walks for an MLB-leading 8.12 K:BB ratio.[68] He also led all major league pitchers in first-strike percentage (73.3%).[69] Despite these exceptional numbers, Scherzer was often the victim of poor hitting support, compiling only a 14–12 record.\n\n2016: Second Cy Young Award and 20-strikeout game [ edit ]\n\nOn May 11, 2016, Scherzer struck out 20 Detroit Tiger batters, his former team, to tie the record for strikeouts over nine innings in a single game, held by Roger Clemens (twice), Randy Johnson, and Kerry Wood. Scherzer became the first pitcher to strike out 20 batters in a regulation game in the 21st century. He accomplished the feat and earned the win in a matchup with former Nationals teammate Jordan Zimmermann; the final score was 3–2.[70][71] Scherzer joined Johnson as the only pitchers to have performed both a 20 strikeout game and a no-hitter during their careers. Nine of the strikeouts ended on three-pitch at bats. Of 119 total pitches discharged, 96 were for strikes; Scherzer did not deliver more than 16 in any inning. It was the first time in history that in any game of 125 or fewer pitches delivered, 96 or more were strikes. It was the third occasion that Tiger manager Brad Ausmus was on the losing the side of a 20-strikeout game; the first two were as a player.[72] It was also Scherzer's first career victory versus Detroit, positing him as the 17th hurler to earn a win against all 30 MLB teams.[73]\n\nOn July 8, 2016, Scherzer was named to the National League squad at the All-Star Game in San Diego as roster replacement for teammate Stephen Strasburg, who was recently activated from the DL. Scherzer performed in relief in the sixth inning, allowing no baserunners.[74] His aggregate season batting achievements included a career-best 12 RBI, which ranked second among major league pitchers to Adam Wainwright with 18.[75]\n\nScherzer was named the National League Cy Young Award winner on November 16, 2016, winning his second Cy Young Award on the strength of a 20–7 record, 2.96 ERA, MLB-leading 284 strikeouts, and an MLB-leading 0.968 WHIP. He became just the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history to win the award in both the American and the National Leagues. He won two of the 2016 Esurance MLB/This Year in Baseball Awards: for Best Pitcher, and his 20-strikeout game was singled out for Best Performance.[77]\n\n2017: Third Cy Young Award [ edit ]\n\nHaving sustained a stress fracture in a knuckle of his right ring finger prior to the 2017 season, Scherzer was unavailable to start Opening Day for the Nationals. He navigated a delayed start to spring training and missed the World Baseball Classic.[78] Nonetheless, he avoided spending any time on the disabled list to start the season. On May 14, 2017, he pitched his first career immaculate inning, striking out César Hernández, Odubel Herrera, and Aaron Altherr on nine pitches in the fourth inning versus Philadelphia. It was the 84th immaculate inning in the major leagues, and second in Nationals' history, following Zimmermann's versus the Florida Marlins in 2011.[79] In a 2–1 win versus the Dodgers on June 6, Scherzer struck out 14. He obtained the first 10 outs of the game via strikeout in spite of his own throwing error on a pickoff attempt, two walks allowed, and a passed ball by Matt Wieters.[80]\n\nOn June 11, Scherzer became the third-fastest pitcher to reach 2,000 strikeouts (after Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw) by striking out Nomar Mazara of the Texas Rangers. Scherzer also reached the 2,000 plateau in the third-fewest innings (1,784), behind Pedro Martínez (​1,711 1⁄ 3 ) and Randy Johnson (​1,733 1⁄ 3 ).[81] Scherzer attained ​7 1⁄ 3 no-hit innings versus the Marlins on June 21 until A. J. Ellis hit a comebacker that tipped off Scherzer's glove and trickled toward shortstop Trea Turner for Miami's first hit. Scherzer had struck out 11 and allowed one walk to that point in the contest.[82] He won the NL Pitcher of the Month Award for June, allowing 14 hits and four earned runs for a 0.99 ERA over the course of ​36 1⁄ 3 innings through five starts. His record was 3–2 and he struck out 51 for an average of 12.63 per nine innings.[83]\n\nNamed to his fifth MLB All-Star Game, Scherzer was NL manager Joe Maddon's selection as the squad's starting pitcher, making him the oldest starter in that lineup. He became the fifth pitcher to start at least one All-Star Game for both the American and National Leagues. At the time of his selection, he consolidated a 10–5 record and an NL-leading both of a 2.10 ERA and 173 strikeouts.[84] Played at Marlins Park in Miami, he tossed 15 pitches over one scoreless inning and struck out Aaron Judge and George Springer.[85]\n\nOn August 1, Scherzer hit his first career home run, a three-run blast off Chris O'Grady of the Marlins, but left the game shortly thereafter with neck spasms.[86] The neck issued recurred, and the club placed Scherzer on the disabled list for the first time since 2009, retroactive to August 15. He was then removed from his next start on August 18 against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park as the neck issue recurred.[87] Scherzer returned to the rotation on August 28, earning a win against the Marlins.\n\nOn September 19, Scherzer carried out 250 strikeouts for the fourth consecutive season, phasing into the fourth pitcher in major league history to do so, following Ferguson Jenkins, Randy Johnson, and Pedro Martínez. Scherzer rebounded from an 8–2 loss with seven runs and six walks allowed to Atlanta in his previous start, to strike out seven and with five hits and one walk allowed over seven innings in a 4–2 win, also against Atlanta.[88]\n\nIn 2017 he was 16-6 with a 2.51 ERA.[89] He led the majors in giving up the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls (26.5%).[90]\n\nEnd of season awards for Scherzer included selection as a starting pitcher on Baseball America's All-MLB Team.[91] Scherzer also won the 2017 National League Cy Young Award—his third[92]—making him the tenth pitcher in history to win at least three.[93] He was the Players Choice Award winner for National League Outstanding Pitcher, the second of his career.[94] He was also elected to the Arizona Fall League Hall of Fame in late 2017, along with Mike Trout and David Wright, and had his number 51 jersey retired by the Scottsdale Scorpions. His AFL achievements included a 2.13 ERA in eight games in 2017 and a 3.38 ERA over four starts in 2008.[95]\n\n2018 [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the 2018 season, Sports Illustrated graded Scherzer as the top pitcher, and fourth-best overall player in baseball, following Trout, José Altuve, and Kris Bryant. In his first 98 starts with the Nationals from 2015–17, Scherzer accumulated the most innings, strikeouts, and pitching WAR. He initiated a contest with at least five hitless innings 11 times, including successfully concluding two no-hitters.[96] He made his third Opening Day start for Washington and struck out seven consecutive Cincinnati Reds batters on the way to a 2−0 win. His ten batters struck out overall set a club Opening Day record.[97] While playing Atlanta on April 9, he pilfered his first career base in the seventh inning, versus pitcher Peter Moylan and catcher Kurt Suzuki. On the mound, Scherzer gained a complete game shutout, the fifth of his career. He struck out 10 and allowed two hits and no walks.[98] He earned the NL Pitcher of the Month Award in April while leading the league in strikeouts (57) and wins (4), and ranking fourth in each of ERA (1.62), WHIP (.082) and opposing batting average (.165).[99] On May 6, Scherzer emerged as the first pitcher in major league history to produce 15 strikeouts in one game in ​6 1⁄ 3 innings (19 outs) or fewer, doing so versus the Philadelphia Phillies. Twelve consecutive outs occurred vía strikeout, including striking out the side in the third, fourth, and fifth innings.[100] It was the second-longest such streak in major league history, his fifth career 15-strikeout game, and the 69th with at least 10.[101] He made his following start versus the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he struck out 11 batters and hit an RBI double for the go-ahead run in the fourth inning that furnished a 3–1 Nationals victory.[102] In a May 19 start versus the Dodgers, Scherzer struck out 13, including dispatching his 100th of the season in 63 innings. It eclipsed Kerry Wood's record for fewest innings to reach 100 strikeouts with ​65 2⁄ 3 realized in 2001. Still, the Nationals lost the game, 4–5, off a blown save by Sean Doolittle.[103]\n\nWith a 2–0 win over Baltimore on May 30, Scherzer procured career win number 150, while striking out 12 over eight shutout innings.[104] He was named the NL Pitcher of the Month for the month of May—his second consecutive monthly award—after going 4–0 with a 2.21 ERA and a league-leading 63 strikeouts.[105][106] Entering as a pinch hitter in the 14th inning on June 2 versus the Braves, Scherzer singled for his first career pinch hit and scored the go-ahead run on a triple by Wilmer Difo in a 5–3 victory.[107][108] In the June 5 contest versus the Tampa Bay Rays, Scherzer settled his second career immaculate inning, striking out Johnny Field, Christian Arroyo and Daniel Robertson in the sixth inning.[109] He advanced into one of five major league pitchers to have recorded more than one in their careers, joining Lefty Grove, Randy Johnson, Nolan Ryan, and Sandy Koufax. Scherzer allowed both runs as earned, five hits, and finished with 13 strikeouts as the Nationals won 4–2, improving his record to 10–1, the first in the major leagues with 10 wins.[110]\n\nIn a span of four following starts, Scherzer lost three times as the Nationals' offense was shut out each time. He lost another outing, 4−3, to the Boston Red Sox on July 2 while collecting his 1,000th strikeout since joining Washington. That vested him as the 11th pitcher in major league history to reach 1,000 strikeouts with two different clubs.[111] He was selected as the NL starting pitcher in the All-Star Game, played at Nationals Park, for his third starting assignment. After allowing a home run to Aaron Judge, Scherzer became the third All-Star Game starter within the previous 30 years to strike out at least four batters.[112] He procured his 200th regular season strikeout in 2018 on July 27 versus the Marlins, retiring Justin Bour with a swinging strikeout, to gridlock with Walter Johnson and Roger Clemens with seven consecutive seasons of 200 or more strikeouts. The three trailed Seaver as the all-time leader with nine consecutive seasons.[113]\n\nOn August 12, Scherzer pitched 7 strong shutout innings, striking out 11 while giving up just three hits and one walk during a primetime night game at Wrigley Field. Once again however, he was awarded a no decision. Up 3-0 in the bottom of the ninth, Nationals pitcher Ryan Madson hit two batters and gave up an infield single before issuing a \"golden homer\"[114] - a 2 out, 2 strike, walk-off grand slam to Cubs rookie David Bote. After the game Scherzer spoke on the loss, saying \"I mean, it's a gut punch\".[115]\n\nOn September 25, Scherzer reached 300 strikeouts on the season, striking out Austin Dean of the Miami Marlins in a 10-pitch at-bat in the seventh inning of a 9–4 Nationals win.[116]\n\nFor the 2018 season, he was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA.[89] He threw 3,493 pitches, more than any other major league pitcher.[117]\n\nInternational career [ edit ]\n\nWorld Baseball Classic [ edit ]\n\nMax Scherzer was initially going to play for Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.[118] However, in early January 2017 it was reported that he would not play in the tournament after suffering a stress fracture in the knuckle of his right ring finger. He was replaced by teammate Tanner Roark.[119]\n\nPitching and preparation style [ edit ]\n\nHe's definitely a different breed, always has been. Just seeing the way he goes about things. He's a machine. —David Price, Scherzer's teammate in Detroit[120]\n\nMax goes to a different level with everything: hitting, baserunning, pitching, all facets of the game. —Derek Lilliquist, Nationals pitching coach[120]\n\nWith a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm) Scherzer throws five pitches: a four-seam fastball with good movement averaging 92–96 mph (topping out at 99 mph[121]), a slider at 85–86 mph, a changeup at 84–85 mph, a cutter at 88–89 mph and a curveball at 78–79 mph.[122] He primarily uses a fastball-slider combination against right-handed hitters and a fastball-changeup-cutter combination against left-handed hitters. Occasionally, he also throws a curveball for the first strike in an at-bat.[123]\n\nScherzer has been nicknamed \"Mad Max\" due in part to a perceived higher-than-normal intensity during game play, and unusual and extensive preparation techniques.[120] He also prepares intently on other aspects of the game, including hitting and baserunning. According to Nationals manager Dave Martinez, Scherzer differentiated himself from other major league pitchers because of his focus on hitting in addition to the work on his pitching. As of August 6, 2018, his batting average as a pitcher (.283) on the season was second-best at his position in the National League to Germán Márquez (.350).[124]\n\nAwards and achievements [ edit ]\n\nMLB records and other distinctions\n\nMost strikeouts in one nine-inning game (20–tied, on May 11, 2016) [71]\n\nMost game scores of 100 or higher in one season (2, in 2015) [66]\n\nFewest innings to reach 100 strikeouts in one season (63, on May 19, 2018) [103]\n\nFewest innings to reach 15 strikeouts in one game (​ 6 1 ⁄ 3 , on May 12, 2018) [100]\n\n, on May 12, 2018) Most consecutive batters retired in relief appearance as MLB debut (13, on April 29, 2008) [9]\n\nThird-fewest innings to reach 2,000 strikeouts (1,784, on June 11, 2017) [81]\n\nFourth pitcher with four consecutive seasons of 250 or more strikeouts (2017) [88]\n\nFifth pitcher to achieve two immaculate innings[110]\n\nOther achievements\n\nTwo no-hitters pitched in one season: versus the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 20, 2015 [56] versus the New York Mets on October 3, 2015 [1]\n\nTwo immaculate inning pitched versus the Philadelphia Phillies on May 14, 2017 [79] versus the Tampa Bay Rays on June 5, 2018 [109]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nScherzer met his future wife, Erica May, at the University of Missouri, where both were pitchers.[127] May pitched for the Mizzou softball team before a heart condition forced her to stop playing.[128] The couple married in November 2013, shortly after the end of the Detroit Tigers season, after more than eight years of dating.[127] In November 2017, they welcomed a daughter, Brooklyn May-Scherzer.[129] The family resides in McLean, a suburb of Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia. They own four rescue dogs and two cats.[130]\n\nThe Scherzers are socially active. In 2013, they partnered with the Detroit Tigers Foundation on a program called Scherzer's Superstars, in which groups from the Metropolitan Detroit chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America were invited to Comerica Park every Tuesday home game to meet Scherzer and some of his Detroit teammates and go down to the field for batting practice.[131] In 2015, after her husband signed with the Washington Nationals and inspired by the actions of his future teammate Sean Doolittle and Doolittle's future wife, activist and sports journalist Eireann Dolan, Erica May-Scherzer partnered with organizers of the Nationals' annual \"Night Out\" event for LGBT fans and led an effort by Nationals' spouses to promote the event.[128][132] May-Scherzer is an ambassador for the Polaris Project, which aims to stop human trafficking;[130][133] Scherzer started a fundraiser during the Nationals' 2016 season called Strike Out Modern Slavery in which the couple matched donations to Polaris for every strikeout Scherzer threw that season.[134][135] Both Max and Erica are also involved with the Humane Rescue Alliance, announcing after Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 that they would personally cover all pet adoption fees from the Washington, D.C.-based group's shelters for four days.[136]\n\nScherzer's younger and only brother, Alex, died by suicide early in the summer of 2012. Alex had a passion for analyzing advanced baseball statistics or sabermetrics. Scherzer learned the value of sabermetrics from his brother, and he implements this as a tool to improve his game. Since Alex's death, Scherzer dedicates every start to his late brother.[137][138]\n\nScherzer has heterochromia iridum; his right eye is blue and his left eye is brown.[139][140] On June 12, 2011, the Detroit Tigers distributed a bobblehead doll depicting Scherzer, with the condition correctly portrayed.[141] In the spring of 2017, the Nationals unveiled a \"delightfully creepy\" crop of Scherzer's eyes, correctly portrayed as blue and brown, with backward and forward Ks photoshopped into the pupils.[142]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Well, you can imagine what the recommendation [from police] will be,\" Mr. Jang said Tuesday.\n\nThe city is accepting applications until the end of this week for a special class of business licence that will charge dispensaries hefty fees and impose limits on who can operate them and where they can set up shop. While storefront pot sales remain illegal, the city said it had no choice but to attempt to regulate the explosion of dispensaries in Vancouver.\n\nThe Vancouver Police have executed 11 search warrants at the city's pot dispensaries since 2012, the most recent last week at a shop operated by the Limelife Society chain in the east side of the city.\n\nCourt documents filed to secure the warrant allege police raided the Limelife dispensary after investigators determined it was being run by an alleged Hells Angel associate, as well as allegedly selling pot to minors. That was the first time law enforcement has drawn a direct link between organized crime groups, which ran B.C.'s illicit marijuana trade in decades past, and the dispensaries that now dot most commercial areas of the city.\n\nThe allegations have not been tested in court and the owner of the Limelife chain, Robert Clarke, did not return requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nLast week, Mr. Clarke said he has absolutely no connection to gangs and he has never been charged with a crime.\n\nEven though police said they were not investigating the other three Limelife locations for links to the Hells Angels, Geoff Meggs, a Vision councillor, said if one location in a chain has been raided over such allegations, then every store owned by the same person should be disqualified from getting a new business licence.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"If they're all under similar business administration, then the accountability would be at the top and it would cast a shadow over all of the licences,\" said Mr. Meggs, who has previously raised concerns about the potential role criminals may play in the dispensary sector.\n\nCity staff say one person can apply for a pot-shop licence to operate up to five separate locations of the same chain and another person can apply for more locations using that same name. Non-profit compassion clubs can be licensed to a sole person or non-profit society.\n\nDon Briere, a recreational cannabis crusader who was jailed for running one of the province's largest networks of illegal grow operations in the '90s, said he doesn't know whether two of his Weeds Glass and Gifts chain of pot shops would secure a new licence after being raided for allegedly selling to kids.\n\nHe said he is applying to for five business licences for Weeds locations and franchisee owners of four of his other shops will apply to be regulated under the new regime.\n\nMr. Briere says he is \"on the same page and the same side as the police,\" noting he filed a complaint with police earlier this year after a Hells Angel allegedly threatened him not to open a new store in East Vancouver.\n\nMr. Jang said annual police record checks for all employees and a regimen of monthly and spot visits by building and bylaw inspectors will also help eliminate any criminal element from newly licensed dispensaries.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"This way you have way more eyes on these places than you ever had before,\" Mr. Jang said. \"These guys all slip up eventually.\"\n\nNone of the dispensaries are selling cannabis legally, which can only be done under the federal medical marijuana system. However, the police department has allowed them to openly hawk their products so long as they don't let minors buy products and aren't tied to gangsters.\n\nPolice have conducted 11 raids on nine dispensaries, often seizing all cannabis products and cash found on site, since the number of pot shops rocketed up from a handful three years ago to about 100 now. They say the raids, often to stop the sale of pot to kids, have resulted in the drug squad recommending 29 charges against 20 people.\n\nHowever, only 10 of those involved with the shops in question have been formally charged and are now involved in court cases, according to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, which handles federal drug offences.\n\nCity staff wouldn't say how many applications have been filed for the new dispensary and compassion club licences.\n\nWith a report from The Canadian Press",
  "latent_27696": "This year’s New York Comic Con had many treats in store for fans, including those searching for the next big sci-fi film. The popular comic book series “The Amory Wars” is getting the Hollywood treatment, courtesy of Mark Wahlberg and Leverage, the production company behind “Boardwalk Empire” and “Entourage.”\n\n“The Amory Wars” is the sci-fi epic dream child of Claudio Sanchez, owner of Evil Ink Comics and the front man for the post-hardcore band Coheed and Cambria. Sanchez was on hand at NY Comic Con to sign the hardcover book “The Amory Wars: In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth 3” — which contains all 12 issues of the popular comic series — and to sign the band’s new CD, which happens to be a prequel to the comic book story.\n\n“The Amory Wars is the artwork for the music Coheed and Cambria, the band, released and it’s essentially the first five records. It’s basically their story,” says Sanchez about how his music and comic series build off each other and create one gripping sci-fi story.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t familiar with his band Coheed and Cambria, they are a progressive, hardcore, punk metal band whose concept albums tell the science fiction story of characters Coheed Kilgannon and Cambria Kilgannon’s fight against a tyrannical ruler named Wilhelm Ryan. Essentially, each studio album tells a chapter of the comic book series.\n\n“The Afterman: Ascension” is actually the origin tale of Sirus Amory, the name sake of the mythology, Sanchez says.\n\n“The Amory Wars” is set in Heaven’s Fence, a gathering of 78 planets held together by interconnecting beams of energy. As the story evolves Coheed and Cambria’s son Claudio assumes responsibility as the savior of Heaven’s Fence.\n\n“I started this concept when I was 18 years-old [and] I found that as a song writer I had a hard time confessing myself in lyrics, but I did want that release,” says Sanchez. But letting people know his personal experiences proved difficult, so he created elaborate stories around the music. “That way I can kind of pose it as something else. The concept is essentially a curtain that I could hide behind,” says Sanchez.\n\nThe characters in the story all draw their personalities from Sanchez’s family, friends and even himself. “Coheed and Cambria are loosely based after my parents. Some of the [others] are based on real people I know or parts of people I know, “says Sanchez, adding, ” Some of the things that [Claudio] goes through are very science fiction-based and very fantasy heavy that sort of mimic some of the things I’ve experience in life.”\n\nFor Sanchez, whose father is Puerto Rican and mother is Italian, family shaped him while growing up in Nyack, NY.\n\n“My family is very much the living version of the West Side Story, without the singing. I’ll take an alcapurria and stuff it into lasagna,” he says. Sanchez remembers speaking Spanish as a kid. Now he admits he can no longer speak Spanish, but he still understands it. “Although I was into rock music, I grew up listening to all kinds of music including Latin and there are elements of that in our music and in ‘Afterman’ our new CD.” According to Sanchez you can hear those Latin elements in the song Evagria.\n\nNext up for a Coheed and Cambria, the release of “The Afterman: Descension” in February 2013. As for Sanchez’s comic career, he’s currently working on creating a superhero book, saying, “I just have a love for creating these odd things; it’s just a release for me.”\n\nEneida I.

  "latent_27730": "On Monday evening, trade groups representing a host of industry workers (architects, real estate agents, community bankers, air conditioner repairmen, beer wholesalers, door inspectors) released a statement expressing grave concerns with Senate Republicans’ tax bill.\n\nThe bill, they argued, did too little for “pass-through businesses”: companies organized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, or S corporations that don’t pay the corporate income tax. Sure, the bill still shields those companies from the corporate tax, and adds a new 17.4 percent deduction on pass-through income for people who own the companies.\n\nBut it’s not enough, the interest groups stressed: The deduction, they complain, is “temporary and too low,” and efforts to restrain the deduction’s cost go too far.\n\nTrade groups send those kinds of letters all the time. But the debate over taxation on pass-through businesses — which account for more than 95 percent of all of America’s businesses in 2012 — is increasingly crucial to the Republican efforts to pass a tax bill.\n\nMany Republican senators seem to agree that merely exempting the companies from corporate tax and adding a new special deduction isn’t enough. Republican Sens. Steve Daines of Montana and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said that they won’t support the Senate tax bill unless it cuts taxes more on pass-throughs. And President Donald Trump has a strong incentive to push for more breaks for pass-throughs as well: The Trump Organization is organized as a collection of pass-through entities, so he and his family would benefit enormously from additional tax breaks for pass-throughs.\n\nAll the more remarkable: Most economists agree that pass-through businesses already get preferential tax treatment relative to other companies. There are political reasons why people are pushing for pass-throughs to benefit still more. But there’s basically no economic rationale for giving them an extra leg up.\n\nPass-through income overwhelmingly goes to rich people\n\nThe pass-through lobby likes to act as though “pass-through” is synonymous with “small business,” and by some definitions that’s true. A bodega or corner shop is likelier to be organized as a pass-through (like a sole proprietorship or LLC) than as a C corporation, the legal designation for companies that pay corporate income taxes.\n\nBut there are a lot of large high-profit companies that are organized as pass-throughs as well. Large family-owned businesses are a great example. The Trump Organization’s companies are pass-throughs, for instance, and no one would confuse it with a small business. “Most hedge funds, private equity funds, law, consulting, and accounting firms are partnerships; these businesses can be large, global enterprises,” Brookings’ Aaron Krupkin and Adam Looney write.\n\nFor instance, Renaissance Technologies, which is arguably the most successful hedge fund in history, having minted four billionaires or near-billionaires among its employees (including Trump mega-donor Robert Mercer), is a partnership and therefore a pass-through. That’s not a small business in any sense of the word.\n\nImportantly for federal tax policy, a tiny handful of super-successful pass-throughs account for the outsized share of profits taxed. Only 0.37 percent of S corporations, for instance, had gross receipts above $50 million in 2012, but according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, those companies accounted for 40 percent of all S-corp profits that year. The 0.27 percent of partnerships with more than $50 million in receipts accounted for 68.2 percent of all partnership income.\n\nAnd the overwhelming majority of pass-through income goes to the top 1 percent — about 70 percent, per U Chicago economist Owen Zidar. That makes sense. Even if your business is small, you need to be reasonably successful and have some capital to get it going. Accountants, lawyers, doctors in private practice, and other people with partnership income typically have advanced degrees and earn well over the median, even if they consider themselves middle class. For hedge funds and truly huge closely held companies (like, say, Hobby Lobby), the incomes involved are even higher.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that while only 19 percent of middle-class Americans have pass-through income, 88 percent of the top 0.1 percent do, and 77.2 percent of the top 1 percent do. For a quarter of the ultrarich top 0.1 percent (people earning over $3.5 million a year), pass-throughs account for a majority of their income. Over two-thirds of all pass-through income is either taxed at the top 39.6 percent rate or the top 28 percent Alternative Minimum Tax rate. (AMT hits a lot of pass-throughs because it limits how much you can deduct in business losses.)\n\nYou can also see this dynamic at work when you analyze who wins from Republican proposals to reduce taxes on pass-throughs. The tax bill passed by the House of Representatives cuts taxes on pass-throughs a little differently, by creating a new 25 percent top bracket for pass-through income, lower than the 39.6 percent top bracket on all other individual income. However, TPC finds that 86.1 percent of taxpayers with pass-through income already pay a 25 percent or lower rate. So capping the rate at that level only helps people rich enough to be in higher brackets.\n\nSure enough, when TPC modeled the effects of a 25 percent cap on pass-through taxes, they found no benefit for the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers, while 85 percent to 88 percent of the benefit accrues to the top 1 percent.\n\nThe Senate proposal helps a broader range of people by creating a deduction for pass-through income rather than capping the rate. But that deduction still gives disproportionate benefit to the rich, just because the rich earn the majority of pass-through income.\n\nPass-through tax breaks create a big new loophole for the rich\n\nBoth the Senate and House proposals also create new tax loopholes for individuals who don’t currently own any pass-through companies. Suppose that Vox.com paid me way, way more than it actually does, and I was in the 39.6 percent tax bracket — even after the House tax bill limits that bracket to income over $1 million (lol, that’ll be the day). Then the tax bill also creates a new 25 percent maximum bracket for pass-through money. I could, in theory, just start up the Dylan Matthews Corporation as an LLC or sole proprietorship and contract with Vox.com to provide tax explainer services on an ongoing basis. Then I’d be entitled to the new 25 percent rate.\n\nThe House and Senate bills each have provisions meant to prevent this kind of tax gaming. The House bill, for instance, exempts income from professional partnerships like law firms from the lower rate, and limits other people who actively work at their pass-through companies to having only 30 percent of their income taxed at the new lower rate. But smart tax lawyers are already figuring out ways around those limitations.\n\nAnd our actual experience with tax breaks like this suggests that gaming is rampant. In 2013, Kansas started exempting pass-through income from all state income taxation. The result, careful analysis of tax returns showed, was not an increase in investment or hiring, but pure gamesmanship. In the words of economists Jason Matthew DeBacker, Bradley Heim, Shanthi Ramnath, and Justin Ross, who studied the change, “the behavioral responses were overwhelmingly tax avoidance rather than real supply side responses.”\n\nIn other words: People used the provision to pay less tax, not to contribute to economic growth.\n\nPass-throughs are already advantaged relative to other companies\n\nSo if pass-through money overwhelmingly goes to the rich, and giving it a tax break opens up a loophole for rich individuals, why in the world are Republicans trying to do it?\n\nThe most common argument you hear from the pass-through lobby (which includes, notably, lobbying firms themselves, who organize as partnerships) is that pass-throughs face a higher rate than C corporations. Today, the top corporate rate is 35 percent, and the top pass-through rate is 39.6 percent. Under the Senate bill, the top rate for corporations is 20 percent, and the top pass-through rate for people getting the full benefit is 31.8 percent. Isn’t that unfair?\n\nBut C corporations are taxed in two stages. First, they pay the corporate income tax on their profits (35 percent now, 20 percent under the GOP plan). Then they distribute the profits to their shareholders, either through dividends or stock buybacks. And depending on the type of dividend or stock buyback, that income is taxed at the shareholder level either as normal income (at a top rate of 39.6 percent, or 38.5 percent under the Senate plan, plus 3.8 percent in Medicare payroll taxes) or capital gains income (at a top rate of 20 percent, plus a 3.8 percent Obamacare surcharge).\n\nFor simplicity, let’s just talk about the current tax code for a moment. Suppose the Acme Corporation earns $100 in profit. Assuming it doesn’t do any international tax avoidance, it pays $35 in corporate tax. Then it distributes the rest to a shareholder, Carl, by buying back his shares. Carl gets $65, and because he held the shares for long enough he’s entitled to a 20 percent capital gains rate on that earnings (assuming he makes enough money doing other things to be in the top bracket). So he pays $13, leaving $52 in profits. The total tax rate on the profits was about 48 percent.\n\nNow let’s suppose that Acme is a pass-through. That $100 would go straight to Carl, who’d pay a 39.6 percent marginal rate on it. He pays $39.60 and keeps $61.40. He’s substantially better off than he would’ve been if Acme organized as a C corporation and paid corporate taxes. (My colleague Alvin Chang has a great cartoon explaining this comparison in more detail.)\n\nOf course, the real world is more complicated than this stylized example. A lot of shares are in tax-protected IRAs and 401(k)s and their dividends and buybacks aren’t taxed at all, helping C-corps whose shares are held that way. But many share buybacks are dividends also taxed at higher individual rates, not the low capital gains rates. And economists who’ve looked at the issue generally conclude that pass-throughs have the better of the deal. Companies typically only organize as C-corps when they have too many owners to feasibly distribute earnings to each of them individually in the way that pass-throughs must.\n\n“The so-called ‘rate parity’ approach would not actually achieve parity between pass-through businesses and C corporations,” Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, writes. “Instead, it would put C corporations at a significant tax disadvantage and would move the tax code further away from neutrality between business forms.”\n\nAnd more to the point, who cares if pass-throughs are taxed more than C-corps as a result of tax reform? Pass-throughs who feel mistreated have a simple fix available to them: They can become C-corps. This option is available to just about any pass-through company. The fact that pass-throughs don’t take this option is further evidence of what a great deal they’re already getting.\n\nThis is a fight about politics more than policy\n\nSo if pass-throughs are already advantaged, why are some politicians so intent on making them more advantaged?\n\nIt’s hard to think of a principled case for additional breaks. The closest thing to a good argument I can think of is this:\n\nIt’s generally better to tax corporate earnings at the shareholder level, where you can be taxed based on ability to pay, than at the entity-level, where it’s less clear who’s ultimately paying the bill Cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent might advantage C-corps, without a generous deduction for pass-throughs You don’t want pass-throughs to just become C-corps, because of Proviso No. 1, and so: You should complement the corporate rate cut with a pass-through cut\n\nBut if you don’t think individual taxation is inherently better than corporate taxation, that reasoning breaks down. And in any case, it’s not the argument that Daines and Johnson and other pass-through allies in the Senate are making.\n\nInstead, legislators appear to have bought into the false notion that pass-throughs are small businesses, and are responding to the organized efforts of trade groups composed of pass-throughs, who push that narrative aggressively (and with the help of pass-through lobbying firms).\n\nNYU tax law professor Daniel Shaviro has referred to the pass-through break as “New Plutocratic Industrial Policy,” a provision that benefits the rich and specific companies for no justifiable economic reason. That’s pretty close to the consensus on this idea that I’ve seen from economists and tax law experts.",
  "latent_27759": "Career paths are being reshaped — some say permanently — in part because of the massive movement toward temporary employment. These changes will be felt most by young people, who face the prospect of a lifetime of temporary or part time work, an uncertain career path, and a lower standard of living with little or no payoff for their post-secondary education.\n\nThe evidence for this rather bleak picture is growing:\n\nIn my Financial Post column, “The Notion of Contract Workers Is Here To Stay,” I cited McKinsey & Co., which reported that “65% of U.S. corporations have restructured their workforce and have no plans to return to pre-recession employment, but rather are opting for contingent and contract work when the need for expansion takes place.”\n\nA 2013 Gallup poll reported one of every five workers is now part-time. And according to the U.S. Department of Labor, 30% of all part-timers fall into the involuntary category. Another rising trend reported by\n\nis that employers are changing part-time workers’ schedules from week to week, with only 10% having a set schedule. One of the main arguments against part-time work is that forced part-time workers share far less than full-timers in economic prosperity. Companies invest less in their training and they get less work experience, and fewer promotions.\n\n“In the past two decades, many major retailers went from a quotient of 70% to 80% full-time to at least 70% part-time…[and]the retail and wholesale sector has cut a million full-time jobs since 2006, while adding more than 500,000 part-time jobs,”argues Steven Greenhouse, in an article in The New York Times.\n\nThe use of part-timers has escalated because of the declining power of labour unions, Susan J. Lambert, a professor of organizational theory at the University of Chicago, argues.\n\nA report by technology firm Mavenlink, titled “The New Independent Workforce,” shows a significant increase in the number of self-employed, independent service firms, solopreneurs and temporary workers in the U.S. It predicts the contingent workforce will increase 40%, or 65 million people, by 2020. Those people will not work in traditional jobs where they work consistently for one employer who provides benefits and insurance.\n\nMany of the temporary jobs held by millennials are now most likely to be in the service industry, a recent survey from Millennial Branding and Payscale shows. That survey is backed by a report by the Economic Policy Institute, which predicts 30% of U.S. workers are expected to hold low-wage jobs — defined as earnings at or below the poverty line to support a family — by the year 2020. Given that roughly 50% of recent university graduates are unemployed or underemployed and those who do work are much more likely to hold these types of jobs, their prosperity prospects are bleak.\n\nThese trends are not isolated to the U.S. A 2012 study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that looked at 10 countries including Australia, Italy, Japan and Germany found similar declines in full time employment since 1985. Temporary work raises long-term questions for the economy. In the past two decades, job security has become unraveled, accompanied by a deterioration in benefits, livable wages and clearly defined career pathways.\n\nWe are witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature of employment, or social contract.\n\nYoung people will miss out on skill development, and bear the brunt of labour market fluctuations and restructuring their entire lives at a time when developed nations, which have aging populations, are increasingly reliant on younger workers to fund their entitlements.\n\n— Ray Williams is President of Ray Williams Associates, a company based in Vancouver providing leadership training, executive coaching and speaking services.

In fact, we’ve got some exclusively Bangor-made stuff that you can’t find just anywhere, as well as some other goodies sure to please even the hardest-to-please King fan.\n\nThe best Stephen King gifts are books, naturally, but for the fanatic that’s got everything, here are some extra special goodies for the giving.\n\nStephen King Pop Vinyl by Funko\n\nFunko makes adorable big-headed figurines out of just about every pop cultural, sports or historic icon you can imagine, including tons of King figurines. There are four different Pennywise ones available, including obviously totally harmless smiling Pennywise, definitely not harmless at all Pennywise, a Walmart exclusive Pennywise with long flowing locks, and, of course, retro Tim Curry Pennywise. There are also figurines of Carrie, Danny Torrance, Wendy Torrance, the Gunslinger, the Man in Black, and Jack Torrance, both frozen and unfrozen. Available online in all sorts of places, including ThinkGeek.com, ToyWiz.com, and Amazon.\n\nOverlook Hotel keychains\n\nYou can let fellow Constant Readers know you’re a fan in a low key kind of way (pun intended) with these cool, retro-looking keychains inspired by various locations in King’s novels. Places like the Overlook Hotel in “The Shining,” Room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York, and a keychain from Darnell’s Auto Repair from “Christine.” Speaking of “Christine,” how about this fun replica of the famed 1958 Plymouth Fury from both the book and the movie?\n\nMolly, aka the Thing of Evil, after believing Donald Trump was the CANDIDATE of evil, switches her allegiance to someone even worse. pic.twitter.com/ZkvrfPffE5 — Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 2, 2016\n\nVote Pennywise shirts and signs\n\nSeeing as Pennywise lives in Bangor’s sewers and abandoned houses — excuse me, DERRY’s sewers and abandoned houses — we’d like to think we have a close, personal relationship with the guy. So last year, during election season, when “Vote Pennywise” signs appeared around town next to other campaign signs, no one batted an eye. You can buy one of those signs through Bangor’s own Gerald Winters and Son, as well as t-shirts printed with the slogan. Limited quantities available for the sign. You’ll vote too…\n\nBDN King photo prints\n\nWe’ve been covering Stephen King for decades — and we’ve got the photos to prove it. Did you know you can have any of our BDN photos printed for a small fee? Sure can. If you’re looking for that one-of-a-kind King piece to gift, try something from one of our talented BDN photographers. Like this, from 1982:\n\nOr this:\n\nOr this, for something a little more holiday-centric:\n\nTo order, visit store.bangordailynews.com and go from there. Also, be on the lookout in the coming weeks for a limited edition fine art print of Stephen King’s iconic “Study Dammit!” poster, made during his years writing for the University of Maine’s Maine Campus newspaper. The poster has been out of print for a few years, but Gerald Winters and Son has commissioned new prints of it that should be arriving just in time for the holidays. Check its website and Facebook for more information.\n\nBangor-centric Stephen King gifts\n\nIf you want to feel the Derry pride, regardless of whether you’re from Bangor, from Maine, or are just a fan, there are some cool local gifts out there to bring out the Pennywise in you. The annual Ghosts of Bangor calendar is currently available to buy, as is a “Greetings From Derry” calendar, and Ghosts of Bangor’s Freese’s Department Store t-shirt, inspired by the “IT” movie but based on a real place. For something a little more subtle, try these handmade wooden Bangor necklaces, sold at The Rock & Art Shop in Bangor.\n\nSpecial Stephen King books\n\nThough we’ve tried to focus more on items rather than books — since books are the obvious Stephen King gifts to give — there are a few fun King publications out there out there that might be of interest to fans.\n\nBack in September, Entertainment Weekly published a collector’s edition issue all about Stephen King and the movies based on his works. It’s still available on Amazon for just 12 bucks. Also available is “Charlie the Choo Choo,” a “children’s” book written by some lady named Beryl Evans, with a storyline that just might be familiar to fans of the “Dark Tower” series. And finally, last year the University of Maine Press published “Hearts in Suspension,” a lovingly compiled exploration of King’s years at UMaine. It’s available through the UMaine website.\n\nBook an SK Tour\n\nIf you really want to splurge on that special King fan, we suggest going all out and reserving an SK Tour right here in Bangor. Ultimate King expert Stu Tinker leads fans on a tour of Bangor, showcasing all the spots that inspired King in his various books set in Derry. SK Tours is closed for about six weeks between Jan. 15 and Feb. 28, but starts booking daily tours again beginning March 1. Reservations start at $45.\n\nLive down the street from Stephen King\n\nFor a paltry couple hundred grand, you could buy the ultimate Stephen King gift — a house down the street from the man himself. Right now there are three homes up for sale on West Broadway in Bangor, the street the Kings have lived on for nearly 40 years. There’s this pale yellow beauty, priced at $675,000, and this 1892 “cottage,” also priced at $675,000. For a more “affordable” house, there’s also this 3,600-square-footer, available for $375k. Just how much of a fan are you, huh?",
  "latent_28249": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop on Tuesday in Beaufort, South Carolina (AP Photos)\n\nPresident Obama and Republican front-runner Donald Trump exchanged insults on Tuesday, with the president insisting Trump would not be elected president and then Trump insisting that the president's slam was actually a compliment.\"I continue to believe that Mr. Trump will not be president. I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job,\" Obama said during a press conference in California on Tuesday. \"It's not hosting a talk show or a reality show. It's not promotion. It's not marketing. It's hard.\"Trump was asked about the comment during a campaign event in Beaufort, South Carolina, that was set up like a fireside chat. Van Hipp Jr., a former South Carolina GOP chairman, asked the candidate questions and read aloud the president's comment -- prompting the crowd to boo.\"He has done such a lousy job as president,\" Trump said, emphasizing each word. \"You look at our budgets, you look at our spending, we can't beat ISIS, Obamacare is terrible -- we're going to terminate it, we're absolutely going to terminate it. And you look at everything, our borders are like Swiss cheese, this man has done such a bad job, he has set us back so far, and for him to say that is actually a great compliment.\"Trump then shared this message for the president: \"You're lucky I didn't run last time, when Romney ran, because you would have been a one-term president.\"",
  "latent_28265": "It would seem that we are headed down a path with the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia that pits three of the least trustworthy entities in America against each other: The President, who is under investigation; the man he fired, former FBI Director James Comey; and a divided news media that has taken sides long before all of the relevant facts are out.\n\nIt doesn’t take much to accurately label Donald Trump a liar. Whether it is Russia, electoral votes, or campaign promises, the President has given us very little in the way of truth. Trump typically favors a grandiose style reminiscent of a carnival barker: loud, braggadocios, and light on substantial facts.\n\nJames Comey is a more complex story, but he has a flair for the dramatic. The Guardian recounted a 2004 event when Comey was the acting Attorney General:\n\nIt had the air of Hollywood. On the night of 10 March 2004, James Comey, the nominee to lead the FBI for the next ten years, rushed to the hospital bedside of his terribly ill boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft. There, he eventually confronted White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, who were trying to get the pancreatitis-stricken Ashcroft to renew a still secret and illegal surveillance program on Americans’ electronic communications. Neither Ashcroft nor Comey, then acting attorney general because of Ashcroft’s condition, would reauthorize the program. When Gonzales authorized the program to go forward without a Justice Department certification, Comey threatened to resign, along with his staff and FBI Director Robert Mueller. The threats worked: President Bush blinked, and Comey won modifications to the secret surveillance program that he felt brought it into compliance with the law.\n\nHowever, Comey was the one that signed off on a legal opinion just two months later that confirmed the legality of the warrantless wiretapping program. Many questions remain about why Comey took such dramatic actions to fight against a program that he may have supported. It smelled of a publicity stunt.\n\nComey also greatly exaggerated the Department of Justice’s case against al Qaeda associate Jose Padilla. Padilla was held by the military without being charged and without access to legal protections. Comey went to the press to detail how Padilla sought to build a “dirty bomb” out of “uranium wrapped with explosives” and that it would have caused “mass death and injury.” However, experts say that taking such action with uranium would have been “the equivalent of blowing up lead.”\n\nOf course, with Comey there is also the bizarre timing and methodology of the announcement that the FBI had uncovered additional emails in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server. He announced the new findings on October 28th, just a week and a half before the 2016 election.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is that the corporate media has formed itself into two camps: those that will relish in anything if it is anti-Trump, and the decidedly right-wing media that will stand by their President, no matter how bad the allegations get.\n\nThe Washington Post was openly celebrating that they may have found damning information on the President earlier this week, while Conservative outlets were busy plugging their ears, shouting “fake news,” and pretending that there is nothing peculiar going on with Trump.\n\nBanner on @foxandfriends right now: “RUSSIA: IT DIDN’T HAPPEN” — Sarah Boxer (@Sarah_Boxer) May 16, 2017\n\nPolls show that America doesn’t really trust the media and trust in the President is purely partisan. As for Comey, he doesn’t exactly get a warm reaction from voters either. So who do we trust? If we cannot trust the President, nor do we have faith in Comey to tell the truth, and we have no faith that the media will accurately or fairly report on the matter, how will we really know what happened?\n\nThe answer about trust and uncovering the facts is simple – we will never again have unfettered access to the truth. When we have built an industry of lying politicians by continually voting them in office on both sides of the aisle, and when we continue to read, like, and share only news that fits our particular worldview, the truth becomes irrelevant. Lying directly benefits the politician and the corporate media outlet alike.\n\nTrump is likely going to screw up and clearly break the law along the way. He may already have. He may be forced from office prior to 2021, especially. But those who support Trump will simply blame it on a biased media. They will be emboldened and seek to push even more Trumpian candidates, feeling that the world is against them.\n\nOn the other side, no matter if Trump breaks the law or not, the word “impeach” is sure to be thrown around on a daily basis while the world waits for the next Trump lie. Meanwhile, the political coffers will be continually stuffed and the ad-supported media will flourish, leaving the American people enraged and blind to the truth.",
  "latent_28479": "news Several of the ABC’s flagship current affairs programs are largely ignoring the Coalition’s radical reshaping of Labor’s popular National Broadband Network project, analysis has revealed, as debate continues to swirl about the public broadcaster’s coverage of an initiative which constitutes Australia’s largest ever infrastructure project.\n\nUnder Labor’s previous NBN policy, some 93 percent of Australian premises were to have received fibre directly to the premises, with the remainder of the population to have been served by a combination of satellite and wireless broadband. However, since taking office the Coalition has drastically modified that policy, instructing NBN Co to go ahead with a model which will see 30 percent of the 93 percent served by the existing HFC cable networks owned by Telstra and Optus. A further 44 percent will receive a hybrid Fibre to the Node service (integrated with Telstra’s existing copper network), and only 26 percent will receive Fibre to the Premises.\n\nThe move has sparked extreme criticism from telecommunications industry experts as well as the general population. In January, for instance, veteran telecommunications analyst Paul Budde described the Coalition’s new “Multi-Technology Mix” approach as “a dog’s breakfast” of different technologies, which could turn out to be a “logistical nightmare” to deliver in practice. Some 272,000 Australians signed a record-breaking petition requesting the Coalition reconsider its plans.\n\nDespite the controversy, an analysis conducted by Delimiter of the NBN-related coverage of three of the ABC’s top flagship current affairs programs over the past 18 months has found that only one — Lateline — covers the issue regularly or in any detail, while others such as 7:30 and Q&A have almost completely ignored the issue in that period.\n\nThe issue came to a head in late April, when Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull appeared on the broadcaster’s flagship panel discussion program Q&A alongside opinionated commentator Van Badham, who has emerged as a critic of the Coalition’s radical reworking of Labor’s NBN project.\n\nAnalysis of the questions submitted to the show before the episode went to air and published online on the ABC’s site showed that as a consequence of the two panellists’ participation, Q&A was inundated with at least many dozens of questions regarding the NBN as a topic, in both text and video form. However, the show did not choose to air any of the NBN questions, choosing to focus on unrelated issues. Pre-show briefing materials distributed to panellists and attendees before the episode contained no mention of the NBN, and host Tony Jones actively prevented Badham from discussing the issue with Turnbull.\n\nAnalysis conducted by Delimiter over the past week has shown that Q&A’s treatment of the issue on that occasion was not an anomaly for the show.\n\nTurnbull was appointed Shadow Communications Minister in September 2010. Since that time, the Liberal MP has appeared on Q&A 12 times, or every few months. Despite the repeat appearances, on only three occasions — 28 April 2014, 10 February 2014 and 8 July 2013 and, did Q&A allow a formal question about the NBN topic to be asked by the audience. Turnbull’s appearances on Q&A while in the Communications portfolio are tabled below:\n\nOn two of those three occasions, host Tony Jones actively curtailed discussion on the NBN, allowing only very limited discussion of the topic, and only allowing Turnbull personally to respond to the issue at length, with other panellists only having very limited input.\n\nThe only occasion on which Jones has allowed extended discussion of the NBN during a show on which Turnbull was a panellist was on 8 July 2013, immediately prior to last year’s Federal Election in September, when Jones allowed a prolonged debate on the issue between Turnbull, then-Communications Minister Anthony Albanese and other figures. That extended debate lasted some 12 minutes, which represented a sizable chunk of the Q&A show.\n\nFollowing the Q&A episode in April on which Turnbull appeared, the ABC issued a statement noting that Q&A attempted to cover as much of the national debate as it could in one hour, but pointed out that not all topics could be covered. At the time, it denied it had a deal with Turnbull for the Minister to not take questions on the NBN on Q&A.\n\n“The NBN has been discussed on Q&A and answered by Malcolm Turnbull in past programs and no doubt will be discussed again in the future,” a spokesperson for the ABC said. “ABC news and current affairs programs have offered comprehensive coverage of the NBN as it has done with all issues on the national agenda.”\n\nHowever, further analysis conducted by Delimiter has demonstrated that the ABC’s flagship current affairs programs often do not cover the NBN issue at all — especially the ongoing criticism of the Coalition’s unpopular radical overhaul of the project.\n\nThe broadcaster’s most high-profile show, 7:30, has not yet covered the NBN as a specific topic in 2014, despite the wide-ranging changes which the Coalition has made to the project and despite the fact that Turnbull has personally made several major policy announcements affecting it (see here and here). The lack of coverage also comes despite the fact that the NBN remains Australia’s largest ever infrastructure project.\n\nSimilarly, 7:30 only covered the NBN as a specific topic a handful of times throughout the 2013 calendar year. The show did not cover the issue at all as a specific topic in the months of January, February, March, May, August, October and November.\n\nCoverage of the NBN topic during other months by 7:30 was typically largely limited to major announcements regarding the project, or Coalition criticism of Labor’s administration of the project. For example, 7:30 covered the Coalition’s rival NBN policy announcement in April 2013, asbestos concerns about the network’s construction in June and construction delays in July. Following the election, 7:30 broadcast three pieces on the NBN, largely reflecting information about the Coalition’s reshaping of the network.\n\nIn December, NBN Co released its Strategic Review, which included a number of options for radically reshaping the project. The release of the report was viewed with dismay by large segments of Australia’s technology sector, as its key recommendation significantly watered down Labor’s popular Fibre to the Premises NBN model, promoting instead a model involving the re-use of the HFC cable networks owned by Telstra and Optus. This model has not been implemented in this fashion overseas, and questions remain about its technical and commercial viability.\n\nHowever, 7:30 did not detail the extensive industry criticism of the proposed new model, instead broadcasting only an interview with Turnbull about the changes.\n\nThe broadcaster’s late night show Lateline has covered the issue much more extensively and in what appears to be a more balanced fashion. In 2013 the show covered the issue in most months, leaving the NBN off its roster only in January, March, November and December. In addition, Lateline went much further than 7:30 or Q&A in challenging the Coalition’s approach to the project, broadcasting interviews with Labor figures such as then-Communications Minister Stephen Conroy and Labor MP Ed Husic.\n\nIn August, immediately prior to the Federal Election, Lateline hosted the only broadcast debate between then-Communications Minister Anthony Albanese and Turnbull.\n\nHowever, there have also been questions raised about Lateline’s coverage of the issue. On 10 April this year, NBN Co announced that it had turfed at least three key executives at the company after just one week of new chief executive Bill Morrow being in his role, with long-time and respected NBN Co head of corporate and commercial Kevin Brown, chief financial officer Robin Payne and chief technology officer Gary McLaren to leave NBN Co.\n\nThat night, host Tony Jones hosted a lengthy interview with Turnbull on Lateline. Jones strongly pushed Turnbull on a range of issues associated with the NBN — including the issue of whether rival telcos such as TPG should be allowed to overbuild the NBN network and the drastically watered down speeds possible under the Coalition’s version of the project.\n\nHowever, Jones commenced the interview by asking about unrelated issues such as the release of the diaries of former NSW Premier and Foreign Minister Bob Carr, as well as proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. In addition, Jones did not ask Turnbull about the executives who had lost their roles at NBN Co.\n\nThroughout 2013 Jones held several other interviews with Turnbull on Lateline in which he pressured the Member for Wentworth on the NBN issue.\n\nHowever, it does not appear as though Jones was similarly active in interviewing figures from the other major side of politics — Labor — with co-host Emma Alberici conducting most of the interviews or debates in that period which involved Labor politicians such as Senator Stephen Conroy (Communications Minister for much of 2013), his successor Anthony Albanese and Labor MP Ed Husic, who also retains a strong interest in the NBN and technology issues.\n\nIn addition, none of the ABC’s flagship programs — 7:30, Lateline or Q&A — have been active in interviewing other stakeholders in the NBN process. It has been extremely rare over the past 18 months that such shows have interviewed figures from the corporate world such as executives from Telstra, Optus, iiNet, TPG or Vodafone, or the minor political parties such as the Greens, or networking vendors from companies such as Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent. The shows have also not regularly featured telecommunications industry analysts, who have often been critical of the Coalition’s approach to the NBN.\n\nMany figures from such organisations have strong views with respect to the National Broadband Network and have voiced their opinions in other media outlets regularly with regard to the project over the past several years, especially associated with the Coalition’s controversial proposed changes to the project.\n\nThe ABC’s approach to the issue comes as the University of Melbourne has recently released a comprehensive study of public attitudes towards Labor’s National Broadband Network project. The study found the initiative still enjoys very high levels of widespread public support from ordinary Australians, despite what the study described as an “overwhelmingly negative” approach to the project by print media such as newspapers.\n\nIn general, the only ABC journalist to have regularly and specifically covered criticisms of Labor’s NBN project over the past several years has been Nick Ross, the Editor of the broadcaster’s Technology + Games site.\n\nRoss’s articles have been very positively received by Australia’s technology sector, which retains significant concerns about the viability of the Coalition’s NBN policy. An article of significant length published by Ross in February 2013 received 438 comments, with the majority praising Ross’s work for its analysis and detail, in a media environment in which few journalists have challenged disputed claims the Coalition has made regarding the NBN.\n\nIn addition, other media outlets have started to use Ross’s work as a basis for investigating the differences between the two policies. For example, Channel 10’s The Project television show used Ross’s work extensively in sharply questioning Turnbull on his rival NBN policy.\n\nSubsequent to his publication of several such articles, however, Ross was sharply attacked by Turnbull, who accused the journalist of creating “relentless propaganda” to support Labor’s NBN project, in a stance which the then-Shadow Communications Minister described in July 2012 as “embarrassing”. Ross was also strongly attacked for the coverage by The Australian newspaper, which was sharply critical of Labor’s NBN project while Labor was in Government. Since that period, Ross has published very little analysis of the NBN project.\n\nThe ABC’s own Media Watch investigated Ross’ coverage in March 2013. At the time, it noted that it would perhaps have been “safer” for Ross to only cover the for and against claims being made about the NBN project, without analysing them. However, host Jonathan Holmes stated at the time that to many media critics, this was a “cop-out” and represented “he said, she said” journalism.\n\nHolmes found that Ross had, using his expertise and specialist knowledge of the NBN topic, had delivered analysis grounded in reporting work, using hundreds of reports and other sources; and had no political affiliations to weigh him down. In addition, he noted that mainstream media outlets such as The Australian Financial Review and The Australian newspapers had taken a broadly negative approach to the NBN; in contrast, he noted strong ABC reader support for Ross’s work.\n\nOne of the only other ABC journalists to regularly raise the issue of the NBN over the past several years has been Jake Sturmer, who from February through December 2013 was the broadcaster’s national science and technology reporter.\n\nDuring his time in the role, Sturmer published a number of articles examining issues such as doubts over whether Telstra’s copper network could meet the needs of the Coalition’s rival NBN policy. Sturmer also covered NBN Co’s Strategic Review and its conclusion that the Coalition’s election policy of delivering 25Mbps broadband to all Australians by the end of 2016 was unrealistic.\n\nHowever, it appears as though Sturmer was reassigned in January this year, as his LinkedIn profile now states he is the ABC’s national environment and science reporter. The journalist still reports for many of the same outlets — ABC News, 7:30, Lateline and the AM and PM radio shows — but his beat no longer explicitly covers technology, and Sturmer has largely ceased covering the NBN project.\n\nBadham, whose blocked questions to Turnbull first sparked debate about the ABC’s coverage of the NBN in April, wrote in early May for The Guardian that Turnbull was escaping public scrutiny of his radical changes to the NBN project.\n\n“Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull may not want to answer many questions about the National Broadband Network, but it shouldn’t stop Australians from asking them,” Badham wrote. “After all, since last September, Turnbull has reneged on pre-election NBN commitments, admitted to giving misleading statements about Labor’s costings, made chummy appointments, ignored expert economic consideration, and infuriated the near-entirety of the professional tech community. And yet, the minister has been able to dodge much deserved public excoriation.”\n\nDelimiter has attempted to contact the ABC’s media spokespeople to invite a response to the issues raised in this article.\n\nImage credit: ABC",
  "latent_28492": "David Cassidy, the teen and pre-teen idol who starred in the 1970s sitcom The Partridge Family and sold millions of records as the musical group’s lead singer, died Tuesday at age 67.\n\nCassidy, who announced earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with dementia, died surrounded by his family, a family statement released by publicist JoAnn Geffen said. No further details were immediately available, but Geffen said on Saturday that Cassidy was in a Fort Lauderdale, Fla. hospital suffering from organ failure.\n\nWATCH: David Cassidy reveals dementia diagnosis (Feb. 2017)\n\n“David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long,” the statement said.

Law fame, as sibling Laurie Partridge and Danny Bonaduce as sibling Danny Partridge.\n\nIt was an era for singing families — the Osmonds, the Jacksons.\n\nThe Partridge Family never cracked the top 10 in TV ratings, but the recordings under their name, mostly featuring Cassidy, Jones and session players, produced real-life musical hits and made Cassidy a real-life musical superstar.\n\nThe Partridges’ best known song, “I Think I Love You,” spent three weeks on top of the Billboard chart at a time when other hit singles included James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain” and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles’ “The Tears of a Clown.”\n\nThe group also reached the top 10 with “I’ll Meet You Halfway” and “Doesn’t Somebody Want to be Wanted” and Cassidy had a solo hit with “Cherish.”\n\n“In two years, David Cassidy has swept hurricane-like into the pre-pubescent lives of millions of American girls,” Rolling Stone magazine noted in 1972.\n\n“Leaving: six and a half million long-playing albums and singles; 44 television programs; David Cassidy lunch boxes; David Cassidy bubble gum; David Cassidy colouring books and David Cassidy pens; not to mention several millions of teen magazines, wall stickers, love beads, posters and photo albums.”\n\nCassidy’s appeal faded after the show went off the air, although he continued to tour, record and act over the next 40 years, his albums including “Romance” and the awkwardly titled “Didn’t You Used To Be?”\n\nHe had a hit with “I Write the Songs” before Barry Manilow’s chart-topping version and success overseas with “The Last Kiss,” featuring backing vocals from Cassidy admirer George Michael. He made occasional stage and television appearances, including an Emmy-nominated performance on Police Story.\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-‘Partridge Family’ star has dementia\n\nMeanwhile, The Partridge Family remained popular in re-runs and Cassidy, who kept his dark bangs and boyish appearance well into middle age, frequently turned up for reunions and spoke often about his early success.\n\n“So many people come up to me and talk to me about the impact it (the show) had,” he told Arsenio Hall in 1990.\n\nEven while The Partridge Family was still in primetime, Cassidy worried that he was mistaken for the wholesome character he played.\n\nHe posed naked for Rolling Stone in 1972, when he confided that he had dropped acid as a teenager and smoked pot in front of the magazine’s reporter as he watched an episode of The Partridge Family and mocked his own acting.\n\nCassidy maintained an exhausting schedule during the show’s run, filming during the week and performing live shows over the weekend, but had plenty of time to indulge himself. In the memoir Could It Be Forever, he wrote of his prolific sex life and of rejecting Dey’s advances because she lacked the “slutty aspect of a female that I always found so attractive.”\n\nCassidy would endure personal and financial troubles. He was married and divorced three times, battled alcoholism, was arrested for drunk driving and in 2015 filed for bankruptcy. Cassidy had two children, musician Beau Cassidy and actress Katie Cassidy, with whom he acknowledged having a distant relationship.\n\n“I wasn’t her father. I was her biological father but I didn’t raise her,” he told People magazine in 2017.\n\n“She has a completely different life.”\n\nCassidy himself was estranged from his father.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1950, he was the son of actors Jack Cassidy and Evelyn Ward and half-brother of entertainer Shaun Cassidy. David Cassidy’s parents split up when he was five and he would long express regret about Jack Cassidy, who soon married Shirley Jones, being mostly absent from his life. David Cassidy stayed with his mother and by the early 1960s had moved to Los Angeles.\n\nREAD MORE: David Cassidy prepares to auction Florida mansion\n\nKicked out of high school for truancy, David Cassidy dreamed of becoming an actor and had made appearances on Bonanza, Ironside and other programs before producers at ABC television asked him to audition for The Partridge Family, unaware that he could sing and intending at first to have him mime songs to someone else’s voice.\n\nCassidy, who only learned during tryouts that Jones would play his mother, worried that Keith Partridge would be a “real comedown” from his previous roles.\n\n“I mean, how much could an actor do with a line like, ‘Hi, Mom, I’m home from school,’ or ‘Please pass the milk?”‘ he wrote in his memoir. “I didn’t see how it could do much for me. After all, I wasn’t the star of it. Shirley had top billing; I was just one of the kids.”",

His sister Anya, nearly three, remained in the Kiev flat with the dead body for three more days, until the mother returned.\n\nUkrainians have expressed shock about the case on social media, and the details were given on Facebook by Mykola Kuleba, the Ukrainian presidential adviser on children's rights.\n\nAnya is in intensive care in hospital, but her condition is improving, Mr Kuleba reports.\n\nDoctors have been trying to feed her - she had reportedly fainted from hunger in the flat.

The backup captioned the photo, \"Arm-wrestled the punter for #6 and lost #itwasagoodrun6 #13years.\"\n\nAnd thus ended the No. 6 era in Whitehurst's life, a period that spanned from his college days at Clemson through his time with the Seattle Seahawks and San Diego Chargers.\n\nWho was this punter? Brett Kern, the Titans' special teams man who had claimed the number long before Whitehurst signed with the team in March.\n\nChristmas Ape of UpRoxx conjectures as to why these two men turned to strength competitions instead of going about the usual \"throw me a figure, I'll sell you the number\" routine that typically occurs in these situations.\n\nUsually what happens when a new player joins a team and wants the jersey number of an existing player, a cash transaction occurs, usually to the amount of tens of thousands of dollars. But seeing as how this is a backup quarterback we’re talking about, perhaps he can’t be as loose with his money as those other players can.\n\nNope, Whitehurst probably can't afford to shell out $20,000 for a number. Spotrac.com reports he is signed to a two-year, $4.5 million contract with Tennessee. Nothing to balk at, but he's not exactly make-it-rain rich.\n\nThus, an arm wrestling match took place—a match Whitehurst lost and will never fully live down.\n\nChin up, sir. You'll show them all when Jake Locker and Zach Mettenberger go down with hip dysplasia this year and you lead the team to a 7-9 record and flash occasional signs of life.

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 5 years old\n\nDespite popularity of solar panels, unhelpful government policies could see 3,400 solar industry jobs slashed over the coming year\n\nOne in ten Australian homes now has solar panels but takeup has levelled off and the solar industry is facing significant job losses due, in part, to unhelpful government policies, according to a new report.\n\nThe study found that falling installation costs have fuelled adoption of household solar, with 1.1m solar panel photovoltaic (PV) systems, encompassing 13% of Australian households, now installed.\n\nBut while Australia now ranks seventh in the world for solar market share, albeit a long way behind world-leading Germany, growth has tapered off, with installations in 2013 set to be 22% down on last year.\n\nThis contraction, the report warns, risks 3,400 solar industry jobs over the next 12 months. Currently, the sector employs around 18,500 people.\n\nThe report was commissioned by the REC Agents Association (RAA), which represents companies that trade in renewable energy certificates, and was undertaken by Green Energy Markets.\n\n“The level of activity in the residential solar industry may well have peaked,” the report states. “The industry is now going through a consolidation process and faces a number of challenges.\n\n“The future of the residential solar market in Australia may depend on finding new ways of refinancing the cost to customers, tax changes to make solar leasing more attractive and finding new markets, such as renters and low-income earners.”\n\nThe report identifies a number of challenges facing the solar industry, including the removal of feed-in tariffs by state governments and an upcoming review of the 20% Renewable Energy Target, which the renewables sector has blamed for creating investment uncertainty.\n\nRAA called on the government to “reaffirm its strong support” for the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, which creates a financial incentive for small solar systems. The organisation said it does, however, welcome the Coalition’s Million Solar Roofs program, which helps low-income households install solar.\n\nRic Brazzale, CEO of Green Energy Markets and president of the RAA, told Guardian Australia that the industry was going through an “adjustment phase”.\n\n“There are a few factors for this – all the states have removed feed-in tariffs and we are seeing some states, such as Queensland, reach saturation point,” he said.\n\n“We’ve also got a new government that wants to review the Renewable Energy Target, which creates additional uncertainty for solar companies.\n\n“There are issues, but we are taking a positive view. We’ve been engaging quite well with the government. I think they are more pro-solar than wind, because they can see it has been embraced by a lot of Australians and it is a significant employer in regional Australia.\n\n“Renewables will certainly have to play an increasing role in meeting the 5% emissions cut target. Solar will have an important play.”\n\nA spokesman for Greg Hunt, the environment minister, told Guardian Australia that the solar industry has a “very bright future”.\n\n“The government is committed to a million roofs solar policy,” he said. “It is part of our Cleaner Environment Plan for Australia. It supports our commitment to both reduce electricity prices for families while also meeting our climate change targets.\n\n“This will not only assist households and community groups with the cost of electricity, but provided stability for the solar industry.\n\n“The government supports local manufacturing and the solar industry and will ensure the industry has a stable policy framework for the future.”",
  "latent_29588": "Effect of music-movement synchrony on exercise oxygen consumption. PubMed Bacon, C J; Myers, T R; Karageorghis, C I 2012-08-01 Past research indicates that endurance is improved when exercise movements are synchronised with a musical beat, however it is unclear whether such benefits are associated with reduced metabolic cost. We compared oxygen consumption (.VO2) and related physiological effects of exercise conducted synchronously and asynchronously with music. Three music tracks, each recorded at three different tempi (123, 130, and 137 beats.min-1), accompanied cycle ergometry at 65 pedal revolutions.min-1. Thus three randomly-assigned experimental conditions were administered: slow tempo asynchronous, synchronous, and fast tempo asynchronous. Exercise response of .VO2, HR, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), to each condition was monitored in 10 untrained male participants aged 21.7Â±0.8 years (meanÂ±SD) who cycled for 12 min at 70% maximal heart rate (HR). Mean .VO2 differed among conditions (P=0.008), being lower in the synchronous (1.80Â±0.22 L.min-1) compared to the slow tempo asynchronous condition (1.94Â±0.21 L.min-1; P<0.05). There was no difference in HR or RPE among conditions, although HR showed a similar trend to .VO2. The present results indicate that exercise is more efficient when performed synchronously with music than when musical tempo is slightly slower than the rate of cyclical movement.\n\nEffect of long-term exercise training on blood viscosity during endurance exercise at an anaerobic threshold intensity. PubMed Adachi, H; Sakurai, S; Tanehata, M; Oshima, S; Taniguchi, K 2000-11-01 Blood viscosity (etaB) is low in athletes, but the effect of exercise training on etaB during endurance exercise at an anaerobic threshold (AT) intensity in non-athletes is not well known, although it is known that exercise training sometimes induces the hyperviscosity syndrome. Fourteen subjects were recruited and divided into 2 groups: those who trained at an AT intensity for 30 min/day, 3 times weekly for 1 year (Group T, n=8), and sedentary subjects (Group C, n=6). The test protocol consisted of a single 30-min treadmill exercise at each individual's AT intensity, which was determined in advance. The etaB, plasma viscosity (etaP), and hematocrit were measured just before and at the end of the treadmill exercise. The subjects were not allowed to drink any water before exercise. In the Group C subjects, the hematocrit and etaP increased significantly and the etaB tended to increase. However, in the Group T subjects, the hematocrit and etaP did not increase and the etaB decreased significantly. These data indicate that long-term exercise training attenuates the increase in blood viscosity during exercise.\n\nPlyometric vs. isometric training influences on tendon properties and muscle output. PubMed Burgess, Katherine E; Connick, Mark J; Graham-Smith, Philip; Pearson, Stephen J 2007-08-01 The purpose of this study was to concurrently determine the effect that plyometric and isometric training has on tendon stiffness (K) and muscle output characteristics to compare any subsequent changes. Thirteen men trained the lower limbs either plyometrically or isometrically 2-3 times a week for a 6-week period. Medial gastrocnemius tendon stiffness was measured in vivo using ultrasonography during ramped isometric contractions before and after training. Mechanical output variables were measured using a force plate during concentric and isometric efforts. Significant (p < 0.05) training-induced increases in tendon K were seen for the plyometric (29.4%; 49.0 +/- 10.8 to 63.4 +/- 9.2 N x mm(-1)) and isometric groups (61.6%; 43.9 +/- 2.5 to 71.0 +/- 7.4 N x mm(-1)). Statistically similar increases in rate of force development and jump height were also seen for both training groups, with increases of 18.9 and 58.6% for the plyometric group and 16.7 and 64.3% for the isometric group, respectively. Jump height was found to be significantly correlated with tendon stiffness, such that stiffness could explain 21% of the variance in jump height. Plyometric training has been shown to place large stresses on the body, which can lead to a potential for injury, whereas explosive isometric training has been shown here to provide similar benefits to that of plyometric training with respect to the measured variables, but with reduced impact forces, and would therefore provide a useful adjunct for athletic training programs within a 6-week time frame.\n\nAge-Related Variability in Tongue Pressure Patterns for Maximum Isometric and Saliva Swallowing Tasks PubMed Central Peladeau-Pigeon, Melanie 2017-01-01 Purpose The ability to generate tongue pressure plays a major role in bolus transport in swallowing. In studies of motor control, stability or variability of movement is a feature that changes with age, disease, task complexity, and perturbation. In this study, we explored whether age and tongue strength influence the stability of the tongue pressure generation pattern during isometric and swallowing tasks in healthy volunteers. Method Tongue pressure data, collected using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument, were analyzed from 84 participants in sex-balanced and decade age-group strata. Tasks included maximum anterior and posterior isometric pressures and regular-effort saliva swallows. The cyclic spatiotemporal index (cSTI) was used to capture stability (vs. variability) in patterns of pressure generation. Mixed-model repeated measures analyses of covariance were performed separately for each task (anterior and posterior isometric pressures, saliva swallows) with between-participant factors of age group and sex, a within-participant factor of task repetition, and a continuous covariate of tongue strength. Results Neither age group nor sex effects were found. There was no significant relationship between tongue strength and the cSTI on the anterior isometric tongue pressure task (r = â.11). For the posterior isometric tongue pressure task, a significant negative correlation (r = â.395) was found between tongue strength and the cSTI. The opposite pattern of a significant positive correlation (r = .29) between tongue strength and the cSTI was seen for the saliva swallow task. Conclusions Tongue pressure generation patterns appear highly stable across repeated maximum isometric and saliva swallow tasks, despite advancing age. Greater pattern variability is seen with weaker posterior isometric pressures. Overall, saliva swallows had the lowest pressure amplitudes and highest pressure pattern variability as measured by the cSTI. PMID:29114767\n\nThe effects of stress on physical activity and exercise. PubMed Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew A; Sinha, Rajita 2014-01-01 Psychological stress and physical activity (PA) are believed to be reciprocally related; however, most research examining the relationship between these constructs is devoted to the study of exercise and/or PA as an instrument to mitigate distress. The aim of this paper was to review the literature investigating the influence of stress on indicators of PA and exercise. A systematic search of Web of Science, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus was employed to find all relevant studies focusing on human participants. Search terms included \"stress\", \"exercise\", and \"physical activity\". A rating scale (0-9) modified for this study was utilized to assess the quality of all studies with multiple time points. The literature search found 168 studies that examined the influence of stress on PA. Studies varied widely in their theoretical orientation and included perceived stress, distress, life events, job strain, role strain, and work-family conflict but not lifetime cumulative adversity. To more clearly address the question, prospective studies (n = 55) were considered for further review, the majority of which indicated that psychological stress predicts less PA (behavioral inhibition) and/or exercise or more sedentary behavior (76.4 %). Both objective (i.e., life events) and subjective (i.e., distress) measures of stress related to reduced PA. Prospective studies investigating the effects of objective markers of stress nearly all agreed (six of seven studies) that stress has a negative effect on PA. This was true for research examining (a) PA at periods of objectively varying levels of stress (i.e., final examinations vs. a control time point) and (b) chronically stressed populations (e.g., caregivers, parents of children with a cancer diagnosis) that were less likely to be active than controls over time. Studies examining older adults (>50 years), cohorts with both men and women, and larger sample sizes (n > 100) were more likely to show an inverse association. 85.7 % of higher\n\nSex differences in the effect of fish-oil supplementation on the adaptive response to resistance exercise training in older people: a randomized controlled trial. PubMed Da Boit, Mariasole; Sibson, Rachael; Sivasubramaniam, Selvaraj; Meakin, Judith R; Greig, Carolyn A; Aspden, Richard M; Thies, Frank; Jeromson, Stewart; Hamilton, D Lee; Speakman, John R; Hambly, Catherine; Mangoni, Arduino A; Preston, Thomas; Gray, Stuart R 2017-01-01 Resistance exercise increases muscle mass and function in older adults, but responses are attenuated compared with younger people. Data suggest that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may enhance adaptations to resistance exercise in older women. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been investigated in men. We sought to determine the effects of long-chain n-3 PUFA supplementation on resistance exercise training-induced increases in muscle mass and function and whether these effects differ between older men and women. Fifty men and women [men: n = 27, mean Â± SD age: 70.6 Â± 4.5 y, mean Â± SD body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2 ): 25.6 Â± 4.2; women: n = 23, mean Â± SD age: 70.7 Â± 3.3 y, mean Â± SD BMI: 25.3 Â± 4.7] were randomly assigned to either long-chain n-3 PUFA (n = 23; 3 g fish oil/d) or placebo (n = 27; 3 g safflower oil/d) and participated in lower-limb resistance exercise training twice weekly for 18 wk. Muscle size, strength, and quality (strength per unit muscle area), functional abilities, and circulating metabolic and inflammatory markers were measured before and after the intervention. Maximal isometric torque increased after exercise training to a greater (P < 0.05) extent in the long-chain n-3 PUFA group than in the placebo group in women, with no differences (P > 0.05) between groups in men. In both sexes, the effect of exercise training on maximal isokinetic torque at 30, 90, and 240Â° s -1 , 4-m walk time, chair-rise time, muscle anatomic cross-sectional area, and muscle fat did not differ (P > 0.05) between groups. There was a greater (P < 0.05) increase in muscle quality in women after exercise training in the long-chain n-3 PUFA group than in the placebo group, with no such differences in men (P > 0.05). Long-chain n-3 PUFAs resulted in a greater decrease (P < 0.05) than the placebo in plasma triglyceride concentrations in both sexes, with no differences (P > 0.05) in glucose, insulin, or inflammatory markers.

Materials and methods A quasi-experimental longitudinal study was carried out in two comparable nursing homes. Ten participants (aged 82.5Â±6.3 and comprising 6 women) meeting the inclusion criteria took part in the 1-month intervention in one nursing home, whereas 11 participants (aged 89.9Â±3.1 with 8 women) were assigned to the control group in the other nursing home. The giant exercising board game required participants to per-form strength, flexibility, balance and endurance activities. The assistance provided by an exercising specialist decreased gradually during the intervention in an autonomy-oriented approach based on the self-determination theory. The following were assessed at baseline, after the intervention and after a follow-up period of 3 months: PA (steps/day and energy expenditure/day with ActiGraph), cognitive status (mini mental state examination), quality of life (EuroQol 5-dimensions), motivation for PA (Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2), gait and balance (Tinetti and Short Physical Performance Battery), functional mobility (timed up and go), and the muscular isometric strength of the lower limb muscles. Results and conclusion In the intervention group, PA increased from 2,921 steps/day at baseline to 3,358 steps/day after the intervention (+14.9%, P=0.04) and 4,083 steps/day (+39.8%, P=0.03) after 3 months. Energy expenditure/day also increased after the intervention (+110 kcal/day, +6.3%, P=0.01) and after 3 months (+219 kcal/day, +12.3%, P=0.02). Quality of life (P<0.05), balance and gait (P<0.05), and strength of the ankle (P<0.05) were also improved after 3 months. Such improvements were not observed in the control group.

PubMed An, Sang Min; Park, Jong Suk; Kim, Sang Ho 2014-03-01 The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of exercise capacity, heart rate recovery and heart rate variability after high-intensity exercise on caffeine concentration of energy drink. The volunteers for this study were 15 male university student. 15 subjects were taken basic physical examinations such as height, weight and BMI before the experiment. Primary tests were examined of VO2max per weight of each subjects by graded exercise test using Bruce protocol. Each of five subject was divided 3 groups (CON, ECGâ , ECGâ ¡) by matched method based on weight and VO2max per weight what gained of primary test for minimize the differences of exercise capacity and ingestion of each groups. For the secondary tests, the groups of subjects were taken their materials before and after exercise as a blind test. After the ingestion, subjects were experimented on exercise test of VO2max 80% by treadmill until the all-out. Heart rate was measured by 1minute interval, and respiratory variables were analyzed VO2, VE, VT, RR and so on by automatic respiratory analyzer. And exercise exhaustion time was determined by stopwatch. Moreover, HRV was measured after exercise and recovery 3 min. Among the intake groups, ECGâ ¡ was showed the longest of exercise exhaustion time more than CON group (p = .05). Result of heart rate during exercise according to intake groups, there was significant differences of each time (p < .001), however, not significant differences of each groups and group verse time (p > .05). Result of RPE during exercise according to intake groups, there was significant differences of each time (p < .001), however, not significant differences of each groups and group verse time (p > .05). In conclusion, EDGâ ¡ showed the significant increase of exercise exhaustion time more than CON group (p=.05) and not significant differences in HR, RPE, RER, HRV, HRR, blood pressure (p > .05). Therefore, 2.5 mg/kg(-1) ingestion of energy drink might be positive effect\n\nPsychophysiological effects of audiovisual stimuli during cycle exercise. PubMed Barreto-Silva, VinÃ­cius; Bigliassi, Marcelo; Chierotti, Priscila; Altimari, Leandro R 2018-05-01 Immersive environments induced by audiovisual stimuli are hypothesised to facilitate the control of movements and ameliorate fatigue-related symptoms during exercise. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of pleasant and unpleasant audiovisual stimuli on perceptual and psychophysiological responses during moderate-intensity exercises performed on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Twenty young adults were administered three experimental conditions in a randomised and counterbalanced order: unpleasant stimulus (US; e.g. images depicting laboured breathing); pleasant stimulus (PS; e.g. images depicting pleasant emotions); and neutral stimulus (NS; e.g. neutral facial expressions). The exercise had 10 min of duration (2 min of warm-upâ+â6 min of exerciseâ+â2 min of warm-down). During all conditions, the rate of perceived exertion and heart rate variability were monitored to further understanding of the moderating influence of audiovisual stimuli on perceptual and psychophysiological responses, respectively. The results of the present study indicate that PS ameliorated fatigue-related symptoms and reduced the physiological stress imposed by the exercise bout. Conversely, US increased the global activity of the autonomic nervous system and increased exertional responses to a greater degree when compared to PS. Accordingly, audiovisual stimuli appear to induce a psychophysiological response in which individuals visualise themselves within the story presented in the video. In such instances, individuals appear to copy the behaviour observed in the videos as if the situation was real. This mirroring mechanism has the potential to up-/down-regulate the cardiac work as if in fact the exercise intensities were different in each condition.\n\nEffect of resistance training on muscle use during exercise NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Ploutz, Lori L.; Tesch, Per A.; Biro, Ronald L.; Dudley, Gary A. 1994-01-01 This study examined the effect of resistance training on exercise-induced contrast shift in magnetic resonance (MR) images. It was hypothesized that a given load could be lifted after training with less muscle showing contrast shift, thereby suggesting less muscle was used to perform the exercise. Nine males trained the left quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle 2 days/wk for 9 wk using 3-6 sets of 12 knee extensions each day. The right QF served as a control. Exercise-induced contrast shifts in MR images evoked by each of three bouts of exercise (5 sets of 10 knee extensions with a load equal to 50, 75, and 100% of the maximum pretraining load that could be lifted for 5 sets of 10 repetitions) were quantified pre- and posttraining. MR image contrast shift was quantified by determining QF cross-sectional area (CSA) showing increased spin-spin relaxation time. One repetition maximum increased 14% in the left trained QF and 7% in the right untrained QF. Left QF CSA increased 5%, with no change in right QSF CSA. Left QF CSA showing contrast shift was less after each bout of the exercise test posttraining. This was also true, to a lesser extent, for the right QF at the higher two loads. The results suggest that short-term resistance training reduces MR image contrast shift evoked by a given effort, thereby reflecting the use of less muscle to lift the load. Because this response was evident in both trained and contralateral untrained muscle, neural factors are suggested to be responsible. The consequence of this adaptation could be to increase 'stress' per unit area of active muscle during the course of training and thereby evoke hypertrophy.\n\nEffects of physical exercise programme on happiness among older people. PubMed Khazaee-Pool, M; Sadeghi, R; Majlessi, F; Rahimi Foroushani, A 2015-02-01 This randomized-controlled trial investigated the effect of physical exercise programme (PEP) on happiness among older adults in Nowshahr, Iran. Results of this study on 120 male and female volunteers showed that an 8-week group physical exercise programme was significantly effective in older adults' happiness. Findings showed that physical exercise programme is so beneficial for increasing older adults' happiness. Physical activity is associated with well-being and happiness. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an 8-week long physical exercise programme (PEP) on happiness among older adults in Nowshahr, Iran. This was a randomized control trial study. The participants consisted of a group of 120 male and female volunteers (mean Â± SD age: 71 Â± 5.86 years) in a convenience sampling among older adults in public parks in Nowshahr, Iran. We randomly allocated them into experimental (n = 60) and control (n = 60) groups. A validated instrument was used to measure well-being and happiness [Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI)]. Respondents were asked to complete the OHI before and 2 months after implementing PEP. The 8-week PEP was implemented with the intervention group. The statistical analysis of the data was conducted using paired t-test, Fisher's exact test and Ï(2). Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in the happiness mean score between the case and control groups; however, after implementing PEP, happiness significantly improved among the experimental group (P = 0.001) and did not improve within the control group (P = 0.79). It can be concluded that PEP had positive effects on happiness among older adults. Planning and implementing of physical activity is so important for older happiness.

PubMed Youssef, Enas Fawzy; Shanb, Alsayed Abd Elhameed 2016-11-01 Aging is associated with a progressive decline in physical capabilities and a disturbance of both postural control and daily living activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supervised versus home exercise programs on muscle strength, balance and functional activities in older participants. Forty older participants were equally assigned to a supervised exercise program (group-I) or a home exercise program (group-II). Each participant performed the exercise program for 35-45 minutes, two times per week for four months. Balance indices and isometric muscle strength were measured with the Biodex Balance System and Hand-Held Dynamometer. Functional activities were evaluated by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed get-up-and-go test (TUG). The mean values of the Biodex balance indices and the BBS improved significantly after both the supervised and home exercise programs ( P < 0.05). However, the mean values of the TUG and muscle strength at the ankle, knee and hip improved significantly only after the supervised program. A comparison between the supervised and home exercise programs revealed there were only significant differences in the BBS, TUG and muscle strength. Both the supervised and home exercise training programs significantly increased balance performance. The supervised program was superior to the home program in restoring functional activities and isometric muscle strength in older participants.\n\nThe Effects of Aerobic Exercise and Gaming on Cognitive Performance. PubMed Douris, Peter C; Handrakis, John P; Apergis, Demitra; Mangus, Robert B; Patel, Rima; Limtao, Jessica; Platonova, Svetlana; Gregorio, Aladino; Luty, Elliot 2018-03-01 The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of video gaming, aerobic exercise (biking), and the combination of these two activities on the domains of cognitive performance: selective attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. The study was a randomized clinical trial with 40 subjects (mean age 23.7 Â± 1.8 years) randomized to one of four thirty-minute conditions: video gaming, biking, simultaneous gaming and biking, and a control condition. Cognitive performance was measured pre and post condition using the Stroop test and Trails B test. A mixed design was utilized. While video gaming, biking, simultaneous gaming and biking conditions improved selective attention and processing speed (p < 0.05), only the bike condition improved the highest order of cognitive performance, executive function (p < 0.01). There were no changes in cognitive performance for the control condition. Previous studies have shown that if tasks approach the limits of attentional capacity there is an increase in the overall chance for errors, known as the dual-task deficit. Simultaneous biking and gaming may have surpassed attentional capacity limits, ultimately increasing errors during the executive function tests of our cognitive performance battery. The results suggest that the fatiguing effects of a combined physically and mentally challenging task that extends after the exercise cessation may overcome the eventual beneficial cognitive effects derived from the physical exercise.\n\nImmediate Effects of Different Trunk Exercise Programs on Jump Performance. PubMed Imai, A; Kaneoka, K; Okubo, Y; Shiraki, H 2016-03-01 The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate effects of trunk stabilization exercise (SE) and conventional trunk exercise (CE) programs on jump performance. 13 adolescent male soccer players performed 2 kinds of jump testing before and immediate after 3 experimental conditions: SE, CE, and non-exercise (NE). The SE program consisted of the elbow-toe, hand-knee, and back bridge, and the CE program consisted of the sit-up, sit-up with trunk rotation and back extension. Testing of a countermovement jump (CMJ) and rebound jump (RJ) were performed to assess jump performance. Jump height of the CMJ and RJ-index, contact time, and jump height of the RJ were analyzed. The RJ index was improved significantly only after SE (p=0.017). However, contact time and jump height did not improve significantly in the SE condition. Moreover, no significant interaction or main effects of time or group were observed in the CMJ. Consequently, this study showed the different immediate effect on the RJ between the SE and CE, and suggested the possibility that the SE used in this study is useful as a warm-up program to improve the explosive movements.

PubMed Ikeda, Satoshi; Ohwatashi, Akihiko; Harada, Katsuhiro; Kamikawa, Yurie; Yoshida, Akira 2013-01-01 The use of novel rehabilitative approaches for effecting functional recovery following stroke is controversial. Effects of different but effective rehabilitative interventions in the hemiplegic patient are not clear. We studied the effects of different rehabilitative approaches on functional recovery in the rat photochecmical cerebral infarction model. Twenty-four male Wistar rats aged 8Â weeks were used. The cranial bone was exposed under deep anesthesia. Rose bengal (20Â mg/kg) was injected intravenously, and the sensorimotor area of the cerebral cortex was irradiated transcranially for 20Â min with a light beam of 533-nm wavelength. Animals were divided into 3 groups. In the simple-exercise group, treadmill exercise was performed for 20Â min every day. In the expected for acquisition movement-training group, beam-walking exercise was done for 20Â min daily. The control group was left to recover without additional intervention. Hindlimb function was evaluated with the beam-walking test. Following cerebral infarction, dysfunction of the contralateral extremities was observed. Functional recovery was observed earlier in the expected for acquisition training group than in the other groups. Although rats in the treadmill group recovered more quickly than controls, the beam-walking group had the shortest overall recovery time. Exercise facilitated functional recovery in the rat hemiplegic model, and expected for acquisition exercise was more effective than simple exercise. These findings are considered to have important implications for the future development of clinical rehabilitation programs.\n\nExercise Effects on Fitness and Bone Mineral Density in Early Postmenopausal Women: 1-Year EFOPS Results.

A control group (N = 12) performed simple isometric contractions of the wrist flexors. An experimental group (N = 12) performed complex proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) contractions consisting of maximal isometric wrist extension immediately reversing force direction to wrist flexion within a single trial. Ten contractions were completed on three consecutive days with a retention and transfer test 2âweeks later. For the retention test, the groups performed their assigned contraction pattern followed by a transfer test that consisted of the other contraction pattern for a crossâover design. Both groups exhibited comparable increases in strength (20.2%, P < 0.01) and reductions in mean torque variability (26.2%, P < 0.01), which were retained and transferred. There was a decrease in the coactivation ratio (antagonist/agonist muscle activity) for both groups, which was retained and transferred (35.2%, P < 0.01). The experimental group exhibited a linear decrease in variability of the torqueâ and sEMGâtime curves, indicating transfer to the simple contraction pattern (P < 0.01). The control group underwent a decrease in variability of the torqueâ and sEMGâtime curves from the first day of training to retention, but participants returned to baseline levels during the transfer condition (P < 0.01). However, the difference between torque RMS error versus the variability in torqueâ and sEMGâtime curves suggests the demands of the complex task were transferred, but could not be achieved in a reproducible way.

Here are the details on some words and phrases that are regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. Keep in mind that all whole eggs are considered to be all-natural, hormone-free, gluten-free, carbohydrate-free, trans fat-free, a good source of Vitamin D and a good source of protein. You may see these words on the carton, but they do not indicate better quality than other eggs.\n\nAlso remember that many eggs sold through at farms and farm markets are in fact organic, but they are not labeled as such when the farm’s egg production is too small to require certification. In any case, these eggs are more likely to have deeply golden, flavorful yolks and sturdy whites that stand up to poaching.\n\nFREE RANGE The birds are not caged, have open space and can easy access the outdoors, where they are able to fly to nests and perches and to forage for food. (Farmers are allowed to restrict their activities according to weather, environmental requirements and local ordinances.)\n\nCAGE FREE/FREE ROAMING The birds are not caged, but they may be crowded, restricted to indoor spaces and floors, and fed exclusively on chicken feed.\n\nCERTIFIED ORGANIC Subject to U.S.D.A. certification, organic eggs must live under cage free/free roaming conditions (they are not free range, necessarily, but they can be).

  "latent_29735": "WASHINGTON — Donald Trump, who wrote a book about his preternatural ability to get deals done, lost in his highest-stakes negotiation yet. Trump failed to get House Republicans behind a badly battered health care bill backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, and the bill was pulled at the last minute on Friday afternoon at the president's request.\n\nTrump, who barnstormed the country blasting leaders who he said had damaged the United States and promising that he would win so much that Americans would get tired of it, is decidedly on a losing streak, facing fresh questions over when and where he will find a signature victory for his young but stumbling administration.\n\nThe major health care defeat follows an injunction against a travel ban from Muslim-majority countries that itself had to be rewritten because the original executive order faced such steep legal challenges. Both of those setbacks came amid the cloud of investigations and allegations into ties between Trump's campaign and Russian officials that led to the resignation of his national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nTrump isn't even winning in polls, which he used to frequently cite during the campaign. According to a new Quinnipiac national poll released this week, his approval rating is at 37% just two months into his presidency, when presidents have historically had high approval ratings.\n\nHis press secretary, Sean Spicer, sought to deflect blame from the president, saying three times that he \"left it all on the field\" in his calls and cajoling of Republican lawmakers but that \"at the end of the day we can’t force somebody to vote.\"\n\nStill, Trump allies realize the blowup on health care is damaging to Trump and the prospects for passing his agenda.\n\n\"This is certainly an early setback,\" said early Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, who remains close to administration officials, noting that it's \"bad\" for his major first agenda item to fail. \"They'll say Trump couldn't close the deal. I'm sure for him he knows those headlines will come.\"\n\nBut Nunberg added that it's overblown to say it harms Trump's reputation.\n\n\"He’s sitting in the Oval Office,\" he said. \"He closed that deal.\"\n\nRep. Chris Collins, a close Trump ally in the House, said he didn't want to blame the president, Ryan, or House leadership, but he went on to call the failure a \"big black eye\" for Republicans and said it \"jeopardizes Trump's agenda for the next two years.\"\n\nJeffrey Lord, a public Trump booster on CNN, argued Thursday that Trump reminded him of Lyndon B. Johnson, comparing the backroom health care negotiations to the Johnson tapes of the former president's phone calls with lawmakers released years after he died. But Friday, as the health care bill died without a vote, Lord said Trump would rise again but pointed fingers at Ryan's failures.\n\n\"My view is he’s a long-term ball player,\" Lord said. \"When you look at his career, when he gets smacked down, he gets up. It doesn’t necessarily need to be next week, or the week after that. My guess is that it will be at some point in the next four years.\"\n\nAs Trump's deal-making failed, he pivoted to another longtime skill: calling reporters to influence coverage of the very public Republican health care meltdown.\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, \"I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,\" but figures within the administration firmly put the blame on the Ryan rollout of the health care bill.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of chief strategist Steve Bannon's thinking said he stayed away from the crafting of the health care bill once he saw the direction it was going — which he did not like — and got involved toward the end to salvage passing the bill, advocating along with Vice President Pence for block grants to be added against Ryan's wishes. The two sources indicated Bannon blames Ryan for the bill's failure.\n\n\"I don’t think this hurts Steve internally, but the people it's exposed are Reince and Gary Cohn,\" one of the sources said. \"If anything, Steve was working to try to get the bill passed with the Freedom Caucus.\"\n\nBesides Ryan, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, whose strengths were supposed to include his relationships on the Hill, could be in danger after the high-profile defeat.\n\n\"I would assume Reince is currently target No. 1 after this,\" said the source. \"This is one of Reince’s big portfolios; he worked with Ryan and tried to do it Ryan’s way.\"\n\n\"This doesn't seem to be at all a priority for Bannon,\" said a source involved in negotiations with the White House. \"He cares more about the border adjustment tax proposal, immigration and those type of issues.\"\n\nFor his part, Ryan said at a press conference that going from being the opposition party to governing comes with growing pains and \"we're feeling those growing pains today.\"\n\nBut Lord said Ryan and the House Republican leadership's actions were \"exasperating\" after seven years of opposing Obamacare.\n\n\"It does not serve the president well and it only damages the speaker,\" Lord said. \"What they should have been doing is getting these people in a room over time. Then the day after inauguration they should have appeared together on the Capitol steps, and they did none of that, so this is inevitable.\"\n\nCalling health care the \"toughest, thorniest political and policy issue that we currently have, Michigan GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga said Trump likely \"learned through this process that politics is different than business... There are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same.\"\n\n\"We're all independent contractors, right?\" he continued. \"And we have some 700,000 people that hire us and every two years do a job review. ... That's the difference that he's probably experiencing right now. There's no ability to sit someone down and say you're fired. It is up to our constituents.\"\n\nBut Arizona Rep. David Schweikert praised Trump for his willingness to work with everyone. \"He met with Tuesday [Group], he met with Freedom [Caucus], he met with 'not aligned,' he met with rural and urban,\" he said.\n\nMany Republicans were privately irked by how the rollout was handled. The repeated assertion by Ryan that he was “working hand in glove” with the White House on this effort seemed belied by the fact that the bill was rolled out in the House, and Trump’s initial comment on the bill was tepid at best.\n\nBut in the past week, Capitol Hill leaders have increasingly put the onus on Trump. The president came to Capitol Hill to speak to House Republicans Tuesday morning and summoned various groups of members to the White House as the clock ticked down.\n\n“President Trump was here to do what he does best, and that is to close the deal,” Ryan told reporters after the meeting. On Wednesday, as he arrived at a meeting at the White House with Republican holdouts on the bill, Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry told reporters that he was “bringing them to the closer.”\n\nBy Thursday morning, House Republicans were already talking about the fate of the bill as largely out of their hands.\n\nA Republican consultant who speaks with administration officials said victories will continue to elude Trump because he doesn't understand that contrary to how he ran his campaign, he needs to make friends and evolve.\n\n\"He’s just trying to bully his way,\" the source said. \"My fear is he’s going to learn this later rather than sooner. He will eventually have a 'come to Jesus' moment, maybe when they take his phone away.”\n\nSome votes should have been easier for Trump to get, the source added, criticizing his lobbying of the Freedom Caucus \"at the last minute\" and the administration failing to give House members cover by losing the war on the airwaves to the Koch brothers and other establishment conservative groups over the health care bill.\n\nStill, Nunberg maintained that Trump was \"smart\" to end the failing health care process today.\n\n\"If anything it shows that sometimes the best deals are the ones you don’t make,\" Nunberg said, riffing on a line Trump tweeted in 2013 about business investments. \"What was going to happen was there would be another week of negotiations, that would hold up his agenda items for another week, and more public airing of private grievances. He’s cutting his losses and moving on.\"\n\nIn his remarks after the bill was pulled, Trump was already looking to return to health care when the terrain is more favorable in the future. He argued that once Democrats see Obamacare \"exploding,\" they will work with him to make a \"beautiful deal.\"\n\nBut for Trump, who wrote in The Art of the Deal that \"more than anything else, I think deal-making is an ability you’re born with, it’s in the genes,\" his series of losses point to another more ominous part of his book for Republicans.\n\n“You can’t con people, at least not for long,\" Trump wrote. \"You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don’t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.”",

Credit:AFP According to that document (as translated by Radio Free Europe), Moscow is supporting the separatists fighting in Eastern Ukraine with arms and troops \"to create an advantageous negotiating position with Western countries\". The Kremlin can then agree to help end hostilities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions imposed when Russian annexed Crimea last year. Whether intentional or not, the strategy is working.\n\nBefore the meeting in Antalya, Mr Kerry was in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi for marathon talks with Mr Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Afterwards Mr Kerry called it a \"critical moment\". Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this week. Credit:Getty Images \"Sanctions will remain in place (against Russia) in an effort to secure the peace that everybody needs in Ukraine,\" he said. \"If and when (the ceasefire agreements are) fully implemented, it is clear that the United States and European sanctions can begin to be rolled back.\" Not everyone was impressed. Pro-Russian separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic sit on a self-propelled gun in Donetsk last weekend. Credit:AFP\n\n\"Kerry is so very nice to Putin\", was the Wall Street's Journal's sarcastic headline on its subsequent op-ed. \"Mr Kerry appears to have given up even asking that Russia exit from eastern Ukraine, much less reverse last year's illegal seizure and annexation of Crimea. US Secretary of State John Kerry shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Tuesday. Credit:AP \"For Mr Putin, the lesson is that he can grab what he wants, wait out the faux outrage and sanctions, and then consolidate his gains.\" Others were more generous in their interpretation. Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs, said both Russia and the US were clearly aware that a \"situation where two large nuclear superpowers barely have working channels of communication for over a year is quite dangerous.\"\n\nHe did not expect sanctions to lift any time soon – for practical and political reasons. He was one of many observers who saw the meeting simply as a change in tone, rather than policy. But contrast with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who flew to Moscow last Sunday, and while there called the annexation of Crimea a \"criminal and illegal act\". There are worrying parallels between Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Russia again denies military involvement (in the face of persuasive evidence as in the Nemtsov report). But such denials count for very little, if Crimea is any precedent. Earlier this year, in the long, often absurdly propagandic documentary Crimea: The Way Home, Mr Putin unashamedly confessed that the deposing of Russia-friendly Ukraine president Yankovych \"forced us to begin working on returning Crimea to Russia\". Mr Putin said: \"I gave (subordinates) some instructions about what needed to be done and how.\" This week Ukrainian officials claimed to have found ballot papers for a new referendum in separatist's regions, with the box ticked to become part of Russia. Whether genuine or clumsy propaganda, it revealed the country's real fears.\n\nHowever Lukasz Kulesa, research director at the European Leadership network, doesn't think Ukraine's 'Donbas' is Crimea Mark II. \"There was an attempt to present eastern Ukraine as part of the new Russia, 'Novorossiya'… but it didn't really work,\" Mr Kulesa said. \"This project basically disappeared, the Russian leaders and experts stopped talking about Novorossiya. \"Right now the Russian game is not to have Donetsk and Luhansk going the same way as Crimea, but keeping it inside Ukraine as kind of a wound that would poison the whole Ukrainian organism. \"I don't see what exactly they could gain from going the independence route, that would basically guarantee more sanctions, and an even more miserable state for the Russian economy.\" That said, Russia is keeping its options open.\n\n\"They threaten with another referendum, they threaten with another military offensive, but they are expecting to stabilise the situation, turn it into a frozen conflict or if something goes wrong blame it on the Kiev side.\" Mr Kulesa doesn't think Crimea will be written off the diplomatic books. He predicts the international community will still refuse to recognise it as part of the Russian federation, which would have practical consequences for trade, investment, tourism, air and maritime traffic. But he expects that, if Russia plays ball in eastern Ukraine, \"there would be an attempt to divide the sanctions currently in place between those connected to the Crimea takeover and keep them in place, basically indefinitely, and the others … which could be scaled down.\" Even if this isn't Mr Putin's plan, it appears a scenario he wouldn't be unhappy with.",
  "latent_30071": "From the Tuesday edition of the Morning Jolt:\n\nPresident Obama turned in a strikingly tone-deaf performance at Monday’s pep rally for Obamacare, even by his standards. The White House spin preceding the event promised a little bit of mea culpa, maybe even a flash of anger at the folks who had primary responsibility for ensuring the Obamacare exchange web sites functioned as promised. (We all know that buck stops long before it arrives at the Oval Office.)\n\nThe Lesson of Monday: Obama Doesn’t Know What to Do Yet, So He’s Spinning\n\nUnfortunately for those Americans who are really interested in signing up on the exchange sites, he glossed over the depth and breadth of the current troubles, giving a speech that sounded more like a State of the Union address with small-business examples and reading letters written to the White House.\n\nHoward Kurtz:\n\nObama’s speech yesterday was not the mea culpa some had predicted. He vowed to fix what he called “kinks” in the system, but generally delivered an upbeat defense of the program.\n\nAs liberal Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein tweeted in mid-address, “So far, this seems weirdly similar to the speech Obama would’ve given if the exchanges were working fine.”\n\nBut they’re not working fine, and White House reporters pressed Jay Carney aggressively about what the president knew, when he knew it and whether the administration owes the country an apology. (During the shutdown, you’ll recall, the press corps didn’t ask the president a single Obamacare question at a news conference.)\n\nThe New York Times, which has been doing solid reporting on Obamacare’s problems, dropped this latest bomb: “Federal contractors have identified most of the main problems crippling President Obama’s online health insurance marketplace, but the administration has been slow to issue orders for fixing those flaws, and some contractors worry that the system may be weeks away from operating smoothly, people close to the project say.”\n\nThe editors of USA Today are unimpressed:\n\nYou can’t help but wonder: Where was all this frantic effort in the three-and-a-half years from the time Obama signed the health law to the day the exchanges opened on Oct. 1? Because that might have helped avoid the unforced error that is raising doubts about the administration’s ability to manage other pieces of the complex law . . .\n\nDenial and evasion haven’t worked, so the administration seems finally to be trying a smidgeon of candor. The person most visibly in charge of the mess, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, told The Wall Street Journal last week that the system needed five years of construction and a year of testing, but instead got “two years and almost no testing.”\n\nReally? There were no such warnings in advance, suggesting she wasn’t on top of the situation.\n\nOn Monday, Obama argued that the dysfunctional websites are the equivalent of broken cash registers in a store filled with appealing goods. Once they’re fixed, shoppers will be happy.\n\nSo far, there’s no way to know whether he’s right because the administration remains mostly clammed up. It won’t say how many people have enrolled. It won’t fully detail the problems. And it hasn’t identified key subcontractors who botched the $400 million start-up, or the team brought in for repairs.\n\nOf course they’re going to clam up. This is an administration whose entire national-security team went along with blaming a terror attack on September 11, 2012, on a YouTube video for a couple of days. They’ve more or less managed to wait out the IRS scandal, the NSA scandal, Fast and Furious, the Department of Justice targeting AP reporters and James Rosen, Attorney General Eric Holder’s potential perjury, James Clapper’s potential perjury, and every other scandal that’s come down the pike.\n\nObama has never encountered a problem he couldn’t spin or distract his way out of: Jeremiah Wright, the crappy data on stimulus.gov (bit of foreshadowing, huh?), the runaway spending of the General Services Administration’s luxurious conferences, Solyndra, Lisa Jackson’s “Richard Windsor” secret identity . . .\n\nObama’s never had to say, “My team and I screwed up, and I’m sorry.”\n\nWhen Obama didn’t downplay, problems, he ignored them.\n\nFor the vast majority of Americans — for 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance through your employer or Medicare or Medicaid — you don’t need to sign up for coverage through a website at all. You’ve already got coverage. What the Affordable Care Act does for you is to provide you with new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time. You may not know it, but you’re already benefiting from these provisions in the law.\n\nAbsolutely no acknowledgement of developments like this:\n\nHealth plans are sending hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters to people who buy their own coverage, frustrating some consumers who want to keep what they have and forcing others to buy more costly policies. . . . Florida Blue, for example, is terminating about 300,000 policies, about 80 percent of its individual policies in the state. Kaiser Permanente in California has sent notices to 160,000 people — about half of its individual business in the state. Insurer Highmark in Pittsburgh is dropping about 20 percent of its individual market customers, while Independence Blue Cross, the major insurer in Philadelphia, is dropping about 45 percent.\n\nThe twin promises, “If you like your plan you can keep your plan; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” were key to passing this monstrosity. If Obama had said, “Some of you will be forced to give up your current plan and your current doctor,” this thing never would have gotten 200 votes in the House.\n\nBut there’s nothing Obama can say on that without admitting he made a promise he couldn’t keep. (“It reached its expiration date.” — the 2009 version of me.) So he’s just going to try to wait it out, and hope that the new tech guys can work a miracle.",
  "latent_30108": "It’s always great when the Mikkeller crew comes to town. They were here for two collaboration brews, one with Partizan for the Rainbow Project and one with the brewpub Earl of Essex, and a tap takeover at the Kings Arms. It’s safe to say they were making the most of their recent visit.\n\nThe tap takeover was a success of epic proportions, to put it mildly. Every beer geek, brewer and beer distributor had crawled out of the woodworks to kick thirteen kegs in one night. After this delicious ordeal it was pretty heroic to see some of the bar team from the Kings Arms and Thomas Schøn from Mikkeller up and ready to brew early the next day. Thomas and resident brewer Jimmy Hatherley had planned the recipe over email – a fairly big 7% percent IPA, packed with five American C hops and a simple malt bill. Thomas had even brought a bag of Citra hops in his suitcase as the guys couldn’t get hold of any. Cue confused Customs Officer jokes.\n\nThomas’ title in the Mikkeller empire is ‘Brand Manager’, but it seems his main duties are to brew and develop head honcho Mikkel’s recipes on their 2bbl pilot kit in the meatpacking district of Copenhagen. He chatted about an interesting Imperial Stout he has on the go, intended for Copenhagen Beer Celebration. Working on three different versions with chilli, chocolate and coconut, the three beers are intended to be drunk alongside each other at the festival. It’s a fairly labour intensive beer, as Thomas has been continuously feeding it brown sugar as the fermentation subsides, and even adding enzymes to break down the more complex sugars. What this means is that it’ll probably be spankingly outstanding.\n\nThe other fun job he has is to travel the world and guest brew with different breweries. From Russia to more recently San Francisco for ‘SF Beer Week’, where he managed to fit in three collaborative brews. One San Fran highlight of his was brewing with a new brewery called Faction, who he was pretty impressed with. They’re making a smoked beer that uses smoked malt, peat malt and actual burnt firewood. It’s obvious he gets a kick from seeing what other breweries are doing around the world, and taking inspiration from these collabs, which fuels how they work at Mikkeller.\n\nWe chatted a bit about how the London beer scene was developing, from Sours, Saisons and barrel ageing that has become a lot more prevalent. Thomas was happy to soak in the scene. When he turned up at Partizan he thought it was the garage where they would drive to the brewery from. He couldn’t believe that they were brewing there. But then he started tasting the beers, one after the other, and he was impressed by the quality of all of them. This small kit brewery approach, which is prevalent in the UK, is something that he really likes.\n\nThe 5 bbl brewing kit in the Earl of Essex sits a little awkwardly in the bar area. Brewing on it is a bit of a juggling act. Head brewer Jimmy and owner Anselm Chatwin are still tweaking how they work in such a confined space, but they get it done. Anselm said that they are actively looking for a bigger brewpub space, to give themselves a bit more room with the kit. With piles of hops strewn over the pub and a brewing related leak found in the basement kitchen, you can understand why the space can be a bit of a ballache.\n\nThe brew day went off without too many hitches, with Jimmy doing most of the brewing and Thomas happy to help when needed. Thankfully the Earl of Essex is probably one of the nicest pubs to sit in on a sunny Saturday morning, nursing a heavy head infused with Mikkeller brews. The beer they brewed was the strongest they had ever tried on the kit, and with what I can only assume is the most hops they’ve ever used too. Not that you would expect anything less from Mikkeller’s Brand Ambassador.\n\nWatch out for the collaboration soon in both the Earl of Essex and The King Arms, I have no doubt it will be a corker of a brew.",

  "latent_30294": "Kayah Gaydish, a conservation worker with Wild South in Asheville, died in a rock climbing accident Sunday in Virginia. (Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nASHEVILLE - An ardent conservationist, expert rock climber and mother of two died in a 50-foot fall Sunday while climbing near Hidden Valley Lake in southwest Virginia.\n\nJennifer Kendall \"Kayah\" Gaydish, 36, had been working as the Linville Gorge Wilderness Ranger for Asheville-based conservation group Wild South since 2013. She was promoted to North Carolina conservation coordinator in October. She was on a rock climbing trip with friends at the time of the accident.\n\nAccording to a statement from Washington County Sheriff Fred Newman, the dispatch center received a call about 4:15 p.m. Sunday, of a rock climbing accident in the Hidden Valley wildlife management area.\n\nDetectives reported that Gaydish fell approximately 50 feet from a rock cliff while rappelling, according to Elaine Smythe with the Washington County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nLaura Boggess, one of two friends climbing with Gaydish when she died, said the accident happened on a risky part of the climb.\n\n\"She was at the top of the climb, the time when you switch from the anchor you build to the permanent anchor,\" said Boggess, of Burnsville. \"It's always the riskiest part of the climb. We think there was some mistake with the way the rope was tied in. There was no failure with the equipment.\"\n\nThough Gaydish's friends attempted to resuscitate her, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Smythe said the cause was considered \"an accidental fall.\"\n\nThe area near Abingdon, Virginia, is remote and is popular with rock climbers, Smythe said, but she does not know of other fatalities having occurred there.\n\nGaydish's body will be transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Roanoke for an autopsy.\n\n\"She was a selfless person. She was extraordinary,\" Boggess said.\n\nThat sentiment was sadly affirmed by everyone who knew Gaydish, a single mother to two teenage children, who was quiet and humble, yet a tirelessly aggressive defender of the environment.\n\n\"What made Kayah wonderful is how unassuming she was,\" said Pat Byington, executive director of Wild South. \"She worked with so many people and pulled so many people together in a silent, and effective and beautiful way.\"\n\n\"She and her friends and volunteers for Wild South worked on removing acres upon acres of the invasive princess trees in Linville Gorge. They can grow 20 feet in a year. She pretty much helped save the rare habitat for plants found in Linville Gorge, found nowhere else in the world. It's not easy work. You gotta do it for love. It’s a real tribute to her – it’s her legacy – that unconditional love of the wild.\"\n\nGaydish’s mother, Ann Kendall, flew to Asheville on Monday, from her home in Tampa, Florida. Kendall said her daughter, who used to work as a doula and at that time took on the name “Kayah,” was born in Richmond, Virginia. When she was 6, the family, including her father, Roy Kendall, and older brother, Jason Kendall, moved to Tampa, where she grew up.\n\nKayah was married to Joe Gaydish who died a few years ago, Ann Kendall said. The couple had two children – son Caleb, 17, and daughter, River, 14. They moved to Asheville about 15 years ago.\n\n“I’m still in denial that this happened,” Kendall said. “She was an expert climber and she did not take chances. She just went out to Moab, Utah, to climb there. The detective told me that normally that is a survivable fall, but she probably hit her head on a rocky area.\"\n\nKendall said she will be the legal guardian to her grandchildren. She wants people to remember her daughter as a smart, strong, compassionate person who survived many trials in life, but was excellent at her two favorite things – being a mom and protecting the environment.\n\n“She’d give you the shirt off her back, and everyone who knows her knows that to be true,” Kendall said. “She was a very good mother. She loved Western North Carolina and she loved Asheville. I tried to get her to come back to Florida to live, and she wouldn’t consider it.”\n\nGaydish did not attend college, but was self-taught and took training in many trades, including work as a dula, as an herbalist, and as wilderness ranger, Kendall said. She was considered an expert rock climber, fastidious about safety, and had even taught others the skill.\n\nBen Prater, who formerly worked for Wild South, first met Gaydish several years ago when she volunteered for the regional environmental nonprofit. Prater was able to hire her on part time as the Linville Gorge Wilderness Ranger – an extremely difficult and demanding job.\n\n“She came to the job as a rock star. She took on this daunting project of eradication of this invasive (princess tree), which was symbolic of her work on the landscape that needed every ounce of her energy, and she did it, she gave her all,” said Prater, who is now director of the Southeast Program of Defenders of Wildlife.\n\n“I’ve hired and worked with a lot of people. She didn’t have a traditional college degree, and I remember we talked about whether that would be a roadblock, but it wasn’t. She was a self-made woman, she was self-taught, and the wisdom she gained by getting her hands dirty was all she needed.”\n\nGaydish was also a volunteer with the Carolina Mountain Club and with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, where she performed trail maintenance and natural resource management work, and was an Appalachian Trail community ambassador for Hot Springs, said Julie Judkins, ATC director of education and outreach, who was also a close friend of Gaydish's.\n\nJudkins said Gaydish worked as a part-time employee with the ATC, as well as with Wild South, until taking on the full-time position with Wild South this fall.\n\n“I think that the community outpour of love and support shows the kind of generous person that she was. I think she was a really strong mother and was always looking for ways to provide service to others and especially to our public lands. I can’t think of anyone more humble and compassionate.”\n\nPrater said Gaydish took her job as a wilderness ranger very seriously, and planned every trail maintenance, invasive-eradication project or rock climb down to the letter.\n\n“She would have been the last person I would ever think would be in an accident like this,” Prater said. “She was exceptionally careful. When you think about what it takes to be a wilderness ranger, especially in a place as rugged as the Linville Gorge, she was meticulous about safety and making sure folks were prepared. She was frustrated when she had to call off trips because people were not as serious as she was about safety.”\n\nPrater said in addition to admiring Gaydish’s work as a colleague, as a single parent himself, he was inspired by her strength in raising children on her own, and her selflessness as a human being.\n\n“We became fast friends. She was one of the kindest and gentlest person I ever knew, wise beyond her years, always quick to give praise, but never one who needed it,” he said.\n\nPeter Barr, a friend of Gaydish’s for about four years, said she was one of the region’s environmental heroes. He said last year Gaydish helped organize a fundraiser with the Carolina Climbers Coalition to help open climbing access in the area where she was climbing Sunday.\n\n“Kayah was one of the most sincere people I ever knew, and cared for our mountains and trails as much as anyone. She devoted herself to stewarding our wild lands and building and maintaining our trails,” said Barr, trails and outreach coordinator for the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy.\n\n“She left us doing something she loved and believed in, in a place she worked hard to protect,\" Barr said. “She was a hero of mine. She was inspiring in everything she did in her life. I feel like the region will not be the same without her.”\n\nJudkins said a fund has been set up to provide for Gaydish’s children. Details on a memorial service are in the works.\n\nWant to help?\n\nTo donate to a fund set up to help support Kayah Gaydish's two young children, visit www.youcaring.com/kayahgaydish.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1YwuSnk",
  "latent_30318": "Winning World War III, Climate Change Edition\n\nJanuary 3rd, 2016 by Sponsored Content\n\nIs that so hard?\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships For Climate Change Action\n\nThe aforementioned question comes to us from the Masdar 2016 Engage Blogging Contest. The topic of public-private partnerships is of critical interest to Masdar, which is a subsidiary of the company Mubadala, which is this:\n\nIn 2002, Mubadala – the Arabic word for ‘exchange’ – was established by the Government of Abu Dhabi as a principal agent in the diversification of Abu Dhabi’s economy.\n\n[snip]\n\nMubadala was established to strengthen Abu Dhabi’s growth potential, and to help the government meet its socioeconomic targets…\n\nWhile Mubadala’s first major venture involved natural gas production and transportation, in 2006 it created Masdar as a subsidiary, which quickly went to work and formed a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007 to create the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology.\n\nThe Masdar Institute should ring plenty of bells with CleanTechnica readers. We’ve been following Masdar’s work on solar energy, including last summer’s opening of the new “Masdar Solar Hub” R&D facility.\n\nMasdar has also been active in the field of aviation biofuel, focusing on salt-loving plants that can thrive in arid conditions, including a “closed loop” system that integrates biofuel crops with food production.\n\nOne For All, All For Climate Change Action…Or Not\n\nIn an early piece on Masdar back in 2011, CleanTechnica referenced the institute’s work on the energy-nexus in an article titled “U.S. Fiddles While Others Work For New Energy Future,” and that brings us to the point.\n\nThe U.S. stacks up pretty well when it comes to developing strategies for transitioning to a low carbon economy by forming public-private partnerships, but there is one key difference. The economic value of the sustainability policies being pursued by the Obama Administration has been drowned out by an aggressive public relations effort in support of the fossil fuel industry, spearheaded by powerful federal legislators such as Senator James Inhofe and Senator Ted Cruz, who is currently running for the Republican nomination for president under a platform that includes abolishing the Department of Energy, and abetted by state legislators and executives such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (yes, this guy), who is also running for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe problem is that the experience of climate change has already crossed the barrier from theory to reality, so while government policy has enabled the development of the necessary technology, the pace of progress has been slowed artificially, by the fossil lobby.\n\nIn a “free” market nation like the U.S., the missing piece needed to accelerate the pace of change is the engagement and enthusiasm of consumers at every level, as individuals, businesses, institutions and government agencies.\n\nThe last time that happened was during World War II under a unified government campaign in support of the war effort, which was coincidentally the last time that the U.S. was attacked on its own shores by another sovereign nation.\n\nFollow me on Twitter and Google+.\n\nImage: via Masdar.",
  "latent_30606": "Comedy Central\n\nAs our own Danger Guerrero said here, there and just about everywhere else he can find an outlet, Comedy Central’s Review is one of the best half hours on television. Its first season was a smash success with audiences and critics alike, and the cult hit is now back for a second bout of viewer-submitted review topics and poor life decisions on the part of host Forrest MacNeil.\n\nForrest’s doppelgänger, Andy Daly took some time out of his busy schedule to chat with us about Review‘s Australian roots, the ins and outs of the writers room, and what the final episode of the series might involve. Here’s a spoilery hint — Forrest dies! Not really. Well, kind of.\n\nReview‘s first season was a big surprise, mainly because the audience wasn’t familiar with the original Australian show, Review with Myles Barlow. Do you feel like the first season’s success gave the team a big boost?\n\nYeah, definitely. I think in season one, we felt good about what we were doing. We were excited about what we were doing. We were serious about making a show that Comedy Central’s audience would like, but would bring new people to Comedy Central who aren’t already in their audience. We were very optimistic about all of those things, but we were also following our own instincts. There were certainly times when we looked at each other and just said, “Is anybody else going to find this funny outside of this room? Have we gone too far? Is this too crazy?” Having the first season air and get the response that it did was a huge boost to the idea of following our instincts. I think, going into season two, we kind of felt emboldened about our instincts a little bit. We can take this wherever we want to take it, and there will be, hopefully, an audience out there that will be appreciative of it and ready to receive it.\n\nThe first season borrowed a lot from the original. With it behind you, did you feel free to expand Forrest’s story in season two?\n\nOur attitude was, yes, this has been a pre-existing Australian series, but we can take from it what we want and we can leave aside the things that we don’t want. We asked, “What do we love about what they did? What do we just want to take? What do we want to flat out steal from them? What do we want to change and take in a different direction?” Our show in season one was very different from their show, actually, but in this season, we didn’t go back and watch anything. We just kind of barreled ahead. I can only think of one topic in season two that they also did. Our treatment of this particular topic is quite similar to theirs because I love what they did with it.\n\nYou’ve talked elsewhere about how heavily scripted the show is. How much time did the writing team spend plotting the new season?\n\nWe gave ourselves less time to write season two, actually. We didn’t have to take the time that we did with season one figuring out basic things about how the show works, who Forrest is and how his world works. That is something, if I had to do it over again, I might to do differently. The challenges of writing a second season are different challenges, but I wouldn’t say that there are fewer challenges. It’s a different thing but it’s difficult, so it did feel a little bit like we didn’t have quite the time that I would’ve loved to have had. But yeah, we worked the scripts very, very hard through all the time we had. We actually did a little more writing during production than we did in season one, which is very challenging to do because I’m in every scene, and Jeffrey Blitz is directing every scene. So, it’s a little hard to get writing done while you’re doing that.\n\nImprovising played a big role in season one, and maybe even a bigger role in season two. Probably because we were slightly more likely to get to the set, open up the script for the day and say, “Oh no, I don’t want to do that!” So, we did a fair amount of making it up as we go along. And the editors, I have found, lean towards things that were improvised. I think it’s because, in that mockumentary style, something that feels spontaneous feels more real, so the editors definitely have a preference for that. So, you’ll see a lot of little improvised moments here and there.\n\nI imagine that, since this is the second season, everyone is comfortable enough with each other and the material to improvise more often.\n\nRight. There’s a little bit more of an understanding of that. It’s an interesting show because it’s grounded in the real world, but we also take certain flights of insanity. Where exactly is the right line of reality versus uncertainty or insanity? It’s something that always has to be tested out or discussed.\n\nForrest’s personal life, and just how f*cked up it gets, is obviously a main focus of the show. However, one of my favorite things is the relationships (or lack thereof) he has with his Review coworkers, especially Producer Grant (James Urbaniak). Do you get to explore these further in the new season?\n\nDefinitely! The relationship between Forrest and Grant does get examined a fair amount in season two. You’ll have to wait for it, but we do zoom in a little bit on that dynamic between the two of those guys. We have a lot of fun with Forrest and all the people in his world. If Forrest wants to do this, they are there to help him and help push him where he says he wants to go, no matter how self-destructive it might be.\n\nComedy Central\n\nI’m eager to see what you’re talking about regarding Forrest and Grant’s relationship. The “this could be your penicillin” joke is one of the first season’s best.\n\nA little behind the scenes of that. We were talking about that in the writers room, asking what would have been Forrest’s justification for doing these extreme things. Maybe he’s like the guy that discovered penicillin. I threw out this idea of “fungus on a stick.” Then, I said we should look up how penicillin was actually discovered, because I don’t think it was literally fungus on a stick. We should look up what it really was and put that in the script. But Jeffrey Blitz said, “No, I don’t think Forrest should understand that any better than you do.” So, yeah, “fungus on a stick” was truly my best stab at how penicillin was discovered.\n\nHow do you go about coming up with, writing and selecting the topics that Forrest must review?\n\nAnything anybody comes up with ends up on an index card that ends up on that back wall of the writers room, which is just floor to ceiling index cards. These are grouped into different categories. Physical challenges, lifestyle challenges — I’m not sure what all the other categories are, but we’ve figured out some way of organizing them. Then we really start outlining the season by talking about what big things should happen. What’s the season-long narrative arc? So, those are different colored index cards that go up on the front wall of the writers room. Then, it’s just a matter of picking reviews off the back wall that feel like that they could help get at what’s happening to him in his life. Trying to crack them, make them work, and come up with little stories filled with lots of little jokes. A lot of the ones that we jam on, we end up feeling like, “Nah, that’s not going to work.” So, we send it back to the back wall. Luckily, we find enough that work.",
  "latent_30674": "I applied to ECQ again with a version of this act, and a few months later, got my next rejection in the mail… And you know what? It wasn’t quite as hard the second time. Was it discouraging? Absolutely. Learning more about their acceptance policies – that they found I was a solid juggler, but lacked the dance background they desired (not to mention that I was 25 years old… a dinosaur in their eyes) – softened the blow and encouraged me to keep training hard.\n\nThanks to a friend’s recommendation, I started performing at a themepark. After that, I got a call to join a USO tour in South Korea. The adage that “work begets work” turned out to be true, and I started securing more contracts and working all over after that.\n\nThe next year, I was the opening act for ECQ’s juggling festival’s gala show. A few years later, I closed the same festival’s welcome show with a different routine.\n\nCould I have learned a ton in their program? Absolutely. Can you get the same foundations by training on your own? Absolutely.\n\nIf I hadn’t applied to ECQ for the first time, I might have just given up on a career in circus entirely. That first rejection helped shape my belief that you should always let the other guy say “no” to you – that you should apply for jobs, festivals, and opportunities even if you don’t think you have a great shot – that you should let the folks in control deny your application, rather than letting your pessimism or humility deny you the opportunity before your work gets seen. Taking rejection in stride builds character (or, at least, I hope it does!) and helps you look at the application process more critically: “Was my application really the best it could have been? What could I have done better? What should I have done differently? Was this just the right application at the wrong time?”\n\nIn the case of Canadian circus schools, they often have a quota – certain numbers of Quebequois and Canadians must be accepted in order for them to secure state funding. The other slots are open for applicants from the rest of the world. If they’ve already taken applicants from these areas in your discipline, you’re out of luck – regardless of your merits as a circus performer.\n\nIn the world of grant writing, similar unseen forces are often at play. Some institutions reject first-time applicants outright, as well. Those rejections shouldn’t be seen as the end of your attempts at securing funding or a residency or whatever you’re after – those letters of rejection can be interpreted as a kind of handshake. A way to know that they’ve read your proposal, and that you should just go ahead and give it another shot the next year – with an even stronger application that shows you’ve been doing the work without their help. Even the gate-keepers love a go-getter.\n\nSo, in a way, I’m grateful that I was denied the opportunity to enter the circus school in Quebec City.\n\nThe fire those rejections kindled has motivated me to continue working on my craft – work that’s allowed me to perform all over the world, both with my own productions as well as with companies like Cirque du Soleil. It brought me to Vermont, where I met my wife; given me a bootstraps attitude towards training; and has allowed me to build a life on my own terms.\n\nIf you’re looking to attend circus school – absolutely audition. Shake hands and meet peers with the same aspirations as you have… Just don’t be fooled into thinking their program is the only way to achieve the career you want. The only thing that matters is the hours you spend training, the feedback you seek out, and the drive you have to pursue mastery.\n\nI’ll leave you with the latest video of my ball juggling act, performed at the Periplo International Circus Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nIs it perfect? Absolutely not. Does it show some kind of growth from that first audition attempt at ECQ? Here’s hoping.",

  "latent_30976": "WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said Thursday he opposes proposals to strip the central bank of its bank-regulating authority.\n\nVolcker, who chairs President Obama's economic advisory panel, told the House Financial Services Committee that removing the Fed's supervisory authority would be a mistake. The Fed conducts bank examinations and sets capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve Board should not become an academic seminar debating in its marble palace various approaches toward monetary policy without the leavening experience of direct contact with, and responsibility for, the world of finance and the institutions through which monetary policy is effected,\" Volcker said.\n\nA proposal under consideration by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would create one mega-regulator made up of the four national banking agencies including the Fed.\n\nAs part of the proposal, supervisory authority over banks would be transferred from the Fed to the new agency. The Fed, in turn, would be responsible only for monetary policy, such controlling interest rates.\n\nCongress also is considering legislation that would remove the central bank's consumer-protection authority and place it within a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency.\n\nThe effort by Dodd reflects in part populist frustrations with the Fed for bailing out the banks using hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars.\n\nEfforts to emasculate the Fed were supported by Arthur Levitt, a Clinton-era Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, who cautioned against giving the Fed too much power. He told lawmakers he opposes the Fed overseeing monetary policy and bank \"safety and soundness\" supervision, arguing there are conflicts in that approach.\n\n\"The Fed has too many conflicts to do this job effectively,\" Levitt said. \"Defending the 'safety and soundness' of financial institutions and managing monetary policy creates inevitable and compromising conflicts with the kind of vigilant and independent oversight a systemic risk regulator requires.\"\n\nSeparation of commercial banking and risky investments\n\nVolcker, who headed the Fed between 1979 and 1987, testified that legislators should prohibit commercial banks from engaging in certain risky activities, particularly because they could become the beneficiaries of tax-dollar infusions.\n\nCommercial banks and their holding companies shouldn't be permitted to own or invest in hedge funds or buyout shops, he said. He added that commercial banks should also be prohibited from a \"heavy volume of proprietary trading, with its inherent risks.\"\n\n\"I think we have learned enough about the challenges and distractions for management posed by the risks and complexities of highly diversified activities,\" Volcker said.\n\nVolcker added that there should be some additional checks and balances when it comes to the oversight of the Fed.\n\nHe argued that one Fed board governor should be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as a second vice chairman of the Fed board and that this official would have responsibility for overseeing regulation of systemically significant institutions. The official would also have a staff to help identify problem sectors or institutions, Volcker said.\n\nFuture for taxpayer-funded bailouts\n\nLawmakers and Volcker clashed over whether the government should continue to be given the flexibility to use taxpayer dollars to prop up institutions in the case of a financial crisis.\n\nRep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., the committee's ranking member, argued that taxpayers are tired of paying for Wall Street's mistakes.\n\n\"They see something manifestly and fundamentally wrong with a casino environment in which the high rollers pocket the profits, often measured in millions if not billions, while the taxpayers pay off the losses,\" Bachus said.\n\nHowever, Volcker said that he was opposed to abolishing the Fed's ability to inject capital into the system in the case of an emergency.\n\n\"I am not proposing that the Fed's emergency powers be abolished,\" Volcker said. \"I squirm when it is used, we know if it ever got used it would set a precedent and we didn't want to set the precedent of using it, but now that it's set, we want to develop attitudes and say it's extremely extraordinary, but I wouldn't take it away.\"\n\nResolution authority\n\nLawmakers and Volcker also debated the usefulness of a White House proposal that would set up a mechanism to unwind a large insolvent institution in a way that it does not cause collateral damage to the markets.\n\nBachus said such a process masks the fact that the government was identifying a group of institutions it considers too-big-to-fail.\n\n\"When we designate 20 institutions to be too big to fail, we endorse a situation where people will assume they will be saved and there is a guarantee,\" said Bachus. \"It enshrines the moral hazard issue.\"\n\nVolcker said that Wall Street would have a general idea of what institutions are on the list, but even then it actually could be fluctuating at any time, with some smaller interconnected firms included as well.\n\n\"It will be difficult to identify in advance who is systemically important, because you may find smaller institutions that have connections with other institutions that create a clog in the system and should be included,\" Volcker said. \"However, this dismantling authority will diminish the sense that creditors of big banks will be bailed out.\"\n\nSuch a resolution mechanism could make payouts but it would require bondholders to lose some of their investments or convert their stakes into equity. The mechanism could also force certain problem institutions into mergers, or take other steps \"that would not require taxpayer-funded infusions,\" Volcker said.\n\nHe also said that the government should give the Fed responsibility to survey the whole financial system and block transactions in a sector when the central bank said it believes there is a dangerously large amount of trades in that area. He added that the government should have the ability at any time to say at any time that a particular institution has become too risky and as a result it needs to cap leverage and have a greater amount of capital on hand.\n\n\"Somebody should have raised the question that subprime or credit default swaps raised a threat to the markets,\" Volcker said.\n\nFinancial transaction tax?\n\nVolcker said that Congress should require a study be conducted about the viability of the idea of having a financial transaction tax that would be used to inject capital into systemic financial institutions at a time of instability, as an alternative to taxpayer-funded infusions. However, Volcker expressed some reservations.\n\n\"If the fee is low enough not to be disruptive to the markets, it won't be significant enough to pay for these costs,\" he said. \"If it is large enough for what is needed, it likely will have a disruptive impact on the markets.\"",
  "latent_30996": "Democrat Chad Taylor withdraws name from ballot after decision that could affect which party controls the Senate\n\nThe Republicans’ bid to regain control of the US Senate suffered a major blow on Thursday when the Kansas Supreme Court issued a ruling widely-viewed as a boost to an independent challenger in the state.\n\nThe ruling compels Kansas’s Republican secretary of state to remove the name of a Democratic candidate from ballot papers ahead of November’s elections.\n\nRepublican strategists had wanted Chad Taylor to remain on the ballot, hoping it would divide the large block of Kansas voters opposed to the state’s three-term incumbent senator, Pat Roberts. Instead, the decision is expected to lead to Democrats switching allegiance to the independent, Greg Orman, who according to one recent poll already enjoys a seven point lead over Roberts in the deep-red state.\n\nKris Kobach, the secretary of state who attempted to keep the Democrat’s name on the ballot paper, had been accused of abusing his position to boost the electoral prospects of Roberts, a fellow Republican.\n\nTaylor brought a lawsuit to the state supreme court, claiming Kobach was effectively “conscripting me to run for office” even though he had complied by the rules for withdrawing from the race.\n\nIn its ruling, the court sided with Taylor, determining that Kobach “shall not include Taylor’s name on any ballots” in the forthcoming Senate election. The decision is a significant setback for Roberts, a Kansas senator since 1997, who will now see the anti-incumbent vote effectively consolidate behind Orman, his most serious challenger.\n\nPolitical science professor Chapman Rackaway, who has been closely following the Kansas race, said the court ruling was a boon for the independent candidate. “If Orman can hold his lead through the attacks that are coming, he has taken command of this race that he is unlikely to relinquish,” he said.\n\nThe result also deals a blow to Kobach, who is facing his own re-election battle in the state. Although Kansas is a deeply conservative state, politics there has been upended in recent weeks, with a swathe of top Republican incumbents, up to and including the governor, Sam Brownback, battling against a surge of public anger over deep tax cuts.\n\nHowever the significance of the decision was also felt in Washington. Given the close national race for control of the Senate, political forecasters have said the Kansas race, which just a weeks months ago was considered a safe Republican seat, could feasibly help determine whether Republicans or Democrats balance of power in the legislative body.\n\nOrman has not said which party he would caucus with if he wins the Senate race, but Democrats believe he would ultimately join their ranks. Both other independents in the Senate - Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont - currently caucus with Democrats.\n\nAt the very least, the judgment is a political setback for Republicans nationally, who are having to divert funds and resources they to defend what should be safe, conservative territory.\n\nThe Orman campaign, which is striving to rise above the fray and appear non-partisan, responding to the ruling by claiming it did not mind which other candidates were on the ballot. “No matter who’s on or off the ballot, Greg Orman is running as an independent against the broken system in Washington that has failed Kansas and failed America,” his campaign manager, Jim Jonas, said in a statement.\n\nThe Roberts campaign, in contrast, reacted angrily to a decision it claimed had been issued by “liberal activist supreme court justices” which it said had “disenfranchised” Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe precise impact of the court’s ruling on the Kansas Senate race will be difficult to decipher One poll this week showed Orman opening up a 41-34 lead over Roberts. Even though he had publicly announced his withdrawal from campaigning, Taylor still received 6 points in that survey, by Public Policy Polling.\n\nA second poll, by Fox News, had the race closer - with Orman and Roberts running neck and neck. However that survey had Taylor still receiving 11% of the vote.\n\nTaylor’s lawsuit centred on the letter he filed to withdraw his name on 3 September, just an hour before the deadline for making changes to the ballot. Kobach argued the letter failed to meet the legal requirements set out in a 1997 statute.\n\nThe court heard that once the deadline passed, Kobach, the state’s attorney general, Derek Schmidt, who is also a Republican, and a room full of lawyers stayed up late into the night reviewing the letter. They concluded that his name could not be removed because, although he quoted the correct statute in his letter, Taylor did not specifically claim to be “incapable of fulfilling the duties of office”.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, several justices appeared to take issue with Kobach’s argument, with one accusing the secretary of state of a “loosey-goosey” and “ad-hoc” determination of which candidates can appear on the ballot.\n\nTaylor’s lawyers had pointed out that Kobach had permitted another Democratic candidate, Miranda Rickel, from removing her name from the ballot. Her letter - which also did not directly declare an incapability for holding office - was delivered to Kobach’s office on the very same day as Taylor’s. She was permitted to withdraw from the race. Taylor, on the other hand, was not.\n\nIn their ruling, the seven justices concluded that Taylor’s letter “effectively declares he is incapable of fulfilling the duties of office if elected”.\n\nOne issue that remains unresolved is whether Democrats are now legally obliged to nominate another candidate to replace Taylor, or whether there would simply be no Democrat on the ballot paper. The Kansas Democratic Party did not respond to a request asking if it would name a replacement candidate.\n\nBefore the judgment was handed down, Kobach said that if he lost the case, and Taylor’s name had to be removed, the Democratic party was legally obliged to provide a replacement name. He threatened to return to the Kansas supreme court with his own lawsuit, to force Democrats to name a replacement.\n\nBut time is running out; absentee and ballot papers for military personnel serving overseas need to printed on Friday.",

  "latent_31812": "In his telling, he is protecting put-upon inventors. But he may simply be profiteering from a flawed and creaky legal system.\n\nMr. Spangenberg speaks in rapid-fire clumps of words, usually while looking down and grimacing slightly, as though trying to lift a barbell. When we met, he was wearing what he calls “my uniform”: a pair of jeans and one of his 40 identical black, short-sleeve, mock-turtleneck Nike T-shirts.\n\nHe doesn’t mind his public reputation as an ogre, and by all means, he says, call him a troll — though he thinks the name is a bogus effort to taint his profession.\n\nWhen it comes to work, he is focused to the point of being obsessive. As an associate at a corporate law firm — after taking the ACT test, he attended the University of Delaware and eventually earned a law degree from Case Western University — he once worked four days straight without sleep, and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\n“I had a mild seizure,” he said. “There’s only so much coffee and caffeine tablets you can take.”\n\nHe stands about 5-foot-6 and was bullied as a child because of his height. He always fought back, he says, and he usually lost; his nose has been broken by an assortment of fists. This has given him a lifelong hatred of bullies, which explains, he says, why he wound up in a job where he often stands with a small company assailing a larger one.\n\nBut IPNav doesn’t exactly fight using the Marquess of Queensberry rules. In a 2008 ruling, Judge Barbara B. Crabb of Federal District Court in Wisconsin, concluded that Mr. Spangenberg was involved in witness tampering — specifically, inducing a lawyer to “intimidate a witness on the eve of trial.” The eviscerating 62-page ruling was in a case brought by DaimlerChrysler against a company owned by Mr. Spangenberg called Taurus IP. The carmaker accused Mr. Spangenberg of breaking a 2006 we-won’t-sue-you-again agreement over certain tech patents.\n\nIt was a complex case, but here’s a quick summary: one company controlled by Mr. Spangenberg (Orion IP) was accused of having signed a settlement with DaimlerChrysler. Later, a different Spangenberg-owned company (Taurus IP) sued DaimlerChrysler with related patents. Mr. Spangenberg seemed to be trying a double dip — angling for two settlements from the same defendant. Tsk, tsk, said Judge Crabb, though she used tougher language and painstakingly enumerated the maze of companies in the Spangenberg empire. She ordered Taurus IP to pay DaimlerChrysler $3.8 million to cover its legal fees and succinctly described Mr. Spangenberg’s business model this way: “to license patents through litigation: first file a lawsuit, then negotiate a licensing agreement as part of a settlement.”",
  "latent_31826": "Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy has never been one to shy away from the microphone. The 57-year-old coach speaks candidly on players and his own performance as a coach. Most importantly, he has shown a willingness to speak out against injustice. He has unwillingly accepted that Donald Trump will be president. However, he’s steadfast in challenging Trump and others at every step.\n\n“I’m sick of people who supported Trump saying ‘get over it, you lost,’” Van Gundy told Sporting News. “That’s not how America works. We get to critique him the same way they constantly fought Obama. As long as I have a platform I will continue to speak up because it’s my responsibility.”\n\nMORE: SVG rips Donald Trump\n\nVan Gundy took some time to sit down with Sporting News to discuss racism, sexism and many other societal ills.\n\nSporting News (SN): When did you first become aware of politics?\n\nStan Van Gundy (SVG): I was raised in a home where we grew up where we discussed issues. I’ve always been really politically aware. My wife and four kids are very aware. They make me more attune to a lot of things I would not think about. Especially women’s issues. I have three daughters and a wife. They constantly are making me aware of ways we aren’t respecting women. I love that they challenge me. I want my kids aware. I don’t want them to vote a certain way because that’s how I voted. We agree and disagree, but most importantly, we all learn.\n\nSN: What are some of the things your daughters have taught you about women?\n\nSVG: I was always for equal pay and things like that. But there are so many other issues. Like when you see the Brock Turner case at Stanford. Here’s a man who got caught sexually assaulting a woman, and the courts don’t see it as a big deal. He got a six-month sentence because some judge said his life was important. But what does that say to women? Or you see this study from Harvard where a woman sends in the (same) resumé as a man and she gets called back four times less. All they did was change the first name and the men got more call backs. This what my daughters are up against. A lot of the time when you sit in a position of privilege like I do, you don’t realize how things are until you live closely to those are dealing with oppression. It’s the same with my players, staff and other people around the NBA.\n\nMORE: Sports figures that support Donald Trump\n\nSN: How can others become more aware?\n\nSVG: Read and listen. When you have privilege you have to been quiet and listen. I wasn’t raised in some of these situations. I had a very fortunate upbringing — 30 years around basketball and listening to players talk about getting pulled over because somebody thought they were in the \"wrong\" neighborhood. Then you read books like Michelle Alexander’s \"New Jim Crow\" where it shows society locked up an entire generation of young black men for small drug crimes. It’s done so much damage. You have whole communities ruined over petty marijuana possession. You almost feel ignorant for not knowing this stuff before. You then say, \"Wow it shouldn’t be like this.\" And then you see this election on top and you have to say something, so I did.\n\nSN: Is this why you spoke out in Phoenix?\n\nSVG: Absolutely, we took a major step back. We elected a man who said some of the worst things ever, and people still voted for him. It’s been over a month and I still can’t believe so many were willing ignore racism, sexism and mistreatment of the LGBTQ community. He said things that were beyond what we should expect in America. So I felt the need to speak out. It wasn’t so much that he got elected. It was more what was said by him and his campaign. I didn’t care about my candidate losing and the Republicans winning. I’ve voted for plenty of people who lost. I did care about all the things he said that were encouraged or at least condoned by voters.\n\nMORE: Donald Trump tweets on sports\n\nSN: Do you regret anything you said in Phoenix?\n\nSVG: I meant what I said about how electing Donald Trump will set our country back. I stand by that. However, I do wish I wouldn’t have made the blanket statement about not respecting anybody who voted for Trump. I spoke from a place of comfort. I make an excellent salary and work a great job. A lot of the people who voted for Trump don’t. Let’s say you say you’re out of a job and believe this guy is going to get you on back on your feet. You might overlook some stuff not because you believe it. But you’re that desperate. They’re wrong. But it’s what they believe. It’s easy for me to say, \"How can they vote for a monster?\" But when people fear they make awful choices. Even if that means looking over a racist and sexist man. I should not have said I don’t respect them. What I don’t respect is all the things that were said.\n\nSN: What is the responsibility of the person with privilege?\n\nSVG: We have a great responsibility because, rightly or wrongly, we tend to be the people in power. Or people like us. People with advantages don’t tend to want to give them up. If you see it as a zero-sum game then it will never change. If only the people who are disadvantaged speak out, then it’s not enough. I don’t want to overshadow their voices, but I want to support. There’s a difference. It’s the people who are advantaged who need to see things as unfair. No movement in our history has ever worked with only the oppressed people fighting. That’s why the rollback of Affirmative Action and Voting Rights Acts is so flawed. I wish we lived in a world where we didn’t need to protections but we don’t. It’s up to them to tell us when things are even, and we aren’t close to being on an even playing field. I don’t see how anybody can look at our systems and see the world as equal. If you are, you’re lying to yourself.",
  "latent_31849": "I’ve very clearly staked out my position on what the Pirates should do this offseason — augment the team and make an earnest run in 2018, then re-evaluate in July. I still feel that way.\n\nBut here we are a week out from Christmas and Neal Huntington is still making statements that appear as if he and his staff are dithering on whether to re-load or re-build. What were they doing in October and November?!\n\nThe Yankees have been sniffing around Gerrit Cole and he’s a desirous asset, as young grasshopper Alex laid out for your reading pleasure last week. Now I could wow you with numbers about surplus value and prospect worth and grind out how much Cole should return. Heck, I still might do that before I finish this article. But I don’t have to because Gerrit Cole was already traded last July. Huh?\n\nEveryone likes to make comps between Player A and Player B. The vast majority of the time, those comps are tenuous, at best. But in the case of Gerrit Cole and Sonny Gray, they are amazingly accurate. Both Gray and Cole were drafted in 2011 (Cole went 1-1, Gray went 1-18 to the A’s) and both made their debuts in 2013 midseason. So these stats encapsulate the same 4+ season timeframe.\n\nLet’s look at some overarching stats between the two:\n\nInnings pitched — Cole 782.1, Gray 770.1\n\nK/9 rate, career — Cole 8.44, Gray 7.78\n\nBB/9 rate, career — Cole 2.34, Gray 2.94\n\nHR/9 rate, career — Cole 0.77, Gray 0.85\n\nERA/FIP, career — Cole 3.50/3.27, Gray 3.45/3.67\n\nJust with those five criteria, we’ve built the same pitcher. But what’s even odder is that both have achieved those stats in relatively similar fashion. Both of them have only reached 200+ innings twice in those four full seasons. Both of them had their peak year in 2015. Cole’s 2015 was very shiny (2.60 ERA/2.66 FIP, 5.4 WAR) and would have won him the Cy Young in some years, while Gray’s 2015 was exceptional in its own right (2.73 ERA/3.45 FIP, good for 3.8 WAR). Both had down 2016 campaigns due to injuries.\n\nCole has the slight advantage in career WAR — 15.9 to Gray’s 12.0 — mostly because of his phenomenal 2015 campaign and his dominant debut in 2013. Both have had whispers of ‘ace’ surround them for years and both have fallen short of that in the minds of many in their respective fanbases.\n\nLast July, the A’s traded Sonny Gray to the Yankees at the deadline for a package that was laden with upside, but swimming in risk. It didn’t have the knockout, can’t miss, blue-chip prospect in it that so many expect in a return for Gerrit Cole. The A’s received three players back for Gray:\n\nRHP James Kaprielian (ranked #87 preseason by Baseball America, missed all 2017 while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery)\n\nSS Jorge Mateo (ranked #85 preseason by Baseball America, a steep drop from his 2016 preseason rank of #26)\n\nOF Dustin Fowler (while being showcased by the Yankees he ripped his knee after his 1st Major League at-bat. The A’s still took him.)\n\nThat’s it. Two injured players and a shortstop that has a ton of speed, but not a great hit tool, that is a declining asset in the prospect world.\n\nAlex tossed out names like OF Clint Frazier, LHP Justus Sheffield, and 3B Miguel Andujar in his article. At this point, a one-for-one Frazier-Cole deal would actually be an overpay on the Yankees part. What’s even crazier is that Neal Huntington is, as his M.O., shooting straight for the top of the pile in any negotiation.\n\nPirates have wanted Gleyber Torres in a Gerrit Cole deal. Can’t see yanks giving GT up. Frazier a more likely centerpiece, but would need to be more than 1 for 1. Perhaps andujar or Adams could be 2nd piece. Still negotiating. — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) December 16, 2017\n\nI love Gleyber Torres, but he’s a top 5 (maybe top overall) prospect in the game. And as much as I think Gerrit Cole is a great pitcher, he doesn’t have that much control and that good of a resume to warrant asking for Torres in a deal.\n\nSheffield was ranked #91 prior to 2017, so he’s in the same range as Kaprielian and Mateo, but his 2017 was somewhat uninspiring enough that I could see him falling out of the Top 100 altogether. Andujar is intriguing to me and I would be happy to see him as part of the return. It’s possible that Andujar sneaks in the back half of the Baseball America Top 100.\n\nAnother name being bandied about is Chance Adams, unranked on the Baseball America Top 100, but should be in the back half of this year’s list. Jordan Montgomery debuted this year for the Yankees and provided 155 innings on the Major League level. His production looks like that of a low-end #3/high-end #4 pitcher, but his appeal is that he’s obviously ML-ready with six years of team control remaining (he’s a near-certainty to be a Super Two arbitration player, as he accrued 153 days of service).\n\nA package of Andujar and Montgomery would lack the zesty names that many people would easily identify with as a return for Cole. However, it’s probably one that is roughly equivalent in value to the one received in the Sonny Gray trade just this past July. Something like Sheffield, Adams, and Andujar would be more equivalent in terms of matching prospect worth at that specific moment in time.\n\nReceiving a pitcher like Jordan Montgomery back doesn’t really move the needle much, either in 2018 as he’s similar to a Chad Kuhl, or down the line as his ceiling is probably where he is right now. The 23-year old Miguel Andujar could be the answer at 3B, but he’s certainly not the can’t-miss prospect that many observers would be hoping to receive in return for trading Gerrit Cole.\n\nI still believe that Gerrit Cole can tap into his 2015 form again. It’s there. He’s shown it. If he can, he’s the only pitcher on the Pirates’ staff (yes, including Taillon) that has that ceiling and ability to front a playoff-contending rotation. I’d keep him and his compatriots and re-assess in July. If the Pirates are out of it, the calculus of the discussion changes entirely.",
  "latent_31894": "\"We thought: 'Let's have a stage the shape of Texas.'\" In dark glasses, 10-gallon hat, cowboy boots and – of course – long beard, ZZ Top's bassist Dusty Hill is remembering the time the band decided to take their home state to the world – or as much of it as they could reach. \"There was a screen in the back that looked like the desert. Then, let's get some animals. We had a longhorn buffalo that came up on hydraulic lifts before and at the closing of the show – you don't want it up there during the show. Bad idea. Javelina [skunk pigs], which are mean little guys. And a coupla rattlesnakes in a Plexiglass dome. You could put your foot on top of that glass.\"\n\nThis was 1976, and the Worldwide Texas Tour, one of the greatest follies in rock history. \"There were six or eight semi-tractor trailers to carry the gear and they were painted in a desert scene, and they were done in order,\" Hill continues. \"They had to travel down the highway in a certain order so the scene went from one to another.\"\n\nWhen Hill says the tour \"cost us\", he's not exaggerating. The cost of caring for the animals alone was reportedly $140,000 (£88,000). And then there was the further problem of trying to play for audiences outside the US. \"We were trying to take it to Europe,\" Hill says, \"but the quarantine laws hooked us.\"\n\nHe reflects for a moment, inscrutable behind his shades, before observing, gently: \"If we ever have a problem, it's not comin' up with ideas. It's stoppin' us.\"\n\nThere may well be plenty of people for whom the notion that ZZ Top are a band of ideas is as ridiculous as calling Skrillex one of our more sensitive singer-songwriters. Are the Texan trio not just the American answer to Status Quo? The band with two members with beards and – get this – one without, but it doesn't matter because his name is Beard?\n\nWell, maybe. But there's a whole lot more to ZZ Top. Actually, how's about this for a notion: ZZ Top are in fact an absurdist modern art project whose chosen medium is the 12-bar blues. \"I like that,\" says Billy F Gibbons, singer, guitarist, and other beard (gingerish, rather than greying like Hill's). \"Jim Dickinson, our favourite crazed record producer out of the Memphis area, called me aside and he said: 'Yeah, ZZ Top. You're like the Dalí of the Delta.' I'll take that. A high compliment in my esteem.\"\n\nThe absurdism is there in ZZ Top's obsession with the ephemera of US pop culture: the Cheap Sunglasses and TV Dinners of their songs. It's there in the matching stage uniforms. It's there in the music, too, in the way they started assimilating new-wave influences from 1979's Degüello album, in the way their comeback single earlier this year was a cover of a Houston hip-hop song. It's there in their surrealist approach to the world (when Gibbons was once asked why their 1983 smash-hit album Eliminator was their first record without a Spanish title, he explained it was in fact called El Iminator).\n\nMost of all, the absurdism is there in Gibbons – whose every word appears to be the setup to an elaborate practical joke that he may or may not choose to follow through with. Even his dressing-room table backstage at Merriweather Post Pavilion in suburban Maryland – where ZZ Top are playing a festival date at the personal request of headliner Jack White – has its concession to oddness: a personalised memo pad headed: \"BFG. Friend of Eric Clapton.\"\n\n\"It was kind of a prank,\" Gibbons says. \"I went in to get a business card printed up at the local Kinko's. And when I came to collect it they showed me the sample, and said: 'Shall we run with it? Do you approve?' I said: 'I'll take it.' OK. That's Joke No 1.\"\n\nJoke No 2 begins with Gibbons being asked to record a part for a solo record by Sam Moore, and leaving his card on the mixing desk in case he was required to return – not knowing Clapton was due in the studio the next day. \"Fast-forward to Eric's seven nights at the Royal Albert Hall. His minder tracked me down and said: 'Eric would like to see you.' I saw the show. On the exit, he said: 'We're going to see Eric.' Fine. Go down to the bowels of the Royal Albert Hall, there was a small door, and one small sofa, and Eric was sitting there. He said: 'I have two requests. I understand the Gibson guitar company is making a tribute to your famous Sunburst. Can you get me in the queue to get one?' 'I'm pretty sure. And what's the second request?' 'Can I have one of your business cards?' Busted!\" He laughs delightedly.\n\nGibbons is steeped in the blues – brought to him by Big Stella, the housekeeper at his childhood home in Houston – but also in art. When ZZ Top were on hiatus in the late 1970s, before Degüello, he went to Paris to pursue it. \"I had some buddies from Houston that had started this consortium of new-day surrealism – more than just a tip of the hat to the Dada guys. We were doing Xerox art and it was not so great, but the effect … If you took an image and then printed it out and then re-imaged that, the more generations you did the degradations started to set in. It was real vivid. From a technical standpoint it was just degradation, but from an artistic standpoint it was an enrichment of a visual experience.\"\n\nHe set himself the challenge of bringing that same combination of degradation and enrichment to the blues. Then punk came along and offered him the means to do so, though not without help from Sir Freddie Laker. In September 1977, Laker launched his Skytrain – a budget-priced flight between New York and Gatwick. When Gibbons saw the flights were launching for $99, he resolved to take his English father and Irish mother to the British Isles. \"So we go and we drop down when this punk explosion was happening,\" he says. \"One thing I can assure you: I remain open to the effects of the energy events. That really got my attention. The anger and the angst did not allow anything more than: 'I don't have time to practise too long, I'm just gonna give it to ya like I got it.'\"\n\nReturning to the South, he realised he wasn't the only one who had noticed. Over in Georgia, the B-52s were presenting a kitschy, Dayglo version of American pop culture inspired by punk, and he decided to respond. \"They had the song Rock Lobster, and Party on the Patio was: \"You think you can get punky? We're gonna get punky!\" In truth, the music ZZ Top started making at this time was not awfully punky – though it could be tinny, occasionally tuneless and very, very odd – but it locates precisely the point at which ZZ Top's songs embraced subjects besides beer drinkin', hell raisin', brothels and bad women – that's how punk liberated them.\n\nThe obsession with the detritus of American life, Gibbons says, gave the band their real voice: finally, they weren't imitators or copyists. As he puts it, finding their own subject matter enabled them to be blues musicians without the carping about them being white and never having picked cotton. \"I knew it was OK because there was no way ZZ Top would lose their blues.\"\n\nThe blues came early into the lives of both Hill and Gibbons, in Dallas and Houston respectively. \"My mother listened to blues records when I was a small child,\" Hill remembers. \"Back then, without sounding so ancient, kids would go to each others' houses, bring some records to play. And I'd bring Muddy Waters or Son House or something, and the parents of these other kids would almost freak out: 'What the fuck are you bringing here?' Whoa! I thought everybody had these records, because that's what I had.\"\n\n\"A few nights a week we'd get to go down to stay with Big Stella in her house,\" Gibbons says. \"She had four kids – there was, ironically, Little Stella, Dorothy, Minnie and Johnny, and then my younger sister Pam and I. And Big Stella would often be tuckered out and gone to sleep by 8.30, 9 o'clock. Little Stella would grab my sister and I and walk us down to the corner where there was a little juke joint. I say a little juke joint – it was owned by Don Robey. Don Robey was the black entrepreneur that had Duke Records, Peacock Records, he owned the Bronze Peacock, the El Dorado Ballroom, the Buffalo Booking Agency. Suffice it to say that that was the start, because it spawned the interest. And I had the immediacy. When I was six years old I saw Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf, some of the giants.\"\n\nThe turning point for Gibbons, though, was seeing Elvis in his glorious, Brylcreemed pomp. \"My mom took my younger sister and I to see Elvis in Houston in 1956. It was one of these big showcase shows. Brenda Lee was on the bill. Elvis by this time had topped up. Texas was a big starting point for Elvis and fortunately my mom was a fan and we got to go see it. And I was like: 'That's it.'\"\n\nBoth Gibbons and Hill started playing music young, too. Gibbons was a member of a psychedelic band called the Moving Sidewalks, whose song 99th Floor is one of the enduring classics of the garage punk boom. Hill and Beard joined the American Blues, whose gimmick was dyeing their hair blue. But in a state as conservative as Texas, being part of the underground wasn't a passport to acceptance. \"Being a musician in Texas had its own set of risks ,\" says Hill, perhaps remembering their contemporary Roky Erickson of the 13th Floor Elevators, who ended up institutionalised. \"In the 60s in Texas. I got probably less shit about having blue hair than about having long hair, because I believe they thought I was crazy.\"\n\nGibbons is an odd thinker, darting off on tangents in his easy drawl, speaking softly and so slowly that his words appear weighted with import. It's only when reading them back that one realises quite how bonkers some of what he says sounds. For instance, a question about whether hip-hop is the modern blues sees him asserting the world will undergo a fundamental change in 2024. \"There will be scientifically acknowledgeable events comparable to the appearance of language or the appearance of life,\" he says. \"We're already starting to see it: chemical control of ageing, artificial eyesight for the blind. We're racing toward this moment when all that is knowable becomes known. The delivery mechanism? What will it be? A blinding flash of lightning? Or does everyone drink a sip of water at the same time? Does everybody hit the return key? But I'm getting a little esoteric here. Back to the blues, please.\"\n\nI have no idea if he believe this. He conveys it with absolute solemnity, but maybe he's having me on, testing my credulity. A couple of times he brings up emails on his Macbook to show me pictures – a photo Jeff Beck has sent over of a vintage car he has rebuilt; the Rolling Stones' 1972 lightshow, an inspiration to the current Top stage set – and asks that I pause my recorder, as if it might somehow be able to absorb the contents of his computer by digital osmosis. But he's diligent, too – after an hour he asks to stop the interview, and whisks me to the side of the stage to watch the end of Jack White's set. It's an \"is this really happening?\" moment, watching White play Seven Nation Army from a few feet away, standing alongside this totem of American rock, yet it leads me to fear the interview will not resume. But no, once White has finished we stalk back to the tour bus and carry on, as if the interruption had never happened.\n\nGibbons's unexpected way of viewing the world, though, has paid dividends. Take Eliminator, the album that made ZZ Top the most unlikely superstars in the MTV firmament back in the 80s. It sounds like a band making a calculated attempt to crack the mainstream, with its smooth, shiny finish, its beats processed to metronomic perfection, its hooks sharpened and placed front and centre. In part, it was the result of Gibbons's exposure to UK synth bands such as Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark and Depeche Mode. And in part it was a product of Gibbons's personal quest to discover perfect time.\n\n\"Midi was invented and all these instruments were talking to each other, and you could make this one the slave to this one. The crack in the code was the fact that the drum machine introduced for the first time to the listening ear close-to-perfect time, which had been the aspiration of musicians since the invention of the metronome,\" he says.\n\n\"So we didn't abandon the blues backdrop. We kept a rock focus. But all of a sudden we're paying attention to good timing, good tuning. Simple.\n\nEarlier this year, ZZ Top released their first album for nine years. La Futura is the rarest of things from a veteran band – a record that stands among the best they've done. Its guitars roar and growl, Gibbons's voice a toxic gargle in counter to Hill's higher, truer yell. And it begins with the year's most unlikely cover version: I Gotsta Get Paid, a version of DJ DMD's crack-dealing hip-hop anthem 25 Lighters. As with so many things in ZZ Top's career, it owes as much to chance as to design.\n\nThey were short one song as the sessions for La Futura came to an end. Gibbons cast his mind back to 1996, when the band's studio was being refurbished and instead they were recording in a place used by the local hip-hop crews. \"There was three rooms – Studio A on the left, Studio B on the far right, connected by the collective chillout lounge. And that's where it all started to break the ice. The hip-hop guys wanted to know: 'Hey, how do you do this guitar stuff?' But we wanted to know: 'Well, how do you program this drum? We like the backbeats!' I became transfixed on that one track 25 Lighters. Fast-forward to the last promised track deliverable to round out La Futura. I'm sittin' there talkin' about the good ol' days with the engineers, G Moon and Joe Hardy, and I said: 'You remember that 25 Lighters? Man, that thing has been driving me nuts.' Well, Mr Moon was watching some Lightnin' Hopkins videos on YouTube and as luck would have it, the two energies came together. Simple, to the point. No, we're not going to be a rap or hip-hop group by any stretch of the imagination. What we do is, we're gonna make it ZZ Top. Bluesy, yeah. But it's all Houston ghetto.\"\n\nNext week, ZZ Top's 43-year stint as one of the world's most recognisable rock'n'roll bands will be honoured in London, when they pick up the Living Legends gong at the Classic Rock Magazine awards. Watching them on stage in Maryland, you see the affection in which they are held by very different groups of people of very different ages. The men the same age as them whoop for early blues like Waitin' for the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago; there are twentysomethings punching the air to the big hits from Eliminator – Gimme All Your Lovin', Legs and Sharp Dressed Man. There are hipsters getting down to I Gotsta Get Paid. They are loved. There's even a cheer when drummer Frank Beard's dog Gizzmo runs onstage at the end of the set (he has his own set-up in the dressing room, complete with skull-and-crossbones water bowl) and scampers about the amps.\n\n\"If there are people who admire us and what we do, that's a huge compliment,\" Hill says. \"As long as it doesn't get too crazy. People are all the time telling me stories: they named their son after me, or more than likely their dog. Or they got a tattoo. Or had their first sexual encounter when a song of ours was playing. Thank you for the compliment, I really wish I had been there.\"",

  "latent_32021": "Julian Togelius has an idea about where open-world games are going. Let's call it the infinite world theory. In his version of the future, titles like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto will have no set missions or narrative arcs, and no pre-defined landscapes. Instead, the game engine will use procedural generation, artificial intelligence and creative computing techniques to dynamically build environments and experiences to suit every individual player. In the Togelius infinite world, you'll be able to drive a car in one direction for several miles and find that the game has built a city at the end of the journey, just for you. What's more, that city will be populated with characters who act like real humans rather than bizarre automatons. It will be the player's interactions with these characters that creates the stories.\n\nAlthough this sounds like science fiction, Julian Togelius is a university professor who has spent the last five years researching the concept of procedurally generated content in games. His infinite world theory is not a fantastical dream, it's a distinct possibility. \"[Procedurally] creating new environments, including things such as mountains, vegetation, houses, etc, is pretty straightforward,\" he says. \"There are out-of-the-box solutions available to all of these problems individually. It's just a matter of integrating them and putting in the adaptivity. This would provide a big increase in perceived freedom, but it would also enable the game to adapt to the player, to create environments that it thinks the player wants...\"\n\nIt's a good time to be thinking about this sort of stuff. This week, EA announced that it is working on a big open-world action project, hiring Assassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond to oversee the studio. \"We've never really operated in the largest genre of gaming,\" said the company's chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen. \"That's the Assassin's Creed-style games; more open-world, more single-player versus multiplayer.\"\n\nBut you have to ask, where can EA go with this? Big names like Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed and Witcher have taken the current formula just about as far as they can. All offer a central narrative told through a sequence of story missions, all supplement this with an explorable landscape and discoverable side-quests. This is how the open-world genre has worked for a decade.\n\nBut the cracks are showing, and the key problem is asset generation. As games get bigger and more ambitious, developers need exponentially larger teams to write the stories, script every encounter and design every building, object and vehicle in the universe. Eventually, this approach will drive development costs so high, the genre will collapse in on itself.\n\nMichael Cook, a computational creativity researcher at Goldsmiths University has been thinking about this problem for a number of years. In 2011, he began development of ANGELINA, a computer program capable of designing its own games using assets drawn from image search engines. He thinks the future of this genre is about handing creative power to the machine itself. \"The most crucial thing I think open worlds need to do is back off the brink of total scripting and hand-design,\" he says. \"There has always been a tension between handcrafted missions and wild systems that let you invent magic or manipulate local politics. In my opinion, the systems are what bring open world games to life. Games where everything is scripted and static are only possible because the teams are so large and so efficient at making them - but we can't do this forever, and I don't think it'll lead us towards the next generation of open worlds. We need to build more systems in our games, things that players can interact with and break.\"\n\nWe're already seeing moves toward automated and reactive design in games. With Left 4 Dead, for example, Valve introduced the concept of an AI director which altered the intensity and style of zombie attacks based on player activities; for Skyrim, Bethesda created the Radiant quest system, which generated simple tasks based on player location and enemy types. Meanwhile, games like Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress and the forthcoming No Man's Sky have all used procedural generation to construct unique environments - and middleware packages like SpeedTree allow studios to generate areas of terrain without having to draw every last piece of foliage.\n\nWhat these systems don't do, however, is give you the impression of a creative intelligence working behind the scenes to join all the dots and create complex new experiences - they're just limbs operating without a brain. How can we make an open-world game that looks like it is really responding to, and learning from, the player?\n\nTen years ago Jeff Orkin was a coder at Monolith Productions, masterminding the revolutionary AI systems behind games like No One Lives Forever and F.E.A.R. Later, he completed a PhD at MIT, looking into the concept of crowd-sourcing data for AI systems; in other words, he wanted to get computers to watch people play a game and then learn from what they did, using that knowledge to make interesting reactive non-player characters.\n\n\"Open world games are all about player stories; they're about having players walk away with memorable moments, caused by their own decisions and actions,\" he says. \"For example, last year's Shadow of Mordor did a great job of producing memorable moments through their Nemesis system, which created randomised enemies with a memory of past encounters with the player that they could vocalise in their taunts. This is a step in the right direction. Contextual dialogue ties events together, and explains to the player what the NPCs are thinking, and how decisions made in previous encounters have led to the current situation. However, giving every NPC the ability to dynamically voice contextual dialogue is an intractable problem in an open-world game.\"\n\nBut Orkin thinks he has a solution. In his PhD project, The Restaurant Game, he asked 16,000 people to download and play a simple game in which a customer goes for a meal and is served by a waitress; at first he asked participants to play as either the diner or the server and just improvise a meal scenario - all the while, the computer was analysing and recording their actions and behaviours. Several thousand games later, Orkin was able to replace the waitress with an AI, equipped with a database of reactions drawn from those thousands of playthroughs. The result was a computer controlled character seemingly able to learn, adapt and behave like a real person.\n\nIn 2013 Orkin founded a new company, GiantOtter, where he and several veteran AI coders gradually refined the system into a new crowd-sourcing AI platform called GroupPlay, which the company is set to make available to development studios working on narrative games. During development, the team recruited testers to play a series of short RPG mini-games while improvising their own dialogue and interactions with the game world - all of this was recorded and added to a database of conversations and actions which could then be made available to NPCs. As Orkin explains, \"by recording several gameplay sessions of each scenario, cross referencing them with other similar scenarios, and doing some tagging and clustering to associate semantic meta-data, we can generate a vast dialogue database to draw from depending on the context.\"\n\nSo let's say a game like Witcher implements GiantOtter's technology. The developer could spend a few weeks getting groups of designers and actors to play the game, mess about in the world, chat to each other, and then record all of that talk and action. These realistic experiences would then be stored in a database of discreet behaviours and dialogue segments, which would inform NPCs in the game. So when you, say, visit a blacksmith, whatever you say or do, even if you stand on his anvil and twirl your sword around your head, the AI will have a suitable response because a human tester, at some point in the past, will have already done that.\n\n\"The cool thing is that this approach does not only capture individual reactions, but entire conversations that can play out between multiple NPCs, breathing the illusion of intelligent life into the world,\" says Orkin. \"These conversations can be intertwined with other similar conversations to produce a nearly infinite variety of sequences for the player to overhear\".\n\nGiantOtter has already performed a pilot test of the tech with one of the major open world game developers (he can't way which), and the results were convincing. As Orkin explains, \"We got validation from designers that this kind of authoring via demonstration is actually a more natural way to express behavior and dialogue, as compared to trying to turn designers into programmers who have to encode branching gameplay logic, which often leads to brittle behavior when these scripted events are placed anywhere in an open world\". He also foresees a future of community contributed dialogue, with players able to record their own voice performances, which the GroupPlay system could add to the game. Want a minor character in GTA VI to sound and act like PewDiePie? That's unfortunately possible.\n\nSo, crowd-sourced dialogue and actions can be used to inform AI characters and make them more adaptable and naturalistic; can the same kind of idea be applied to whole stories? Mark Riedl heads up the Entertainment Intelligence Lab at the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing. For the past three years he's been working on a project named Scheherazade, a crowd-powered automated story generation system, which creates its own interactive fiction by studying groups of plot lines developed by humans. In one experiment his team asked dozens of volunteers to write their own very simple bank robbery story. Scheherazade then analysed every narrative, worked out common elements, and produced its own interactive bank robbery text adventure. Later, test subjects were shown two versions of the bank robbery interactive fiction: one written by Scheherazade and one by a human. Most subjects were unable to tell which was produced by the AI.\n\nRiedl's research is being funded by the US defence agency Darpa and the plan is to produce military simulations, based on the written experiences of veterans, which teach new soldiers how to, say, interact with civilians in unfamiliar countries. It takes a narrative designer many months to research and write dozens of different possible scenarios, but Scheherazade is able to keep generating new variations, simply by analysing reports filed by experienced military personnel. Riedl also sees the video game potential of the technology - one example he's given is a Star Wars RPG that creates endless narrative quests and subplots by reading online Star Wars fan fiction and working out common elements. Okay, you may end up with a lot of ewok/droid love affairs, but as Mass Effect has shown with its inter-species romances, people are totally down with that sort of thing.\n\nWhat both Orkin and Riedl are working toward then is a concept known as drama management, a program of interlocking AI systems that serve quests and narrative adventures to players - often via intelligent NPCs - within a dynamic open world. \"This is a growing and exciting area of research,\" says Cook. \"A lot of work is being done on making game worlds both rich and unpredictable, as well as making them more controllable by designers. At the Experimental AI for Games workshop this year we had a paper called 'Toward Characters Who Observe, Tell, Misremember, and Lie' by folks at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\"The paper's about a new AI framework that the researchers are using to make open-world narrative games about information and social relationships. Their game is called Talk Of The Town, and in it are hundreds of NPCs who know things about the town - where people live, where they work, when they were born, and so on. But just like the real world, these NPCs aren't perfect - they might forget what they know, or remember things wrongly, or they might have been lied to when they learned a piece of information. So when you're talking to people in the world, trying to discover what the locals know about someone, you have to think, is this person reliable? Do they have a reason to lie to me? Do they look like they know what they're talking about?\n\n\"For me this is a powerful new concept in AI systems - and it's a system, not a script. We're familiar with characters in games lying to us, but only when a writer or designer decides they should. This is a changing, malleable system that demands a new kind of thinking from players. Open world games are falling prey to over-scripting and over-design - they're more like really big closed worlds than truly open ones. We need these kinds of unpredictable and organic AI systems to add life back to our open world games.\"\n\nRiedl agrees that the future of open world games should not just about bigger environments and more detailed visuals, the future should also be about social dynamics. Right now, when you're in a location like Los Santos or Tamriel, you know you're the only inhabitant with agency - everyone else is either a mindless pedestrian cycling through limited set behaviours or a quest giver who has one pre-written speech to deliver. But a deeper system, combining the Nemesis concept with the Talk of the Town technology would provide a world filled with dynamic Machiavellian plotters. And that means a very different set of games.\n\n\"If NPCs possessed social reasoning, then open-ended action games can be about power dynamics,\" says Riedl. \"They may support strategies in which the player forges and betrays lasting relationships with NPCs instead of just shooting. Think of an interactive version of The Wire, House of Cards, or The Sopranos. These TV shows are about the weaving and unweaving of complex interpersonal relationships as a means to an end. This provides new, complex strategies that may complement the action-oriented aspects of the game. NPCs with innocuous beginnings could become regular companions, or grow into mortal enemies. An indication of success would be the player having a strong emotional response to the procedurally generated actions of an NPC, or to the betrayal or demise of a favourite character.\"\n\nFor Riedl one possible future for the open world game may be an experience that combines The Sims, which features lifelong ambition arcs, with something like Prom Week, the fascinating University of Santa Cruz project that simulates social interactions between students in the run up to their prom. The goal would be to produce characters that exhibit both short term and long term goals. Right now, he is using stories to teach computer characters how to behave believably - and also morally. By studying stories of simple human interactions such as going to a chemist to pick up a prescription, his program is discovering for itself certain acceptable and unacceptable behaviours.\n\nWhat all of these AI researchers agree on is that the future of open world game design is going to be less about lots of scripted stuff being fed to the player, and more about the player collaborating with the computer to create fresh, personal stories together. While at the University of Copenhagen, Julian Togelius and his students created a platformer named Super Mario Evolution, which would watch how each player explored the world, whether they preferred jumping around, running, or collecting objects, and then built new levels, on the fly, based on their preferences. \"The game is curious about you,\" he says.\"The game plays the player\".\n\nRemembering Dragon Age: Origins How Bioware brought the fantasy RPG into the 21st century.\n\nMichael Cook, meanwhile, has discussed developing two games: Murder and Mystery. In the first you play a guest at a Cluedo-style dinner party trying to assassinate the host. In Mystery you play a detective sent to investigate a murder. The idea is that an AI system would watch games of Murder to invent case files for Mystery.\n\n\"There's a lot of work being done to get AI to understand what the player wants and to have the AI either help or hinder those goals. Martin Cerny's Sarah And Sally is looking into how to solve the problem of AI companions in games, for example.\n\n\"But I think really good open world games should be like improv theatre - you do something dramatic, and the game thinks about what it can do to add the most drama, tragedy or comedy to the game. Grand Theft Auto shouldn't be about static missions that come one after another; it should be an improvised story that you and the game tell each other. We think about AI mostly as something that tries to stop us from winning. Really, we should be thinking about it as a friend who wants us to have as much fun as possible.\"\n\nSo, EA, if you're looking for ideas on how to advance the open-world genre rather than just apply the same old features to a new setting, the future is about crowd-sourced AI, about capturing player activity, and about stories that evolve around the individual participants. The future is collaboration between program and player, the former learning from the latter. But that won't be easy.\n\n\"I think co-creation research can be really helpful, but it's still early days,\" says Cook. \"Understanding what a human wants is as hard for AI as it is for other people\".",

This story is essentially true: I know both Ed and Eric, and neither denies it (although Eric, for reasons that will become apparent, never repeats it either).

He is otherwise in all respects a superior gamer, and I've spent many happy hours competing with and against him, as long as he is given enough time.\n\nSo, Eric was playing a Neutral Paladin (why should only Lawful Good religions get to have holy warriors was the thinking) in Ed's game. He even had a holy sword, which fought well, and did all those things holy swords are supposed to do, including detect good (random die roll; it could have detected evil). He was on some lord's lands when the following exchange occurred:\n\nED: You see a well groomed garden. In the middle, on a small hill, you see a gazebo.\n\nERIC: A gazebo? What color is it?\n\nED: (Pause) It's white, Eric.\n\nERIC: How far away is it?\n\nED: About fifty yards.\n\nERIC: How big is it?\n\nED: (Pause) It's about thirty feet across, fifteen feet high, with a pointed top.\n\nERIC: I use my sword to detect good on it.\n\nED: It's not good, Eric. It's a gazebo!\n\nERIC: (Pause) I call out to it.\n\nED: It won't answer. It's a gazebo!\n\nERIC: (Pause) I sheathe my sword and draw my bow and arrows. Does it respond in any way?\n\nED: No, Eric, it's a gazebo!\n\nERIC: I shoot it with my bow (roll to hit). What happened?\n\nED: There is now a gazebo with an arrow sticking out of it.\n\nERIC: (Pause) Wasn't it wounded?\n\nED: Of course not, Eric! It's a gazebo!\n\nERIC: (Whimper) But that was a plus three arrow!\n\nED: It's a gazebo, Eric, a gazebo! If you really want to try to destroy it, you could try to chop it with an axe, I suppose, or you could try to burn it, but I don't know why anybody would even try. It's a *)@#! gazebo!\n\nERIC: (Long pause. He has no axe or fire spells.) I run away.\n\nED: (Thoroughly frustrated) It's too late. You've woken up the gazebo, and it catches you and eats you.\n\nERIC: (Reaching for his dice) Maybe I'll roll up a fire-using mage so I can avenge my Paladin.\n\nAt this point, the increasingly amused fellow party members restored a modicum of order by explaining what a gazebo is. It is solely an afterthought, of course, but Eric is doubly lucky that the gazebo was not situated on a grassy gnoll...\n\n=============================================\n\nI should now probablyexplain that a gnoll is a monster straight outta the Fiend Folio...\n\n------------------\n\nI just had my car's alignment checked.

From my point of view that's what they're doing.\n\n\"I expect as a stakeholder club in the AFL - and I know that this is true from some of the other presidents that I've had communication with - we want parents of players and young players to know that it's not something that's going to be a standard part of our industry from time to time.\"\n\nThe seven-month drugs scandal exploded yesterday after the AFL chose to release its full list of charges against the Bombers.\n\nThe 34-page document revealed a litany of allegations detailing drug injections, substances brought back from China by a convicted drug dealer and claims of a health scare for Hird after he was injected with an exotic substance.\n\nEssendon described the move as an \"ambush\", and said a different set of charges had been presented to the club by the league in tense negotiations last week.\n\nHird, dressed in Essendon garb, emerged from his Toorak home this morning but was in no mood talk to a waiting media pack, offering a brief smile before he quickly drove away.\n\nThe list of charges states:\n\nPLAYERS may have been given banned performance-enhancing drug Thymosin Beta-4, among 15 substances administered.\n\nHIRD had suffered unspecified \"significant\" side-effects from drugs he injected in 2012.\n\nCLUB doctor Bruce Reid expressed his concern and frustration over the supplements regime in his missing letter to other club officials.\n\nHIRD was warned by an AFL integrity officer to avoid peptides.\n\nPLAYERS were to receive 1500 injections of AOD-9604 and a version of Thymosin and more than 16,500 doses of Colostrum and 8000 doses of Tribulus.\n\nAFL, Bombers head for legal showdown\n\n\"The AFL is determined to punish the Essendon Football Club, and four individuals personally, as though we were drug cheats,\" club chairman Paul Little said.\n\nDetailing the charges, AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou said: \"The Essendon Football Club and other parties will be given every reasonable opportunity to answer these charges. There has been no predetermination of this matter.\"\n\nOne club president told the Herald Sun he expected the league to seek club support in punishing the Bombers and, potentially, kicking them out of the finals.\n\nHird health scare claims\n\nLittle confirmed he would front the meeting.\n\nThe league is determined to resolve the dispute in a hearing before the AFL Commission.\n\nBut Hird's lawyers, acting with the support of the club, will today ask the Supreme Court to back the coach's demands for an independent hearing and the removal of AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou from any proceedings.\n\nmedia_camera Bombers coach James Hird told the media that AFL has ''continued its trial by media''. Picture: Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court statement of claim is also expected to detail the events of early February and the AFL's alleged involvement in the club's decision to \"self-report\" to the league and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority.\n\nWhat Little and Hird said in full\n\nThe AFL charged Essendon and its four officials - Hird, club doctor Bruce Reid, assistant coach Mark Thompson and footy boss Danny Corcoran - with bringing the game into disrepute 10 days ago over the 2012 supplements program.\n\nThe full text of Dr Reid's letter and supporting documentation relating to the possible use of banned drugs feature in the 34-page document released.\n\nEssendon also took aim at the AFL over claims a former member of the AFL's anti-doping tribunal was told in February that AOD-9604 was safe and not prohibited.\n\nDr Andrew Garnham, currently working as a consultant for Essendon, said scientific evidence showed AOD-9604 had minimal side-effects.\n\nDoc's letter reveals he was kept in dark\n\n\"That the AFL has known this for six months but let questions hang over the head of the club and most unforgivably our players, is reprehensible,\" Little said.\n\nASADA maintained it had never approved the use of AOD-9604.\n\nA defiant Hird said: \"The AFL today continued its trial by media of me. We only received notification minutes before the AFL charges were made public.\n\n\"The announcement by ambush confirms the AFL is running an agenda, which again calls into question its impartiality.\"\n\nDemetriou said the charges were only alleged, and that Essendon and its officials, had \"every opportunity\" to defend themselves.\n\nAFL knew about AOD-9604\n\nWatch 24/7 coverage on Fox with news+\n\nReplay Ando's chat below (On a mobile device?
