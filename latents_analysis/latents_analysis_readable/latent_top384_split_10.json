  "latent_37": "By Anthony Cordesman\n\nAugust 28, 2017\n\nTerrorism has become one of the dominating national security threats of the 21st century. It is also one of the most complex — mixing the actions of states, extremists, and other non-state actors in a wide range of threats and types of conflicts. Terrorists range from individuals carrying out scattered terrorist acts, to international terrorist networks of non-state actors, to state terrorism including the use of conventional forces and poison gas to terrorize portions of a civil population. Terrorism has also become a key aspect of civil war, insurgency/counterinsurgency, and asymmetric warfare, as well as ideological, ethnic, and religious warfare.\n\nThere is no easy way to categorize the resulting patterns of violence, to measure their rise, or to set national security priorities. For more than a decade, the U.S. has focused on the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it has dealt increasingly with the expansion of the threat into North Africa, other parts of the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world. Key warfighting threats like the Islamic State and its affiliates, and the Taliban and Haqqani Network, are only a comparatively small part of the rising threat in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.\n\nIt is clear from the current trends in other regions that the threat of religious extremism may soon expand rapidly into the rest of Asia, and there are many other causes of terrorism in Africa, Europe, Latin America, the United States. Terrorism is often heavily driven by ideology, but it also is often a reaction to major shifts in population, ethnic and sectarian tensions, failed and corrupt governance, and the failure to broadly develop a given economy and offer employment and a future. No area is immune to the threat, and internal instability can drive terrorism anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Burke Chair at CSIS has made major revisions and updates to its graphic overview of these trends as of the end of 2016. It traces the patterns since 1970, and focuses on the period from 2011-2016 — the years since the sudden rise of massive political instability and extremism in the MENA region. It covers global, regional, and key national trends and compares different estimates and sources for 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe report draws primarily on reporting in the START database, but uses other reporting from sources like EU/Europol, IHS Jane's, and the IEP to illustrate different estimates, different perspectives, and the uncertainties in the data.\n\nThe full report is entitled Global Trends in Terrorism Through 2016, and is now available on the CSIS web site at https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/170828_global_terrorism_update_0.pdf?cGXk7lPZWBjWdjmuwfqQlOdr.MwyX5by.\n\nA separate Executive Summary is also available which describes the key contents and conclusions of the report. It too is available on the CSIS web site at https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/170828_exec_summary_0.pdf?o8kn_MPl_a.I28khE4CdmsLpFzygXaSl.\n\nThe Contents of the Full Report\n\nThe full report shows key trends largely in graphic and metric form. It includes several hundred detailed maps, tables, and graphics. These data and metrics are organized according to the following table of contents:\n\nThe report is necessarily complex. It does show that there is value in looking at global trends, but makes it clear that many key trends are largely regional, and must be examined on a regional basis. It also provides key country-by-country breaks out to show that the driving factors shaping the nature of terrorism in any given case are usually national. International networks certainly play a key role, as do factors like religion and culture, but the forms terrorism take normally differ sharply even between neighboring countries.\n\nKey Uncertainties and Problems in the Data\n\nThe report also must be detailed to properly highlight the differences and uncertainties in much of the data. There often are sharp differences in the most basic summary data, even between two highly respected sources like START and IHS Jane's. These differences do not reflect failures in the analytic efforts of the sources shown. They reflect differences that are inevitable in their need to rely on open source material, the lack of any clear definition of terrorism, the problems in measuring and displaying uncertainty, and the need to guess and extrapolate where key data are missing.\n\nIt does not attempt to provide the supporting narrative that is critical to fully understanding these trends, nor to list all the many qualifications made by the sources used regarding the limits of their models and data. These are areas where the reader must consult the original sources directly — along with a wide range of narrative material and other sources — to fully understand the trends that are displayed.\n\nThe final section of the full report highlights these problems in more detail, but key problems I include:\n\nNo agreed definition of terrorism, or how to define or measure any key metric.\n\nReliance on media sources or unstated sources, cancelation of NCTC and all official U.S. public reporting on trends and data with only the EU and Europol providing detailed and credible official estimates.\n\nRadical differences in level of reporting by region, and a lack of credible data in Central and East Asia.\n\nNo reporting on state terrorism, and ignoring large scale killing of civilians in countries like Syria.\n\nFailure to report ranges in many key areas of large-scale uncertainty – particularly in terms of how terrorist incidents are defined and counted, and data on targets, perpetrators, and casualties.\n\nFailure to clearly distinguish between insurgency and terrorism — a key problem in every state where there is some form of active civil conflict.\n\nLabeling of asymmetric threats and enemies as \"terrorist\" for political purposes, regardless of the real character of the fighting or actions involved and methods of attack.\n\nFailure to distinguish ethnicity, sect, tribe, and other key data driving the patterns of terrorism.\n\nConstant changes in method of analysis and reporting, and unclear historical comparability of data shown.\n\nLack of clear handling of hate crimes in collecting terrorism data.\n\nFocus on ideology and religion rather than the full range of causes of terrorism.\n\nDifferent definitions and listing of perpetrators, and very different counts and characterization of perpetrator actions – compounded by the lack of clear definitions of terrorist versus insurgent actions. Lack of clear methods for reporting attacks and incidents where perpetrators cannot be identified.\n\nSerious limitations to the search and graphing functions of given databases – e.g. inability to search for perpetrators in each country or region, or get totals or a range for casualties.\n\nThe START database and the statistical annex to the State Department Country Reports on Terrorism do provide a long list of caveats about the definitions used and the uncertainties in the data, and that the START data offer three levels of confidence. These caveats are not reported in detail in the report to limit its length and the START data presented only show the high START estimate of terrorism and perpetrator threats.\n\nLike the previous list of uncertainties, they reinforce another key conclusion that should be drawn from the full analysis. An accurate understanding of terrorism cannot be built up out of open source data. There is a clear need to find some way to bring the full resources of the U.S. government to bear on providing more accurate and reliable data in declassified form.\n\nAnother key conclusion is that analyses which ignore the gross levels of uncertainty and the conflicts in the information provided in the different sets of open source data now available, are likely to have little legitimacy and be more misleading than useful.",
  "latent_110": "Intel Core i7 4790 tested - The 4770 revisited ?\n\nThe Haswell refresh is officially here and as such today we review the all new Intel Core i7 4790 processor. Join us as we look at the performance of this CPU in a wide variety of benchmark, will it be noticeably faster then say a Core i7 4770 ? Well today we will seek & find an answer to that. As you guys know Z97 and the Intel refresh of their Haswell processors has been anything from a well-kept secret, up-to the tiniest little details have spread on the web. Today the 11th of May 2014 however is the official date for the desktop side of the launch. This month a number of things are going to happen. You'll notice the new Haswell based processors, mostly all of them merely have a small 100/200 MHz clock frequency increment for a tiny boost in performance. However you'll notice an extensive wave of H97/Z97 motherboard releases as the manufacturers are releasing some really cool stuff alright. And then roughly in the Computex timeframe you are going to see releases of the K series Core i7 and i5 processors. These will be interesting for the performance mongers amongs us, the overlocker processors. The upcoming K model processors have been developed under code-name Devil's Canyon. They have an improved heatspreader & thermal insulation material in that CPU package that is going to cool these processors much better once you pump extra volts in them. But that is for a later article, of course, as the processors announced today are all non-K models.\n\nSo what is being released today processors wise ? Well, basically the entire existing Core processor lineup will receive small incremental clock frequency increases. These are as big as say 100 to 200 MHz. Other then that it is the very same Haswell processor that you might already have inside your system. On the desktop side you will see a new non-K flagship CPU, the 3.6 GHz Core i7-4790, this is the processor being tested today in this article. But also some low power variations of it (the 65 W TPD 4790S and the 45 W 4790T are being released). There are a dozen new Core i5 processors as well. As you guys know Haswell is a hint faster over the last generation (Ivy Bridge), not heaps though. Intel is facing the same problem that AMD stumbled into with their FX series processors. Injecting more and more transistors into a 22nm die will further complicate things. Next to that, the PC market has been changing and Intel is adapting to that. We see much smaller form factor computers including everything from a HTPC, to a small desktop PC to the latest tablets and upcoming detachable solutions. And as such, Intel's focus was to design an architecture that on the desktop side would make it the fastest four-core processors, yet also needed to be more energy efficient and offer a faster graphics solution for their mobile and tablet segment. That compromise my friends, is Haswell. Slowly but steadily processors get more and more features embedded; processor, graphics, chipset features, memory controllers and now also voltage regulation. As such it is safe to state that with Haswell, desktop processors really are SoC (system on a chip) parts as well. Haswell is a family of processors that use a 22nm FinFET process, opposed to Ivy Bridge which might have been the first family of 22nm products, but really was a die shrink of the 32nm Sandy Bridge, and not so much a new revolutionary design. For the desktop platform there will be one line that describes Haswell best, the Haswell architecture will be a small step forward in performance, a big step in IGP performance and a (positive) step down in power consumption, all are good things.\n\nMost of the reader-base of Guru3D are the hardcore gamers that build their own PCs, so today a review on the flagship Haswell architecture based Core i7 4790. Unfortunately it is a non-K model, meaning chances of overclocking at close to NIL. We'll first take you through the architecture, the new features and then we'll start up the performance tests. Have a peek at what will be tested, and then let's head on-wards to the next page.",
  "latent_141": "Before diving into the results of our recent “Make Priest Great Again” card design competition, we wanted to give a bit of a background on how the process of narrowing down the avalanche of entries worked. First, PC Gamer’s Tim Clark talks about narrowing the field, then Simon “Sottle” Welch explains how he went about picking the runners up and overall winner. On the next slide, see the first runner up with commentary from Sottle.\n\nTim: As Anduin would say: Wow! I can’t remember a response to a competition quite like this. Within the first 24 hours we’d received over 2,000 entries, and they kept coming, from all over the world, for the rest of the week. (Shout out to the incredible number of emails from Korea I got every night.) Many entries were accompanied by hundreds of words of text, and one person sent an album containing 100 card ideas. In the end it took three of us to distill them down to a list of several hundred for Sottle to look at. Thank you so much for all your effort. I hope Blizzard takes note, and even considers running some kind of community challenge of its own.\n\nFrom the entries several key themes soon emerged. 1) People really want to experiment more with Shadowform. 2) They also actually want to make Silence Priest work somehow. 3) A ton of people would like a Tyrande Whisperwind legendary that allows overhealing and/or giving Anduin a health cap of 50. When picking the cards to send Sottle, we tried to avoid ideas Blizzard were unlikely to ever implement. So Priest weapons and Druid Choose One effects were frowned on, as was cheap card draw or insanely cheap AoE spells.\n\nAlso, a lot of the cards were very similar—I lost count of the number of versions of “Discover a Shadow Word card”—so, where that was the case, we kept the one with the most lucid text and best art. On the subject of art, we should have been clearer about using existing Blizzard stuff. So if you see an image you created that you’d like credited or replaced, please let me know and we’ll be happy to do so. Finally, respect to the person who just sent in Ragnaros, Lightlord with no changes. Now over to Sottle...\n\nSottle: Judging from the sheer volume of submissions, it seems apparent that many of you care deeply about making Priest great again. The weight of all the entries we received meant that I needed to enlist help to overcome the gargantuan task of sorting the pure from the tainted. Who better to join me on this journey of holy discovery than Torpedo Gaming’s Ness (Priest stalwart, Insomnia Truesilver winner) and Relapse Gaming’s TicTac (Rank 1 Legend finisher in the July Season).\n\nMany entries were dumped in the discard pile immediately; the ludicrously overpowered board nukes, the comically overstatted minions, and the seemingly never ending supply of Purify memes, but other entries were also discarded due to few basic ground rules:\n\n-Nothing that just dies to Fiery War Axe without having significant upside.\n\n-Nothing that requires specific synergies to be at all useful.\n\n-Purely reactive cards better be really damn good.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we narrowed the list down to one winner and nine notable mentions that we have provided for your viewing pleasure.",
  "latent_212": "Minnesota college painted midfield logo at 45-yard line (PHOTO)\n\nLogo painted five yards off at Minnesota school. (Photo: @C_Vogler18 via Larry Brown Sports)\n\nThis is Ed Widseth Field at the University of Minnesota, Crookston, a tiny Division II school in the northern part of the state.\n\nNotice how the school's logo looks like it was assessed a five-yard penalty for encroachment. Instead of having the maroon and gold \"M\" at midfield, it was accidentally painted on the 45-yard line.\n\nThe team's quarterback, Chase Vogler, tweeted a picture of the error, which was then posted by Larry Brown Sports.\n\nShawn Smith, the school's sports information director, tells Dr. Saturday that the logo was painted before the yard lines and yardage numbers, which caused an obvious problem. The painting was done by students before last week's homecoming game against Southwest Minnesota State.\n\n\"I think the initial reaction was like, well that isn't right and everyone had a nice little laugh,\" Smith told the site.\n\nThe team kept the logo and won the game, 33-28. It was the Golden Eagles' first victory of the year after previous losses of 61-0 and 58-6 . I'm not saying Crookston should keep the off-center logo but, yeah, they should totally keep the off-center logo.\n\nIn unrelated news, NFL replacement refs found no problem with the paint job.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/OSmale",
  "latent_232": "Photo\n\nWould you have any interest in speaking to Paul McCartney about the Grammy Award he won on Sunday, a publicist asked over e-mail the other day. O.K., O.K., twist our arms, why don’t you?\n\nMr. McCartney won the Grammy for traditional pop album for “Kisses on the Bottom,” a collection of his covers of standards like “It’s Only a Paper Moon” and “Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” as well as new songs like “My Valentine,” which he wrote for his wife, Nancy Shevell. It is one of at least a few distinctions Mr. McCartney has received in a career that includes numerous solo offerings, several albums with Wings and, before that, his records made with a pop quartet called the Beatles.\n\nMr. McCartney spoke from Britain about his Grammy victory and why, by design, he wasn’t at this year’s ceremony. The conversation (excerpts below) began just before 7 a.m. Friday morning, when an unlisted phone number appeared on this reporter’s cell phone and a voice responded, “Hello, David.”\n\nQ.\n\nIs this who I think it is?\n\nA.\n\nYeah, sorry, this is Paul. Yeah, Paul McCartney.\n\nQ.\n\n[after ecstatic laughter] Good morning, how are you?\n\nA.\n\nYou’re in a jolly mood this morning. I’m very well, thank you. How can I help you?\n\nQ.\n\nSo you’ve just won another Grammy Award. Don’t you ever get tired of these things?\n\nA.\n\nNope. You don’t get tired. It’s very nice. And the Grammys have become more and more important, media-wise. It’s a bigger, better show. When you look at all the people in the musical field who are up for them, it’s gratifying to think that you’ve picked one up.\n\nQ.\n\nIt’s been reported that this is your first Grammy for an album of new recordings since “Let It Be.” [Mr. McCartney has also since won Grammys for individual songs, and the “Band on the Run” album won a Grammy for its engineer, Geoff Emerick.] Does that sound right to you?\n\nA.\n\nYou know what? I don’t keep count. I’m the worst on facts about me or facts about the Beatles. It’s like, “It’s 50 years to the day–” And I go, “Oh is it?” What am I supposed to do? Keep a little diary and watch every little event? So, no, I’m always pleasantly surprised at these facts or these fictions. I can’t help you on that. I’m sure there’s a million experts who could verify that. It’s nice, because I don’t have to keep track. There’s a lot of other people who keep track for me. It’s a luxury.\n\nQ.\n\nI imagine it must be gratifying to be recognized for this album in particular, which was such a departure for you.\n\nA.\n\nIt is a completely different kind of album. I’m very pleased, also, for the producer, Tommy LiPuma, and Al Schmitt, the engineer, they’re such cool guys, very old school. And we had such a ball with Diana Krall. There was a moment in the studio where we were struggling with an intro, I think – although I must say, we didn’t struggle too much on this album – but it wasn’t like it was all charted. We just had the chords and the words, and we did pretty much improvisations. And there was a moment where we were struggling with an intro – should it be this or should we open like this? And Diana was looking a little bit worried. And I said, “Diana, look. I’m from Britain and I’m in L.A., the sun is shining, I’m in Capitol’s famous Studio A where Nat King Cole recorded. Diana, I’m on holiday.”\n\nQ.\n\nThe victory is its own reward, of course, but you weren’t at the Grammys ceremony this year. Why not?\n\nA.\n\nWe started to get a theory that when you don’t go, that’s when you win. But Nancy likes the event, and I do too, because she does. In some ways, it’s better than the Oscars – the Oscars are great and super-important, but the Grammys is like a really cool concert and you get some very good performances. But this is what happens: We went a couple of times and sort of sat there, and graciously accepted defeat. With that moment you look for at the Oscars or the Grammys, when the cameras go to the people who didn’t win, and they’re smiling wonderfully and applauding. “And the winner is – John Mayer!” And you go: [through clenched teeth] “Oh, wonderful. How wonderful. What a good singer.” Secretly you’re thinking, “He’s not as good as me though.” It’s a very human moment.\n\nThis year I was actually presenting at the Baftas, they’d asked me to present a film music award that night. And then coming home from that, I got a text saying “You’ve won a Grammy.” So the car was alight with triumph. Hence the theory, you mustn’t go if you want to win. But having said that, we might go next year.\n\nQ.\n\nDo you have one place where you keep all your awards and trophies?\n\nA.\n\nNo, I don’t. I’m particularly lax on that. I don’t know where they all are. I’m just not organized. I said to someone the other day, “Would you believe the Beatles were up for an Oscar, for ‘Let It Be,’ and we didn’t even know we were up for it?”\n\nQ.\n\nIs that even possible?\n\nA.\n\nWell, exactly. In those days, it was. Because it was less of a global ceremony. And the Beatles were very much in a – “Let It Be” was the time that we were breaking up, so the news had not reached us. If you take that as indication, how unconcerned – how unplugged – we just weren’t plugged into that. Nowadays it’s very hard to avoid it. I don’t think any of us ever collected all of our gold discs, to put them up on walls. So I don’t have a trophy room. Some of them go up in my office, which I think is an appropriate place to intimidate businesspeople. [laughs] Which is my aim in life.\n\nI’m very honored to get them. I don’t organize them and catalog them. The excuse is always – which is the truth – I’m too busy doing it. I’m talking to you now before I go into the recording studio to record new songs of mine. I love that – I love that I still am enthusiastic, I’ve still got the energy and the desire to keep doing it. So the analysis has to take a back seat.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat’s the album you’re working on now?\n\nA.\n\nIt’s a new studio record, my new songs. I’m always writing songs and I’ve got a bunch that I want to record. I’ve been working with a variety of producers, and today I’m actually working George Martin’s son, Giles. I’m actually just going down the road to the studio. I’m just going to pull over, have a little walk down the road, pull into the studio and start thrashing about on my guitar.\n\nQ.\n\nThose fellows that you worked with at the 12-12-12 benefit concert, will they show up on your new album?\n\nA.\n\n“Cut Me Some Slack,” which I did with the Nirvana boys, will be on Dave Grohl’s album. That’s his project. He just rang me up, said: “Do you want to come over for a jam? I’m working on this project about the old Sound City days.” I was in L.A., so I went over with my wife and two of my daughters and they just hung, the gals, while me and Dave went over to the studio, feeling like two little teenagers escaping. Dave got on the drums, I got on guitar, Krist Novoselic got on bass, Pat Smear got on guitar. I just shouted some words – [demonstrates] “Mamaaaaaaaa!” – got into that mode. What was so lovely about it was that it really was just, “Hey, do you want to have a jam?” It was totally organic. It was like an improv afternoon. Really if you think about it, it should be something that a major label would dream up. [executive’s voice] “I want you boys to get together, and we’re going to put a lot of money behind this.” But it wasn’t, it was just our idea and we did it in one afternoon.\n\nQ.\n\nWell, you’ve got my number now. Feel free to give me a ring if you’d ever like to jam in New York.\n\nA.\n\nWhat do you play?\n\nQ.\n\nI play the plastic guitar in Rock Band.\n\nA.\n\nOh, cool. I bet you’re better at it than I am. My grandkids always beat me at Rock Band. And I say, Listen, you may beat me at Rock Band, but I made the original records, so shut up.",
  "latent_425": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been named the chief strategist behind the government shutdown, with Obamacare and the spending bill at its heart. It’s therefore more than understandable that Cruz might be defensive when faced with discord and dissatisfaction within his own party. Just two days ago, a Republican senator described the attack of fellow Republicans on Cruz — according to The Huffington Post — saying, “It just started a lynch mob.”\n\nCruz insists that in rallying fellow Tea Party members and Republicans into the present situation he had not damaged his party — “Not remotely,” said Cruz. “I also think far too many people are worried about politics” Cruz said discussing the shutdown, referring to “nasty partisan jabs from Democrats.”\n\nThough Cruz believes his efforts haven’t left the Republican party with a black eye, the numbers don’t stand behind Cruz’s claims. Based on recent polls, the shutdown is not treating the Republican party well in terms of public opinion.\n\nA poll conducted by Public Policy Polling – with a sample size in each district consisting of 600-700 registered voters — did not bode well for Republican popularity. Done over the end of last week, the poll showed that the Republican incumbents in 17 out of the 24 districts polled were found to be behind the generic Democrat in approval ratings.\n\nPollster Jim Williams illustrates just how significant those numbers are. In the National Journal, Williams explains that, “Democrats must pick up 17 seats to win control of the House. These poll results make clear that if the election were held today, such a pickup would be well within reach.” Williams also notes that this defies “conventional wisdom that gerrymandering has put the House out of reach for Democrats,” a scary thought for House Republicans.\n\nSeparate polls from both CBS and Fox News corroborate these findings. CBS found that 3 days into the government shutdown 44 percent of Americans felt that Republicans in Congress were at fault, with only 35 percent placing the blame on President Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\nThe Fox News poll, conducted October 1 and 2, found that 25 percent of voters blame “Republican leaders such as John Boehner” for the shutdown, while 17 percent blame “Tea Party Republicans such as Ted Cruz.” With 24 percent blaming President Obama, and only 8 percent faulting “Democratic leaders such as Harry Reid.” In a show of force, 20 percent of those polled blamed everyone equally. On the basis of party lines, the poll showed 42 percent blaming the Republicans and 32 percent the Democrats.\n\nOffering a final nail in the coffin, USA Today quotes a Quinnipiac Poll that came out Tuesday saying that 74 percent of Americans disapprove of Republican actions in Congress, compared to 60 percent of those polled who take issue with Democratic conduct.\n\nWhile it may seem overwhelmingly in favor of the Democrats, opinion isn’t as strongly in their favor as it was 17 years ago after the last government shutdown, at least according to The Washington Post. In a Washington Post/ABC poll taken directly after the shutdown ended in 1996, it was found that 50 percent of Americans felt Republicans were to blame, with only 27 percent blaming Clinton.\n\nEven so, Cruz finds himself in a difficult position with many of his fellow Republicans, and his frustration is apparent. “It seems that there is nothing the media likes to cover more than disagreements among Republicans, and apparently some senators are content to fuel those stories with anonymous quotes,” said Cruz in an interview with Politico.\n\nCruz said that his goals going forward would be ending “Harry Reid’s shutdown,” and “ensuring that vital government priorities are funded, and preventing the enormous harms that ObamaCare is inflicting on millions of Americans.” One thing that remains to be seen is whether fellow party members will thank him for his efforts when House elections roll around.\n\nHere’s how the major U.S. equity indexes traded on Monday:\n\nDon’t Miss: 5 Vital Steps to Protect Your Finances from Government Shutdowns.",

  "latent_512": "Mexican Collapse Feeds Illegal Alien Problem In U.S.\n\nMichael Cutler\n\nThis article on Fox News was brought to my attention by Bruce DeCell, a good friend who, given the circumstances under which we met, I would prefer that we had never met. Bruce is a founding member of 9/11 Families for a Secure America (9/11 FSA). He is a former New York City Police officer whose son-in-law was one of the many victims of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nI serve as an advisor to 9/11 FSA and we often discuss the clear nexus between our nation’s failures to secure its borders and create an immigration system that possesses meaningful integrity.\n\nThe Fox article actually deals with both of these critically important issues. The current situation in Mexico is the direct result of the ever-increasing influence that the drug cartels wield in that country. Corruption has historically been a way of life in Mexico. The current situation involves an exponential increase in the corruption, but adds to that problem the factor of escalating violence as drug cartels, not unlike terrorist organizations, use violence and the threat of violence in conjunction with bribery to destabilize the federal government of Mexico, along with local governments in that beleaguered country.\n\nIn order to wield this much power, the cartels needed to get their hands on huge sums of cash. The drug trade provided an infusion of billions of American dollars. The narcotics flowed (and continue to flow) north and the proceeds of the drug trade flowed south – into the bulging coffers of the cartels.\n\nThe cash bought many things, including weapons and vehicles (airplanes, boats, cars and trucks). That cash also bought counterfeit identity documents and safe houses and provided the means by which the cartels could set up shop here, expanding the tendrils of its reach clear across the United States.\n\nThis cash has the potential to corrupt government bureaucrats on the federal and local level in Mexico, thus enabling the criminals – and potentially terrorists – to buy authentic Mexican passports and other identity documents, in false names to disguise the identity of criminals and terrorists. It could also be used to similarly corrupt other officials of other Latin American countries to secure authentic identity documents in false names and nationalities.\n\nFinally, that cash bought politicians, high ranking military officials and police officials. Those who could not be bought are killed. Many citizens of Mexico who bear no relationship to the drug trade are often caught up in the violence. They are, in the term the military often uses, “collateral damage.”\n\nBy failing to secure our nation’s borders, millions of illegal aliens have been able to enter the United States without leaving a trace of their arrival. Among the millions of illegal aliens whose primary goal is to get an illegal job are thousands of criminal aliens involved in gangs and the drug trade. Additional aliens are involved in other criminal enterprises. Not all of these aliens are citizens of Mexico or even Latin America. Many aliens come from other countries from other parts of the world. Additionally, there are a significant number of illegal aliens who are citizens of so-called “special interest” countries. These are the countries that are engaged in terrorism such as Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and others.\n\nIt is also an established fact that there are terrorist training camps located in the Tri-Border Region of Brazil. By not securing our borders, our government has literally left the door open to all sorts of threats to the security of our nation and the safety of our citizens.\n\nYet there are still members of the United States Congress who are opposed to securing the border that must be secured to protect our nation and our citizens. There are those within the open borders crowd who profess to be advocates for “immigrant rights,” but who must know of the violence in Mexico and must be able to understand the clear nexus between the drug trade and the violence visited upon decent citizens of Mexico.\n\nYet these people steadfastly refuse to support any effort aimed at stopping the flow of drugs and illegal aliens. There is a clear nexus between trafficking in both commodities. Often illegal aliens are forced to carry drugs on their person as they are taken across the border by the smugglers (coyotes). Such aliens are referred to as “mules” because to the smuggler, they are nothing more than beasts of burden. They are used as mules would be to carry a load. Those illegal aliens are indeed treated no differently from any other load of contraband and, when they finally arrive in the United States their treatment is demeaning and dehumanizing. They do not come to share the “American dream” but rather to provide cheap and exploitable labor.\n\nNow the violence is escalating exponentially. Kidnappings and home invasions are nearly a daily occurrence in cities in the United States that are located near the Mexican border. Phoenix, Arizona is one particularly hard-hit example of this trend.\n\nMeanwhile, each and every day more and more members of the drug cartels and the various gangs enter the United States and have embedded themselves in communities clear across our country, not unlike a metastasizing malignant tumor. The concern is that with the increasing numbers of cartel members and their enforcers along with members of gangs such as MS-13, the tactics of terror that have driven increasing numbers of Mexican citizens to run the border that is supposed to separate Mexico from the United States may well be applied in increasing numbers of cities across the United States.\n\nIt is now estimated that there are now more violent gang members in the United States than there are sworn police officers.\n\nThe Fox article describes how there are increasing numbers of citizen of Mexico who now see in the United States not only an opportunity to make more money than would be possible in Mexico, but a safe haven to get away from the extreme violence that includes beheadings of police and military officials.\n\nInterestingly, the article concludes:\n\nImmigration lawyers say they don’t believe the U.S. will reach a point where it cannot afford to keep all of the asylum-seekers here, but they do agree that the immigration system will be heavily strained. Already, asylum officers are working with insufficient resources to process the number of applicants. According to a 2005 survey by the Immigration Policy Center, 93 percent of surveyed asylum officers said they routinely worked overtime, without pay, in order to avoid a backlog of cases. Some also said that they didn’t have enough time to thoroughly address each case, leading to the fear that they may have made wrong decisions in granting asylum.\n\nIt is clear that the beleaguered employees at USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) lack the ability to keep pace with their ever increasing workload. I have often invoked the analogy of the episode of I Love Lucy wherein Lucy and her hapless cohort, Ethel, take jobs at a candy factory. They are supposed to wrap pieces of candy that are delivered to them on a conveyor belt that keeps moving faster and faster until they are unable to keep pace with the candy that hurtles at them at warp speed. They try eating the candy and stuffing the candy down their clothes to keep up, but to no avail.\n\nIn that analogy, I left an important factor out. Imagine if a small but unknown percentage of the candy contained a deadly poison. Imagine if Lucy and Ethel were told that in addition to wrapping the candy they needed to attempt to find the poisoned morsels.\n\nThat is the untenable situation that the adjudications officers at USCIS find themselves in each and every day. Consider the case of Mir Amil Kansi, a citizen of Pakistan who applied for political asylum and then showed his appreciation by standing outside the CIA in January 1993 one morning with an AK-47. He opened fire on the employees of our government’s intelligence agency and when the smoke cleared, two officials were dead and three others were wounded. In the ensuing investigation it was determined that he had lied on his application for political asylum. He was ultimately tracked down and returned to the United States to stand trial for his murderous rampage.\n\nKansi is only one of many aliens who easily gamed the immigration system in order to embed themselves in our country in preparation for their nefarious activities. The attack on the World Trade Center the month after Kansi attacked the CIA also involved aliens who easily gamed the immigration system. The terrorists of the 9/11 attacks had also been able to manipulate the immigration system to their advantage. In all, it was determined that of 94 terrorists who had been identified as operating in the United States in the decade leading up to the attacks of September 11, 2001, 59 had used immigration fraud to either enter the United States and / or embed themselves in the United States.\n\nThe issue of the utter lack of integrity to the immigration benefits program has yet to be addressed. There are still politicians who talk about Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) but precious few seem to give a damn that criminals and terrorists are easily able to game that bureaucracy that literally puts the keys to America’s front door into the hands of those who would kill us – if and when they have the opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, each and every day our border still permits the entry of thousands of illegal aliens who enter surreptitiously. Every single day, narcotics flow north and money – American money -flows south buying guns, vehicles, corruption and death.\n\nThe other day a reporter noted that the approval rating for Congress had soared. She said that, if I recall correctly, the approval rating was an incredible 31%.\n\nThat nearly took my breath away! Could you imagine keeping your job if your employer told you that out of 100% you had a 31% approval rating?\n\nIn less than two years each and every member of the House of Representatives is up for reelection. In less than two years more than one third of the members of the United States Senate will have to face their constituents. They need to be reminded that they work for us, We the People!\n\nThe large scale apathy demonstrated by citizens of this nation has emboldened elected representatives to all but ignore the needs of the average American citizen in a quest for massive campaign funds and the promises of votes to be ostensibly delivered by special interest groups. There is much that we cannot do but there is one thing that We the People absolutely must do – we must stop sitting on the sidelines.\n\nFamilySecurityMatters.org Contributing Editor Michael Cutler is a Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies and a recognized authority who addresses the implications of immigration on national security and criminal justice.\n\nRead more excellent articles from Family Security Matters\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_967": "CLOSE Apple, Google and Facebook have stood the test of time—so far. But will the tech titans really live forever? Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes all three entities will grow even more powerful over the next six decades. USA TODAY\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak predicts the future, as in 2075. (Photo11: Jon Swartz, for USA TODAY)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — When Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976, the two Steves assumed it would last forever.\n\nWoz still believes that's true. In fact, he's convinced Apple, Google and Facebook will be bigger in 2075, the theme of next weekend's Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC), “The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?”\n\nThe three-day conference, which Wozniak helped create last year, explores the intersection of pop culture and technology. This year's guests includes the 30th anniversary cast reunion of Star Trek: The Next Generation, actors William Shatner and John Cusack, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and renowned architect Greg Lynn.\n\nSVCC is expected to draw 75,000 to 100,000 from April 21-23 to downtown San Jose. In addition to a start-up village and space exploration zone, its exhibit floor showcases entertainment companies, comic book vendors, and technology exhibits for virtual reality, robotics and smart devices. Panels and film presentations will weigh in on flying cars, aliens, Mars, the implantation of computers into brains and other space-age stuff, show organizers say.\n\nCLOSE After a first year success that made it the largest fan expo in Northern California, Silicon Valley Comic-Con is returning for a second show in 2017. USA TODAY\n\nWozniak is no stranger to predictions. In 1982, he said portable laptops would emerge. And he has strong opinions on how we'll live in 58 years.\n\n\"Apple will be around a long time, like IBM (which was founded in 1911),\" Wozniak said in an interview on Friday. \"Look at Apple's cash ($246.1 billion, as of the end of its last fiscal quarter). It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook.\"\n\nWoz shared some other predictions on what type of planet we can expect in 2075:\n\n— New cities. Deserts could be ideal locations for cities of the future, designed and built from scratch, according to Wozniak. There, housing problems will not exist and people will shuttle among domed structures. Special wearable suits will allow people to venture outside, he said.\n\n— The influence of artificial intelligence. Within all cities, AI will be ubiquitous, Wozniak says. Like a scene straight from the movie Minority Report, consumers will interact with smart walls and other surfaces to shop, communicate and be entertained. Medical devices will enable self-diagnosis and doctor-free prescriptions, he says. \"The question will be ethical, on whether we can eliminate the need for physicians,\" he says.\n\nMars covered in clouds viewed by the Hubble Space Telescope, May 2016. (Photo11: NASA / HUBBLE / HANDOUT, EPA)\n\n— Mars colony. Woz is convinced a colony will exist on the Red Planet. Echoing the sentiments of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin start-up has designs on traveling to Mars, Wozniak envisions Earth zoned for residential use and Mars for heavy industry.\n\n— Extraterrestrials. With apologies to those who believe in aliens, Wozniak says there is a \"random chance\" that Earthlings will communicate with another race. \"It's worth trying,\" he says, \"but I don't have high hopes.\"\n\nThe trick with predicting the future, Wozniak readily acknowledges, is that it changes so quickly. \"Who could have foreseen the rise of an Uber a decade ago?' he says, before pausing.\n\n\"She has more power in her hand than Superman,\" Wozniak, broadly smiling, says, pointing at a colleague's iPhone. \"To make such strides in computing...

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nCamera Logic in a 2D Platformer\n\nGetting the camera right in a classic 2D Platformer is not as easy as it might seem at first.\n\nThe most simple approach would be to hardwire the camera to the player, so the player is always centered in the screen. This might be ok for prototypes but it has some flaws that can really frustrate the player.\n\nFor example if the camera scrolls up with each jump of the player it easily will cause nausea. It's also not very smooth when the player starts running or stops immediately.\n\nIn our upcoming game Tiny Thor we have experimented with various options and I want to describe which techniques we ended up using.\n\nFirst of all we handle the X- and Y-Axis separately of each other.\n\nScrolling on the X-Axis\n\nFor the X Axis we define a left and right border (Focus Area on the Screenshot).\n\nWhen the player moves, the camera will calculate the distance between the old camera position and the new player position. Then we know how many pixels we have to scroll. To smooth out this movement, we divide this distance by 32 so that the camera lags behind. We also have a max camera speed that will never be exceeded.\n\nVarious camera zones explained.\n\nTo avoid triggering camera movement on every small motion we only apply this scrolling behaviour if the player walks out of the left or right border of the Focus Zone. The camera will then catch up immediately.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned camera lag, we end up with less visible area in the direction the player is heading. This reduces the relevant information on screen that the player requires to react to enemies, obstacles, platforms, etc.\n\nTo address this problem we move the horizontal Focus Zone based on the player sprite's orientation.\n\nThe camera now 'looks' into the same direction as the player.\n\nWhen the player moves to the right, the focus zone moves to the left, which keeps the player on the left side of the screen center.\n\nWe move the Focus Zone even more off-center based on the player's x-velocity. This added view distance further helps with reacting to the levels upcoming challenges.\n\nThis results in smooth camera movements that adapt to the players next intention, preventing frustration and offering more freedom in level design.\n\nScrolling on the Y-Axis\n\nThe scrolling on the y-axis follows a similar logic and provides the top and bottom borders for our Focus Zone.\n\nInstead of dividing the difference between player and camera by 32, we use a factor of 16 for the smoothing effect. Furthermore the camera only starts moving when the player is standing on an object, to prevent the camera from following every jump.\n\nCamera starts to scroll on y-axis as soon as player has some ground under his feets.\n\nCamera doesn’t scroll on y-axis when player jumps.\n\nX and y behaviour in action.\n\nFor regular scenarios these rules seems sufficient, but if the player is jumping around the top part of the screen or is falling down a shaft, this camera behaviour would break.\n\nTo address this we add two further horizontal lines that check the vertical position of the player. We call these panic lines (dark yellow in the images), as crossing these warrants a quick movement of the camera.\n\nSo whenever the player is jumping or falling and crosses one of these lines, the camera will quickly follow.\n\nCamera catches up as soon as player cross the panic lines.\n\nAll of this worked nicely for most situations in our levels, but for some scenarios in the levels we want a manual override of this behaviour.\n\nThis is done with simple rectangles in the level editor that allows locking the camera on one of the axes for as long as the player is within the defined area.\n\nThis is really useful if you want a player to see if a drop down a ledge is safe.\n\nIt can also be used in hectic sections that are mostly oriented in one direction like falling down a long shaft full of gems.\n\nWe also make use of this logic for locking the player's camera in a bossfight where the player is caged anyways and where the steady camera helps dodging all the attacks and projectiles.\n\nAnother use case is to completely change the camera's focus on another part of the level. The logic here is to let the camera pan along a wire between the players position and the specified area, rest there for a second and then pan back again. We use this to show the consequence of a flipped switch for example.\n\nAll this results in a dynamic camera behaviour that works 95% of the time, while giving you the tools to manually design the camera’s behaviour in those remaining situations for gameplay reason or dramatic effect.\n\nNow you don’t need to hire a cinematographer ;)\n\nAbout the author\n\nJochen is the founder of Asylum Square, an independent game studio, that focuses on retro-inspired games that we all would have loved to play back then when we were young.

As a player, he is one of the best right-backs in the world, and he’s a really good person as well.”\n\nBut while Enrique really likes his manager and his Anfield defensive colleague, he is most definitely not a fan of taking penalties.\n\nHe scored his first Liverpool goal earlier this season against Wigan, from open play, and laughed: “I am realistic in my life – if you’re not good at something, don’t do it. I’m not good at taking penalties so I will be last, even after Pepe Reina.\n\n“It was an amazing feeling to score my first Liverpool goal. It was one of the best moments I have ever had.”\n\nEnrique swapped Tyneside for Merseyside during the summer of 2011 following four years with Newcastle – a switch influenced by the desire to emulate modern greats at Anfield.\n\n“One of the reasons I came here was Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and now Luis Suarez,” he told LFC TV in the latest edition of their ‘Life Through a Lens’ programme.\n\n“These are players that have amazing history at the club and I want to try to be like them in the future here. You have to respect the past he has here – he’s a player that has played 700 games.\n\n“It’s not lucky, he deserves it. He has been an amazing player for Liverpool for many years and he’s an example for any player here.\n\n“Coming to Liverpool was one of the best decisions in my life, in terms of football.\n\n“Of course, I already played for a good club at Newcastle, but you can’t compare one club with the other in terms of history.\n\n“It was really quick; I knew there was interest from before the summer. When they started talking to Newcastle about how much I was going to go for, it was one or two days to sort it out. I told them I wanted to come here.\n\n“I’m really happy with my decision to be here; it’s my second season and I’m playing a lot, like last year. I’m improving a lot as a player and a person as well.”",
  "latent_1739": "What in your opinion is most important skill for an offlaner? Does being a captain forces you to play different than most offlaners? [Arc1]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Какой навык по твоему мнению наиболее важен для офлейнера? Тот факт, что ты капитан как-то заставляет играть иначе, чем другие офлейнеры?\n\nУмение приспосабливаться к разным игровым ситуациям(так как против определенных лайнапов стоять проще , против других малейшая ошибка будет стоить тебе жизни) и думать наперед(угадывать перемещения вражеских суппортов). Вообще каждый игрок на одной и той же роли как не крути мыслит по разному ) У нас нет единственного координатора по игре(каждый вносит свою ленту на определенных этапах игры) и по этому я не думаю что это как-то влияет на мою игру ) The ability to adapt to different situations (playing against certain line-ups is easier, a slight mistake against others can cost you your life) and thinking ahead (guessing enemy supports’ movement).

Made my day to see you doing a 20-20. Feel free to answer either of my questions or both.\n\nIf you had to rank the heroes disabled in -cm at the moment from 1-5 (1 being the strongest, 5 being the weakest), how would you rank them and what would probably be their most common role? (the heroes disabled are Broodmother, Earth Spirit, Terrorblade, Phoenix, and Legion Commander) [Aisikle]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Я большой фанат Empire! Рад, что ты провидишь это 20-20 Можешь ответить на оба из моих вопросов или только на один.\n\nЕсли бы тебе пришлось оценить тех героев, которые недоступны в -cm на данный момент по шкале от 1 до 5 (1 - самый сильный, 5 - самый слабый), то как бы ты их оценил и какова бы была их основная роль в игре по твоему мнению? (Герои: Broodmother, Earth Spirit, Terrorblade, Phoenix и Legion Commander)\n\nНа самом деле все эти герои очень сильны и если бы они появились на -cm моде я думаю это бы очень поменяло баланс , оценил бы я так 1-Terrorblade (керри) , 2-Phoenix(offlane) , 3-Legion Commander(carry,jungler), 4-Earth Spirit(offlane, mid , support), Broodmother(offlane) In fact all of these heroes are really strong and if they all were in -cm it would have affected the balance quite a lot. I would rank them this way: 1-Terrorblade (carry), 2-Pheonix (offlane), 3-Legion Commander (carry, jungler), 4-Earth Spirit (offlane, mid, support), 5-Broodmother (offlane).\n\nMy other question is when you reached the grand finals in StarLadder against DK, was there a clear strategy in mind to use against them? Some examples might be, did you feel winning early or mid game was more important; was there any clear ideas of what heroes needed to be banned or picked? What ultimately went wrong in the games?\n\nThanks very much for the 20-20 and good luck in TI4!!! [Aisikle]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Мой второй вопрос касается вашего матча против DK на грандфиналах Старладдера. Была ли у вас готова чёткая стратегия против них? Например, считали ли вы, что важнее получить преимущество в начальной стадии игры или в середине; было ли чётко ясно каких героев нужно было банить или пикать? Что в итого пошло не так?\n\nОгромное спасибо за это 20-20 и удачи на Ti4!!!\n\nЧестно сказать свои лучшие пики на тот момент мы уже показали пока дошли до грандфинала , по этому удивлять их было нечем , в целом эта команда показалась нам очень неприятной в плане драфта , так как у них огромный пул героев и законтрить их очень тяжело. В первой игре все было очень ровно до определенного момента , скажем так переломной драки , но в целом ДК отлично пикнули Воида , который был ключевым(неприятным) героем. После этих игр мы сделали вывод , что нам тоже не помешает расширить свой пул ) To be honest, we already showed our best strategies before getting to the grand final, so there was nothing to surprise them with. In general Team DK looked very unpleasant for us in terms of draft, because they have a giant hero pool and countering them is very hard. The first game went evenly until a certain moment, a defining fight. DK picked Void that was the main (unpleasant for us) hero. After those games we came to a conclusion that we need to expand our hero pool.\n\nClockwerk is a very versatile hero when it comes to item builds and we've seen you go many different routes in this regard. How would you decide whether or not Armlet should be picked up, because this is not such a common item on Clock? [NeThZOR]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Клок очень гибкий герой когда дело доходит до выбора айтемов для него, и мы видели много различных вариантов. Имеет ли смысл собирать на Клоке Армлет, не самый популярный предмет для него?\n\nЯ считаю что имеет , исходя из игровых ситуаций , всегда собираю в сочетании с блейдмейлом , к примеру взять нашу вторую игру на старладере против IG , имея в команде луну и венгу , у меня была просто куча дмджа с руки + я был очень танковый ну или к примеру в сочетании с каким-то Тролем в твоей команде, когда ты за его ульт можешь убить вражеского керри с руки ) Если ты видишь что блейд мейл хорошо заходит в этой игре , значит и армлет может зайти , зависит от того насколько хорошо у тебя идет игра , так как если у тебя не получается собрать быстро эти два айтема , это уже будет не так эффективно ну и против всяких думов , апаратов или героев с сумонами(инвокер , визаж , лон друид) тоже мало смысла , проверил на личном опыте ) I believe there is a point to picking it up, depending on the situation. I always pick it in a combination with Blademail, for example our second match vs. IG on SL9 Finals, having Luna and Venge in our team I had a ton of damage from my rightclicks and I was very tanky. Or for example with a Troll Warlord in your team, when with his ult you can just kill an enemy carry. If you see that Blademail fits well in this game, then it might work depending on how good your game is going, because if you won’t be able to pick up those two items fast, it will be less effective. Also there isn't much point in picking it versus Doom, AA or heroes with summons (Invoker, Visage, Lone Druid). I say this from my personal experience.\n\nIt's nice to see you guys rising this high this year, congratulations on the invitation! What's your opinion on 6.81's impact on this year's International? How unexpected results can we get? [pidzson]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Приятно видеть как высоко вы выросли в этом году, поздравляю с инвайтом!\n\nКаково твоё мнение о влиянии 6.81 на TI в этом году? Насколько непредсказуемые результаты мы можем получить?\n\nЭто дает встряску всем командам , куча новых пиков , много забытых героев опять всплывают в игре. Я не думаю что патч значительно повляет на результаты , в прошлом году была похожая ситуация перед TI , тоже был новый патч, все зависит только от подготовки команд. It shakes up all teams, a ton of new picks, a lot of once forgotten heroes are rising up again. I don’t think that the patch will significantly affect the results, there was a similar situation last year before TI, there was a new patch too. It all depends on how prepared teams are.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about the recent changes to Tusk's snowball and the hero in general? Do you think he can be a stable pick for the offlane with the new possible plays that can be made? [Provocateur]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Какие у тебя мысли на счёт недавнего изменения шара Тускара и на счёт героя в целом?\n\nСчитаешь ли ты, что он может стать стабильным пиком на оффлейн благодаря его новым возможностям?\n\nМы уже пикали его несколько раз в официальных играх , как супорт он мне нравиться больше ) We already picked him a few times in official matches. I like him more as a support.\n\nYou have a wide array of strats compared to a lot of proteams but in consequence some of them are not as refined. Is it a choice to practice a lot of different approaches or it came naturally? [nojok]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + У вас есть большое разнообразие стратегий по сравнению с другими про командами, но в результате этого некоторые из них не так отточены. Вы специально решили тренировать много различных стратегий и подходов к игре или так получилось само собой?\n\nМы всегда стараемся расширять наш пул , некоторые герои всплывают случайно , простая импровизация , но потом многие из этих героев становятся приоритетными ) We always try to expand our hero pool, some heroes popped out at random, pure improvisation, but after that a lot of those heroes become a priority.\n\nCan you tell us about the decision to make Silent the carry? He's performed incredibly in the roll, but it just seemed so surprising to see him go from the support role into the hard carry well and for you guys to dominate in such a short amount of time. [garlicface]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Можешь ли ты рассказать о решении перевести Сайлента на керри? Он играет отлично, но просто это достаточно удивительно, что он так хорошо перешёл с саппорта на керри и вы начали доминировать так быстро.\n\nСайлент очень универсальный игрок , он переиграл на многих ролях и многих героях , как он играет на керри мне нравиться больше всего , мне кажется он наконец-то нашел для себя идеальную роль ) Silent is a very versatile player, he played on many roles and many heroes. The way he plays as carry I like the most. I also think that he finally found the perfect role for himself.\n\nYour team displays amazing levels of synergy. Where did it come from? Is it just from familiarity and playing a lot together, or do you work on different kinds of plays and situations in scrims and practices? [schmitty9800]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Ваша команда показывает замечательную координацию и взаимодействие. Это происходит из-за того, что вы хорошо знаете друг друга и просто часто играете вместе или же вы специально отрабатываете различные ситуации и моменты на квшках и тренировках?\n\nЯ думаю все это из-за отличной атмосферы внутри команды , в какой-то степени наш костяк (я , Флай , Резолюшен) тоже важен , так как мы долго играли вместе и хорошо понимаем друг друга , а когда в команде есть какой-то костяк , сыграться вместе намного проще. I think that it’s all thanks to the team chemistry. Our core (me, Fly, Resolut1tion) is also important to some degree, because we played together for a long time and understand each other well. When a team has such a core it’s much easier to achieve teamwork.\n\nWhat teams are you most afraid to play against going to TI4? What team is your most friendly ally? [Marco1723]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Каких команд вы опасаетесь больше всего на TI4? С какими команда вы больше всего дружите, так сказать?\n\nDK , Newbee (китайцев никогда не стоит недооценивать) / лично для меня это Na`Vi , а так у каждого по разному , кто-то больше общается с игроками одной команды , кто-то больше с игроками другой ) DK, Newbee (you should never underestimate the Chinese). Personally for me the most friendly is Na`Vi, but it differs from person to person. Someone talks more with players of one team, someone with players of another.\n\nHow can you catch up with the opponent's cores in farm and level given how far behind offlaners will often be in comparison to the other team's solo players? What are the most important impact you can make in those situations? [SupportDotA2]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Как можно догнать вражеских фармящих героев по фарму и опыту, учитывая как сильно можно отстать от них будучи офлейнером? Какие важные действия можно сделать в таких ситуациях?\n\nЭто можно сделать только если ты будешь постоянно убивать вражеского керри , один или с помощью супортов / мидера , не важно , по другому никак ) You can only do that if you will constantly kill enemy carry, solo or with the help of other heroes (supports, midlaner, doesn’t matter). There is no other way.\n\nHow much of your style is based on the region you are from and do you think there are any teams that cross into styles from other areas? (EU, CIS, China, SEA, North America, etc.) [Bigtony]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + На сколько стиль вашей игры основан на том, что вы из СНГ? Есть ли команды, которые комбинируют стили из разных регионов?\n\nУ многих команд есть свой уникальный стиль(смесь разных стилей в одном) , наш стиль игры наверное больше всего выделяется агрессией. Many teams have their unique style (a mix of different styles in one), our style is probably most notable for the aggression.\n\nWhat will the most-picked offlane hero be during TI4? Gotta be Centaur, right? [DaiWales]\n\n+ Show Spoiler + Какого героя на офлейн будут пикать чаще всего на TI4?\n\nПолюбому же Кентавра?\n\nНа самом деле приоритеты на оффлейнеров всегда меняются , тот же Кентавр сейчас уже не так популярен , я думаю чаще всего в пике/бане будет batrider / ds Generally the priorities on offlaners constantly shift, so even the Centaur isn't as popular anymore. I think the most banned/picked would be Batrider/Dark Seer.",
  "latent_1808": "There’s a long-standing debate over Shakespeare’s sexuality. I do a deep dive.\n\nIf there’s one thing that everyone in the world has in common, it’s an unfortunate and often shamefully hidden love of trying to figure out whether or not famous people are gay. Google any famous name plus the word gay and you’ll find that someone’s beaten you to the speculative punch.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare gets a particular amount of attention in the gay/straight arena. People have been dissecting Shakespeare’s work and life for decades trying to figure out if he secretly had a thing for the fellas. And the resounding answer is… maybe.\n\nI ended up wandering deep into this rabbit hole (no immature pun intended) and dug up these 11 pieces of evidence that are presented in “oh yeah, Shakespeare was gay” debate.\n\n1 | Sonnet 20\n\nIn 1609, a collection of 154 Shakespearean sonnets were published, arguably without his approval. The first 126 of the 154 are widely accepted as love poems to a man. Sonnet 20 is the most-cited example and, depending on how you look at it, could even make Walt Whitman say, “Damn, son, pump the brakes…”\n\nA woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,\n\nHast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\n\nA woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted\n\nWith shifting change, as is false women’s fashion:\n\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\n\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\n\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\n\nWhich steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.\n\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created;\n\nTill Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\n\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\n\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\n\nBut since she prick’d thee out for women’s pleasure,\n\nMine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.\n\nThe whole “master mistress of my passion” thing draws a lot of attention… but the last two lines, which basically say, “You’ve got a nice penis that women really like, so go stick it to them but save the emotional love for me,” put Sonnet 20 over the edge.\n\nIt’s so blatant that the people in the “Shakespeare wasn’t gay” camp really only argue that this poem isn’t necessarily written by Shakespeare as Shakespeare… but, rather, could be him writing as a character.\n\n2 | SO many cross-dressing plays\n\nShakespeare’s plays feature more cross-dressing than a Wayans Brothers movie. (And if you’re doing Othello at a homogeneous high school, perhaps more cross-racial make-up application, too.) About one out of every five Shakespearean plays involves cross-dressing and in three of them, it’s absolutely central to the plot.\n\nOf course, this isn’t to say that cross-dressing is a 1:1 match with homosexuality. Far from it. And one of the most timeless pillars of comedy is man + women’s clothes = laugh. (Also man + women’s clothes + run-by fruiting = mega laughs.)\n\nStill, that’s a whole lotta gender blurring going on. Imagine if a prominent filmmaker today focused 20 percent of his films on cross-dressing. No one would even have the energy to speculate on Ryan Seacrest and Anderson Cooper anymore.\n\n3 | Henry V\n\nShakespeare focuses a lot on deep male friendship. And that’s good. Guys are always fun to hang out with; like when Marge said to Homer, “He prefers the company of men,” and Homer replied, “Who doesn’t?”\n\nBut… there is one scene in Henry V where the Earl of Suffolk and Duke of York die in each other’s arms. Oh shit. Should I have put “SPOILER ALERT”? Anyway, many have suggested that it crosses the line from “great friends” to ” forbidden lovers”…\n\nSo did he [York] turn and over Suffolk’s neck\n\nHe threw his wounded arm and kiss’d his lips;\n\nAnd so espoused to death, with blood he seal’d\n\nA testament of noble-ending love.\n\nNow, again, merely writing about two men kissing as they die to express their lifelong love doesn’t mean the person writing is gay. Every week I write a list NFL picks — that doesn’t make me a football player, a Greek or Professor Pigskin.\n\n4 | His wife gets shafted in his will\n\nYes, Shakespeare was married. To a woman. Of course, we all know that’s not necessarily a sign of heterosexuality, more of just coloring inside the lines of societal expectations.\n\nHis wife’s name was Anne Hathaway. She, of course, would go on to star as Jake Gyllenhaal’s wife in… Brokeback Mountain. Now THAT’S some damning evidence.\n\nAll hilarity aside, Shakespeare’s wife really was named Anne Hathaway. A different Anne Hathaway than the one now, obviously. And there’s speculation that he wasn’t all that into her — while they had children, they also had a shotgun wedding (she gave birth six months after they were married)… and, after three years together, he went off to live on his own. Even more revealing is that when he died, the only thing he left her in his will was, quote, “the second best bed.”\n\nDoesn’t seem like much, especially since, unlike most writers, Shakespeare actually owned land. (The “best bed” at the time was usually the one people had for guests, so the “second best bed” was the marital bed. But still, at least throw in something else for your wife.)\n\n5 | “Mr. W.H.”\n\nShakespeare’s sonnets are all dedicated to a mysterious “Mr. W.H.” Assuming it’s not David Cross or Charlize Theron. (Or, more literally, Woody Harrelson.)\n\nMost speculation suggests it was either Henry Wriothesley, the third Earl of Southampton, or William Herbert, the third Earl of Pembroke. Clearly someone thinks Shakespeare had a third Earl fetish. Seems a little like an NFL groupie who has a fetish for punters or special teamers who just got called up from the practice squad, but whatever.\n\n6 | Hamlet acrostic spells “I am a homosexual”\n\nThis is definitely the weakest argument. There’s an urban legend that, in the very first published copy of Hamlet, the first letters of the final 14 lines spelled out “I am a homosexual.”\n\nOf course, no one can really produce evidence of this. I went and actually looked at the last 14 lines of Hamlet and tried to recreate this urban legend. It’s not really possible. I had to use unorthodox line breaks, blend Horatio’s final speech with Prince Fortinbras’s, include the final stage direction, and divide the word “exeunt” over three lines…\n\nI shall have also cause to speak,\n\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on\n\nmore; But let this same be presently perform’d,Even while men’s minds\n\nare wild; lest more mischance On plots and errors,\n\nhappen. Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put\n\non, To have proved\n\nmost royally: and, for his passage, The soldiers’ music and the rites\n\nof war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies:\n\nsuch a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot. A dead march.\n\nE\n\nxe\n\nunt, bearing off the dead bodies;\n\nafter which a pea\n\nl of ordnance is shot off.\n\nVERY dubious. This is like listening to Beatles songs for hidden backwards messages. Or searching for the word “sex” in the clouds in Disney movies.\n\n7 | Sonnet 126\n\nSonnet 126 begins “O thou, my lovely boy.” And while I’m not sure if Shakespeare envisioned himself the Day Man or Night Man — or if the lovely boy is a metaphor — this poem (the 126th of the 126 man-directed sonnets) is one of the only ones that just comes right out and declares its man slant.\n\n8 | His sexy pinup portrait\n\nMost of the pictures we see of Shakespeare have him looking kind of bald and squirrely and oddly pointy. Last year a new portrait surfaced where he was looking much handsomer.\n\nThe chairman of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust even called it a “pinup.” In this portrait Shakespeare looks rosy-cheeked, he’s got a handsome beard (metaphor????????), and a head of styled hair. He’s also wearing an elaborate lacy collar and a gold-trimmed suit.\n\nThe Trust also said that the portrait might, quote, “give fresh momentum to generations of speculation as to whether the playwright was bisexual”… since it seems that the portrait must’ve been commissioned by someone wealthy. Like, say, a third Earl.\n\n9 | All male casts\n\nWhen Shakespeare’s works were performed, first off, he acted in a lot of them. And second off, the casts were all male. This wasn’t necessarily by choice, of course — at the time, women weren’t allowed to be actors. (As opposed to now, when a certain leading lady in the Twilight movies just chooses not to actually act.)\n\nStill, that had to get awfully confusing during the plays when male actors playing female characters were cross dressing as men. And Shakespeare knew when he was writing the plays they’d be performed in all-male casts. On some level, he knew he was writing drag shows. On some level.\n\n10 | The “summer’s day” was really a guy\n\nShakespeare’s Sonnet 18 is arguably his most famous love poem, and begins with a very famous couplet…\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\n\nWell… as the 18th sonnet, it’s part of the 126 sonnets directed at a man. The summer’s day is a man. (Obviously. The summer’s eve would’ve been a woman. Muted and ashamed hi-yo.)\n\nLater on in the sonnet, there’s some wordplay that might or might not further suggest the man is a summer’s day…\n\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm’d;\n\nIs the “his” a reference to summer? Yes. Could the “his” also be Shakespeare playing with pronouns to send a shout-out to his special guy? Absolutely. Do we have to meet him more than halfway to reach that conclusion? Probably.\n\n11 | Condemning Achilles’s gay relationship\n\nFor all the Shakespeare-gay speculation, there’s only one time where Shakespeare directly discusses homosexuality in his works. It’s in Troilus and Cressida, and it’s a discussion of Achilles… who has a tendoncy (yep) to swing toward the gents…\n\nTHERSITES\n\nPrithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk: thou art thought to be Achilles’ male varlet. PATROCLUS\n\nMale varlet, you rogue! what’s that? THERSITES\n\nWhy, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs, loads o’ gravel i’ the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, limekilns i’ the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous discoveries!\n\nTwo things here. One, if today’s right-wing politicians have taught us anything, it’s that the people who condemn homosexuality the loudest are the ones who are, by far, the most likely to get caught with a man in an airport, truck stop or public park bathroom.\n\nAnd two, while such a venomous anti-gay speech could seem to shut the door on this entire “was he/wasn’t he?” argument — this speech actually fits in with the mores of the era. Even if Shakespeare was gay, the societal attitude toward homosexuality lined up with the rant above. Even though Troilus and Cressida is set during the Trojan War, the speech there reflects the Elizabethan attitudes toward homosexuality.\n\nA lot of the speculation about Shakespeare’s sexuality is because he would’ve had to be coy and ambiguous about it in his writing — “coming out” wasn’t an option.\n\n—\n\nTo wrap up, there’s, clearly, no definitive evidence that Shakespeare was gay. It’s all speculative and ambiguous. Unless someone uncovers some new piece of evidence, the debate will quietly, eternally push on.\n\nI don’t find any of the stuff presented above to be a good enough piece of evidence to lead me to a verdict. Like so many other things, it’s a circular, unresolvable argument that’s more entertaining to debate than actually solve.\n\nTo paraphrase and bastardize the end of Sonnet 18, so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long will this debate live on and give life to longtail traffic for this blog post.\n\n—\n\nYou may also like…\n\n11 Most Overrated Shakespeare Quotes\n\n11 Odd Words Shakespeare Invented That Never Caught On\n\n11 Pieces of Evidence the Grinch Was Dr. Seuss’s Autobiography\n\n11 U.S. Presidents Who Might’ve Been Gay\n\n11 Literary References People Make Without Realizing It",
  "latent_1952": "The guys who raised one acre of corn -- and bushels of public awareness -- in their 2007 film \"\n\n\" will kick off the\n\ntonight, talking about their latest project: a vegetable garden thriving in the bed of a pickup.\n\nCurt Ellis, 30, who grew up outside Lake Oswego, and his best friend from college, Ian Cheney, also 30, will take turns giving the Muddy Boot keynote address, \"Back to Back-to-the-Land.\" The fifth annual celebration of all things sustainable unfolds on the grounds of St. Philip Neri Catholic Church in Southeast Portland. The festival includes two days of music, family activities, panel discussions and workshops on urban livestock, edible landscaping and food justice.\n\n\"King Corn\" is a buddy movie about two friends, neophite farmers Ellis and Cheney, who figure out fertilizer and food subsides and whip up a batch of high fructose corn syrup in their home kitchen. Their discovery of how corn figures in the American diet charmed the critics and aired nationally on PBS.\n\nEllis and Cheney, who grew up in New England, became friends at Yale, where they employed creative ways to educate fellow students about where their food came from. Ellis remembers turning sheep loose in the middle of campus and having sheep dog demonstrations. After graduation, the pair decided to make documentaries. Ellis' cousin, Aaron Woolf, joined the \"King Corn\" project as producer and director. Ellis and Cheney emerged from the impromptu film school to make \"The Greening of Southie\" (2008) about Boston's first residential green building.\n\nNew Yorkers now -- Ellis lives in Manhattan and Cheney in Brooklyn -- they are working on their latest project, \"Truck Farm.\" Ellis is also deep into his nonfilm project, FoodCorps. He's choosing seven to 10 states where 50 young adults will work on developing Farm to School food systems and nutrition education.\n\nEllis returns to Portland often -- his parents still live near Lake Oswego. In a telephone interview, Ellis talks about his work as an agricultural advocate and the importance of learning how to water a tomato plant. His responses have been edited.\n\nQ. Portland's Muddy Boot Organic Festival is sponsored by, among other groups, a Catholic congregation with a commitment to caring for the earth. Do you see a religious or spiritual element to the eat-local-live-sustainably movement?\n\nA.\n\nI do see a spiritual connection between myself and the food I eat and the work I do advocating for healthy, sustainable and fair food. When I was living in Portland, my wife and I attended Portland Mennonite Church and the pastor talked a lot about seeking the peace of the city, asking questions about environmental and social issues and the fact that we are, at the end of the day, all in this together.\n\nThat's what draws me to food and agricultural advocacy. It is the one thing that ties us all together: We all eat food that's grown somewhere, either respectful or disrespectful of the humans and animals involved.\n\nQ. Do you worry that eating local, sustainable food can be more expensive than consuming processed or fast food?\n\nA.\n\nThe good news about growing some of your food is it's pretty affordable. You don't have to have much land to grow a big harvest. Seeds, sunlight and water are cheap. But we are at risk of becoming a two food-system society, where the affluent are able to afford fresh, organic fruits and vegetables and carefully raised meat and the least wealthy are stuck eating fast food. We will have lost our sense of justice if we can't make good food affordable.\n\nWhat can you grow in the bed of a pickup?\n\nYou can grow a shocking amount in a dirty old pickup truck. We harvested three shopping carts of fresh organic produce last summer. And the same this summer. Twenty different varieties of vegetables and herbs are growing. The most satisfying is arugula. You get a harvest every few weeks, enough for a big beautiful salad.\n\n\"Truck Farm\" tells the story of this one brave pickup truck, her transition into being a garden and the amazingly creative people growing food in unexpected places -- in window sills, in vacant lots.\n\nQ. You've taken the truck farm on the road. What sort of response do you get?\n\nA.\n\nPeople just like to see things growing. It reminds us of home, even if we didn't grow up on a farm. We have parents, great grandparents who grew up on a farm.\n\nIt's a real renaissance. All Americans, especially the young, are getting excited about agriculture. If you look around Brooklyn, not far from my office, people are growing food on rooftops on a commercial scale, supplying restaurants and families with food grown five stories up, in vacant lots in cities like Detroit. It is a national groundswell of interest.\n\nQ. Why do you think people are so fascinated?\n\nA.\n\nWatching food grow gives us a sense of where we came from. To see food growing in the dirt helps us remember for a moment what good food tastes like. The times we share as humans, our most memorable times, are shared around the dinner table or eating outdoors with people we love.\n\nWhen:\n\nFriday and Sunday\n\nWhere:\n\nSt. Philip Neri Catholic Church, 2408 S.E. 16th Ave., Portland\n\nKeynote:\n\n7 p.m. Friday. Tickets are $25 at the door.\n\nFestival:\n\nNoon to 9 p.m. Saturday, noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $5 per person at the gate, no charge for children younger than 12.\n\nSchedule:\n\nQ. Do you have those memories?\n\nA.\n\nI grew up hanging onto my dad's knees, watching him water the vegetables in his garden. Those are great memories, spending time with my dad and learning how to water a tomato at the same time.\n\nQ. Someone once told me that everyone should plant a tomato. Can a simple act like that make a difference?\n\nA.\n\nAbsolutely. We hosted the Wicked Delicate Garden Contest and challenged students to grow food in the most creative, funniest, stupidest places. We had 70 entries and gave prizes out to the winners. It was fabulous to see the look of joy in the pictures they sent in. There's something really wonderful about being able to eat something you grew yourself, something whimsical about a bean sprout growing in a tennis shoe.\n\nQ. Someone tried that?\n\nA.\n\nThat was the winning entry. Someone from Brown University turned a bicycle into a mobile garden. A middle school had an awesome disco garden ball with edible nasturtiums growing out of it. And there was a lunchbox farm from a grade school, a plastic, folding lunchbox that had a beautiful bean sprouting from it and a proud smiling girl standing next to her creation.\n\nIt's a simple thing to do, but it's satisfying. There is something innate in humans that makes us want to be around other growing, living things -- plants in particular. We are drawn to the magic of a seed sprouting and becoming something we can eat. Whether it goes back to a grandmother in Puerto Rico with a garden or my dad watering his Willamette tomatoes, that's as alive as you get to feel, when you're tending to another living thing.\n\n--",
  "latent_2058": "Last Saturday, January 31, CIA Inspector General David Buckley resigned after a little more than four years in office. His departure came at the end of the same month his office published a scathing report that found the agency committed serious wrongdoings in connection to its rendition, detention, and torture program. It was also the same month that his report was swept aside by a parallel investigation conducted by a CIA “Accountability Board” that was hand-picked by agency leadership. Unsurprisingly, the Accountability Board recommended holding no one accountable for any failings.\n\nThe CIA Accountability Board report on the agency’s search of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) staffers’ computers continues a disturbing pattern: First, the CIA commits serious misconduct. Then, the CIA’s internal, independent watchdogs in the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigate and document the misconduct. Next, CIA management overrides the inspector general’s findings, excuses the misconduct, and either imposes inadequate sanctions or decides not to discipline anyone at all.\n\nThis pattern is documented in the executive summary of the Senate torture report. The intelligence committee found that misconduct like killing or injuring prisoners, using unauthorized interrogation techniques, detaining people unlawfully, or providing inaccurate information about the program “did not result in appropriate, effective, or in many cases, any corrective actions.”\n\nIn fact, the Senate study describes incidents where CIA leadership intervened to ensure that no one would be held accountable for homicide and wrongful imprisonment. The first was for the death of Gul Rahman at the CIA’s “COBALT” detention site in November 2002. Rahman died of hypothermia after an official identified in the report as CIA OFFICER 1 ordered that he be shackled to the wall of his cell so he had to rest on the bare concrete floor, naked from the waist down. Yet four months after Rahman died, the CIA Station in Afghanistan recommended that CIA OFFICER 1 “receive a ‘cash award’ of $2,500 for his ‘consistently superior work.’”\n\nWhen a CIA Accountability Board recommended in 2005 that CIA OFFICER 1 be suspended for ten days without pay due to Rahman’s death, the CIA’s Executive Director overrode that minimal punishment, and no one was disciplined at all for the homicide. This is just one of several examples of the agency failing to hold employees accountable, or imposing minimal consequences for egregious errors.\n\nWhile the CIA’s official response to the Senate torture report acknowledges “significant shortcomings in CIA’s handling of accountability” for failures and abuses that occurred during the rendition and black site program, it still does not recommend any corrective action. The response instead states that the agency “do[es] not believe it would be practical or productive to revisit any [rendition, detention and interrogation program]-related case so long after the events unfolded,” thinking it sufficient to say:\n\nLooking forward, the Agency should ensure that leaders who run accountability exercises do not limit their sights to the perpetrators of the specific failure or misconduct, but look more broadly at management responsibility and more consistently at any systemic issues … [N]o board should cite a broader issue as a mitigating factor in its accountability decision on an individual without addressing that issue head on.\n\nThe CIA Accountability Board’s December report on the agency’s search of Senate computers is the first test of whether these reforms have any meaning or effect. And the answer is: they do not. As before, the CIA has overridden the Inspector General’s findings, decided to hold no one accountable, and failed to address the crucial underlying issues.\n\nThe OIG released its report about the agency’s search of Senate staffers’ computers on the same day that the CIA released the Accountability Board report. The OIG report was completed in July 2014, but was withheld for months from both the public and from most of the Senate staffers whose network drives the CIA had searched. The result? The OIG’s findings have been overshadowed by the Accountability Board’s much less independent and credible report.\n\nOver and over, the OIG report corroborates and expands on the allegations in Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) March 2014 floor speech on the CIA’s search of SSCI computers and attempts to refer Senate staff for prosecution. Meanwhile, the Accountability Board rejects the OIG’s conclusions in favor of the self-justifications offered by the CIA employees responsible for the search of Senate computers and unfounded criminal referral against Senate staff.\n\nA. The CIA Lawyer’s Memo\n\nOne of the central figures in the dispute between the CIA and its Senate oversight committee is the unnamed lawyer in the agency’s Office of the General Counsel who initiated the search of Senate computers. A five-page memo by this attorney rationalizing his actions is included as an appendix to the OIG report. This memo reflects a disturbing tendency to treat oversight as a crime, which the OIG rightly rejected but the Accountability Board Report concludes was “reasonable.”\n\nThe lawyer states that by January 9, 2014, he became suspicious that Senate staffers had seen “classified, draft, pre-decisional, privileged documents” that the CIA never wanted them to see. These are the documents known as the “Panetta Review.” According to multiple accounts, unlike the CIA’s official response to the Senate torture report — which, according to Senator Feinstein, the lawyer delivered to the committee — the Panetta Review concedes that the agency deceived policymakers about torture for years.\n\nIn response, the CIA lawyer assigned IT staff to search Senate staffers’ side of RDINet, the computer network that staffers used to review documents for the torture study. The attorney presents himself as having not only the legal right, but also the duty, to take these actions because of the CIA’s statutory obligation to protect “sources and methods.” He claims that the letters exchanged between then-CIA Director Panetta and Senators on the Intelligence Committee about RDINet in 2009 did nothing to limit the CIA’s authority to investigate a “possible security breach” and the CIA “could not have lawfully done so.”\n\nThe attorney also presents himself as having the active support of CIA Director John Brennan in his investigation of Senate staff. His memo states that on January 10, 2014, Brennan “directed [him] to pursue all available options to determine how the documents came to be on the SSCI side of the system.” The next day, Brennan called him at home, and “emphasized that [the lawyer] was to use whatever means necessary to answer the question.”\n\nThe memo also states that Brennan eventually ordered a “pause” in the investigation to notify the intelligence committee leadership of the investigation. This was contrary to the lawyer’s advice that “the conduct in question could be criminal,” and that informing the Senate “would result in the potential targets of the investigation — SSCI staff — being informed of the investigation, and would permit them to ‘get their story straight’ prior to being interviewed by Agency security officers or law enforcement.” But the attorney also claims that Brennan subsequently assured him that he “supported all [of the lawyer’s] actions in this matter.”\n\nB. The OIG Report\n\nThe OIG report decisively rejected the CIA lawyer’s rationale for searching Senate computers, and instead finds that he and four other CIA employees acted “improperly” when they accessed Senate staffers’ drives.\n\nThe OIG report bases this conclusion in part on “a series of written letters” between Panetta, Feinstein, then-Vice Chairman Kit Bond (R-Mo.) and their staffs, that demonstrate “a common understanding reached between the CIA and the SSCI.” Those documents state repeatedly that the Senate side of the RDINet network would be “walled off,” accessible only to the committee and to CIA IT technicians for routine maintenance and monitoring. Both CIA and Senate documents reflect an agreement that any additional CIA access had to be specifically “authorized by the Committee or its staff.”\n\nThe OIG report concludes that the CIA’s searches of the Senate network violated this agreement. The report’s description of the searches is heavily redacted, but makes clear how far CIA employees strayed from routine network administration or monitoring. For example, following instructions from CIA lawyers, IT personnel “set up a user profile on RDINet that was configured with the same privileges as a SSCI Majority staff user.” They used this dummy account to “run Google queries with the same permissions as a SSCI staffer to see what they were able to view in their search results,” and to open some of the documents.\n\nThere were also additional searches of Senate drives, with involvement by the CIA’s Counterintelligence Center as well as IT personnel. These searches were clearly conducted without the intelligence committee’s knowledge or consent.\n\nRegarding the CIA lawyer’s claim that Brennan told him to “use whatever means necessary” to find out how Senate staff had accessed the Panetta review, Brennan did not deny that the phone call occurred, but said there was “a difference in emphasis” between what he told the CIA lawyer and what the lawyer wrote in his memo. According to the OIG report, “Brennan stated that he would never used those words and had not stated that … Brennan stated that he wanted to know how the documents got to the SSCI side but did not direct anyone to review SSCI systems.” On January 14, 2014, Brennan reportedly ordered CIA personnel to “stand down” from further investigations of Senate staff until he could brief the intelligence committee’s leadership. Despite this order, on January 16 and 17, the CIA’s Office of Security’s Cyber Blue Team conducted another search of Senate staff drives. OIG found that this review included a “keyword search of all and a review of some of the emails of SSCI Majority staff members” on the RDINet system.\n\nOn February 7, 2014, the CIA’s Acting General Counsel Robert Eatinger (whose name is redacted from the OIG report) filed a crimes report against Senate staff with the Department of Justice. The OIG report found that the crimes report “was unfounded,” in part because Eatinger “had been provided inaccurate information on which the letter was based.” In particular, the OIG wrote:\n\n[T]he crimes report stated that SSCI staffers might have exploited a software vulnerability on RDINet to obtain access to the [Panetta Review documents], in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act … The report was solely based on inaccurate information provided by the two [Office of the General Counsel] attorneys [to the Office of Security].\n\nThe OIG report found that there was indeed “a vulnerability” with the Google search tool that the CIA provided to the committee, which was “not configured to enforce access rights or search permissions within RDINet and its holdings” from 2009 to April 2013. But contrary to the CIA lawyer’s memorandum and the crimes report to DOJ, OIG found no evidence that Senate staff had deliberately “exploited” this flaw until CIA personnel “confronted them” with inappropriately accessed documents. Rather, it was SSCI staff who brought the vulnerability to the CIA’s attention. On November 1, 2012, a SSCI staff member alerted CIA staff that the search tool “was indexing the Majority staff work product on a shared drive,” and asked them to make it stop. The CIA did not act on this request for months. Then in 2013, a SSCI staff member requested “a number of detainee videos not provided to the SSCI by the CIA,” based on a spreadsheet that a CIA employee recognized as being from the Panetta Review. After this incident, in April 2013, CIA IT staff finally discovered and repaired the flaw with the Google search tool.\n\nThese actions are not consistent with Senate staffers knowingly “exploiting a vulnerability” in a CIA firewall. They are consistent with the CIA providing a Google search tool that did not work the way it was supposed to work. As Senator Feinstein said on the Senate floor in March 2014,\n\n[C]ommittee staff did not “hack” into CIA computers to obtain these documents as has been suggested in the press. The documents were identified using the search tool provided by the CIA to search the documents provided to the committee.\n\nThat is not a crime or anything close to a crime. But the Accountability Board, handpicked by Brennan, has concluded that it was “reasonable” for CIA attorneys to treat it as one.\n\nC. The Accountability Board Report\n\nThe Accountability Board rejects one after another of the OIG report’s conclusions, and recommends against pursuing any form of discipline or accountability for any CIA employee.\n\nContrary to the OIG report, the board found that the 2009 letters between Feinstein and Panetta did not create any binding agreement about the CIA’s access to Senate drives on RDINet. As evidence of this, the board cites occasions when Senate staffers asked for CIA personnel’s assistance to locate documents on the Senate side of the network, and incidents where CIA documents disappeared from the Senate drives without notice. But the former is consistent with the CIA’s agreement to access the Senate side of the network only with SSCI’s authorization, and Feinstein has made clear that she viewed the latter as a violation of SSCI’s agreement with CIA.\n\nThe Accountability Board’s assertion that there was no binding agreement between the committee and the agency contradicts not only Feinstein and the OIG, but the CIA’s position in ongoing litigation. When the CIA is trying to argue against Freedom of Information Act lawsuits for access to the full torture report, it portrays the letters between Feinstein and Panetta in 2009 as stating binding “condition[s] on which SSCI insisted.” When it is trying to justify searches of Senate staffers’ computer drives, the CIA portrays those same letters as barely relevant, let alone binding.\n\nBecause the accountability board found that there was no written agreement governing CIA access to the Senate drives on RDINet, it evaluated the searches under a “reasonable person” standard. It found that all searches conducted before Brennan ordered the searches stopped were “reasonable” attempts to balance the need “to ensure that a CIA system containing substantial sensitive material was secure,” and the need “to safeguard the prerogatives of the Senate.” Only the Cyber Blue Team review of Senate emails is conceded to be “inappropriate,” though the board said it was “benign in intent.”\n\nThe conclusion that the search was reasonable rests partly on National Security Act of 1947 requirement “to protect sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.” But the board never mentions the National Security Act’s statement that:\n\nNothing in this Act shall be construed as authority to withhold information from the congressional intelligence committees on the grounds that providing the information to the congressional intelligence committees would constitute the unauthorized disclosure of classified information or information relating to intelligence sources and methods.\n\nThe board also entirely fails to mention the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that “for any Speech or Debate in either House, [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place.” The Supreme Court stated in Gravel v. United States that the clause “was designed to assure a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation or threats from the Executive Branch,” and held that it applied to staff as well as members. Other Supreme Court precedent makes clear that committee oversight activities are protected, as well as speeches in the Senate chamber.\n\nIncredibly, the Accountability Board report repeatedly cites the need to preserve the CIA’s relationship with the Senate as a justification for searching Senate computers without informing the committee. The board writes that the initial search was “reasonable given the embarrassment to the Agency and harm to the Agency-SSCI relationship that would have resulted from a false allegation.” Further searches were “reasonable” because “this was no normal potential security problem; it involved the United States Senate,” which made it more important to “have explored all alternatives and possible solutions before the problem was confirmed and the D/CIA would have raised it with Senate leaders.”\n\nBut the CIA lawyer’s memo makes it very clear that the purpose of not informing the Senate was not to verify evidence and explore alternatives — which could have been accomplished through dialogue with the committee. The purpose was to gather evidence for a potential criminal prosecution of Senate staff, before Senators could protest or staff could “get their stories straight.” The agency went on to file an inaccurate crimes report against Senate staff with the Department of Justice — a fact that the Accountability Board does not dispute, but barely acknowledges. It is hard to think of anything that could be more damaging to the oversight relationship that the CIA and the White House claim to value so highly. But the Accountability Board fails to identify who was responsible for the inaccurate report to DOJ, fails to recommend that anyone be disciplined for it, and fails to recommend any safeguards against a repetition of the incident.\n\nD. Analysis: Does the CIA Answer to Anyone?\n\nFor all the flaws in the CIA lawyer’s memo, one thing is clear. He and other CIA employees did indeed have Brennan’s full support for the actions they took against Senate staffers. Brennan personally selected every member of the Accountability Board — three of whom are current CIA officers — and the CIA has unreservedly accepted its conclusions.\n\nThe details of the OIG and Accountability Board reports are important, but the larger context is equally significant.\n\nSenate staffers spent six years investigating a state-sanctioned program of torture by the CIA. They uncovered evidence of horrible brutality in violation of federal law, and years of deception to the Congress, the public, and the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, no CIA officers have faced criminal charges for torturing prisoners, and none are likely to, for reasons the DOJ refuses to publicly disclose. Many officers involved in the program’s worst abuses have been repeatedly promoted instead of facing discipline. In contrast, the DOJ prosecuted a former CIA officer for leaking information about the torture program to the press.\n\nI know some of the staffers who wrote the torture report, including the probable subject of the crimes report to the DOJ. They do not leak and have never been credibly been accused of leaking. They do not confirm or deny information that is officially classified, no matter how obvious it is or how many years it has been in the public domain. They scrupulously continue to follow the classification restrictions that the CIA and the committee placed on them, no matter how absurd those restrictions are or how severe the crimes they conceal.\n\nNevertheless, the CIA searched their computer drives and their emails, and referred them to the DOJ for prosecution. Why? Because, in the course of an official Senate investigation into the torture program, they used a CIA-installed Google search tool to find CIA documents about the torture program. They read the documents, despite the fact that they contained a questionable stamp of “privilege,” and preserved them when they thought they were in danger of destruction. The staffers’ actions were not crimes or a security breach justifying a search of Senate computers. Their actions were oversight of an agency in sore need of it.\n\nIf I were an intelligence community whistleblower, or a foreign victim of a human rights abuse by the intelligence community, the staffers who wrote the SSCI report would be my first phone call in the U.S. government. If they are not safe from surveillance or retaliation by the intelligence community for conducting oversight — despite the protection of powerful politicians and the Speech or Debate Clause — we are all in trouble.\n\nCongress wrote the National Security Act of 1947 and provides the intelligence community’s budget; it does not have to allow the CIA to twist the Act to justify spying on its oversight committee. It could amend the National Security Act and similar statutes to place meaningful limits on the definition of “intelligence sources and methods;” right now, there are none. Congress could place statutory limits on the use of dubious claims of “deliberative process” and other executive privileges to withhold essential documents like the Panetta Review and Office of Legal Counsel memos from Congress. The intelligence committees could amend their own rules to lessen the restrictions on sharing basic information about the legislative and oversight process with the public, and to increase staff access to the information they need to conduct oversight. They could push the CIA to appoint a new Inspector General as soon as possible, and use the annual intelligence authorization bill to improve the CIA Inspector General’s authority to conduct investigations and notify Congress of their results. (Senator Feinstein suggested the Executive Branch improve Congress’s and the Inspector General’s access to information in early January, but the administration has largely disregarded these recommendations).\n\nThese changes are unlikely to succeed in the short run, with the new chair of the Senate Intelligence committee actively hostile to oversight. But a member of Congress proposing them would be a start.",

  "latent_2361": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nBack in 1415, with the decadent Borgio papacy nearly 80 years away and the Reformation’s challenge more than a century away, there was no hint that catastrophe was approaching Catholicism itself, even when a three-way battle for the Holy See made a pope resign.\n\nNow, as Pope Benedict XVI prepares to retire on Thursday and his successor’s selection process starts Friday, it takes no church historian to realize that the world’s best-organized faith is in deep moral, institutional and political crisis.\n\nThe writer is a Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nSimilarly, it takes no fortune-teller to predict that the next pope will be expected to impact an embattled Vatican’s relevance in a world wedged between a largely post-religious north and an increasingly Islamist south.The 117 cardinals and archbishops who will convene Friday in the Sistine Chapel are expected to produce a new pope within 24 days, during which they will meet daily in order to hear and scrutinize each other before finally selecting someone in their midst and sending white smoke to billow through the chimney atop St. Peter’s Square.THE MOST vexing crisis pervading the conclave will be the sex-abuse scandals that have shaken the Catholic world in recent years.The abuses, whose main victims were thousands of boys ages 10 to 14, resulted in cover-ups, investigations, prosecutions, convictions and high-profile resignations – most memorably Boston’s Archbishop Bernard Francis Law in 2002 – as well as a flood of lawsuits that have forced some dioceses to shut down entire churches and some to declare bankruptcy.The span of the sex-abuse allegations – multiple countries in four continents over more than half a century – has made some suspect that, just like the dioceses of San Diego, Portland and Tuscon were compelled to declare financial bankruptcy, the entire Church might as well declare moral bankruptcy.The consequent institutional crisis, which the National Catholic Reporter has described as one of the worst in the Church’s history, comes at a time when Catholicism is steadily losing followers.The US has lost more than 1,000 parishes over the past two decades, and European church attendance has plunged to well under 50 percent even in Catholic bastions like Spain and Ireland.While these trends have been accelerated by the recent scandals, they also reflect a rich West’s post-religious Zeitgeist highlighted by abandoned churches’ reincarnation as quaint real estate projects.This, in essence, is the major internal challenge Catholicism faces as its top clergy gather to anoint their new leader. Though this crisis had long matured by the time Benedict began his eight-year papacy, the image problem the Church faced when he entered office has not changed and was in fact exacerbated with this papacy’s own share of brouhahas, from financial disorders in the Vatican’s innermost banking to document leaks from the pope’s innermost chambers.Beyond image, there is no indication that the deeper theological value at play in the sex scandals – clerical celibacy – will be seriously reviewed any time soon. The conservatives who have efficiently resisted contraception and family planning are believed to vastly outnumber the liberals, a ratio that leaves consideration of priestly marriages and feminine priesthood highly unlikely.Moreover, with Islam steadily expanding in Europe while evangelical churches sprout from Brazil to Africa, Catholicism is challenged not only morally but also geographically. Symbolically, Rome’s own great mosque, whose construction was financed by Saudi Arabia, seats 12,000 worshippers representing an estimated one million Muslims throughout Italy whose quest to build yet more mosques is facing political resistance.Understandably, then, some are beginning to eulogize Catholicism as a declining faith whose colorful ceremonies and sprawling business interests can no longer conceal its moral crisis and political irrelevance.Such eulogies have been made in the past and proved premature.BACK IN 1978, with some 100 million Catholics trapped beyond the Iron Curtain while communism coran the world, Stalin’s famous disparagement of the pope as a general with no divisions seemed vindicated.Hardly a decade of history had turned on its head.The daring appointment of a charismatic Polish bishop as pope was soon followed by hugely attended masses beyond the Iron Curtain. Communism’s subsequent downfall was at least partly related to Catholicism’s underestimated energy and untapped resources. Catholicism had displayed such resilience previously, during the Counter-Reformation, when it retook much of the turf it had previously lost to Protestantism.It follows that when the Conclave convenes next Friday, it will try to define the turf it must conquer this century if it is to restore its diminishing historic relevance.While the Church must find a way to restore its following in Europe and North America, that is essentially a defensive battle.To go on the offensive the way it did under John Paul’s leadership, the Vatican will have to seek a geopolitical niche where it can have a relative advantage. And in today’s perplexed international system, such a niche actually exists and begs to be filled. Circling the entire globe, it runs along the cleavage that separates the rich north from the poor south.With Islam mainly in the south, Protestantism mostly in the north and other faiths lacking global reach and pretensions, Catholicism is the only religion firmly positioned to suspend bridges across this fault line. Similarly, with the rich world perplexed in the face of capitalism’s moral failures and economic malfunctions in recent years, the Cardinals may think they can inspire a counter-greed Zeitgeist of chastity and charity.The selection of a charismatic pope from the Third World would help change the subject from recent decades’ sex scandals and the affairs that haunted Benedict’s papacy to issues of wealth and poverty and north-south relations.Then again, to make such a choice, the Conclave must share a sense of historic urgency of the sort it felt in the face of communism’s assault. The Italian names that have been touted – Milan Archbishop Angelo Scola and Cardinal Angelo Bagnasca of Genoa – like Canada’s Marc Ouellet, may fail to deliver such dramatic change. Then again, a choice like Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana is considered problematic because of his anti- Islamic militancy. Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines has been more careful and, at 56, is also younger than the others, who are between the ages of 65 and 72.The next pope may well be someone whose name has not come up at all. But whoever he is, the choice will immediately be interpreted as a statement either for or against change. The Church, after all, did not always confront history’s challenges as successfully as it fought communism. Next month’s choice will therefore be judged by the extent that it resembles one of two precedents: the vision with which the papacy confronted communism or the impotence with which it met fascism.WHILE RELEVANT for a broad range of issues, from clerical morality and Western greed to north-south relations and Islamist expansion, one issue that does not stand to be affected by the papal succession is the Jewish world.Theologically, the transition since Vatican II’s retreat from Christianity’s historic accusations against the Jews has since matured and become a quiet harmony, albeit one where many still find room for improvement.Politically, the Vatican’s full recognition of the Jewish state two decades ago and the papal visits here by both John Paul and Benedict have cemented a normal relationship between the Jewish people and its former archenemy, a relationship Israel can only dream to someday have with its current enemies.Ironically, the Vatican’s current relations with the Jews are much better than its relations with the millions of disenfranchised Catholics whom the new pope will be expected to somehow appease.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Latin American countries are opening their doors to Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country, as Europe struggles with a growing refugee crisis.\n\n'Everyone wants to leave': death of hope drives young Syrians to Europe Read more\n\nChile and Venezuela have this week both offered to take in Syrian refugees , and Brazil said it would continue to welcome people escaping the country’s brutal conflict. Argentina and Uruguay have also created special programs to resettle Syrian refugees since the war started in 2011.\n\nChile’s government said on Tuesday that it would take 100 families seeking refuge “to address the grave humanitarian crisis affecting thousands of Syrian citizens”.\n\n“The decision has already been made by the president and it will happen as soon as possible,” said the foreign minister, Heraldo Muñoz.\n\nOn Monday, Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro said that his country would accept 20,000 refugees from Syria – while at the same time reiterating his support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, whom he described as “the only leader with authority in Syria”.\n\n“I want 20,000 Syrians to come, Syrian families to our Venezuelan homeland to share this land of peace, this land of Christ, and of Bolívar, to work with us and to contribute to … the development of this magic land,” proclaimed Maduro.\n\nThe figure cited by Maduro is just over the estimated 18,000 Colombian nationals who have fled Venezuela since mid-August after a wave of deportations of undocumented migrants there.\n\nBrazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, said she wanted to “reiterate the government’s willingness to welcome those who, driven from their homeland, want to come live, work and contribute to the prosperity and peace of Brazil. Especially in these difficult times, these times of crisis, we have to welcome refugees with open arms.”\n\nA long way from home: Syrians find unlikely refuge in Brazil Read more\n\nBrazil, Latin America’s largest country, has been the main destination for Syrians seeking refuge in the region, with more than 2,000 Syrians granted asylum in the country since the start of the Syrian conflict.\n\nBrazil, which has a large Syrian and Lebanese immigrant population, launched a humanitarian visa programme in 2013 for those affected by the Syrian conflict which gives people the right to apply for refugee status once they are in the country.\n\nArgentina’s “Syria Programme” created special humanitarian visas for Syrians fleeing the conflict, offering permanent residence after three years.\n\nUruguay resettled five Syrian families who had been living in refugee camps in Jordan in 2014. They were offered housing, healthcare, education and financial support from the government, but a year later, the 42 Syrians now want to leave.\n\nIn a protest staged in front of the presidential palace this week, they complained that the country is too expensive and that they have not been able to find jobs. Nonetheless, another group of 80 Syrian refugees is expected to land in the country before the end of the year.\n\nLatin America has a history of taking in immigrants and asylum-seekers from across the world. A wave of Spaniards fled to Latin America during the Spanish civil war and the Franco era, and many Jewish refugees settled in South America during and after the second world war. By the late 20th century, it was Latin America that was producing refugees fleeing civil wars, dictatorships and hardship.\n\nJavier Miranda, director of human rights of the Uruguayan presidency, has said that accepting Syrian refugees is the region’s way of “repaying its debt to the world”.",
  "latent_2537": "Perhaps Neil Young could put on a benefit concert.\n\nBlind River, after all, is where the famous Canadian rock star blew the transmission out of \"Mort,\" his 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse back in the Sixties. That experience inspired Long May You Run – the haunting song Mr. Young performed at the closing ceremonies for the Vancouver Winter Games.\n\nThe singer is also an environmental activist, all for the same green energy that has put this pretty little Northern Ontario community in a situation that has its 3,549 citizens wondering how their $18-million ended up in a garbage dump more than 600 kilometres out of town.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt is a story that begins, as so many such tales do, as something that seemed like a good idea at the time…\n\nIn 2010, encouraged by a provincial initiative to encourage green energy, Blind River arranged to borrow $49.5-million from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. CMHC was offering low-interest loans for infrastructure projects as part of the federal government's Economic Action Plan.\n\nThe town already had its own small hydro dam and a wind turbine. This loan would allow Blind River to build a massive solar farm that would create jobs – much needed in the area – and give its people low-cost, renewable and clean energy. All very admirable.\n\nQuickly, however, the best-laid plans began to go wrong. The solar farm couldn't get approval to hook into the provincial grid. Solving the conductivity problem would prove hugely expensive, so the town looked for an alternative.\n\nThe dam, the turbine and the CMHC loan were all transferred over to North Shore Power Group, which the municipality would take over and own and where the mayor and councillors would be represented on the board. North Shore turned to smaller solar initiatives with some success, investing about $25-million in some 70 new projects that led to a welcome 17 jobs, with more such projects still in development.\n\nThe town had other pressing infrastructure needs, particularly in necessary upgrades, but North Shore had to keep up payments on the CMHC loan, which had a 4.03-per-cent interest rate and was locked in until 2025. The anticipated revenue flow from the solar farm had not materialized.\n\nSo North Shore came up with what seemed an ingenious solution: It would invest the remaining money at a higher interest rate (roughly 7 per cent) and meet the CMHC payments with money earned from this smart investment. Not only would it make money on the investment but it would be part of yet another green energy initiative – an ambitious plan to turn the city of Ottawa's garbage into energy.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPlasco Energy Group had a process called \"plasma gasification\" that could turn vast amounts of waste into electrical power. Entrepreneur Rod Bryden, a former owner of the Ottawa Senators, convinced the city to let a Plasco wholly owned subsidiary, Plasco Trail Road Inc., build a pilot project on city lands.\n\nIf all worked out as expected, then the city would enter into an agreement whereby Trail Roads would take the city's garbage, turn it into electricity, sell the power and pay a royalty to the city. Everyone would win.\n\nBut there were delays. Plasco saw costs rise and target dates revised. A 2008 demonstration seemed to work fine. In 2010, with the Plasco plant still not running as promised, the provincial Ministry of the Environment found problems with smog-causing emissions.\n\nBut still they believed. Ottawa gave extensions. Investors – some of them major players in the field – bought in, as did North Shore Power Group in 2011. North Shore says all was entirely above board and that CMHC agreed that the investment was an allowable use of the funds. North Shore had an engineering review from an internationally recognized expert; it had expert advice from national investment firms; and it had security in that the loan was in the form of a sale leaseback transaction tied to the Plasco Trail Road equipment.\n\nOthers clearly had faith, as well, as investors continued to pour millions into the project well after the Blind River money arrived. The city of Ottawa was convinced enough to strike a 20-year deal with the company to take up to 300 tonnes a day of waste once everything was up and running.\n\nTrouble was, it couldn't get up and running permanently. More investment was needed but wasn't forthcoming. Mr. Bryden left the company a year ago, and rumours swirled through 2014 that the grand plan was on increasingly shaky legs.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nConcerns were rising in Blind River with a municipal election looming in October. Andre Berthelot, an area lawyer, put his name in for mayor and produced a long, well-researched paper he titled, \"A Bit of A Pickle – How Blind River Got Backed into a Corner.\" In the document, Mr. Berthelot spelled out the concerns.\n\nOthers, however, did not share Mr. Berthelot's views. Alex Solomon, another candidate for mayor, told an all-candidates meeting that the investment was all done with proper guidance.\n\n\"We did our due diligence,\" Mr. Solomon told the gathering. \"We didn't just decide to do this. We're proud of it. I'm proud of it. And we will continue to work to make sure that it is a viable project – and it is.\"\n\nMr. Berthelot was convinced it was not viable: \"I've tried to get at the documents provided to the municipality regarding any 'due diligence' by the North Shore Group. The town advised me that it would try to get those materials from North Shore Group but never did so. The North Shore Power Group refused outright, although some documentation they would release if I signed a confidentiality agreement. I refused to do that.\"\n\nNorth Shore contends there are no \"secret\" third-party reports being hidden.\n\nMr. Berthelot says the debate split the town into two camps. \"I was a leper,\" he told The Globe and Mail this week. \"I was not well regarded by many members of council.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the Oct. 27 election, Mayor Sue Jensen was returned to office with 643 votes. Mr. Berthelot was second with 580, Mr. Solomon with 380.\n\nOn Feb. 10, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson announced his city was done with Plasco, as the company had filed for creditor protection. Among the listed creditors was a little town on the shores of Lake Huron, owed $17.92-million.\n\nMrs. Jensen, the mayor, did not respond to requests for an interview, nor did certain members of council. The Ottawa Citizen encountered the same non-response.\n\n\"I think they're embarrassed to a point where they don't want to talk about it,\" Mr. Berthelot said.\n\nGraeme Lowry, the CEO of North Shore Power Group, agreed to answer questions by e-mail, pointing out that the collapse had caught the town by \"surprise\" and that he, personally, was \"deeply saddened\" by events, as he still firmly believes that Plasco could have been \"a clean-tech game changer.\"\n\nMr. Lowry said the town has restructured the remaining loan with CMHC that makes the debt more \"affordable.\" A town council amending agreement obtained by The Globe says the previous annual payments were $4,461,429, but will now fall to $1,115,324 a year – the final one due on March 1, 2037.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Berthelot is pleased that the arrangement should keep North Shore from defaulting on the loan, but the 22 years of built-in debt is a concern. Much will depend on how much can be recovered from the security – \"if anything is, in fact, realized.\"\n\nNorth Shore has hired the law firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon to aid in recovering its money in a possible selloff of assets.\n\n\"We are doing all that is prudent,\" Mr. Lowry said.\n\nMr. Berthelot remains unconvinced. \"Faith is a fine thing,\" he said. \"You have to have it – and hope, as well. But it should be tempered by reality occasionally so that you know what you need to do.\"\n\nIt is a story far from over for little Blind River, the town made famous around the world by Neil Young, a town that now might just as soon never again hear the mournful harmonica lead-in to Long May You Run:\n\n\"We've been through/ some things together/ With trunks of memories/ still to come…\"",
  "latent_2604": "NOTE: I have updated this a little since originally posting it in 2015; I have now added point three.\n\nI received an email a while back from another artist who was just starting out. He had a great portfolio of work but was unsure about how to launch off into the illustration world. Looking back, almost 10 years now, when I started out as a professional illustrator: I was a little naive and wasted a lot of time, money and emotion working things out.\n\n—\n\nI thought I’d offer these points for you to consider, with the hope they can help you avoid some of the pillow punching I went through, and ultimately streamline your journey towards making a career out of creating beautiful artwork for the world.\n\nI’m sure there’s a number of different articles out there talking about similar things, and you may already know about this stuff or maybe it won’t necessarily apply to what you do. So I’ll just say the following is my personal take on what I think are the essential ingredients that, at a bare minimum, need to be in place to make your way towards illustration success. There are many other little clumps of clay to slap on top but I think everything else builds on the foundation of these seven.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I apologise in advance for this epic post – I was riding a tidal wave of caffeine. Anyway if you’re in a hurry here’s the TL;DR jump-to links:\n\n—\n\n1.WEBSITE [PORTFOLIO]\n\nFirst and foremost you need to show people what you do. Your website should be simple – first impressions are everything, and people have a short attention span these days. Lay it out so your portfolio is the first thing visitors see when they land on your site, and organise the portfolio to show off your best/most popular work first.\n\nAvoid having submenus or dropdown menus for your work – new visitors just want to see what you do. With submenus you’re already making them think, and like I said people these day will often get impatient as they don’t want to have to make extra decisions.\n\nIt’s like going to a sandwich shop, and having the person behind the counter ask you what you want at every stage: “Would you like cheese? Okay, would you like jalapeños? Salad? Sauce?…” You get frustrated and say, “JUST GIVE ME THE GODDAMN SANDWICH!” Take the decision out of it – just grab their attention first and if they like what you do they’ll check out other stuff. Your site represents you, so I suggest having something that visually looks stylish.\n\nHere are a quick couple of really good examples of straight-to-the-point yet slickly designed portfolios: Olly Moss and Alexander Wells\n\nIf you don’t have time right now to sort a good looking website then Behance is a great temporary alternative. It’s simple and stylish, it’s used by creative professionals and hiring clients to scout artists and it’s free. Also, it’s a great platform for sharing your work, learning what others like and finding inspiration. It’s a good place to start if you haven’t got a website going or just don’t have time at the moment.\n\n2. POWERFUL PORTFOLIO\n\nI have a quote above my desk that reads “GREAT PORTFOLIOS GENERATE GREAT WORK.” I think I got it from this book Illustration 101 by Max Scratchmann. It’s a bit outdated now but there is still some good advice in there.\n\nKnow what kind of work you want to be creating – the kind of work that would be a dream to be making every day – and gear your portfolio to attracting that audience/clientèle. Keep your work consistent in overall “look” and present your best work first. It’s better to have ten captivating images than 20-30 that are “meh”.\n\nIt’s tempting to include work that you really like but is in a completely different style to most of your other work; if you really like working in more than one style I’d suggest creating an alias for your other “style”, with a separate portfolio, website and marketing strategy. This isn’t uncommon.\n\nDo not cater to the masses. I remind myself to create art in a style that I love, with subject matter that inspires me, if I love it then I’m sure there is at least one other person out there that will like it. You don’t want to look back, at the end of your days, and realise you did it all for other people, people whom you probably never met.\n\nYour portfolio should be based around “your thing”; you might just want to create artwork to sell (posters, merchandise etc.), or want to get into creating comic art, or you might want to focus on getting particular kinds of commissioned jobs etc. Decide on what kind of work you want to be creating day-to-day and stick to it.\n\n3. DON’T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB\n\nIt’s a romantic notion to think of working every day from home, creating artwork all day long and getting paid for it. While this is by all means a possible way of life as an illustrator, there are a couple of reasons I would say it would be best to keep a regular job on the side, especially at the start.\n\nListen, you’d be crazy to jump ship and battle the seas on your own without getting together a boat, paddle, nets to catch fish and some sunblock. It doesn’t make sense to drop your main means of income before you at least have a portfolio together, or a couple of completed jobs under your belt or a customer base for the products you sell.\n\nAnd even if you did have all that together there are two main reasons I’d say you should keep a side job: a regular income and human interaction (keeping sane).\n\nRegular income: Having a separate income takes the pressure off trying to pay rent and buy food with an income solely from illustration gigs (which can be few and far between). Stress kills creativity.\n\nFor years I was working full time as an illustrator at home, and I thought the idea of taking on a side job would somehow mean I wouldn’t have time to take on illustration commissions if they came in. Here’s the reality; at one point I was able to work a full time job (9 – 5, Mon – Fri) and work on two separate commissions, all at the same time. This spanned a couple of weeks and meant I had no free time, but I made it work, and delivered the work successfully on time. So if I was able to do it with a full time job, there’s no reason I couldn’t do this with a part time job. Obviously if you are working 60+ hour weeks in your current job, then you will have to scale back your hours or find a new day job to have enough time and energy to pursue commissions or develop your illustration.\n\nHuman interaction: Working from home as your own boss is all great and everything but the one thing it lacked for me was human interaction. It can definitely get lonely. Getting out of your “home-working bubble” is good for you – not only psychologically but also creatively – but I won’t go into that now. I would suggest finding something completely different to what you do at home. For example, a more physical job, on your feet, where you have a lot of interpersonal interactions with others. This can also help out a lot with the following point…\n\n4. GET OUT [SOCIALISE]\n\nIt took me a while to get things going as a professional illustrator but I can say one of the biggest factors was meeting people, and surrounding myself with other creative people. Don’t picture this wrongly. I’m not some outgoing socialite that’s chatting to people all the time – closer to the opposite in fact – but there have been a few opportunities that have come my way just by being amongst other people. Sort of “in the right place at the right time” kinda thing.\n\nOne of my first clients was someone that I met through my housemate at the time who ran a big design company. One day he asked me if I could produce something for him; off the back of that successful job more jobs came.\n\nAnother example is of a guy from my uni course who I bumped into years later, and by this point I had heard he had landed a job creating illustrations for a well known international TV series (which they ended up hiring him for on every new season from then on). Asking him how he got the gig, he said he had been working in the office of the production company of the show, just doing general office work. He happened to hear they were looking for an illustrator for this new reality TV series and pretty much said, “well actually, I do artwork…”, they liked his stuff, and the rest was history.\n\nIf you live in the middle of nowhere it could be difficult and I’d honestly say try moving to somewhere more happening or with at least an openness to creativity, though sometimes your situation might not allow that.\n\nSome other things you can do:\n\nHire shared studio space – great for being “in the same boat” as other creative people, which helps with inspiration, motivation, referrals to potential clients and solidarity. [This is the main benefit of doing a university course, not necessarily learning your trade but simply being amongst others that do what you do.]\n\nCreative meetups/social events – I used to do a regular “Drink n Draw” social in my city – it’s fun, sociable, improves your creativity, and you get to see how other creative minds think. My friend couldn’t find one where we lived so he decided to start one himself and yes, sometimes there was only two of us.\n\nExhibitions/art events – for inspiration, seeing how others do it, new ideas… make sure to chat to the exhibition host about the artist.\n\nI’m terrible at describing my work to people so now I say “It’ll be easier if I show you” – have images on your phone to show people mid-conversation what you do. Get the Behance app if you have a Behance portfolio.\n\nMost illustrators are hidden away, immersing themselves in their artwork – that’s just part of the life, but for your sanity if nothing else you need to get out of the bubble every once in a while.\n\nHEAR THIS: You are the make up of the people you spend most of your time with. If your goal is to create great artwork, or work in the creative industry you should have at least a couple of people in your circle that are in this sort of industry. Hang out with other illustrators, graphic designers, animators, modelmakers and painters. Or if you want to be self-employed find others that are also and learn from each other. By spending the majority of your time with similar minds, you’ll feel inspired, driven, supported when you’re demotivated and generally in a conducive environment that will steer things in the right direction.\n\n5. PROMO STRATEGY [FIND PEOPLE THAT LOVE WHAT YOU DO]\n\nFor years I was approaching this all wrong and it was honestly the cause of quite a bit of anxiety and distraction… “Which social media do I focus on? There’s so many now, but if I’m active on all of them I might miss the gravy train!” “Am I putting in enough time?” “I need to ENGAGE!”\n\nYour means of promotion for your business or “brand” will be based on the kind of work you create. But I’m not going to tell you where you should be promoting yourself or to whom, as that’s a whole article in itself, but I will say the most important thing when it comes to selling is defining and finding your fans.\n\nKevin Kelly’s 1000 True Fans is a short but very eye-opening article on how you can have your fans support you through the things you create. If you don’t like reading (shame on you!), here is an interview with him – you can skip to 2:45 for the explanation.\n\nAlso a while ago I came across Chris Wilson’s stuff, an artist himself who also started sharing his strategy on how to find your audience, engage with them and ultimately be paid for doing what you love. It’s probably because of him you’re reading this article right now.\n\nI subscribed to his weekly newsletter and each week he imparted golden advice on how to promote your artwork by being more intelligent with your approach. He made so much sense that I later decided to buy his online course on selling your art, and it’s honestly one of the best things I could have done.\n\nIf nothing else I’d definitely advise signing up to his newsletter via his website as he gives a lot of good advice and is always happy to answer questions.\n\n6. SIDE PROJECTS\n\nAnother quote which I always remind myself of is “create while you wait” from this highly recommended book Mastering Creative Anxiety by Eric Maisel.\n\nI apply this in two different ways. The minor one being, if I’m working on a piece and it’s not looking the way I want, instead of getting frustrated, which would lead me to procrastinate, I will move my attention to another creative thing – e.g. finishing another drawing I started, working on another piece or idea, or another task for that day. So at least you’re doing something productive with your procrastination.\n\nThe other and more major way I apply this is to focus on personal projects and ideas in between commissions. Chris Oatley, another great artist & teacher, did a great series of blog posts on Creative Side Projects.\n\nThere are two main reasons why I think they are necessary. One is they are a great way to develop your portfolio. And two, they are necessary for the “Long game”. Meaning, you can’t realistically rely on commissions as an illustrator, or at least not forever. They are very rarely regular (e.g. every week). The ability to make a viable income lies in the hands of the person/company hiring you. And then who’s to say they won’t find someone else to do what you do for them. So, that’s why I think it’s important to create something that generates a passive income for you: prints for sale, a picturebook, merchandise, a comic, artwork for a product or game where you can take royalties instead of a fixed fee.\n\nThis is taking matters into your own hands and not being at the mercy of people paying you to work for them. Like I said this can be done while you’re waiting for your next commission to start. You have the luxury of living in a time in which you can harness the power of the web, with things like crowd-funding helping to realise your creative visions, big and small.\n\n7. DRAW/DOODLE\n\nIf you’re a creator of any kind I honestly think you should be regularly doodling and expressing your imagination on a page, computer, tablet or toilet cubicle wall. Your ability to draw well is irrelevant here, as the act of drawing is about finding out a little about yourself, in a similar way writing does. If you take the need to be perfect out of the equation look at this as a means of relaxation, or meditation if that’s your jam. The things you like, the way your mind works, new weird ideas. Essentially your uniqueness, your quirkiness. Forget about showing this stuff to anybody – sure if it’s good, and you want to, share it, but this is for you first and foremost.\n\nKeep a pen/pencil and paper nearby you, or on your person at all times; this stops you from “thinking about” doing it and the tools are just there, at hand ready to go. Don’t think, just start. Sometimes you come up with crap; other times, gold.\n\nAnd it doesn’t have to be an hour session, it can be five minutes. Find little pockets of time which you usually occupy with unproductive things like phone crap. Here’s an idea instead of getting your phone out when you’re waiting for your bus, train, whatever, replace that phone with a mini sketch pad and take a look around. You’ll notice things you hadn’t before and become more observant.\n\nYou’re a creative; this is where you can train your creative muscle to be STRONG LIKE BULL.\n\nOn that point, my friend shared this with me recently and I thought it was brilliant, inspiring and hilarious: Peter Draws: drawing your feelings (a calm guide) If you have time watch the whole thing, it doesn’t disappoint.\n\nBONUS ROUND\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nI keep a folder on my computer that’s full of inspirational artwork. We all suffer from creative dips and lack of motivation. Keeping a folder full of beautiful artwork or bookmarking websites of my favourite artists usually gives me an injection of drive.\n\nSOURCE IMAGES\n\nAs well as a folder for inspiration, I keep a folder full of source photos I’ve captured over the years. These are divided into Subfolders of: Nature & Close-ups, Outdoor & Landscapes, People & Poses, Structural.\n\nThey are mostly taken when I’ve been out and about and I’ve seen something which looks worth capturing on camera. It might be something with good lighting, a unique looking tree, interesting architecture etc.\n\nThe main reason for having this folder is for quick access to images when someone hires you and you have a short deadline. We don’t always have time to go out of the house to get reference photos and can’t always rely on Google for these things. So start collecting your own.\n\nSo there it is! Well did you get any value from this? Did it open your EYES? Fire over any comments or questions you may have below!

The upshot, Thompson stressed, is that Republicans should \"exercise some caution\" when talking about the president personally.\n\nOn the call--which Yahoo News was invited to attend because of a mistake by someone on the staff of the Republican National Committee--Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary for George W. Bush, encouraged Republicans to turn around Democratic attacks lobbed at the GOP presidential candidates (Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, for starters) for \"flip-flopping.\"\n\n\"I don't like playing defense,\" Fleischer said. He suggested the listeners to Tuesday's call label the president as a flip-flopper on the following issues: opposing tax increases for those making under $250,000, opposing the Bush tax cuts, opposing raising the debt limit, and opposing a health care mandate.\n\n\"When it comes to flip flopping, Barack Obama is the king of flip flopping,\" Fleischer said. \"You can offer that to anybody,\" he suggested.\n\nThompson noted that Obama may be boxed in by similarly strong personal approval numbers for Republican lawmakers as he ponders attacking the GOP House majority during the 2012 campaign.\n\n\"\n\nObama running against Congress is not going to work,\" Thompson said.\n\nIn a poll conducted in early November by the Tarrance Group and the Democratic group Lake Research for Politico and George Washington University, voters gave their personal member of Congress a 46 percent approval rating--even higher than the 44 percent personal approval numbers for Obama in the survey, Thompson said. (The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.)\n\nFifty-eight percent of the voters surveyed disapproved of how Obama is handling relations with Congress, according to Tarrance's November poll.\n\n\"It's a tough road for him when you look at those numbers,\" Thompson said of the president.\n\nThompson said that his group's research suggests that voters are giving Obama higher approval on foreign policy than on the issue of jobs and the economy.\n\nVoters aren't simply looking at the president as the symbol for a \"broken Washington,\" Thompson said.\n\nUpdate 3:40 p.m.: Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer followed up with Yahoo News to say the story \"misses the point\" and that Tuesday's call wasn't about ways to avoid attacking the president, it was about sharing the best strategies for attacks. \"It makes more sense to focus on his failed policies than on personal attacks,\" Spicer told Yahoo News of their data regarding the president.\n\nAri Fleischer also emailed Yahoo News to share his complete list of Obama flip-flops, which, in addition to the points above, includes: promising to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term; vowing to lower unemployment below 8 percent following the stimulus; falling short on shovel-ready jobs; contradicting himself on constitutional rights-- condemning Bush but then supporting \"warrantless wiretaps, indefinite detentions, secret renditions and kept [Guantanamo] open; giving lobbyists waivers to work at the White House after saying they wouldn't work there; and refusing public financing in 2008 after vowing to accept it.\n\nOther popular Yahoo!

They build it, they maintain it. And the general public benefits.\n\nEvergreen Mountain Bike Alliance wanted more Eastside bike trails. King County Parks, through its Community Partnerships and Grants Program, handed over basic construction money and signed up the mountain bike group and its scores of volunteers to build the bike park on county land.\n\nBut stretched resources spawn innovation, such as the partnership program that has created the Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park.\n\nPublic parks agencies used to do it all: own the park, construct paths, maintain improvements, and so on.\n\nFor information on the Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance, including a schedule of mountain-bike skills classes to help you ride places such as Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park, see www.evergreenmtb.org.\n\nEMBA holds Duthie Hill work parties four times weekly: 2 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 10 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Call 425-241-7806 or 206-335-8361 for more information, or check the club Web site under \"Recreation.\"\n\nThe Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park grand opening is slated for May 22. Tentative plans are for a ribbon-cutting ceremony, poker ride, bike vendor tents, skills demonstrations, demo bikes, raffles and more. The Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance's Web site ( www.evergreenmtb.org ) will provide details as they emerge.\n\nDuthie Hill Mountain Bike Park is at 27101 Duthie Hill Road, between Sammamish and Fall City. To get there, take Interstate 90 to Exit 17 in Issaquah and go north on Front Street North. Curve left as the road becomes East Lake Sammamish Parkway and turn right onto Issaquah-Fall City Road. Follow for four miles (the road becomes Duthie Hill Road) to the Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park parking lot, on the right. Note: On busy weekends, the Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance recommends parking about a mile away, at Endeavour Elementary School's parking lot (26205 Issaquah-Fall City Road), and riding to Duthie Hill Park.\n\nWe're about halfway through the Boot Camp trail at the new Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park when our paths diverge. Mike Westra, who's giving me a tour of the place, takes a minor detour to the right — he hops his bike up onto a foot-wide fallen log and, with great skill and concentration, begins to pedal down the length of it. At log's end, he rides right onto a connecting fallen log, and continues meting out his speed and balance to keep from falling the foot or so to the ground where I've got my bike tires firmly planted.\n\nOn and on Westra goes, following one connecting downed log after another. Zigging to the left when the logs lead that way and zagging to the right when he has to. On and on for 450 feet — the length of one-and-a-half football fields!\n\n\"That's the world's-longest log ride,\" a slightly out-of-breath Westra says after hopping off the final log and back down to earthen trail.\n\n\"We came across a bunch of blowdown all in here and decided to connect them to make one huge log ride.\"\n\nWestra, of Seattle, is project manager for the Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance (EMBA), a Seattle-based organization with more than 5,000 members that is building and will maintain the Duthie Hill bike park in cooperation with King County Parks, which owns it. Readying the park for its May 22 grand opening is Westra's current main project. The 120-acre park on the Sammamish Plateau, between the towns of Sammamish and Fall City, promises something for just about every stripe of rider given to putting knobby tire to dirt trail.\n\nMiles of buff, mostly flat but still plenty curvy-swervy, cross-country trails; technical free-ride routes with wood structures offering deep drops, table tops and ramps for launching oneself airborne; fast, flowy downhill sections, and lots more. Though the grand opening is still a couple months away, about 90 percent of the park's Phase One trails are open now and being enjoyed by riders.\n\nHard-core and more\n\n\"Usually you go to a bike park and they only have hard-core stuff for riders like him, but nothing for me,\" says Angela Earle while pointing at her body-armor- wearing husband Randy Earle, a former downhill mountain-bike racing champion. They've come over from Seattle.\n\n\"But this place has lots of cool stuff for both of us; I like to challenge myself a little but I don't want to do the crazy stuff he does.\"\n\nWhile there's certainly plenty of \"crazy stuff\" at Duthie Hill — double-black diamond drops and jumps off impressively built wood structures that seem almost like works of art — all of these trails will have options; that is, ways to ride around the really tricky parts without having to leave the ground or even put a foot down. Say your friend wants to try that world's longest log ride but you're more of a terra firma fan; you can basically ride alongside him or her without lifting your wheels off the dirt. Thus, just about all of Duthie Hill can be ridden and experienced by newbies and kids.\n\n\"No doubt, getting kids out here is one of our goals,\" says Westra, of the club's guiding principles in designing the park.\n\n\"It's important for kids to get outside and to be doing something different besides this,\" he says, miming someone texting on a cellphone.\n\nJampacked thrill ride\n\nIt's an understatement to say that EMBA trail builders are experts at maximizing space. See their I-5 Colonnade mountain-bike skills park, created in cooperation with Seattle Parks and Recreation Department, located under Interstate 5 between Eastlake and Capitol Hill: In just two acres, Evergreen managed to fit dozens of dirt jumps and elevated drops, a pump track, a trials area, a half-mile of cross-country trail, a learning area and more.\n\nThough the Duthie Hill park is spread out across 120 mostly forested acres, it has a similar jampacked feel. Four main cross-country trails fan out from a central open practice area in cloverleaf fashion, each one a mile to mile-and-a-half long. Within each clover leaf are more technical downhill and/or free-ride trails with big jumps and drops.\n\nAt 2.5 acres, the park's central area offers an open space with skinnies, logs and progressive drops for riders to hone their skills or just warm up. It's also the perfect classroom for the club's instructional mountain-biking classes, which are offered two Saturday mornings each month.\n\n\"Eventually, we also want to offer advanced skills classes where we teach people how to safely ride some of the bigger, more technical structures,\" Westra says.\n\nThat open area is conducive also for holding events, such as the May 22 grand-opening celebration, and club-sponsored races, such as the Duthie Hill Dash, tentatively planned for June 19.\n\nBoardwalk welcomes\n\nEvergreen's trail builders know something about making a good first impression, too. To get to the park's trails from the Duthie Hill Road parking lot, you first ride atop a winding 200-yard-long boardwalk that weaves and wends its way through a stand of alders. The sensation is that of floating through the forest, as if you were an owl or a raven winging it through the woods to an adventure beyond.\n\nEntering the park from the south, while not quite as aesthetically pleasing, has its own advantages. Duthie Hill Park essentially connects to Grand Ridge Park, another King County Parks property, which has its own six-mile-long mountain-bike trail, meaning that it's possible to pedal about seven miles from Interstate 90 to Duthie Hill, just about all of it off-road.\n\nThe idea of using Duthie Hill as a mountain-bike park first began showing up on people's radar about five or six years ago. With bikes not allowed in much of the Issaquah Alps — or allowed only in limited areas at certain times of the year — Eastside mountain bikers were struggling to come up with places to ride. Putting their collective heads together, EMBA and King County Parks found a solution.\n\n\"Checking our inventory, the park really jumped out as an ideal place for a bike park,\" says Butch Lovelace, program manager with King County Parks. \"Not only because of its proximity to Seattle, but also because of the high density of youth up there on the Plateau.\"\n\nAbout two years ago, King County Parks awarded EMBA $200,000 in grants to build the park and work began. Westra says that club members have logged some 6,000 hours in volunteer work hours getting the park ready for the grand opening.\n\n\"We're looking forward to a general good-time celebration,\" Westra says. \"And then we'll take a break and then we'll begin work on Phase Two.\"\n\nEMBA hopes to complete Phase Two, which includes additional cross-country and free-ride trails, as well as more learning and technical features, in April 2011.\n\nMike McQuaide is a Bellingham freelance writer and author of \"Day Hike!

You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser.\n\n[ download ]\n\nThis past April, Brooklyn hip-hop artist Theophilus London released his first proper full-length, the highly acclaimed, Smiths-referencing This Charming Man. However, London first garnered attention in 2008 with his riveting (and free) JAM! and This Charming Mixtape, which found him nimbly rapping over tracks from Kraftwerk and Whitney Houston (!) among others. Since then, he’s toured with A-Trak and previously spotlighted artist Jack Penate, introducing his blend of solid rhymes and impressionistic electronic beats to new audiences and garnering coverage from the likes of Rolling Stone (blah) and The New York Times (huzzah!). London, who goes by his real name, is blessed with the sort of innately cool style that can’t really be cultivated, and it shines through in everything from his Reid Miles-looking album art to the perfect cadence of his flows.\n\n“Humdrum Town” is the latest digital single from the Green Label Sound project and finds London again paying titular homage to Morrissey & Co., this time in the form of a copped lyric from “William, It Was Really Nothing.” London’s track also sneaks in some of that song’s melancholy; “Humdrum Town” is a hip-hop banger that is too sedate for the dance floor, a chill-out equivalent for the rap-loving hipster set. At times, gauzy synthesizers stretch themselves out slowly like yoga poses behind London’s vocals, while other passages make way for more animated drum machines and staccato synth pin pricks. Fans of The Cool Kids, Spank Rock, and even Top 40 fiends like Kanye and Kid Cudi will be drawn in by Theophilus London’s unique mystique.",
  "latent_2908": "When I caught up with John Kasich yesterday in a Washington sports bar, I asked Ohio’s governor if he could see himself supporting Donald Trump. He shook his head.\n\n“I’m waiting to see if at this point there’s going to be a Damascus Road experience, a dramatic change,” Kasich said. “And I haven’t seen it. You never know when it can happen. But without that, I won’t be involved.”\n\nKasich said he couldn’t even see voting for the guy, though he was quick to add he wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.\n\nI asked him why he thought Republican leaders in Washington continued to profess their support for Trump, even as they denounced his comments.\n\n“Look, I think in either political party, there’s always a tug between party loyalty, being part of the team, and your conscience,” Kasich said. “And there’s a lot of people that are really torn. And I don’t want to excuse them. But human nature being what it is, there’s always a sense of ‘what’s my obligation to the team’ and ‘how does this affect the people I work with.’\n\n“I think that’s why, to some degree, you’re seeing people run away. They won’t even talk to the press. Because they don’t know what to say.”\n\nWhat about his own party loyalty?\n\n“I’m a Republican,” he told me. “I’m going to travel for Republicans. I’m going to help the ticket in Ohio. But I’ve learned over the course of my career that I have to live with myself and with my family.”\n\nYou would think, after the worst mass shooting in American history, and after wave upon wave of Donald Trump’s stunning response to it, elected Republicans would be asking themselves a hard question right now.\n\nAre they going to dutifully follow Trump down this twisted, rapidly descending path to the place where he promises there will be all kinds of winning and “everything is going to be fair” because there’s going to be “total justice”?\n\nOr, like Kasich, are they going to say “enough is enough” and set off in search of higher ground?\n\nI’ve had plenty of fun in this column at Trump’s expense. He’s said so many things over the last several months that cry out for a sense of humor. (I go back to his debate answer when he was asked about the nuclear triad: “I just think nuclear — the power and the devastation are very important to me.”)\n\nBut there’s nothing funny about where we are right now. First Trump took credit for his own prescience before the bodies in Orlando could even be counted. Then he reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States — a proposal he had walked back because rivals and allies alike rejected it.\n\nIn the days since, he’s accused American Muslims of sheltering terrorists and has darkly vowed to keep a closer eye on their places of worship. He’s lied repeatedly about the national origin of the Orlando shooter, who was born in the same New York borough from which Trump himself hails.\n\nHe’s banned one of the nation’s premier newspapers, the Washington Post, from covering his campaign events, adding to his growing media enemies list.\n\nWhy? Because the Post had the temerity to report Trump’s clear insinuation that the president of the United States was hiding his sympathy for foreign terrorists, if not actively aiding them.\n\nAnd to think the Russians had their hackers break into computers at the Democratic National Committee so they could steal the opposition research on Trump. Here’s a tip, Vladimir: Save yourself the trouble and turn on the TV, instead.\n\nI don’t think Trump is a fascist — I really don’t. Fascism requires a belief system. All Trump knows is how to read a room and exploit the most powerful emotion lurking in it.\n\nBut like a storefront psychic who happens upon a genuine spirit, Trump is now playing with powerful historical currents he really doesn’t seem to understand. I can’t shake from my mind a tweet I saw this week from Jared Yates Sexton, a correspondent for the New Republic, who mingled among the crowd of parents and their children at one of these raucous Trump rallies in North Carolina.",
  "latent_3003": "Media manipulation is a series of related techniques in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests.[1] Such tactics may include the use of logical fallacies, psychological manipulations, outright deception, rhetorical and propaganda techniques, and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting attention elsewhere. In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul writes that public opinion can only express itself through channels which are provided by the mass media of communication – without which there could be no propaganda.[2] It is used within public relations, propaganda, marketing, etc. While the objective for each context is quite different, the broad techniques are often similar.\n\nAs illustrated below, many of the more modern mass media manipulation methods are types of distraction, on the assumption that the public has a limited attention span.\n\nContexts [ edit ]\n\nActivism [ edit ]\n\nActivism is the practice or doctrine that has an emphasis on direct vigorous action especially supporting or opposing one side of a controversial matter.[3] It is quite simply starting a movement to effect or change social views. It is frequently started by influential individuals but is done collectively through social movements with large masses.[4] These social movements can be done through public rallies, strikes, street marches and even rants on social media.\n\nA large social movement that has changed public opinion through time would be the 'Civil Rights March on Washington', where Martin Luther King Jr. performed his 'I Have a Dream' speech attempting to change social views on Non-White Americans in the United States of Americ, 28 August 1963. Most of King's movements were done through non-violent rallies and public speeches to show the white American population that they were peaceful but also wanted change in their community. In 1964, the 'Civil Rights Acts' commenced giving Non-White Americans equality with all races.\n\nAdvertising [ edit ]\n\nDaisy \", a TV commercial for the re-election of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson . It aired only once, in September 1964, and is considered both one of the most controversial and one of the most effective political ads in U.S. history.\n\nAdvertising is the action of attracting public attention to something, especially through paid announcements for products and services.[5] This tends to be done by businesses who wish to sell their product by paying media outlets to show their products or services on television breaks, banners on websites and mobile applications.\n\nThese advertisements are not only done by businesses but can also be done by certain groups. Non-commercial advertisers are those who spend money on advertising in a hope to raise awareness for a cause or promote specific ideas.[6] These include groups such as interest groups, political parties, government organizations and religious movements. Most of these organizations intend to spread a message or sway public opinion instead of trying to sell products or services. Advertising can not only be found on social media, it is also evident on billboards, newspapers, magazines and even word of mouth.\n\nHoaxing [ edit ]\n\nA hoax is something intended to deceive or defraud. When a newspaper or the news reports a fake story, it is known as a hoax. Misleading public stunts, scientific frauds, false bomb threats and business scams as hoaxes.[7] A common aspect that hoaxes have is that they are all meant to deceive or lie. For something to become a hoax, the lie must have something more to offer. It must be outrageous, dramatic but also has to be believable and ingenious. Above all, it must be able to attract attention from the public. Once it has done that then a hoax is in full effect.\n\nThe word hoax became popular in the middle to late eighteenth century.[7] It is thought to have come from the saying 'hocus pocus'. Hocus pocus means meaningless talk which is typically designed to trick others or conceal the truth about a situation. It is thought to be derived from a conjuror in the time of King James who called himself 'The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus', where he would perform a trick and call out a phrase beginning with \"hocus pocus\".\n\nThe key word in something becoming a hoax is \"public\". A lie or a deception only becomes a hoax when it is acknowledged by the public. A popular hoax that is evident in today's times would be the 'Microwave your spoon' hoax. This hoax originated from a video which shows a metallic spoon being heated inside a microwave oven. It then further on suggests that it is easier to eat ice cream when the spoon is first microwaved. This hoax has fooled many people on social media into believing that the spoon could be microwaved, only to find that their microwave was damaged. The point of this hoax was to show how gullible people can be on social media and to prove that not everything you read or see on the internet is true.\n\nAn example of a hoax was a fake viral video is one that happened in 2012. Greenpeace paid to have a video made by Yes Men and that Occupy Seattle posted on their website. The video then took off and a lot of companies and people shared it. The video was of a drink fountain that looked like an oil platform at a party for Shell malfunctioning, and getting all over the party. The video then shows the a man telling the person holding the phone camera to stop filming while they are rushed out the door. There were also fake legal messages sent out to make it look like Shell was threatening the people reporting the story. It was very widespread and believed by many.[8]\n\nPropagandising [ edit ]\n\nPropagandising is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument. Propaganda is commonly created by governments, but some forms of mass communication created by other powerful organisations can be considered propaganda as well. As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda, in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the chosen result in audience attitudes. While the term propaganda has justifiably acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples (e.g. Nazi propaganda used to justify the Holocaust), propaganda in its original sense was neutral, and could refer to uses that were generally benign or innocuous, such as public health recommendations, signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election, or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to the police, among others.\n\nPropaganda uses societal norms and myths that people hear and believe. Because people respond to, understand and remember more simple ideas this is what is used to influence people's beliefs, attitudes and values.[9]\n\nPsychological warfare [ edit ]\n\nPsychological warfare is sometimes considered synonymous with propaganda. The principal distinction being that propaganda normally occurs within a nation, whereas psychological warfare normally takes place between nations, often during war or cold war. Various techniques are used to influence a target's values, beliefs, emotions, motives, reasoning, or behavior. Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.\n\nThis tactic has been used in multiple wars throughout history. During World War II, the western Allies, expect for the Soviet Union would drop leaflets on the US and England. During the conflict with Iraq, American and English forces dropped leaflets, with many of the leaflets telling the people how to surrender. In the Korean War both sides would use loud speakers from the front lines.[10] In 2009 people in Israel in the Gaza war received text messages on their cell phones threatening them with rocket attacks. The Palestinian people were getting phone calls and leaflets warning them that they were going to drop rockets on them. These phone calls and leaflets were not always accurate.[11]\n\nPublic relations [ edit ]\n\nPublic relations (PR) is the management of the flow of information between an individual or an organization and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. PR is generally created by specialised individuals or firms at the behest of already public individuals or organizations, as a way of managing their public profile.\n\nTechniques [ edit ]\n\nInternet manipulation [ edit ]\n\nAstroturfing [ edit ]\n\nAstroturfing is when there is an intent and attempt to create the illusion of support for a particular cause, person, or stance. While this is mainly connected to and seen on the internet, it has also happened in newspapers during times of political elections.[12] Corporations and political parties try to imitate grassroots movements in order to sway the public to believing something that isn't true.[13]\n\nClickbait [ edit ]\n\nClickbait refers to headlines of online news articles that are sensationalized or sometimes completely fake. It uses people's natural curiosity to get people to click. In some cases clickbait is simply used to generate income, more clicks means more money made with advertisers.[14] But these headlines and articles can also be used to influence a group of people on social media. They are constructed to appeal to the interest group's pre-existing biases and thus to be shared within filter bubbles.[15]\n\nPropaganda Laundering [ edit ]\n\nPropaganda Laundering is a method of using a less trusted or less popular platform to publish a story of dubious origin or veracity for the purposes of reporting on that report, rather than the story itself. This technique serves to insulate the secondary more established media from having to issue a retraction if the report is false. Generally secondary reports will report that the original report is reporting without verifying or making the report themselves. The news and entertainment site Buzzfeed.com has been used to originate several via their BuzzFeed News section. This term was coined by a Reddit user HexezWork regarding a discussion[16] related to the investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian Collusion.\n\nSearch engine marketing [ edit ]\n\nIn search engine marketing websites use market research, from past searches and other sources, to increase their visibility in search engine results pages. This allows them to guide search results along the lines they desire, and thereby influence searchers.[17][18]\n\nBusiness have many tactics to lure customers into their websites and to generate revenue such as banner ads, search engine optimization and pay-per-click marketing tools. They all serve a different purpose and use different tools that appeal to multiple types of users. Banner ads appear on sites that then redirect to other sites that are similar. Search engine optimization is changing a page to seem more reliable or applicable than other similar pages. Pay-per-click involves certain words being highlighted because they were bought by advertisers to then redirect to a page containing information or selling whatever that word pertained to. By using the internet, users are susceptible to these type of advertisements without a clear advertising campaign being viewed.\n\nDistraction [ edit ]\n\nDistraction by major events [ edit ]\n\nCommonly known as \"smoke screen\", this technique consists of making the public focus its attention on a topic that is more convenient for the propagandist. This particular type of media manipulation has been referenced many times in popular culture. Some examples are:\n\nThe movie Wag the Dog (1997), which illustrates the public being deceitfully distracted from an important topic by presenting another that whose only quality is that of being more attractive.\n\n(1997), which illustrates the public being deceitfully distracted from an important topic by presenting another that whose only quality is that of being more attractive. In the U.S. TV series House of Cards, when protagonist Frank Underwood finds himself trapped in a media rampage, he addresses the viewer and says: \"From the lion's den or a pack of wolves. When you're fresh meat, kill and throw them something fresher\".\n\nPoliticians distract the public by showing them \"shiny object\" issues through the use of TV and other media. Sometimes they can be as simple as a politician with a reality show, like Sarah Palin had for a short time back in 2009, which aired on TLC.[19]\n\nDistracting the public [ edit ]\n\nThis a mere variation of the traditional arguments known, in logic, as ad hominem and ad populum but applied to countries instead of individuals. This technique consists on refuting arguments by appealing to nationalism or by inspiring fear and hate towards a foreign country or to all the foreigners. It has the potential of being important since it gives the propagandists the power to discredit any information coming from other countries.\n\nSome examples are:\n\nQ: \"What do you think about Khokara's politic on X matter?\" A: \"I think they've been wrong about everything for the last 20 years or so...\"\n\nQ: \"Your idea is quite similar to the one proposed in Falala.\" A: \"Are you suggesting Falala is a better country than ours?\"\n\nStraw man fallacy [ edit ]\n\nAn informal fallacy. The \"straw man\" consists on appearing to refute the opponent's argument while actually attacking another topic. For it to work properly the topic that was actually refuted and the one that should have been refuted need to be similar.\n\nDistraction by scapegoat [ edit ]\n\nThis is a combination of the straw man fallacy and the ad hominem argument. It is often used to incriminate someone in order to argument the innocence of someone else.\n\nThis is a very important tactic for governments and politicians, and it even made its way to the famous book The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene, in the Law #26 titled: \"Keep you hands clean\".\n\nPhoto manipulation [ edit ]\n\nVisual media can be transformed through photo manipulation, commonly called \"photoshopping.\" This can make a product, person, or idea seem more appealing.

  "latent_3087": "Senate Republicans were confident they had the support needed to pass their tax overhaul Friday as last-minute changes brought more GOP lawmakers on board.\n\n\"We have the votes,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters after GOP senators emerged from a meeting.\n\nBy passing the bill, the Republican Party would step closer to its goal of overhauling the American tax code under a unified government. As McConnell spoke, the GOP still had not released the final text of the bill it wants to push through later Friday.\n\nSens. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., earlier Friday said they would back the bill after securing further tax relief for pass-through businesses. Then, holdout Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, committed to supporting the plan, leaving Republican leaders confident that they had the support.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., will oppose the plan over deficit concerns, the only Republican to say he would vote against it as of Friday evening.\n\n\"While I support a number of the provisions included in this legislation and continue to believe it would have been fairly easy to alter the bill in a way that would have been more fiscally sound without harming the pro-growth policies, unfortunately, it is clear that the caucus is in a different place,\" Corker said in a statement.\n\nThe support Friday from the other senators, among the last Senate GOP holdouts, all but guarantees that Senate Republicans can pass their plan. The GOP scrambled to rework the bill after a last-minute setback Thursday night.",

Meanwhile, the shows that are going on — tonight is the tour’s third night, in Vancouver — are suffering from embarrassingly low attendance, and being moved to venues half the size of the original stops.\n\nIn the just-released cancellation announcement, Lilith co-founder Terry McBride says, “We are in the midst of one of the most challenging summer concert seasons with many tours being cancelled outright. Everyone involved with the tour would like to apologize to the fans and artists scheduled to play in these markets, and express appreciation for all the support for the festival’s return. Lilith remains the only tour of its kind, and we are confident that fans will be amazed by what each date has to offer.”\n\nRefunds are of course being offered, and fans are encouraged to check the website to find out how the cancelled shows may affect the artist lineups in their towns. But meanwhile, it’s time to put on your fantasy management caps, Mixers: Why is this tour struggling?

  "latent_3329": "The Vikings gave no quarter when they stormed the city of Nantes, in what is now western France, in June 843—not even to the monks barricaded in the city's cathedral. \"The heathens mowed down the entire multitude of priest, clerics, and laity,\" according to one witness account. Among the slain, allegedly killed while celebrating the Mass, was a bishop who later was granted sainthood.\n\nTo modern readers the attack seems monstrous, even by the standards of medieval warfare. But the witness account contains more than a touch of hyperbole, writes Anders Winroth, a Yale history professor and author of the book The Age of the Vikings, a sweeping new survey. What's more, he says, such exaggeration was often a feature of European writings about the Vikings.\n\nWhen the account of the Nantes attack is scrutinized, \"a more reasonable image emerges,\" he writes. After stating that the Vikings had killed the \"entire multitude,\" for instance, the witness contradicts himself by noting that some of the clerics were taken into captivity. And there were enough people left—among the \"many who survived the massacre\"—to pay ransom to get prisoners back.\n\nIn short, aside from ignoring the taboo against treating monks and priests specially, the Vikings acted not much differently from other European warriors of the period, Winroth argues.\n\nIn 782, for instance, Charlemagne, now heralded as the original unifier of Europe, beheaded 4,500 Saxon captives on a single day. \"The Vikings never got close to that level of efficiency,\" Winroth says, drily.\n\nView Images Erik the Red, a famous Viking explorer and the discoverer of Greenland, built a wooden church (replica above) for his wife in Qassiarsuk, Greenland. Photograph by Peter Essick, National Geographic Creative\n\nViking History Told by Their Victims\n\nJust how bad were the Vikings?\n\nWinroth is among the scholars who believe the Vikings were no more bloodthirsty than other warriors of the period. But they suffered from bad public relations—in part because they attacked a society more literate than their own, and therefore most accounts of them come from their victims. Moreover, because the Vikings were pagan, they played into a Christian story line that cast them as a devilish, malign, outside force.\n\n\"There is this general idea of the Vikings as being exciting and other, as something that we can't understand from our point of view—which is simply continuing the story line of the victims in their own time,\" Winroth says. \"One starts to think of them in storybook terms, which is deeply unfair.\"\n\nIn reality, he proposes, \"the Vikings were sort of free-market entrepreneurs.\"\n\nView Images Archaeological evidence suggests that Vikings built a base camp for hunting and trading on the shore of Canada's Baffin Island. Photograph by David Coventry, National Geographic Creative\n\nTo be sure, scholars have for decades been stressing aspects of Viking life beyond the warlike, pointing to the craftsmanship of the Norse (to use the term that refers more generally to Scandinavians), their trade with the Arab world, their settlements in Greenland and Newfoundland, the ingenuity of their ships, and the fact that the majority of them stayed behind during raids.\n\nBut Winroth wants to put the final nail in the coffin of the notion that the Vikings were the \"Nazis of the North,\" as an article by British journalist Patrick Cockburn argued last April. Viking atrocities were \"the equivalent of those carried out by SS divisions invading Poland 75 years ago,\" Cockburn wrote.\n\nFew scholars today hold Cockburn's view. In fact, some believe the trend Winroth represents—de-emphasizing Vikings' violence and stressing their similarities with other Europeans—goes too far.\n\n\"Other Europeans were perfectly horrible as well,\" agrees Tom Shippey, an emeritus professor of English at Saint Louis University, who writes often about the Vikings. But why, Shippey asks, slightly exaggerating, did the Vikings always win?\n\nMuch of the explanation, he says, is an \"ethos that is unlike anything else in Europe,\" one that included reverence for the warrior ideal and a gallows-humor, \"who cares?\" attitude toward death.\n\nIn addition, points out Martin Arnold, a reader in Old Norse studies at the University of Hull, the pope placed limits on Christian warfare and threatened excommunication for leaders who became unduly aggressive. The Vikings had no such inhibiting force.\n\nAn alternate explanation for the Viking win-loss record, which Winroth embraces, is that Viking ships were so speedy and stealthy that the Norse almost always surprised their enemies. \"I don't buy it,\" says Shippey.\n\nView Images Viking seafarers used ships like this modern replica to reach the New World. Photograph by David Coventry, National Geographic Creative\n\nBlood Eagles and Berserkers\n\nIt used to be routine for scholars to claim that Vikings killed some of their victims by means of the so-called blood eagle. The form of an eagle reportedly was carved onto a victim's back, his rib cage severed, and his lungs pulled out the back.\n\nBut Winroth holds strongly to the view, first advanced by his Yale colleague Roberta Frank, that the anecdote derives from a misreading of the allusive, grammatically ambiguous, and metaphorically rich Viking verse written by the so-called skalds.\n\nSkaldic poetry is full of birds, including eagles, that feast on the bodies of one's enemies. Through dubious grammatical readings, the authors of the Scandinavian sagas, written centuries after the Viking raids, turned an eagle cutting into a man's back into an eagle being carved on the back. Further embellishments and creative license took flight from that first error.\n\nWinroth also wants us to rethink the berserkers, the supposedly near-psychopathic warriors in the front line of Viking attacks said to be immune to pain and possibly high on psychotropic mushrooms. The more colorful accounts add that they chewed on their shields and ate burning coals. But Winroth argues that references to berserkers first appear in the poetry of 13th- and 14th-century Iceland, and they are plainly described as people who lived \"once upon a time.\"\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily rule out the existence of half-crazed warriors, says Robert Ferguson, an independent scholar and author of The Vikings.\n\n\"I don't have any particular trouble in imagining that the Vikings in the forefront of their attacks were men of violence, the kind of people you have in the Hell's Angels now. They would drink. They were almost psychopathic. I think we have berserkers [in modern armies] now. They just aren't called that anymore. \"\n\nView Images This geometrical Viking camp on the Jutland Peninsula of Denmark extends some 130 yards in diameter. Photograph by Ted Spiegel, National Geographic Creative\n\nThe True Reason for Viking Raids\n\nRather than being primed for battle by an irrational love of mayhem, Vikings went raiding mainly for pragmatic reasons, Winroth contends—namely, to build personal fortunes and enhance the power of their chieftains. As evidence Winroth enumerates cases in which Viking leaders negotiated for payment, or tried to.\n\nFor example, before the Battle of Maldon in England, a Viking messenger landed and cried out to 3,000 or more assembled Saxon soldiers: \"It is better for you that you pay off this spear-fight with tribute ... Nor have we any need to kill each other.\" The English chose to fight, and were defeated. Like anyone else, the Vikings would rather win by negotiation than risk a loss, Winroth says.\n\nNor was every place the Vikings attacked decimated, despite repeated claims by scribes that \"everything was destroyed.\" Winroth notes that the trading post of Dorestad, in what is now the Netherlands, was sacked four times in four years, starting in 834, yet it continued to flourish. Viking raids were seen as an \"overhead cost,\" Winroth writes, and a fair number of traders doing business in Dorestad would have been Norse.\n\nAlong those lines, Winroth stresses just how entwined the Norse were with other Europeans. In the 840s a Viking named Rörik, whose uncle had been king in Denmark, plundered the coastal regions of the kingdom of Emperor Lothair, in what's now Belgium and the Netherlands. Lothair then essentially hired Rörik to defend his land against other Viking raids, a common practice. Rörik became the equivalent of a European prince.\n\nView Images This sixth-century helmet plaque shows two berserkers, one wearing a horned helmet and one in a wolf or bear mask. Photograph by Werner Forman, Universal Images Group, Getty Images\n\nThe Norse were prodigious traders, selling furs, walrus tusks, and slaves to Arabs in the East. Winroth goes so far as to argue that Vikings provided much needed monetary stimulus to western Europe at a crucial time. Norse trade led to an influx of Arabic dirhams, or coins, which helped smooth the transition to an economy of exchange instead of barter.\n\nYet even among scholars who attempt to see things from the Vikings' perspective, disagreements persist about the nature of Viking violence. Robert Ferguson, for example, doesn't downplay its ferocity, but he characterizes it as symbolic and defensive, a form of \"asymmetric warfare.\"\n\nIn the year 806, for example, the slaughter of 68 monks on the Isle of Iona, off the coast of Scotland, sowed terror in Europe. Ferguson suggests that the move was designed to convince Charlemagne and others that it would be very costly to expand Christianity into Scandinavia by force. The Vikings \"were fighting to defend their way of life,\" Ferguson says.\n\nView Images Stefan Nordgren lives in a trailer during the annual reenactment of a Viking battle in Sweden. Photograph by Johan Bavman, Institute\n\nWinroth took an indirect route to becoming a scholar of the Vikings. As an undergraduate in his native Sweden, he was frustrated by how little he learned about the Norse. And misunderstandings about Vikings \"are just as prevalent in Scandinavia\" as in the United States, he says. \"Maybe more.\"\n\nWhen his early work as a scholar on medieval church law helped him to win a MacArthur Fellow prize, the so-called genius grant, he used some of the funds to retrain himself as a scholar of the Norse.\n\nAsked whether he thinks there's a danger of going too far in domesticating the Vikings, Winroth replies: \"To domesticate them means to see them in context.\"",

  "latent_3665": "This is a running list which we'll keep updated as we get things fixed. The numbers after some items are references to internal changelists and nothing anybody should worry about. Remember asking about release dates means dead rookies! We're planning to focus more on balancing and gameplay changes in this patch. Among the things we will be focusing on incentivizing using mid-sized squads more often, in part by reigning in the relative utility of tiny and huge squads in some situations. Bugfixes - Fix a bug causing newly-hired units to rapidly level up, especially mid/late game black market purchases. - Fix base game bug with PCS items disappearing from soldiers. - Attempted fix for the \"squad stuck on mission\" bug when infiltrating an about-to-expire mission. 2207 - Fix bug causing the DLC mission sites to spawn more than once in a campaign. Requires a new campaign to avoid the bug. 2219 - Fix bug causing Invasion missions to sometimes be considered a failure if the spike is destroyed after all aliens are defeated. 2160 - Attempted fix for bug causing failed facility sabotage missions to still destroy the facility - Add faceless base loot (corpse) to the faceless civilian & rebel character templates. Ensures they still drop a corpse if you manage to kill them before they transform. 2177 - Full Override Permanent now does not break MindControl on source unit death or leaving play (e.g. evaccing). Added a listener to the TransferMec effect that breaks MindControl when the only remaining units are mind-controlled units that cannot evac. 2158 - Alerted units will now be alerted to the location where explosives detonated instead of the location of the unit that threw/launched/placed them. - Berserkers should no longer attack friendly units while in yellow alert on datatap missions. They may still target friendlies after being enraged. 2174 - Fall back effect (used by Flush, Roust and Fall Back) will no longer trigger on stunned units - Dead/Captured Psi units will not show eligible for Psi level up - Port fix to allow mod-added menu items to respond to keyboard activation. Courtesy of robojumper and the Community Highlander project. - Fix keyboard navigation order issue in the armory with mod-added entries (AWC, Officer abilities) being skipped over. Allow <enter> to fire the on clicked delegate for mod-added armory buttons. - Attempted fix for case where liberation object chain would not advance when liberation 2 was completed. Add a backup TriggerEvent for 'LiberateStage2Complete' when the network tower trigger occurs. 2163 - Replace the md_ShootingRange_01 parcel with a modified _LW variant that removes the fire from one of the XCOM squad spawn locations. Should avoid starting missions with people on fire tiles. 2210 - Fix a bug causing non-ballistic weapons to not stack correctly in the inventory after stripping all weapon mods. 2211 - Restore weapon upgrade UI to showing 4 slots at a time. - Moved \"Strip All Weapon Upgrades\" button to bottom nav-bar of the weapon upgrade UI - Fix bug with weapon pawn not updating properly after stripping weapon upgrades in the weapon upgrade UI - Fix bug with some soldiers not having their weapons stripped when \"Strip All Weapon Upgrades\" is used - Fix bug with \"Strip All Weapon Upgrades\" stripping the current soldier when used from the weapon upgrade UI. - Blanked-out vanilla ENDS TURN loc because it was often used inaccurately. - Attempted fix for LR pop-up when unit is impaired and not getting LR bonus - Added IsPanicked check for various abilities that shouldn't work when panicked (not sure if IsImpaired covers panicked or not) - Removed Reaper from AWC list, would not work on gunner without Fleche - Fixed Sniper Rifle laser sound range to 30. - Pod Substitution code should now respect \"Protected\" string in encounter name and not make any substitutions - Lone Wolf should ignore Gremlins as a \"nearby ally\" - Removed vestigal sweep objective from facility sabotage, should correct \"full salvage\" erroneous report - Large intel cache should properly reward 25 intel instead of 40 now - Fix vanilla bug with the navbar not refreshing correctly when entering the weapon upgrade UI from squad select (2217) - Combined Arms should no longer provide a damage bonus to non-damaging attacks like Flashbang (2218) - Fix bug causing captured soldiers to occasionally re-appear in their squad and be able to go on missions (but be uncontrollable on those missions). 2222 - Fix bug with Trojan not applying when hacking a robot outside of regular sight range. 2223 - Added check for dead units in UnitCannotAcceptAura, attempt to fix dead leaders broadcasting passive bonuses 2224 - Refresh the mission info panel after a boost. Ensures the evac delay turn count is updated correctly. - Air Controller perk should be properly reflected in mission brief evac estimations 2227 - Sneks will no longer attempt to bind stunned units (fixes buggy behavior) 2227 - Hack Defense malus from Redscreen Rounds should stack now 2227 - Attempted fix for Skullouch not applying properly 2228 - Attempted fix to deprecated vanilla Advanced Heavy Weapons PG project showing up 2230 - Sharpshooters restricted from Chain Shot, Flush and Guardian in AWC - Removed all upkeep costs from facilities to work around negative supply bug. Raised initial price of some facilities and upgrades. - Units protected by Mind Merge will now correctly handle losing temporary shield hp before losing permanent shield HP - Fixed logic short circuit in LeadByExample so it should apply consistently now - Flush and Roust may no longer be used from concealment, as they don't work properly in those cases - Went for nuclear levels of damage with Kubikiri to fix reports it didn't always overcome % DR - Remove disorient/shutdown effects from robots on a successful control robot hack, similar to as is done for dominate. Fix bug causing the effect animations to not be removed (with a slight glitch in the animation showing the robot recovering from shutdown twice). 2232 - Attempted fix for bug in Rapid Reaction and Sentinel causing their use counters to reset every half-turn. 2233 - Fixed bug with reinforcement difficulty-based modifiers - Fixed some bugged code in PostEncounterCreation not finding right mission - Fix vanilla graphical bug causing units taking more than one overwatch shot after stepping out to fail to step back to their previous tile. - Fix bug causing mission brief to incorrectly display \"concealed start\" for avenger defense. - Fix bug causing mastered MECs to not be transfered to the resistance outpost on sweep missions. 2235 - Fix bug causing bleeding out Haven Advisers to not be recovered on mission completion. 2234 - Using Steady Weapon will now count as an attack action for the purposes of Deep Cover, meaning DC will not trigger. This prevents Deep Cover auto-canceling the Steady Weapon bonus. - Fixed bad config in Reinfs where [0] index was being ignored. All reinf arrays start at 1. - Fixed some crit damage values that were too low - Fix a vanilla bug causing wounded units taken on missions allowing deployment of wounded soldiers (e.g. avenger defense) to magically heal on mission end. This can cause bugs in both LW2 and vanilla where their HQ healing project is still active and when it completes they will be reset to \"Active\" status regardless of whatever status they had at the time. Since they were no longer injured they could be infiltrating or advising in LW2 or in a training project in LW2 or vanilla. - Fix bug causing InclusionExclusionLists to not work. 2255 - Created handlers for objectives for cases in which player has unlocked black site after 1) researching resistance communications or 2) has contacted all 16 regions. 2256 - Concussion rocket smoke will take effect immediately now. 2256 - Fix a bug causing dark events to sometimes activate before the activity they are attached to expires. 2257 Feature - Adding Smash n Grab mission and associated activity. This mission will show up fairly often, including from campaign start. XCOM starts out revealed at a fixed evac point. At a nearby ADVENT structure is between 4-6 loot boxes that contain supplies, elerium dust, alien alloys, an elerium core or a datapad. Loot will scale up over the course of a campaign. A soldier may carry loot from only one box. The mission uses a \"soft\" timer of steadily increasing reinforcements after a turn threshold is reached. Mission can occur in city, smalltown and wilderness areas. Gameplay / Balancing - Game will no longer reserve a rebel at home when choosing the squad for rendezvous. 2166 - Engineer advisers will now appear on resistance Supply Convoy missions, and Scientist advisers on Intel Raid missions in addition to retaliations. Soldiers will continue to appear on all raid types and retaliations. 2151 2182, 2195, 2211, 2213, 2215, 2216, 2218, 2220, 2224, 2227, 2230, 2231, 2233, 2243, 2245, 2251 (changes still in test) QOL - Allow changing equipment/PCS/upgrades on haven advisers as long as the adviser is eligible to be moved (i.e. there is no active retaliation in the region). - Added \"Strip Weapon Upgrades\" button to loadout screen: strips just the equipped weapon of upgrades. - \"Swarming\" will have a number of plus symbols after it depending on how many enemies are on a mission; ie Swarming+++ has more than Swarming+. This will help show infiltration progress a little better in high-alert areas. - Add a general function to UIPanel to allow the changing the color of arbitrary MCs by name. Adjust the reinforcement UI dags colors based on the text color. - Add mod override for reinforcements incoming UI. LW2 will display green and yellow warning/imminent displays when the reinf bucket is filling. 2240 Modding - Added trigger event to SwitchActiveRow (moddability improvement). 2164 - Added TriggerEvent for clicking on a SquadSelect_ListItem. For modding support. 2161 - Improved mod compat with mods that use the ammo pocket inventory slot: Slot will be locked on infiltrating units and items in the ammo pocket will behave similar to items in the grenade pocket when determining which items are utility slot items. 2208 - Move class limiting heavy weapons and hiding havens behind config variables. If these vars are not set original behavior will be used. 2221 - Functions that count # of working rebels will work better with custom rebel jobs by testing for hidden job rather than summing other default jobs. 2233 - Added some mod-support code to CanRankUpPsiSoldier for custom Psi trees. 2233\n\nChanged Text",

  "latent_3796": "Our society may be highly competitive, but prescribing brain-enhancing medication to healthy children is unethical and doctors must act to protect the most vulnerable.\n\nThat’s the crux of the argument put forth in guidelines for doctors released Wednesday by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). The paper discusses the misuse of stimulant medications normally prescribed to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as Ritalin and Adderall.\n\nDr. Michael Goldstein, a pediatric neurologist at Western Neurological Associates in Salt Lake City and former vice president of the AAN, said the article isn’t intended to stop doctors from medicating children with diagnosable learning disorders. It is, however, directed at adolescents who take ADHD and other stimulant medications to boost their brain power or get better grades.\n\n“Taking some child with As and Bs and making it so they get all As, that’s different than a child who’s struggling. If society sees that as acceptable, that’s one issue. If physicians see it as acceptable, that’s another,” he said in an interview with Healthline. “If your child is doing well and you want him to be a star, that troubles me personally and those who wrote this paper.”\n\nAthletes, Celebrities, and Social Pressure to Perform\n\nChildren in success-driven environments are often under pressure to not only meet requirements, but to excel beyond them. This includes performing well in elementary school, junior high, and high school in order to get into a top-tier college, doing well there, and then striving for a successful career.\n\nThe AAN paper states that the practice of using stimulant medications solely to improve performance is rising, but the evidence is mostly anecdotal. Still, experts say the use of neuroenhancers is adding to the $10 billion annual revenue for makers of ADHD medications.\n\nWhen professional athletes—from Barry Bonds to Lance Armstrong—use performance-enhancing drugs it’s not much of a stretch for kids to believe that taking pills to excel is acceptable.\n\nGoldstein argues that teens using neuroenhancers to do better in the classroom is just the same as athletes using steroids or celebrities having plastic surgery: once one starts doing it, the rest have to follow suit to stay competitive. Though no one bats an eyelash when a movie star gets breast implants, we’d be appalled to see them on a six-year-old girl for the purpose of making her a star, Goldstein said.\n\nTaking medication to increase brainpower is more ethically complicated for adults, as they’re less vulnerable than children, but the AAN's standards for doctors are quite straightforward.\n\n“There are some things you do with adults that you shouldn’t do with children,” Goldstein said.\n\nThe AAN paper explains the ethical, legal, social, and neurodevelopmental implications of allowing this prescribing practice to continue. In sum, the AAN says doctors should stop prescribing stimulants to healthy kids for numerous reasons, especially the fact that experts don't know what the drugs can do to a developing brain.\n\nPraise for High Achievers\n\nPraising children who use stimulants for their good grades is a major factor in the continuing abuse of these drugs. In fact, experts say that serious dilemmas may arise because using drugs to boost academic performance is sometimes applauded by parents and teachers.\n\nThis is why the responsibility to protect children rests not only with parents, but with doctors as well.\n\n“Doctors caring for children and teens have a professional obligation to always protect the best interests of the child, to protect vulnerable populations, and to prevent the misuse of medication,” study author Dr. William Graf of Yale University said in a press release. “The practice of prescribing these drugs, called neuroenhancements, for healthy students is not justifiable.”\n\nStudies have shown that many college students experience high levels of stress due to academic pressure and self-imposed expectations. Some report an increased workload and lower grades than they expected. Many students are turning to neuroenhancers to combat these problems through late-night cram sessions.\n\nNeuroenhancing drugs seem like a student's savior: they’re cheap (and covered by insurance), easy to obtain, and effective at helping students study. The New York Times recently featured op-eds from people who have abused stimulants in order to excel. These anecdotes highlight the drugs’ ability to enhance performance, but also to cause crippling addiction and withdrawal.\n\nA Doctor’s Duty\n\nPrevious AAN guidelines for doctors state that it’s neither illegal nor unethical for doctors to prescribe adults neuroenhancing drugs. For children, however, it’s a different ballgame.\n\nThe implications of prescribing performance-enhancing drugs cast as far out as experts can see. The new paper states that a doctor’s concern should be protecting society’s children, as well as maintaining the integrity of the medical profession.\n\n“The physician should talk to the child about the request, as it may reflect other medical, social, or psychological motivations such as anxiety, depression, or insomnia,” Graf said. “There are alternatives to neuroenhancements available, including maintaining good sleep, nutrition, study habits, and exercise regimens.”\n\nMore on Healthline.com:",
  "latent_3832": "Iowa’s Judicial Branch flunked a recent transparency and accountability study because of barriers to public access to information, a lack of legal requirements for judicial evaluations and concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThose concerns include limited access to judicial officers’ asset disclosures, which can reveal potential conflicts of interest and which aren’t audited for accuracy, and a lack of restrictions on judges returning to the private sector after serving on the bench.\n\nThe failing grade came despite a recent milestone in the judicial branch, which completed a statewide rollout of its Electronic Document Management System earlier this year. The system makes public court records available online. But full access still is restricted to judges, lawyers, court administrators, aggregators and those involved in cases, not the general public.\n\nThe State Integrity Investigation, released last month by the nonprofits Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity, examined various measures of transparency and accountability in state government across thirteen categories. IowaWatch was involved in conducting the survey of Iowa government agencies.\n\nThe judicial branch was one of two categories that earned a failing grade for Iowa. The other was for lobbying regulation.\n\nMultiple efforts by IowaWatch to reach out to the judicial branch for a comment on its failing grade were turned down by Steve Davis, communications director for the judicial branch. However, Davis responded to questions for the survey earlier in the year.\n\nThe survey examined accessibility both in law, how access is protected in the legal code, and in practice, how the law is carried out. In some cases the actions of a single judge can cut off access to the court despite laws in place to protect that access.\n\nDistrict Judge James Richardson was able to derail coverage of a May 2013 vehicular homicide trial in Audubon County by forbidding note taking by a newspaper reporter for the Daily Times Herald in Carroll.\n\n“The reporter was writing in a notepad and the judge said he couldn’t. If jurors saw him writing it would bias the jurors because they would think what was being said was more important,” Jared Strong, a reporter at the Herald, said.\n\nNote taking is common in court coverage. In fact, court rules allow live-blogging, video and still cameras in the courtroom. However, provisions within the expanded news media coverage law allow magistrates and judges to attach conditions or limit coverage for reasons including protection of rights to a fair trial.\n\nThe Herald reported the note-taking ban in its coverage and the ban was picked up by national media blogger Jim Romenesko.\n\nJudge Richardson stuck to the decision despite attempts by the chief district judge, Jeffrey Larson, to reverse the rule. Strong said the paper eventually had to threaten to sue before Richardson agreed to allow the reporter, a summer intern who had just started his stint at the paper, to take notes in the courtroom as long as members of the jury couldn’t see him.\n\nStrong said most of his interactions with the courts have been positive, and the ban was “an isolated instance with a judge not used to having media coverage.”\n\nMedia coverage of court cases can provide useful insights to the public that can’t be accomplished by reading records, said Zack Kucharski, executive editor of The Gazette in Cedar Rapids, who serves as expanded media coordinator for the Sixth Judicial District in Eastern Iowa.\n\n“People can understand the courts at a much better level if they watch a case unfold,” Kucharski said. “You’re able to watch interactions, you’re able to watch emotions, you’re able to understand the variety of challenges that are going on in the courtroom at any given time.”\n\nCONFIDENCE IN THE COURTS\n\nQuestions about disclosure of judge’s assets racked up the most low scores in the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity survey because of barriers to public access to reports about those assets and the absence of auditing.\n\nAsset disclosures are annual forms filed by judges and magistrates containing a list of businesses, outside occupations or professions and any sources of income they have that are greater than $1,000.\n\nThe disclosures can reveal potential conflicts of interest, showing what financial stakes a judge or magistrate might have in a case.\n\nThe disclosures in Iowa did not meet the survey’s requirements for easy access. The documents are not available for free online — requesters must contact the Iowa Supreme Court clerk of court’s office and copied documents can incur a printing fee — and do not meet requirements for open data formats, which includes things like machine readability.\n\nAdditionally, the forms are not audited for accuracy although staff verifies that the forms are turned in, Davis, the judicial branch’s spokesperson, said in an email for the survey.\n\nTardy filers receive a reminder by their court administrator, Davis said. For those who again fail to submit the document, the Judicial Qualifications Commission sends a final email warning noting that failure to respond could result in action, including possible discipline, by the commission.\n\nJohannes Tonn, a research manager with Global Integrity who worked on developing the survey, said the focus on asset disclosures, both within the judicial branch and in other areas of government, is a key part of evaluating trust in government.\n\nIt comes down to understanding motivation, he said.\n\n“Making sure that judges are clear about where their financial interests lie and making people see that they are impartial and they aren’t deciding in favor of particular interest or entity is definitely important so people can have trust in the impartiality of judges,” Tonn said.\n\nA judge is responsible for recusing him or herself when a conflict of interest arises. However, it could be beneficial for lawyers to have easier access to those documents, Maura Strassberg, professor of law at Drake University, said in an interview for the survey.\n\n“Lawyers do have the ability to request that a judge recuse themselves and the more information you have the better,” she said.\n\nPaul Gowder, associate professor of law at the University of Iowa, said in an interview for the survey that the Iowa judicial system is open and fair and instances of corruption were unlikely. However, he said publishing the disclosures could protect people’s confidence in the courts.\n\n“Certainly the judges have some privacy interest in their financial affairs, but given the strong interest that we have in the legal community in making sure that judges and the courts are free of the appearance of a conflict of interest, it would certainly be preferable to make them as publicly available as possible,” he said.\n\nRETURNING TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\nOnce a judge leaves the bench, he or she is free to return to the private sector, which knocked points off the judicial branch’s score in the integrity survey.\n\nThe survey required a cooling-off period for state-level judges before taking a private sector position that could present a conflict of interest, like trying to influence former colleagues. Work in an unrelated field did not require restrictions.\n\nIowa law does not limit a judge’s post-bench work in the private sector, unlike the situation facing state officials and employees in the legislative and executive branches who are prohibited by law from entering into certain private sector lobbying jobs for two years after leaving a government position.\n\nIn an interview for the survey, former Iowa Supreme Court Justice David L. Baker said judges are restricted from practicing while on the bench, but he didn’t see an issue with judges return to law practice afterwards.\n\n“I don’t think if I go argue a case in front of a judge that I have any influence over that judge,” Baker said.\n\nHe said judges don’t work alongside members of the executive or legislative branches so they do not have influence over members of those branches that could be abused if a former judge takes up a lobbying position.\n\n“It’s not the same as a top staffer or a legislator leaving the legislature and wanting to come back and lobby,” he said.\n\nGRADING JUDGEES\n\nEvery two years, the Iowa State Bar Association publishes judicial evaluations of judges standing for retention. The association has conducted the reviews since 1964. However, Iowa Code does not require that evaluations take place or be made public.\n\n“What we are saying is that everyone needs to see in black and white, in a legal format, what are the rules that we play by,” Tonn said. “The way we measure accountability is by being very clear. You could still do better by actually having it codified in the law.”\n\nBruce Walker, current bar association president, said the survey does what it is intended to do: provide voters with credible information. Although the evaluation is not legally mandated, Walker said he saw no reason why the association would stop producing the reports in the future.\n\nAlaska, which besides receiving the best grade overall in the integrity survey, received the best grade for its judicial system — a B minus. According to the survey, the constitutionally mandated Alaska Judicial Council performs the judicial performance evaluations.\n\nThe evaluations include input from judges, attorneys, peace officers, social services officials, jurors, court employees and attendees of public hearings. Results are available online as well as in voter pamphlets available at the polls.\n\nIn Iowa, evaluations are filed by member attorneys who appear frequently before the judge. Results are published on the bar association’s website and made available to the media.\n\nIn an interview for the survey, past bar association president Joe Feller said the bar’s evaluation isn’t influenced by outside factors because the association is independent from state entities and the judicial branch.\n\n“The public can have the assurance that the evaluations that we do are truly reflective of the opinions and sentiments of the members of our bar association that work with these judges,” he said.\n\nONLINE SYSTEM EVOLVING\n\nThe court’s Electronic Document Management System was implemented county-by-county beginning in 2010 and reached the final counties — Allamakee, Chickasaw, Howard and Winneshiek — this year. The system makes court documents more accessible to those within the court system by putting them online.\n\nBut online access is restricted to judges, lawyers, court administrators, aggregators and those involved in a case. The public still needs to visit a computer kiosk in the courthouse in the county that originated document.\n\nRox Laird, a recently retired editorial writer with the Des Moines Register and past president of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, said the court was concerned about security and privacy issues caused by putting so much information online.\n\nFrom the time e-filing was established in Plymouth County in 2010 to the point at which the final counties came on board this summer, nearly 2 million cases had been filed, including 6.5 million documents, by almost 88,000 users, according to a press release.\n\n“It’s one thing to say you can go to Sac County and ask for a court record or maybe a divorce case or a lawsuit that involves financial records,” Laird said. “You’d have to drive to the courthouse in Sac County and ask for the record and look at it there and make copies. If this is all online, for all 99 counties, the court is worried about these records being scraped by different entities — businesses, scammers, you name it.”\n\nLaird said it was an evolutionary process, with those filing information getting up to speed on how to file records to ensure confidential information is protected before expanding access to public records. He said efforts were underway to expand access to Iowa journalists.\n\nKucharski, of The Gazette, said he could go to the courthouse, walk around the file cabinets and “pretty much just look at anything you wanted” when he started as a reporter 18 years ago.\n\nThe online database, with its current restricted access, is a trade-off, he said. Reporters are able to access a synopsis of cases quickly, without the restrictions of courthouse hours, but also without the full detail that comes in complete reports.\n\n“In some regards, I think the Iowa court system is ahead of the curve, but there’s an expectation to always do more,” he said. “You look at some of the technology that’s in place in some of the courtrooms, while we have courthouses across the state that don’t even have metal detectors yet.”\n\nSTILL A WAYS TO GO\n\nTonn, of Global Integrity, said the true value of the integrity study lies not in a state’s score but in the data itself and the discussions it can ignite. Information on each of 245 indicators used to evaluate government transparency in all 50 states is available online.\n\n“It is important for government officials and legislators and journalists to be able to dig into the data and see, ‘this states does this differently and seems to do better. Maybe we should try that,’” he said.\n\nKucharski said the survey points out areas that still need some work and increases the expectations people have for holding public officials accountable.\n\n“While Iowa’s laws have been good, they can always be better. And frankly, the more that there’s an aura of transparency I think the more effective government is,” he said.\n\nTO LEARN HOW IOWAWATCH’S NONPROFIT JOURNALISM IS FUNDED AND HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT IT, GO TO THIS LINK.\n\nThis IowaWatch story was republished by the Des Moines Register, The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA) and The Hawk Eye (Burlington, IA) under IowaWatch’s mission of sharing stories with media partners.",
  "latent_3842": "Today is the tenth anniversary of Chris Nolan's Batman Begins. Said film, the first installment of Chris Nolan's so-called Dark Knight trilogy, is basically the equivalent of Michael Jackson's Moonwalk. Jackson didn't invent the moonwalk, but he did popularize and will forever be the person associated with it. Even if the first modern reboot was arguably Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes back in July 2001, Batman Begins is the one now forever associated with the term and the ideas behind it. It was Chris Nolan's successful revamping of the Batman film franchise, which cast Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and surrounded him with the likes of Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson, that became forever associated with the would-be reboot. Back in 2005, the idea was new enough that a number of writers who arguably should have known better presumed it to be a kind of prequel to the 1989 Batman rather than its own separate thing. The film salvaged the Batman franchise from the wreckage of Batman & Robin and eventually paved the way for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. But its success was not preordained, nor was its box office triumph the sort of lightning-fast mega-kill we now associate with tent poles. It opened with “just” $48.7 million over the Fri-Sun portion of its $72.8m five-day opening, barely legging it to $206m domestic and eking out $374m worldwide on a $150m budget. But it dropped right on the tail end of the DVD boom, and its critical and word-of-mouth popularity gave it genuine strength on the DVD and emerging HD-DVD/Blu-Ray market. Ten years later, I wanted to examine the film’s overall legacy, in ways both good and bad. And with that said, here we go…\n\nIt was the first successful reboot.\n\nAs noted above, 20th Century Fox attempted to revamp the Planet of the Apes franchise in 2001, with (ironically) Batman director Tim Burton at the helm. But while the picture nearly broke the opening weekend record ($68.5m, just below the $74m debut of The Lost World: Jurassic Park), it was critically-lambasted and immediately rejected by audiences. The film earned a solid $362m worldwide on a $100m budget, which today would have meant a sequel. But Fox knew that the second time wouldn’t be the charm, so they put the apes into hibernation for another ten years. Yet Batman Begins was considered a triumph in terms of rescuing a formerly proud franchise despite making only a little more than Planet of the Apes worldwide on a 1/3 bigger budget.\n\nPerception is an odd thing. On paper, it would look like Batman Begins was barely a hit, let alone a declaration of Batman’s continuing cinematic legacy. Yet the acclaimed and well-liked adventure stuck around in theaters for a rather long time. It rented and sold well on DVD and Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. knew that the goodwill earned by the first installment could pay off a few years down the line with the “promised” Joker-centric sequel. And of course the $1 billion-success of The Dark Knight was the pay-off to the promise of Batman Begins. In retrospect, it’s astonishing that Warner was as patient as it was. I can't help but think that in today’s environment a small-scale success like Batman Begins would have ended up being revamped into a Batman/Superman team-up picture which in turn would operate as a backdoor Justice League pilot. Oh wait…\n\nBut come what may, Batman Begins was perceived as a big hit, and thus (along with the even more successful Casino Royale 17 months later) gave Hollywood the hope that they could take any old once-popular property and basically do a do-over. Be it the Robocop remake or the Amazing Spider-Man reboot (which followed the sad, tragic mere $890 million disaster of Spider-Man 3), the floodgates were open and they have yet to remain closed. I have often blamed The Amazing Spider-Man for basically getting Hollywood hooked on the arbitrary “because it was once popular” reboot, but Batman Begins did it first. I have long discussed the complicated legacy of Tim Burton’s Batman and how it cemented the notion of a pre-sold property as prime blockbuster material. It would be not a little ironic if our current reboot/remake mess is also the fault of the next “first” Caped Crusader adventure.\n\nIt taught Hollywood the wrong lessons about reboots and proverbial prequels.\n\nAs you well-know, Hollywood has a long history of learning the wrong lessons from its blockbuster hits. And the success of Batman Begins (and especially The Dark Knight) was no exception. Batman Begins was not a leggy and beloved comic book action drama because it was dark-n-gritty or because it was filled with background exposition or even because it grounded its adventure in a somewhat “real-world” environment. Batman Begins was a hit because it did all of those things in service of a good story that was well-told and well-performed. The notion that Batman Begins ushered in a new era of dark-n-gritty franchises was relatively false (J.J. Abrams’s Star Trek and Marvel’s Iron Man were such bummers!), and the ones that did try that route (Snow White and the Huntsman, Man of Steel, etc.) mostly fell somewhat flat even if they qualified as hits.\n\nThe notion that Batman Begins was a hit because it explained every component of what happened “before the story you knew” unfortunately stuck. Those who would argue that Nolan’s Batman movies were humorless, cold, and hyperrealistic obviously never bothered to watch the warm and often funny interactions between Christian Bale and Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman (or best of all, the three of them in the same hilarious scene) or the bits involving fear gas-wielding ninjas, magical medical healing, and over-the-top villainy. It wasn’t just that David Goyer’s screenplay laid out specific details that showed us Bruce finding the Batcave or ordering the components of the bat suit, it made those details entertaining and allowed those details to operate as character development. And, like Casino Royale, the would-be origin-centric reboot still remembered to be a ripping adventure with the main character fully up-and-running by the end of the first hour. Bruce Wayne is fully operational as Batman an hour into the 140 minute picture, which means the last hour or so offers an exciting and engaging Batman adventure in its own right.\n\nWe didn't need a whole Robin Hood movie where we end with Russell Crowe's Robin of Locksley finally being the Robin Hood you allegedly know-and-love. We didn't need a Superman reboot that ended with the Man of Steel possibly/hopefully being the iconic superhero we know and love. And we sure as heck don't need to know how Leatherface got his chainsaw or what exactly did or didn't happen to Peter Parker’s parents. The notion that Batman Begins triumphed because it explained everything and elaborated on previously untold (on film) backstory negates the fact that its box office triumph was primarily based (over the long haul) on the fact that it was a good movie featuring a pop culture icon. Part of its artistic triumph was in how it laid in the preemptive details, both in terms of onscreen actions and internal emotional character development, in a way that enriched the story rather than distracted from it. Not everything needs an origin story.\n\nIt saved the comic book superhero movie.\n\nRemember that second wave of comic book superhero movies I always talk about? The one that started with Blade and X-Men and unleashed a wave of present-tense, real-world-centric superhero films based on comparatively modern characters that that generation’s moviegoers actually wanted to see? Well, take a moment and count the good ones that dropped from, oh, 1998 to 2008. You’ve got the first two Blade movies, the first two X-Men movies, the first two Spider-Man movies (I'm not as big of a Spider-Man 2 fan as most, but I'll bow to the majority on this one), and uh… that’s about it. I don’t hate Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four,or X-Men: The Last Stand, but nor will I pretend that they ennobled the sub-genre. The majority of comic book superhero movies were either noble failures (Superman Returns, Hulk) or generally-dismissed whiffs (Ghost Rider, The Punisher, Daredevil, Catwoman, Elektra, etc.) that either outright bombed or made a token profit despite no one really liking them.\n\nWhen some of the best comic book superhero movies of that era were not actually based on a comic book (The Matrix, Unbreakable, The Incredibles), it’s time to look at said era with fresh eyes. Save the second and third X-Men and the first three Spider-Man films, none of these were really big hits either. Hollywood spent a decade chasing the ghosts of Spider-Man only to come up with films that cost $75 million-$120 million to produce but were often lucky to cross $200m worldwide. The first X-Men didn’t even cross $300m worldwide, but it was a hit because it only cost $75m to produce. Batman Begins paved the way, for better or worse, for everything that followed, even if the effect wasn't felt for a few years down the road. It is the Marvel Cinematic Universe that kicked things into hyperdrive and began the third \"interconnected\" era of comic book superhero movies. But it's tough to imagine Iron Man existing without Batman Begins showing it the way.\n\nIt was a critically-lauded gem and a (small scale) box office winner that proved that a comic book superhero movie could be a somber character drama first, a blockbuster action movie second, and a comic book adaptation third. It was an attempt to fashion an emotionally engrossing and genuinely thoughtful character study that just happened to be based on a comic book superhero. It was a comic book superhero movie that you could watch with your parents without being a little embarrassed, and yet its smarts and attention to detail didn't come at the cost of action, source fidelity, and gee-wiz spectacle. Watch Daredevil (either version) and Batman Begins back-to-back and you'll realize why Nolan’s picture felt like such a marvel. Watch Batman Begins and Iron Man back-to-back and realize how much Iron Man is a rip-off of Batman Begins how much the entire Marvel universe owes to Nolan’s “grounded in relative reality, rooted in intelligent character development, unafraid to indulge in comic book melodrama” superhero picture.\n\nIt is today, ten years later, oddly underrated.\n\nDespite its lasting impression, in ways both good and bad, it remains somewhat underrated in the shadow of what followed. If The Dark Knight was the Godfather part II of the superhero sub-genre, and The Dark Knight Rises is (so very much) The Godfather part III of the franchise, then Batman Begins is where The Godfather was when I was growing up, a mostly beloved original overshadowed by the darker, more complicated sequel. Well since this is the tenth anniversary, let me take a moment to state outright that Batman Begins is a pretty terrific picture. It is a sprawling and endlessly entertaining mix of introspective drama, crime procedural, and finally unapologetically comic book-y adventure. It balances the origin story, five consecutive villains (Joe Chill, Ra’s Al Ghul, Falcone, Scarecrow, and then Ra’s Al Ghul again), a crime plot, and a superhero tale without dropping a single ball. It’s filled with great performances from the likes of Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Cillian Murphy (as possibly the most low-key creepy comic book villain we had yet seen). Even Katie Holmes mostly kept her head above water despite being forced to play both the love interest and the would-be Leslie Thompkins-ish moral compass while delivering most of the \"message\" monologues.\n\nIt wisely borrowed not from Frank Miller’s satirical Dark Knight Returns but from Miller’s more humanistic Batman: Year One while taking from the explicitly optimistic and empathetic arcs being written by Ed Brubaker, Greg Rucka, and Devin Grayson at the time. Their Bruce Wayne/Batman was a hero, and a good and compassionate man. He wasn't a psychopath, and thus neither was the Batman in Chris Nolan’s universe. Of course, it helps that the film is 100% self-contained, with Nolan and Goyer throwing everything they have at the film they were making and not even worrying about the sequel until after-the-fact. There were no real sequel set-ups on world building digressions. Sure the DA that gets murdered at the end of the second act is probably going to get replaced by Harvey Dent, and we all knew what that playing card meant right before credits rolled, but Batman Begins could-well have ended the franchise right then-and-there without a single real loose end. It was a complete thing, rich in character, storytelling, and more than enough solid (if clunkily edited) action beats to satiate those seeking thrills.\n\nIt is a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and end, where the focus never drifts away from Batman/Bruce Wayne. It is thoughtful, intelligent, emotionally poignant, and not remotely patronizing to its target audience or anyone else in the theater. That The Dark Knight took what worked about the second act crime story material and expanded it to feature length while dropping Heath Ledger’s rabid dog of a Joker into the mix doesn't mean that Batman Begins wasn’t any less terrific at what it was trying to do. I happen to like Batman Begins as much as The Dark Knight, with the caveat that they do different things exceptionally well. Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, and Gary Oldman are superb and ground the sequel in something of a grand tragedy, yet Batman Begins is an explicitly Batman-centric character study with an oddly progressive (Bruce's father is \"compassionate conservatism\" in practice) and optimistic streak. They are both fantastic and they both deserve a limelight. Ten years ago, Batman Begins perfected the idea of a franchise reboot, revitalized the comic book superhero film and accidentally taught Hollywood both the potential to be found in their older once-popular franchises and the danger of merely offering the ingredients without the proper preparation.\n\nAs Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. struggle to develop a connective tone for their DC Comics films, they could do worse than to look at the film that started it all. Batman Begins paved the way for The Dark Knight because it was a terrific movie, not because audiences were clamoring for an origin or the backstory to every interesting fictional character out there. The film of course ends with Jim Gordon revealing a joker playing card found at a murder scene. If you saw the film anywhere near opening day or opening weekend, your audience probably went nuts. Maybe you did too. But Hollywood should remember that people didn't roar with applause at the end of Batman Begins just because they liked the Joker. We soiled our collective pants with excitement because of how good Batman Begins was and how exciting the prospect of a Joker in that universe would be. Nolan's movie darn-well-earned that tease, folks. Batman Begins kicked off a whole new kind of franchise, the franchise reboot. But far too few of those reboots were really able to really “earn it” in terms of renewed audience interest. Ten years ago, Batman Begins earned it in spades.",
  "latent_3858": "Editor’s Note: Billionaire venture capitalist Nick Hanauer made his fortune as the seventh investor in Amazon and as the owner of a web ad firm, which he sold to Microsoft in 2004 for a whopping $6.4 billion. He is also a critic of trickle-down economics. Below, Hanauer critizes the theory that a higher minimum wage will cause increased unemployment. Going further, he suggests that economic theories in general are not science, but merely social and moral constructs. This post originally appeared on Hanauer’s blog, Civic Skunks Works and is reprinted here with the permission of Nick Hanauer.\n\nNoah Smith, a smart financial writer with a very good blog, recently wrote an article on the $15 minimum wage for Bloomberg. The piece celebrated the fact that, finally, we’ll have some data on how the $15 minimum wage would affect jobs. Smith said he considered it a test because in theory, “a higher minimum wage should cause increased unemployment.”\n\nThe more I thought about it, the less sense this premise made. Smith’s article underscored two big things for me: first, the degree to which people see the evidence they want to see; second, how silly the idea of “economic theory” can be. Smith claims that we don’t know what the result of a $15 minimum wage will be. Will it kill jobs or not? But the truth is there’s abundant and overwhelming evidence that this theory is wrong and that higher minimum wages don’t hurt employment. The evidence is there; you just have to choose to see it.\n\nLet’s just look in my own back yard for an example of that evidence. Washington state has had the highest minimum wage in the nation for several years—at $9.47, it’s a full 30 percent more than the federal minimum of $7.25. Washington’s unemployment rate of 5.5 percent isn’t the best in the country, but it’s not the worst, either. In fact, it perfectly matches the national rate. Seattle was until recently the fastest growing big city in the country. The first part of the $15 minimum wage rollout was successfully implemented in April, and unemployment in our county promptly plummeted to 3.3 percent.\n\nAn even more dramatic example of the goofiness of this so-called “economic theory” is the impact of the wages of tipped workers on the restaurant industry. In Washington, these workers earn at least $9.47 plus tips, a whopping 440 percent more than the federal tipped minimum of $2.13 plus tips. Despite the predictions of “economic theory,” and despite the warnings from the National Restaurant Association that eliminating the tip credit would cause food Armageddon, Seattle has one of the most robust restaurant scenes in the United States. Why? Because when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants, it’s really good for the restaurant business. If economic “theory” were correct and if paying workers more resulted in higher unemployment, we would have no restaurants in Seattle.\n\nEverywhere you care to look, you can find examples of high-wage places with low unemployment, and low-wage places with high unemployment. Seattle and San Francisco, cities with the highest minimum wage in the country, have low unemployment and among the fastest rate of small business job growth in the nation. Mississippi, where the minimum wage remains at the federally mandated $7.25 an hour, has a high unemployment rate of 7 percent, far above the national rate. In the overwhelming majority of circumstances, the high-wage states and cities enjoy low unemployment while the unemployment rate in low-wage states continues to climb.\n\nOther examples abound. CEO pay, for instance, has skyrocketed from 30 times median to 300 times median over the last three decades, but we have more CEOs than ever before. How can this be, if “theory” predicts that higher wages kill employment? So, too, for tech workers and financial service workers—wages in those sectors have been climbing like crazy and so has employment. So clearly, wages can rise a lot, and so can levels of employment.\n\nIn order for something to legitimately be called a theory, it must result in accurate and consistent predictions. For instance the theory F=MA, (force equals mass times acceleration), is never wrong. Ever. In every case ever tested, force actually does equal mass times acceleration. There are no examples in the known universe in which force didn’t equal mass times acceleration. But the same cannot be said for the “theory” that if wages go up, employment will go down. It’s not always true. It’s not even that it’s almost always true—it isn’t even usually true. Thus, the claim that when wages go up for low-wage workers, employment will go down isn’t really a legitimate “theory.” Rather, it’s best understood as a claim designed to influence how people explain the world around them, and by doing so, control people’s behavior. I think of this so-called theory as more of a scam or a confidence game.\n\nIf I can convince you to believe that giving you a raise would result in economic devastation for everyone, and likely unemployment for you, I’ll have economic power over you. The ploy claiming that, “I would love to pay you more, except then it would be bad for you,” has become an article of faith for workers all around the country. This broad untruth is more commonly known as “trickle-down economics.” It is a time-tested way for the powerful to assert control over the less powerful—perhaps the oldest dynamic in human affairs. The real magic of trickle-down economics, by the way, isn’t to convince people that if the rich get richer, that’s good for the economy and therefore good for you. The real power comes from convincing people that if the poor get richer, that will be bad for the economy and bad for you.\n\nThis is why economics is often less science and more scam. People want to think of economics as a natural science, like physics, with the comforting reliability of simple-to-understand theories like F=MA. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Economics is a social science, and the so-called theories are really social and moral constructs. The theory that if wages go up, employment goes down isn’t a physical law like F=MA. It’s a moral law like “bedtime is 9:00 pm.”\n\nEconomics is mostly how humans rationalize who gets what and why. It’s how we instantiate our preferences about status, privileges, and power. So if I can persuade you that if wages rise then employment falls, I can almost certainly reduce the pressure you and society at large put on me to increase your wages. Because in the reality I’ve created to do so would be bad. For you. If people believe that higher wages means financial ruin for those who get them, they will flee from higher wages and the politics that deliver higher wages.\n\nI’m not asserting that everyone who subscribes to this “theory” secretly knows it isn’t true but says it anyway. On the contrary, the people who say it usually believe it. However, people believe all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons, but rarely because of facts or evidence. Rather, we often believe what suits us, what makes us feel good, or what advantages us. And if you are a person who pays wages or are sympathetic to those who do so, the theory that if wages go up, employment comes down is a very attractive thing to believe and to promulgate. After all, if I run a business, your wages are my profits.\n\nThe most powerful forces in economics are not numbers or facts. They are prejudices and preferences. No amount of evidence will ever change the degree to which many of the rich and powerful prefer themselves to be richer and more powerful and others poorer and weaker. The $15 minimum wage will work, just like all the other big historical increases in the minimum wage worked. Workers will be better off, and unemployment rates will be largely unaffected. But the people who prefer the rich to be richer and the poor poorer and the economists who are sympathetic to them will ignore this evidence in the same way they ignore all of the present and past evidence. It’s really just about deciding which side you’re on.",

I wouldn't of marked the USPS lot because it is an actual functioning lot. Does it need to be redeveloped? Sure, but I wouldn't really consider it a surface lot blight. Also another one that shouldn't of been highlighted is a parcel at the very north end of the Pearl District is actually an open field park, not an empty lot.Also, not to nitpick, but I do live here, so I do know what some of those lots are.

  "latent_4337": "Imagine a prosthetic device capable of restoring decision-making in people who have reduced capacity due to brain disease or injury. While this may sound like science fiction, researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have proven for the first time that it is possible in non-human primates, and believe that one day it will be possible in people.\n\nIn essence, the scientists used an electronic prosthetic system to tap into existing circuitry in the brain at the cellular level and record the firing patterns of multiple neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in decision-making. They then “played” that recording back to the same brain area to electrically stimulate decision-based neural activity. Not only did it restore function, in some cases, it also improved it.\n\n“The prosthetic device is like ‘flipping a switch’ to turn on a decision in real time,” said Sam Deadwyler, Ph.D., professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest Baptist, and senior author of the study, which is published in the Sept.14 issue of the Journal of Neural Engineering.\n\nIn the study, the scientists trained five monkeys to match multiple images on a computer screen until they were correct 70 to 75 percent of the time. First, an image appeared on the screen, which the animals were trained to select using a hand-controlled cursor. The screen then went blank for up to two minutes, followed by the reappearance of two to eight images, including the initial one, on the same screen.\n\nWhen the monkeys correctly chose the image they were shown first, the electronic prosthetic device recorded the pattern of neural pulses associated with their decision by employing a multi-input multi-output nonlinear (MIMO) mathematical model, developed by researchers at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn the next phase of the study, a drug known to disrupt cognitive activity, cocaine, was administered to the animals to simulate brain injury. When the animals repeated the image-selection task, their decision-making ability decreased 13 percent from normal. However, during these “drug sessions,” the MIMO prosthesis detected when the animals were likely to choose the wrong image and played back the previously recorded “correct” neural patterns for the task.\n\nAccording to the study findings, the MIMO device was exceedingly effective in restoring the cocaine-impaired decision-making ability to an improved level of 10 percent above normal, even when the drug was still present and active.\n\n“The basis for why the MIMO prosthesis was effective in improving performance was because we specifically programmed the model to recognize neural patterns that occurred when the animals correctly performed the behavioral task in real time, which is a unique feature of this particular device,” said Robert E. Hampson, Ph.D., associate professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest Baptist, and lead author of the study.\n\n“Based on the findings of this study, we hope in the future to develop an implantable neuroprosthesis that could help people recover from cognitive deficiencies due to brain injuries,” Hampson said.\n\nCo-authors of the study are: Ioan Opris, Ph.D., and Lucas Santos, Ph.D., Wake Forest Baptist; Greg A. Gerhardt, Ph.D., University of Kentucky; and Dong Song, Ph.D., Vasilis Marmarelis, Ph.D., and Theodore W. Berger, Ph.D., University of Southern California.\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants DA06634, DA023573 and DA026487; by National Science Foundation grant EEC-0310723; and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), contract N66601-09-C-2080 to S.A.D.\n\nMedia Relations\n\nMarguerite Beck: marbeck@wakehealth.edu, 336-716-2415",

The team hoped to re-sign him to the practice squad heading into Week 1, but the Los Angeles Rams claimed him off waivers. That’s where he spent the first week of the season before being waived on Wednesday to make room for Cornelius Lucas.\n\nOnce Dielman cleared waivers, the Bengals were quick to get him on the practice squad, filling the void left by Jake Elliott. Ironically, Elliott was also a fifth-round pick this year who was waived during final cuts. He was initially signed to the Bengals’ practice squad, but the Philadelphia Eagles signed him to their 53-man roster earlier this week.\n\nDielman fits the mold of offensive linemen the Bengals prefer in that he's very versatile and provides depth at multiple positions. He was a starting center and team captain for the Utah Utes in 2016 after starting all 26 games in 2014 and 2015 at the right tackle spot.\n\nHowever, Dielman only appeared in five games last season before sustaining a season-ending leg injury. It’s unclear what exactly the injury was, but it was enough to end his season and help lead to him falling into Day 3 of the draft. Dielman also missed a good portion of Bengals OTAs, though he went through training camp with no reported setbacks.\n\nEven so, the Bengals felt that Alex Redmond, T.J. Johnson and Christian Westerman earned those final interior lineman spots over Dielman. It’s also still unclear what Dielman’s long-term NFL position will be, but the kind of versatility he has is something the Bengals love.\n\nDielman had little chance of taking Russell Bodine’s starting center spot this year, but Bodine hits free agency in 2018. Having Dielman can be insurance in case Bodine goes elsewhere while also giving Cincinnati depth across the offensive line in 2017 if anyone on the 53-man roster is injured.",
  "latent_4453": "Your summer trip to Europe should not only be about drinking at bars in Munich and youth hostels, right? If you’re up for taking a slight detour and exploring Europe, here are some wild, fascinating, strange, morbid and borderline ridiculous festivals that can teach you a lot about the continent’s vibrant cultures.\n\n1. El Colacho\n\nWhere: Spain\n\nWhen: June 7\n\nOne of the world’s most bizarre (and frankly terrifying) events is the Baby Jumping Festival (El Colacho) that takes place annually in Spain’s Castrillo de Murcia. An exorcism of sorts – newborn infants are swaddled and placed on mattresses in the street while grown men dressed as Devils jump over them. This act is supposed to cleanse the babies of original sin, but we suppose if “the Devil” happens to lose his footing, all bets are off. El Colacho is certainly one of the more controversial celebrations in the ring of festivals, but with bullfighting and tomato throwing also occupying Spain’s corner, it’s just another addition to the list of the country’s bizarre customs.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n2. Venice Biennale\n\nWhere: Venice, Italy\n\nWhen: May 9 to November\n\nIf discovering and checking out Europe’s finest art galleries and exhibitions is high on your travel agenda, we sincerely hope you do not miss out on the Venice Biennale.\n\nAs one of the biggest international art events, the festival goes on for a good five months where the world’s best and brightest artists new and bold work is displayed. People from all around flock to this city to catch a glance, while world renowned critics form their opinions. The Biennale gets larger and larger by the year, and features over 150 artists from 88 countries.\n\nFun fact : The Vatican tasked a group of artists to build/create a more contemporary and modern version of the first chapters of the book of Genesis.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n3. Festival No.6\n\nWhere: Portmerion, Wales, UK\n\nWhen: September 3\n\nThe perfect destination for backpackers and travellers, Festival No 6 has earned itself more than a few accolades for being intimate, stylish and awe-inspiring. The festival, which brings together the whole town, is also a healthy alternative to over-crowded and hedonistic EDM festivals, with its family-friendly camping areas and activities.\n\nThe music at boutique gala suits its setting perfectly, with a eccentric range of rock, folk and techno. Over the past two years artistes like James Blake, My Bloody Valentine, The Smiths and Manic Street Preachers have performed here. Stages are set at different venues in the village i.e the town hall, the amphitheatre, the stone boat and the field over-looking the sea, among other spaces.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n4. Festival Of Giants\n\nWhere: Douai, France\n\nWhen: July 12 to 14\n\nTaking another turn for the weird, here is a festival that is a 500 year old tradition in france. Every July, in Douai massive human effies/statues of the Gayant (giant) family are paraded on the streets in the midst of dancing, singing and overall revelry. People flock to the streets in their wackiest/medieval outfits to witness a longstanding cultural tradition of the land. The biggest ‘Gayant’ happens to Monsieu Gayant, who towers to 28 feet and weighs around 820 pounds.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n5. Festival of Near Death Experiences\n\nWhere: Pontevedra, Spain\n\nWhen: July 29\n\nFounded by those random Russian dudes who like to hang from skyscrapers…\n\nOkay, so here’s the context – Similar to Mexico’s festival of the dead, Spain likes to celebrate the people who nearly died? On this day very drab-ly dressed family members carry people who had near-death experiences in the past year to their catholic Church where a large mass is held. The most unusual aspect being, old men without families must carry their own coffins to the mass. Later, the procession moves to the Church cemetery where they sing “Virgin Santa Marta, Star of the North, we bring those who saw death.”\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n6. Wife-Carrying Championship\n\nWhere: Sonkajarvi, Finland\n\nWhen: July 3\n\nInspired by a gang of thieves that was notorious for stealing women from villages in the late 1800s, the Wife-Carrying Championship undoubtedly boasts some honorable roots. First introduced in Sonkajarvi, Finland – this sport expects competitors to carry their female companions through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. Running downhill with a woman squeezing your head between her thighs probably doesn’t sound like the ideal way to spend a hot afternoon, but when the light at the end of the tunnel (the grand prize) is your wife’s weight in beer – you will certainly want to ‘run for your wife’!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n7. Oktoberfest\n\nWhere: Munich, Germany\n\nWhen: Late September to October\n\nNot the usual summer festival but definitely something taking a sabbatical from work for, Oktoberfest is pretty much the largest beer centric festival in the world held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It is a 16-day festival running from late September to the first weekend in October with more than 6 million people from around the world attending the event every year. The Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture, having been held since 1810.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n8. World Body Painting Festival\n\nWhere: Austria\n\nWhen: 3 to 5 July\n\nAustria’s body-painting festival is a vibrant cacophony of music, colours and art. And it’s happening this July. BPF, ‘a fusion of body and beats’, is being held on 3 to 5 July, colouring the streets of Poertschach, Austria. Their lineup features global indie acts like Gentleman, the reggae/dancehall veteran from Germany, Pineapple Express, a live electronic act from Italy, City Lights Calling, an acoustic band homegrown in Austria and many more.",
  "latent_4490": "This article is about the rock musician. For the hip hop pop-rap musician Jack Edward Johnson, see Jack & Jack\n\nJack Hody Johnson[1] (born May 18, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter,[2] musician, actor, record producer, documentary filmmaker and former professional surfer. Johnson is known primarily for his work in the soft rock and acoustic genres.[3][4] In 2001, he achieved commercial success after the release of his debut album, Brushfire Fairytales. Johnson has reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart with his albums Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George in 2006, Sleep Through the Static in 2008, To the Sea in 2010, and From Here to Now to You in 2013. Johnson's In Between Dreams album peaked at number 2 on the chart in 2005 and again in 2013.[5]\n\nJohnson is active in environmentalism and sustainability, often with a focus on the world's oceans. Johnson and wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and the Kōkua Hawaii Foundation.[6] In 2008, Johnson adopted the concept of greening (reduce and reuse), and donated 100% of the proceeds of the Sleep Through the Static tour to the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation. Similarly, the proceeds from the 2010 To the Sea album tour went to All At Once, a Johnson backed collaborative of greening charities promoting fan involvement.[7][8][9]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nThe son of well-known surfer Jeff Johnson, Jack was born and raised on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii.[10] He began to learn how to surf at the age of five. At seventeen he became the youngest invitee to make the finals of the Pipeline Masters, one of surfing's most prestigious surfing events, on Oahu's North Shore. One week later, however, his stint as a professional surfer ended when he suffered a surfing accident at the Pipeline that put more than 150 stitches in his forehead and removed a few of his teeth; this later became the inspiration for the song \"Drink the Water\".[11][12] He appeared as a surfer in The Endless Summer II in 1994.[13]\n\nJack Johnson graduated from Kahuku High School in Oahu. He would later attend the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and graduated in 1997[14] with a B.A. in Film Studies.[15] While Johnson learned the guitar at the age of 8 and started songwriting at the age of 12, his passion for music grew when he played rhythm guitar for the band Soil (not to be confused with the heavy metal band of the same name) in college.[11] In 1994, Zach Gill's band, Django Reinhardt, released a CD that quickly made Django a favorite band of the Isla Vista party scene at UCSB. Django was the rival of Jack Johnson's band Soil, but Gill and Johnson developed a strong friendship that became bandmates in later years.[11][16][17] While with Soil at UCSB, Johnson opened for then relatively unknown acts such as Sublime and Dave Matthews with far from sold out crowds at the venues.[11]\n\nJohnson credits his songwriting influences as Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Radiohead, Otis Redding, G. Love and Special Sauce, Ben Harper, Sublime, The Beatles, Bob Marley, Neil Young, and A Tribe Called Quest.[18] Johnson names Jimi Hendrix as his all-time favorite guitarist.[19]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nJohnson performing in 2005.\n\n2000–03: Brushfire Fairytales and On and On [ edit ]\n\nJack Johnson's big break was writing and contributing vocals for the song \"Rodeo Clowns\" which was featured on G. Love's 1999 album Philadelphonic. The song would later become the most famous single on the album.\n\nIn addition to his later success as a musician, Johnson is also an accomplished filmmaker. Johnson directed the surf films Thicker Than Water (2000) and The September Sessions (2002), in which he also starred. Both movie soundtracks were also products of Johnson. Johnson also starred in the 2004 surf film A Brokedown Melody.\n\nSuela released a four track demo that caught the attention of Ben Harper's producer, J. P. Plunier, who worked with Johnson to produce his debut album Brushfire Fairytales during December 2000 with Harper and his Weissenborn lap steel guitar making a guest appearance.[11][20] Brushfire Fairytales was released on February 1, 2001, and led to Johnson becoming the opening act in late February 2001 for the last twenty-three cities of Ben Harper's “Innocent Criminals” tour of the United States.[11]\n\nJohnson went back into the studio with Adam Topol (drums, percussion) and Merlo Podlewski (bass), who played on Brushfire Fairytales, and Mario Caldato Jr on production duties, to record his second full-length album On and On. It was the first album to be recorded at Johnson's Mango Tree Studio in Johnson's home town of North Shore, Oahu, and the first to be released through The Moonshine Conspiracy Records. On and On was released on May 6, 2003.\n\nThe Moonshine Conspiracy Records was later changed to Brushfire Records; Johnson turned the offices and studios of his Los-Angeles based record company into a model of eco-friendliness, with solar power, recyclable CD packaging, and power-saving air conditioners.[21]\n\n2004–09: In Between Dreams, Curious George, and Sleep Through the Static [ edit ]\n\nJohnson performing at the Austin City Limits Festival 2004.\n\nOn April 3, 2004, Johnson and Ben Harper performed with Toots and the Maytals on Saturday Night Live (season 29, episode 16).[22][23]\n\nIn October 2004, Johnson returned to the Mango Tree Studio with Topol and Podlewski along with Zach Gill (of Animal Liberation Orchestra) playing accordion, melodica and piano, to record his follow-up to 2003's On and On. In Between Dreams was released on March 1, 2005.\n\nSing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George is a soundtrack album by Johnson, released on February 7, 2006. The album also features Ben Harper, G. Love, Merlo Podlewski and Zach Gill. It was the first soundtrack to make it to number 1 since the Bad Boys II soundtrack in August 2003, and was the first soundtrack for an animated film to top the Billboard 200 since the Pocahontas soundtrack in July 1995.\n\nJohnson enlisted J.P. Plunier to produce his fourth full-length studio album, Sleep Through the Static. It was recorded using 100% solar energy at the Solar-Powered Plastic Plant studio in Los Angeles. The album featured Gill (keys), Podlewski (bass) and Topol (drums, percussion). Sleep Through the Static was released on February 1, 2008, and was followed by a world tour.\n\nA live album and DVD of Johnson's 2008 world tour, entitled En Concert, was released on October 27, 2009.[24] The DVD was directed by Emmett Malloy.\n\nJohnson spearheaded the Kōkua Festivals (2004–2008 and 2010). Often occurring around Earth Day, these six years of festivals provided support for the Kōkua Hawai'i Foundation, which is a charitable organization that supports environmental education in the schools and communities of Hawaii. Kōkua Festival 2004/2005 was a DVD released by Jack Johnson Music that showcased the early Kōkua Festivals. He also participated, with Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews, Eddie Vedder and others, in the documentary Kōkua 2008: 5 Years of Change (2009),[25] produced by Brushfire and Three Foot Giant Productions and shown on Sundance Channel.[26] On April 17, 2012, preceding his 2012 Hawaiian Islands tour, he released the live Kōkua Festival compilation Best of Kōkua Festival.[27][28][29]\n\nJohnson produced Animal Liberation Orchestra's fifth studio album, Man of the World, which was released February 9, 2010. The album also features vocals from Johnson.\n\n2010: To the Sea [ edit ]\n\nOn February 1, 2010, Johnson's official website announced that his fifth studio album, To the Sea, was in the recording process at the Mango Tree Studio, with a planned worldwide release during the first week of June 2010.[30][31] The website also announced an accompanying European, Australian and New Zealand tour to coincide with the album's release on midnight 31 May.[30]\n\nThe first single from To the Sea was \"You and Your Heart\", released on April 6, 2010.[32]\n\nWhile speaking with New Zealand radio station ZM, Johnson said he is constantly aiming to build relationships with local pro-environment, non-profit groups. \"We try to raise money for a lot of these groups who are doing positive things in the community. We try to focus mostly on environmental education, just trying to get kids out into nature, supporting local farms and things like that.\"[33]\n\nJohnson embarked on a world tour in 2010 with Paula Fuga, a Hawaiian vocalist, playing at a range of venues across the world including Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, U.S. and Japan.\n\n2012: Hawaiian Islands tour [ edit ]\n\nJohnson performing as a headliner at Bonnaroo on June 15, 2013\n\nOn February 22, 2012, Jack with John Cruz and Paula Fuga announced a 7-show acoustic tour of the Hawaiian Islands during April.[34][35][36]\n\nAt the Stan Sheriff Center on April 14, 2012, during the Pillars of Peace Hawai'i: Building Peace on a Foundation of Aloha, Johnson performed introductory music before Nobel Peace Laureate Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, gave the speech \"Educating the Heart\". Better Together was one of several songs Jack performed.[37][38][39][40][41][42]\n\n2013–present: Bonnaroo, From Here to Now to You, and All the Light Above It Too [ edit ]\n\nJohnson released From Here to Now to You with his band on September 17, 2013. On June 15, 2013, Jack and the Band performed as headliners at the 2013 Bonnaroo in Tennessee.[43][44] He also played two acoustic concerts, one at London's Tabernacle in Notting Hill and the other at New York City's Allen Room at Lincoln Center overlooking Central Park, featuring songs from his upcoming album.[45][46][47] The From Here to Now to You Tour ran from March through September 2014.\n\nIn February 2017, Johnson announced a U.S. tour beginning in Chicago at the Huntington Bank Pavilion on Northerly Island on June 1 and ending with two Kōkua Hawai‘i Foundation benefit concerts at the Waikiki Shell on August 4 & 5. Also, he revealed plans to release an album in the summer 2017.[48][49][50] Later, he added a September 10 concert for the 2017 Ohana Fest at Doheny State Beach, Dana Point, California.[51] On September 8, 2017, Jack released his seventh studio album All the Light Above It Too, and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard chart's \"Artist 100.\"[52][not in citation given] In July 2018, Johnson released his greatest hits album \"Jack Johnson: The Essentials\" in Japan.[53]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nOn July 22, 2000, Johnson married his college girlfriend, named Kim.[17][54] They have three children: two boys and a girl. Johnson lives on the North Shore of the island of Oahu in Hawaii. In an interview with Johnson, Ann Donahue from Billboard described Johnson's family life by saying \"There is often trouble in balancing the life of an artist, environmentalist, and family man, but Johnson seems to have the niche for such a challenge. This time around, he's found a pace that agrees with him...bringing his family along so he can spend mornings with them sightseeing.\"[55] Both Johnson and his wife decline to talk about or release any intimate information concerning their children.[56]\n\nCharity [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Johnson and his wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation, a non-profit public charity supporting environmental, art, and music education worldwide. Jack and Kim Johnson also founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation in 2003. Johnson and his family work hard every year at festivals and concerts alike, to raise money for causes they feel are most important. Johnson recorded a cover of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" for the 2007 benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, which was also included on the 2009 benefit album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. In talking about Johnson and his career choices, Rolling Stone wrote: \"It is a typically generous move from Johnson, who has used his multi-platinum success to support causes he cares about.\" Although the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation is a non-profit organization that \"focuses on environmental, arts and music education\", it has raised more than $750,000 from 2009 to 2010 to give away.[57] Johnson was in Osaka, Japan on his To the Sea 2010 World Tour at the time of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. He was in a hotel with his family when it struck. After having to postpone the rest of his tour, he donated $50,000 to GlobalGiving's Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund.\n\nJohnson's Ohana Charitable Foundation has also supported Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. He also decorated a guitar for Little Kids Rock to auction to raise funds for its program.[58]\n\nOn September 22, 2012, he donated his time to play a few songs at Farm Aid 2012 in Hershey, PA. Later in 2012, Jack donated $50,000 for Hurricane Sandy relief and added links on his website for others to donate:\n\n“ After years of touring and surfing along the East Coast, I have made so many great friends. It is heartbreaking to see the images and hear their stories. I just made donations to help recover and relief efforts for Hurricane Sandy. Below is a list of groups you can support. If you can't donate money, you can donate food, supplies or your time. Our East Coast family, friends and neighbors need our help. Aloha\n\n–Jack[59] ”\n\nVocal and music style [ edit ]\n\nJohnson combines baritone vocals with laid-back acoustic instrumentation. He occasionally uses reggae, hip-hop, and soca singing styles, as well as electric instruments.\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nList of awards and nominations received [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Valley Forge National Historical Park, for example, will be celebrating George Washington’s 284th birthday with cupcakes, samples of a birthday cake made using Martha’s Washington’s “Great Cake” recipe and a parade for children that will teach them “how to march and drill like a Continental soldier.” Admission is free.\n\nFlying Drones at National Parks Can Result in Fines, Penalties\n\nFrom March 5-13, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society’s 2016 Philadelphia Flower Show, held in the 33-acre Philadelphia Convention Center, will have a National Park Service centennial theme, with floral and garden designers creating displays inspired by Valley Forge and Shenandoah, Yellowstone, Yosemite and many other parks and historic sites.\n\nThe show will also feature a “Big Timber Lodge” made of wood and stone, with Native American-inspired art, floral totems, a 12-foot waterfall and a life-size American buffalo sculpture. (Tickets: $27 for adults; $20 for students, 7-14; Kids age 2-16: $15.)\n\nDuring National Park Week (April 16-24), admission fees will be waived at all park sites that have them (look here for a list of other free admission days in 2016).

  "latent_4558": "You may also be looking for the Catullan named Tongo Rad.\n\nTongo was a strategic Ferengi game that was a combination of cards and roulette and which was played with two to eight players. The object of the game was to win by acquiring as much wealth as possible.\n\nOn a given turn, a player could \"confront\", \"evade\", \"acquire\", or \"retreat\". Each venture had a \"risk\" amount, a \"buy\" amount, and a \"sell\" amount, where the risk amount was equal to the sell amount minus the buy amount. Other possible actions a player could take include \"indexing the margin\", \"indexing the exchange\", \"leveraging the buy-in\", and \"converting reserves\". (DS9: \"Change of Heart\")\n\nPossible tongo hands included a \"full consortium\" and a \"total monopoly\" (the latter being higher than the former). (DS9: \"Change of Heart\")\n\nAccording to Jadzia Dax, the key to tongo was \"to confront when you're sure you're in a better position than the other players. And if your cards match the roll of the dice, then you win.\" (DS9: \"Meridian\") According to Quark, tongo was more than just \"number-crunching\"; they had yet to create a computer that could master the intricacies of the game. (DS9: \"Change of Heart\")\n\nA Global Tongo Championship was held each year on Ferenginar. As of 2373, Zek had won the tournament for twenty-seven years in a row. He also played it for fun. (DS9: \"Ferengi Love Songs\", \"Profit and Lace\")\n\nMiles O'Brien once played tongo against a Ferengi privateer and a Romulan mercenary. (DS9: \"Change of Heart\")\n\nQuark was on a 208-game winning streak over a month-long period during mid-2374 when he beat Jadzia for his 207th victory, causing Worf to lose a bet with O'Brien for a bottle of scotch whisky. O'Brien enlisted Julian Bashir to help beat Quark and end his streak, but Bashir failed when Quark distracted him with talk of Jadzia and Worf's recent marriage to chalk up his 208th victory. (DS9: \"Change of Heart\")\n\nDuring his association with Gaila, when he believed he might be killed, Quark made a gift of his tongo wheel to Jadzia. (DS9: \"Business as Usual\")\n\nIn early 2375, Quark suggested that letting Worf beat him in a game of tongo would be a great battle and would enable Jadzia to enter Sto-vo-kor. O'Brien told him it would only be enough if he had to \"carve his way through a hundred Jem'Hadar to reach the table.\" (DS9: \"Image in the Sand\")\n\nLater that year, Quark wanted to play tongo in Vic Fontaine's lounge, although since the holoprogram was period-specific he was unable to. (DS9: \"What You Leave Behind\")\n\nBackground information Edit\n\nHilary J. Bader created the name tongo while Ira Steven Behr expanded the concept for \"Rules of Acquisition\". (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, p 97)\n\nThe script for \"Rules of Acquisition\" states that tongo can be best described as a cross between poker, mah-jongg, and craps. There were never any \"official\" rules established; according to Ron D. Moore the writers had only a vague idea of what the game was actually about, and mostly just made it up as they went along. (AOL chat, 1997) In an interview on StarTrek.com, Armin Shimerman mentioned that the lack of rules caused continuity problems in terms of which cards were important and how many were dealt. [1] (X)\n\nIn a deleted scene cut from the final draft of VOY: \"Friendship One\", Tom Paris complained that \"the only people who want to talk to me [from the Alpha Quadrant] are my father and a Ferengi Tongo dealer who claims I still owe him three hundred strips of latinum.\"\n\nExternal link Edit",

  "latent_4643": "Tickets for up coming Stone Roses shows from here\n\nThe Stone Roses ‘Second Coming’ Re-evaluated\n\nIt seems like yesterday.\n\nIt was early December 1994 and I was interviewing baggied up youth outside the now closed Virgin Record shop in Manchester city centre, waiting for the midnight opening of the doors so they could buy the Roses about to be released second album.\n\nMany of them were already too young to have been there for the band’s first coming- the triumphant baggy rush of 89/90 but here they were waiting for their own piece of history.\n\nThe massive queue snaked down the street and when the doors opened the album was being blasted out from the shop and the atmosphere was electric.\n\nWhen the needle hit the groove, would the record change the world like the debut? Could it mean as much?\n\nThe Stone Roses second album came out with the same sort of build up and suffocating expectation as the Clash’s second album album, Give Em Enough Rope’ and on release the reviews had the same sense of deflation that has totally skewed the record’s place in history. It didn’t change the world, it was only a great rock n roll record but the expectation altered its position in rock history.\n\nThe problem both bands had was that to release one life changing album that defines a generation becomes an impossible hurdle to follow. As I detailed in my book about the band, The Roses spent years recording the second album. At their peak they had looked like they were on the fast track to big time, the proper big time of stadiums and American success but their in built, punk rock bullshit detector would see them implode long before this.\n\nBorn out of punk rock the band wilfully threw everything away in a glorious anti- career burnout. If they had done the smart thing they would have banged out the second album whilst they were peaking with the ”ËFools Gold’ single and those funky loose jams that were hinted at on the next single ”ËOne Love’ and its sensational b side ”ËSomething’s Burning’- arguably the band’s best ever song. This period saw a collision of Can, Public Image, Sly Stone, post punk, Hendrix, funk and all the band’s own strengths. This funkoid Roses would have formed the kernel of a great follow up album and redefined the band permanently as the kings of the loping groove.\n\nThat would have been the moment.\n\nInstead the disappeared for years and pulled each other apart with different drugs, different musical tastes and different lives and somehow in the middle of this they created a great second album that is often overlooked because it didn’t fit in with the myth.\n\nWhen a band loses its intensity and its drive it never gets it back.\n\nThe moment when the mates against the world, last gang in town vibe has gone it can never be recovered. It’s a natural part of the process- who wants to sit in a transit van or a studio for ever! You get older, you change and you move on. Take that into consideration and it’s amazing that the Roses actually produced a second album and one of such quality.\n\nThe band had done a pretty effective job of disappearing off the scene after the 1989/90 dominance. By the time the rest of the world had caught up with them with all the British bands were doing their version of the Stone Roses under the banner of Britpop the mentors and the masters were still beavering away in Rockfield in Wales trying to make sense of what they had.\n\nThe album could have ended up like the Beatles ”ËLet It Be’- scraps and hints of former genius, instead it came out like ”ËAbbey Road’- a last act of wilful discipline as their whole world came crashing down.\n\nThe tensions are apparent on the record, John Squire wanted to go Led Zep, Ian Brown wanted to go more black music despite this and whilst John wrote nearly all the words and music somehow the band made it sound like their own- taking Squire’s ideas by the scruff of their neck and adding their own sound to it. John Squire may have been in creative hyperdrive but the band’s rhythm section was fluid perfect and Ian Brown’s loping supa-cool, Bruce Lee swagger is all over the album, it’s like they can’t help playing to the way their frontman walked.\n\nThe first single off the album was Love Spreads which broke the band’s silence with a late night radio play which I clearly remember hearing whilst we were driving over the moors late one night. In the pre-internet age the idea that a band could disappear so effectively seems insane but the Roses had become invisible until that sudden re-emergence, making the radio play of their single all the more powerful.\n\nThe first press for ‘Second Coming’ was that famous Big Issue front cover. That they decided to do their exclusive comeback interview with the Big Issue was perfect. It was media suicide to not go the traditional press route but the Roses were so far off the beam by now it was perfect.\n\nI bumped into them in the street in Manchester as they were on the way to do the interview. The four of them rushing out of a Manchester city centre hotel- it was one of the last times that Reni was with the band. The interview was controversial with the mainstream press who were angry they didn’t get the exclusive but the band figured that the revenue raised by the Big Issue would go into the right pockets.\n\nIt was a cheeky and amusing move and very punk.\n\nIt set the tone for the whole campaign, with the band operating behind a shroud of smoke. They had always been fond the tease thing, stretching out the tension, it was part of their music. It was now part of their whole set up. The very idea of releasing an album that close to xmas, when all the pop schlock come out getting in the way of number one was a mental risk that would help to cloud the record’s impact but the Roses always had a lot of front.\n\nThe band were in great spirits on the street that day. It was the first sighting of them for years. The last time I had seen Reni was on the same spot and we walked back to Hulme. He told me a lot of stuff about the album, as well as his shoes and about how great it was that the album had breakbeats on it instead of his drumming and how he was sampling and looping his drums in the studio which seemed strange coming from the best drummer of his generation. He also claimed he was skint!\n\nSoon after the Big Issue interview Love Spreads had wafted out of the radio and it sounded so amazing that night that we stopped the van on the moors and got out and opened the doors and listened to it with the cold chill of the moon lighting up the background.\n\nIt was magical and mystical with its strange quasi-religious lyrics and its rumbling dark power. It has to be one of the best comeback singles of all time. Lots of people eventually said that Ten Story Love Song should have been the proper comeback single and it would have been a bigger hit- its pure pop and uplifting stanzas would have been perfect but ”ËLove Spreads’ has the mystery and weirdness and the intangible genius that the Roses at that point of time were after. The video compounded this- fuzzy images of distant weirdness, cine 8 snatches of the band goofing around and disappearing from view, it perfectly matched their mystery.\n\nA tape of the album arrived the next day and I immersed myself in it. Having written about the band for years I got the tape first from the great Hall Or Nothing PR people (who unbeknown to them I had gifted the Roses to after meeting ex- Roses manager Gareth Evans on the train to London years before. Evans has asked if I could write about the band for the NME after my 1987 feature on them in Sounds. I pointed out to him that you could only write for one music paper at a time and gave him the numbers of two PRs- the great Jeff Barrett and the then more established Hall Or Nothing. Both were the best PR’s in the business, who only did the best bands and were also approachable and always had time for the bands and the journalists. I said that Hall Or Nothing were bigger and more established and he rang them first”Â¦).\n\nThe cheekily titled ”ËSecond Coming’ was a shock because it was so different and yet so similar. It didn’t have the euphoric, pure crystalline pop of the debut. it came with amore world weariness but it had an added slinkiness in its grooves and even if it was not 100 per cent perfect it had some really mind-blowing highs.\n\nSure there was an element of Led Zeppelin to the record, not the heavy Zep but the grooving, neo-folksy Zep. The remnants of the punk generation always had a problem with led Zeppelin but they were a great band and the Roses put their own stamp on the classic sound.\n\nThe Roses return was already a mixture of massively heightened expectations and muted disinterest. Oasis were now the top dogs. The bands had met at WH Smiths in Wales near the studio- Noel and Liam bumping into Ian Brown- the baton was passed over, the same baton the Brown had picked up from the Clash when he sneaked into the Westway wonders recoding on ”ËBankrobber’ in the now defunct Pluto Studios in Manchester. Oasis had taken the Roses template, cranked it up and were now the biggest band in the country.\n\nInto this vacuum would arrive an album that wasn’t playing easy to get- with a marked move away from the pretty pop and dark heart melodies of the debut. This time there was a collection of songs that were not instantly accessible melodically and were far heavier than the debut.\n\nEven the sleeve was different. It was darker, meaner, harder to make out, murkier and hinting at something more menacing than the Jackson Pollock pop art of the debut album.\n\nEven the band’s photos for the Big Issue, snapped in Manchester’s Chinatown by legendary lense woman Pennie Smith (whose collection of shots of The Clash ranks as the finest collection of shots of a rock n roll band ever) showed a group looking more pensive and less surly than the late eighties photos, not looking that comfortable in eachother’s company. It was almost like they had forgotten how to pose as a gang.\n\nHad they forgotten how to make records as well?\n\nThe Second Coming kicks off with a swathe of meditative Zen like feedback before segueing into a tape of a river behind the studio in Buckley, the cold river water sluicing down the mountain captured by Ian Brown on a portable DAT player. Shades of ”ËApocalypse Now’ soundtrack? especially with the swathes of dark feedback.\n\nThe track fuses gently into Reni’s drum pattern, a tribal workout that sounds almost like Fleetwood Mac’s great ”ËTusk’. Squire kicks in and we’re off into the album’s debut eleven and a half minutes track, ”ËBreaking Into Heaven’ and we are into classic rock country. There are shades of Jimmy Page with some of the guitar licks- a precursor to the whole album that has that Led Zep stamp on it with the loose, slithering guitar playing.\n\nThere are several layers of guitar- most of them forwards and some of them sliding in backwards, joining the occasional backwards snares that slurp in and out of the collage. Unlike Zep ‘breaking Into heaving’ floats away, it has a delicate beauty and a real tough groove, it is perhaps the Roses playing together at their best with a tightness and looseness that goes way beyond the fractious situation the band found themselves in at the time.\n\nThe track was one of several jammed versions of the song. Breakout, the flipside of Love Spreads was yet another version of the tune. The jam sessions were a key to the album as producer Simon Dawson told the Melody Maker.\n\n“We spent a lot of time getting the backing tracks feeling good. They’d go in and just jam it for maybe a few days. They’d sort of play it all afternoon and maybe get bored with it and play something else and come back to the first song later with a slightly different feel. They just like playing together as a band, so that’s what they wanted to try and capture. If you want to make an album that sounds live, it’s as simple as that. They did spend a lot of time jamming in the studio, and a lot of different feels came out of that.”\n\nFinally the song kicks in and Ian Brown sings with a strong, nasally northern accent. It’s a million miles away from the American blues tradition and stamps a northern stamp all over the song. His voice is husky and rough- it sounds like a man dragged out of bed which suits the deadly poison of the song. Reni’s backing vocals on the chorus are great whilst Ian Brown’s vocals are great on the album, defining the time and space as a singer should, putting a stamp on the proceedings with a husky whispered intensity reminiscent of JJ Burnel, another karate fiend, on the Stranglers The Raven track from years before.\n\nAbout eight minutes into the song there is a great chord change and the song shifts a gear. how many times do I have to tell you that you don’t have to wait to die Brown intones darkly as the song builds towards a climax.\n\nFor an opening track it’s a weird one. Most bands put on a punchy radio tune to get things going but the Roses were putting all their cards on the table, stretching and flexing, playing to their strengths and creating that half focussed wall of mystique that over the years has strengthened the album.\n\nFrom the off you can tell that this is Squire’s record. There are heaps of guitars on here. Piles of them dominating the band’s sound- layers and layers of guitar sound much like the way Jimmy Page piled up the 6 strings in his days with the Zep. Squire’s 59 Les Paul cranked through a hotwired Fender Twin whilst Mani’s Rickenbacker bass is deeper than ever before- an almost bowel shaking tone- closer to the Jah Wobble wobble that dominated Public Image’s finest moments.\n\nThe album is the same combination of hard rock and English folksiness that Zeppelin mastered, it’s music that slots into US rock FM. Except that The Roses had maintained some sort of edge, a smattering of Manchester tuffness that stopped their music tipping over into rawk boredom.\n\nThis was a record made in its time, this was not the tripped out sixties or the excess of the seventies, this was a band who were fusing rock tradition to something of their time, they couldn’t help their Mancunian vowels to shape the songs, their very northerness leaking through the songs epic reach.\n\nMaybe this was down to Ian Brown’s voice. Brown’s vocal’s are one of the key points of the album, squeezing some sort of emotion, in a menacing and laid back manner out, of John Squire’s words.\n\nSquire wrote nearly everything on The Second Coming. It’s never easy singing someone else’s lyrics, Brown when pressed on this said that.\n\n“He was constantly writing really good stuff so there was no point in me doing anything.”\n\nThere is an air of folksiness throughout the album- the campfire shakes of Your Star Will Shine’ is an acoustic workout with the added spice of the line about the bullet being aimed ”right between your daddy’s eyes’ and Tightrope is maudlin, almost English folk rock .\n\nDriving South is twelve bar Zep boogie driving on a mean riff, it contains the hilarious line ”Ëhe must be pretty but he sure as hell can’t sing’- what the fuck is that about? There was dark sardonic humour and a general darkness inside the tracks.\n\nAlready the difference between the two albums is becoming apparent- on the debut The Roses played as a team, as a sum of their parts but now they are all plying their separate paths, all chasing those Squire guitars and somehow making it work.\n\nNot that Reni is panicking; his drums are effortlessly brilliant throughout with deceptively simple skip beats and great timings jamming to the breakbeats. This guy is a constant, totally amazing. He never even changed the skins on his kit and was still using the same drum kit from the first album. Reni was not averse to messing around with his rhythms. As Simon Dawson remembers.\n\n“Reni is well into taking bits of something, sticking it into a sampler and re triggering it and see what comes out, getting a groove from that. We’d go down that line for weeks sometimes.”\n\n”ËTen Story Love Song’ starts off with a squelch, sounding like it is tagged onto the end of a studio jam- all drums and guitars attempting to find the song before the song’s pure pop perfection slopes in. When it comes in it sends the heart soaring. Heaps of melody pile up, each change in the song is yet another great tune heaped up all the way to the chorus. It is the album’s musical link to the pristine pop of the old days, melodically and lyrically.\n\nBrown’s vocal on this is great one of the key points of the track and somehow dredges an innocence from the song whilst Squire’s guitar is a simple chime and nails the melody down, the whole song sounds as effortless as the first album.\n\n”ËTen Storey Love Song’ segues straight into Daybreak’ which again moves along great fractured drums sounding like something they knocked together in a jam. A jam where Reni is totally on form. There is some pretty neat Hammond pumping through the track. It has that late sixties vibe to it- at that point when the white beat bands started stretching out and just before they fell into progressive rock. The whole thing might have worked better if there was bit more Can in there or a bit more of the black psychedelic soul fused into its grooves.\n\nBrown’s one and only self written track Straight To The Man’. Its easy shuffling groove and odd bounce gives it a sleazy swagger all of its own making it one of the stand out tracks on the album and missed chance of a single with a charm all of its own. Its packs a swagger that Shaun Ryder would capture with Black Grape’s debut months later. The jew’s harp in the track gives it an almost red neck biblical preacher man feel, and the song is Brown- all at once being thrown away and sinister and a precursor to the type of music he would do in his successful post Roses career.\n\nBegging You’ sees the Roses finally cut a track that could be perceived as indie/dance. Its disturbed helter skelter, pile driving, neo-industrial nature is perfect for remixing and when it finally came out a single months later it was reworked several times. The Roses worked with a lot of loops and samples, sometimes running the loops through monitors in the studio and jamming along to them, building up whole new tracks from the collision.\n\nThe Roses then gather round the campfire and have a singsong for Tightrope’. It sounds like the mysterious air of the Welsh hills is getting to them and they are further loosing that city touch, that urban howl that fuses all great pop.\n\nGood Times’ and ”ËHow Do You Sleep’ are side two’s excursions into classic Brit rock, the former is a up tempo boogie workout it was The Roses attempting to write a rock classic. Whilst the latter is their potential ”ËStairway to Heaven’ it even has a similar pipe sound winding through the mix and the big rock coda.\n\nThank god for Love Spreads’- the zig zag wanderer and another of The Roses total classics and as good as anything they ever wrote. It storms in with that great riff and spends five years oozing a mysticism all of its own.\n\nAnd that was it, unless you left the CD running for about ten minutes till it hit track 64, when you were treated to The Roses dossing around with violins and a plinky plonk piano for a very drunken sounding exit.\n\nSecond Coming’ was on a hiding to nothing. For most fans the record was inevitably going to be an anti climax. For many of the true believers who had been burned by the sky high experiences of the late eighties, the record would never capture the same sort of heady euphoria that the debut almost unintentionally caught.\n\nThe Stone Roses had released a record. It was not a normal rock record but weighed down by the past they were always going to be struggling to a certain extent. The reaction was so different, this one wasn’t soundtracking the times- you couldn’t hear it pumping out of every bedsit window, it wasn’t accompanying anyone’s life, it was just a great album and one that sounds better and better over the years and is stuffed full of hidden gems.\n\nThey may have released a fine album but there was no way it could have been an historic album. It was a problem that any group who ever captured the times would have to face, the inevitable crash down to the real world can make them seem so human, so vulnerable.\n\nArguably, though, the album is as easily good as their iconic debut.\n\nSome quotes from Ian Brown about the making of the ‘Second Coming’\n\nIan Brown\n\n‘We believed in that album at the time once we got it on the bag. I wrote a lot of lyrics on that album that I never put in for. I changed all John’s negatives into positives- there were loads of negatives in the lyrics- he had this line I got his dead shrimp baby’ about male impotency and I was saying I’m not singing that’ He was saying it’s a dead powerful singing about male impotency and I was saying I don’t feel like that! I wasn’t a negative person I didn’t want to make a dark album. John’s idea was the first album was all sunshine and colours so the second album will be dark and I’m thinking I don’t like dark music- I love reggae and Tamla Motown and uplifting hip hop and punk rock. I don’t like dark music. I don’t feel dark as a person. I don’t feel I have a dark side. I mean I might do but I don’t want to find it! I felt at the time it’s only an album so I can let that go now- I was thinking we got another three LPs in us and we could work differently on those.’\n\nIan Brown\n\nLove is the Law’ was going to be on the ”Second Coming’. We demoed it. Reni just plays an acoustic on it and John just plays an acoustic as well. It’s good song, yeah, I was dead keen to get it on the album but John wasn’t.\n\nWe had a lot of arguments about ”Driving South’ which was a Zeppelin riff- the key of it is quite high and I wouldn’t sing it high like Led Zeppelin and I was saying it would sound like a heavy metal band if I sung it high. I said ”Ëyou fucking sing it’ so John reluctantly let me sing it the way I wanted.\n\nThere’s a couple of songs I wish we hadn’t done like How Do You Sleep’. I know a lot of people like that one but I don’t and I don’t like that Good Times’ either. I don’t like hoary old rock n roll.\n\nThat’s why I put Straight To the man’ on there.\n\nThe album sounded far too rocky so I wanted to put something funky on there.\n\nBreaking Into Heaven’ starts with a tape of baby crocodiles on it sampled off a video of sounds of nature and the running water I got a little DAT and there’s a little stream behind the studio in Buckley and I taped the stream- Breaking into Heaven’ is a great tune. We wrote that over the Eric B and Rakim beat\n\nIt’s a real shame we didn’t do the second album round the time of ‘Fool’s Gold’. When we started recording in ”Ë92 we had Reni playing the drums for 40 minutes and it was out of this world. We were in this place, like an old brewery in this cellar with a natural echo and I remember John Leckie turning around with a big beam on his face after 40 minutes of Reni on the kit and saying ”Ëcan’t this be the album?’ And I’m saying ”Ëfucking right!’ the second album then would have been fucking amazing, Reni’s like Buddy Rich or Gene Krupa- just him on the kit- no toms on the kit- just fucking amazing.’\n\nIan Brown\n\n‘Love Spreads’ came out and went straight in at number 2 in the charts. There was a sense of excitement. We had a big world tour- the agent got out a world map and said here’s a pin where do you want to go?\n\nIan Brown\n\n‘But then Reni was out of the band. Me and him had a row. We were sick of it. We couldn’t wait any longer for him. He didn’t turn up for the interview with the Big Issue, which was our first interview and was for the homeless and the music media who where to buy the interview off us which would be a positive thing from us for the six homeless people in Islington to get homes off the money we raised. Reni didn’t turn up for that interview and the next day we met an agent and he didn’t turn up for that either. The next day we filmed a video for Ten Story Love Song’ and he didn’t turn up for that either. We said we can’t wait for this kid any longer- then we had a cover shot for the NME that only me Mani and John appeared on- it was like the comeback cover and there’s only three of us on the fucking cover because he didn’t turn up!\n\nWe had this guy, Doug Goldstein, who managed Guns n Roses holed up in the Midland Hotel who had left this message that he’s not leaving town till he met us and we said fucking let him stay there- he give Steve Adge a Rolex watch to bribe him to go and meet him! We went to meet him after three or four days. He was a lovely fellow actually but we didn’t take him on in the end and Reni didn’t turn up for that as well!

It turns out the driver was the daughter of the local police chief. The incident serves as a not-so-subtle reminder that you never know who you might contact at any time while on the job.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this occurred eight months ago, and it took some time before there was any disciplinary action conducted by the service. Moreover, it appears that no one is taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nAlong with authority comes responsibility, something that’s a given if you are a professional. I mean, everyone’s human, right? The driver probably did something that was bone-headed, and it’s maybe natural to be a bit hot-headed and respond in an asinine way. Unfortunately, when you drive a vehicle that is readily identifiable as part of a public safety entity, it violates the public’s trust. The problem is compounded when the agency seemingly fails to follow up in a timely manner and transparently investigate the issue.",
  "latent_4754": "Harvard’s so-called final clubs are coming out of the shadows and aggressively taking on the university for threatening their very existence if they don’t go coed.\n\nThe Fly Club is demanding that Rakesh Khurana, dean of Harvard College, remove himself from dealing with the independent single-sex organizations. It’s calling his bluff on claims that the Fly is a hotbed of sexual assault, The Harvard Crimson reports.\n\nThe Fly’s graduate president, Richard Porteus, sent a letter to both Khurana and the Crimson that accused the dean of “conflicts of interest” in his handling of final-club policy.\n\nPorteus demanded – for the second time, by his count – that Harvard turn over the details of any sexual-assault allegations against the Fly in the past five years that the university has “deemed credible.” The club has been publicly recognized by Harvard for its prevention efforts, yet\n\nthe administration has included the Fly Club in its campaign of innuendo and threats, a campaign seemingly aimed at achieving the political agenda of the administration, rather than ensuring the safety of Harvard undergraduates.\n\nRELATED: Harvard’s attack on single-sex clubs is wrong and illegal, says expert on fraternity problems\n\nKhurana must recuse himself on several grounds, Porteus writes:\n\nhe has threatened to expel or retaliate against club members based on an “unproven and contentious premise” he refuses to back with evidence the dean has a financial incentive to blame final clubs – the $750 million in federal funding Harvard stands to lose if it’s judged to not take sexual assault seriously his wife is on the sexual-assault task force that recommended a coed mandate on final clubs his own behavior as a “house master” is the subject of a sexual-assault lawsuit against the school\n\nKhurana’s role in that lawsuit is worth remembering. He oversaw (and continues to oversee) Cabot House, where former resident Alyssa Leader claims she was raped, harassed and retaliated against over several months by another resident she had previously dated.\n\nRELATED: Harvard sexual-assault task force recommends nonstop training, eradication of male-only clubs\n\nThe Crimson reported on Leader’s suit in February, which faulted Harvard for refusing to move her alleged rapist out of Cabot House until she got a restraining order.\n\nRegardless of the merits of Leader’s suit, the fact that Khurana oversaw the house that is now the subject of a lawsuit against Harvard gives him a strong incentive to pass the buck toward an easier target than Greek row, one that he’s always hated – the final clubs.\n\nPorteus also notes that Khurana, a Harvard Business School professor, can use his “perceived power” over would-be final club members who want to get into HBS:\n\nThese students, including residents of the current dean’s own House [Cabot], say they feel frightened and undermined, even though they have done nothing wrong. The dean has already threatened to disqualify them from applying for fellowships, captaining teams, and running for elective student office. Could he not also adversely affect their applications to graduate school, particularly the one where he teaches?\n\nKhurana has long been on the record against “single-gendered organizations,” and he has every incentive to gut them to deflect from his own peccadillos.\n\nRELATED: Harvard forces all-male social clubs to accept women or they’ll ruin their reputations, students claim\n\nThe real question is whether Porteus and the Fly can rally the other final clubs, who also received copies of his letter to Khurana.\n\nThey got a national boost from Caitlin Flanagan of The Atlantic last week, who blasted Harvard for singling out final clubs based on a “meaningless statistic” while turning a blind eye to sexual assault in its own houses and dorms.\n\nBut they got a black eye days earlier from one of their own, the graduate president of the Porcellian Club. He had accused officials of “McCarthyism” for the coed mandate, but he resigned following an uproar over his claim that the coed mandate could actually increase sexual assault.\n\nKhurana is almost certainly counting on a similar uproar against the Fly from rape-culture propagandists, who think that male fellowship is inherently misogynistic and that data science is as meaningless as gender.\n\nRELATED: Harvard’s oldest male-only club accuses officials of ‘McCarthyism’ for coed mandate\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: Christopher Michel/Flickr, GilC/Shutterstock",

  "latent_4931": "After the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) submitted a petition for exemption for the third-class medical requirement for private or recreational pilots on March 20, 2012, more than 14,000 comments overwhelmingly in support of the exemption were submitted to the FAA. However, the agency failed to act on the exemption request, and now Congress is exerting pressure on the FAA to expand the third-class medical exemption, which currently applies to sport pilots.\n\nThe AOPA/EAA request was for pilots who fly aircraft with up to 180 hp, four seats and fixed landing gear; VFR only with no more than one passenger; and not for business or for hire. Pilots seeking to fly using the exemption would have to participate in recurrent online health education and maintain a valid driver’s license.\n\nTo support the petition, AOPA/EAA noted that available “statistical evidence supports our request.” In operations that don’t require a medical certificate, such as gliders, there is no higher incidence of medical-related accidents. And during the first seven years of implementation of the sport pilot rules, which don’t require an FAA medical examination, “there have been NO accidents attributable to pilot medical deficiency,” the groups noted. Yet in the past 10 years there have been plenty of cases where pilots holding valid medical certificates, many flying commercially, suffered serious medical issues, including death, while flying.\n\nOn March 11, Sens. John Boozman (R-Ark.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) introduced a bill–S.2103–that would expand the FAA’s third-class medical exemption; the bill is similar to the House of Representatives’ General Aviation Pilot Protection Act introduced in December. These bills would force the FAA to allow pilots to fly without a third-class medical in non-commercial VFR operations in aircraft weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to six seats, carrying up to five passengers, as high as 14,000 feet and no faster than 250 knots. Industry speculation suggests that the Congressional proposal might be a way to force the FAA to approve the original exemption request to forestall the Act’s more tolerant parameters.\n\nWhile most of the comments on the exemption petition supported it, one pilot and medical professional wrote that the medical requirement “would help maintain safety for passengers as well as people/property on the ground. The thought of knowing that people could be flying above me or in the air with me in unsatisfactory health is quite scary. We need to keep our skies and the ground safe!” Another wrote: “I disagree with the proposal to allow medical certification by driver’s license. Dumb idea. I am a private pilot and it is clear to me that my peers would still fly if unfit medically if they could. Do not do this!”\n\nMost of the commenters echoed this submission from a military, airline and GA pilot: “After flying…for 40 years I think I have the experience and responsible attitude that should allow me to decide if I am fit to fly an airplane. An FAA aeromedical physical is just a snapshot at a specific time; each pilot must decide before each flight if he is fit to make the flight.”",

  "latent_5161": "0 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\n\nIndiana State Sen. Vaneta Becker (R) has proposed legislation that would not improve math or science skills, or indeed, anything having to do with education, but which would introduce, reports the Indianapolis Star, “’performance standards ‘for singing and playing ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at any event sponsored by public schools and state universities.” Also affected would be private schools receiving state or local scholarship funds, including vouchers. That’s a lot of schools.\n\nThis particular piece of legislation from Indiana may seem a minor annoyance to some, though it’s raising quite a fuss among liberals and progressives, but it represents a far greater threat to America than it might seem. And it only goes to show that Wisconsin and Michigan Tea Partiers have nothing on their Hoosier brethren.\n\nThe GOP and its Tea Party allies claim to be all for small and nonintrusive government, but the new law would require performers “to sign a contract agreeing to follow the guidelines. Musicians — whether amateur or professional — would be fined $25 if it were deemed they failed to meet the appropriate standards.” There’s nothing like giving our already overworked legal system more nuisance cases.\n\nAdditionally, “schools to maintain audio recordings of all performances for two years and develop a procedure for dealing with complaints if a musician is alleged to have strayed from the approved lyrical or melodic guidelines.” Becker claims, “I don’t think it would be very difficult for schools. You could record it on a lot of cellphones or like a small recording device (or) a CD.”\n\nShe says it won’t cost the department of education anything, but then, she hasn’t consulted the department of education.\n\nWho would determine what an acceptable rendition of the Star Spangled Banner is? The State Department of Education with some guidance from the Commission for Higher Education. What Becker herself wants is for it to be sung “the way that we normally have it sung or heard throughout most of our state and our country.”\n\nIt has been argued that this bill does not violate the Constitution. But it is hardly in support of the spirit of the Constitution with regards to the ideals of liberty and free expression. It sounds, unsurprisingly, like a very totalitarian move, which puts it in lockstep with most other GOP legislation proposed over the past year. It would certainly put paid to any covers of the famous Jimi Hendrix version.\n\nOne question which occurs to me is whether or not we can charge all those God-fearing country singers for ruining the song with their overdone twangs. But a better question, not that anyone in the Indiana government will ask it (they are overwhelmingly Republican) is, why waste time on how the national anthem is sung when we should be concentrating on getting grades up and improving our schools and educational standards?\n\nStrangely, this law is not a first. According to the Indianapolis Star Massachusetts and Michigan both have similar laws and no, the Tea Party didn’t do it in Michigan – that particular law dates to 1931. Violation is a misdemeanor. In neither state can you use the song as dance music or as aprt of a musical medley or as an exit march and neither state allows you to make “embellishment or addition in the way of national or other melodies.” Worse, it isn’t limited to schools in those states but covers all public places, including theaters, movie theaters, restaurants, and cafes. Additionally, Florida wants you to act in a certain way when the national anthem is performed (don’t even thing about getting jiggy with it).\n\nBig Brother is watching.\n\nOf course, there is already a federal law regarding the national anthem, such as putting your hand over your heart.\n\nTitle 36 United States Code: § 301. National Anthem. (a) Designation. — The composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem. (b) Conduct During Playing. — During a rendition of the national anthem — (1) when the flag is displayed — (A) all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart; (B) men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and (C) individuals in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. (2) When the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed.\n\nBut federal law doesn’t get persnickety about how the song is sung. And this one gets ignored every Sunday at every football game in the United States during the fall and winter and at every baseball game from spring to fall. So far, nobody has been extraordinarily renditioned but then, if they were, we wouldn’t know, would we? And who knows, we have to do something with those predator drones and Perry can’t possibly use all of them on the Mexican border. So many tempting targets, so much money to use…\n\nBecker and her ilk need to understand there is a difference between basic respect (hand to heart, etc) and artistic expression. Artistic expression is something integral to a free society. And look folks, patriotism isn’t patriotism when it’s coerced and expressions of patriotism cannot be rigidly defined. We each show it in our own way, for example, some by supporting a war and some, equally, by opposing the same war. And a person is no less patriotic because they might hit a high note that is not on the sheet music. I personally find some of the renditions I’ve been exposed to horrific but never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined a law enacted against such performances.\n\nThis is simply an egregious example of what the Republican Party has been about for the past two years, pushing through in state after state and in the federal government legislation that has no direct bearing on any of the many crises we, as a country face. Rather than direct their attention to our real problems, the GOP has time and again directed its attention to problems of its own manufacture, presenting their bills as triumphs for liberty each time they erode our rights.\n\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

  "latent_5229": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Masahiro Tanaka threw two scoreless innings in his spring debut with the New York Yankees, striking out three in a 4-0 exhibition win Saturday against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nIn a game televised live in the early-morning hours in Japan and that took place in front of a packed house at George M. Steinbrenner Field, the 25-year-old Tanaka also allowed a pair of singles in his 31-pitch outing.\n\n\"I was nervous, but it was a good nervous,\" said Tanaka, who was most pleased he didn't walk anyone.\n\nThe Yankees signed Tanaka to a seven-year, $155 million contract in hopes that he can be a young anchor in their rotation for seasons to come. Even though the team has made a concerted effort to limit the expectations and distractions for the right-hander, it hasn't been able to dim the spotlight over two continents.\n\nSaturday was no different. When Tanaka stepped to the mound to begin the fifth, he received a loud ovation with many of the fans standing. He quickly got up 0-2 before allowing a lined single to Darin Ruf on a 94 mph fastball.\n\nTanaka retired the next two batters on fly balls before ending the inning by unleashing another 94 mph fastball, on a 3-2 pitch, on which Cesar Hernandez swung and missed.\n\nTo start the sixth, Tanaka struck out Ben Revere on three pitches, finishing off the center fielder with his renowned splitter that dropped late.\n\n\"That split is dirty,\" Yankees teammate CC Sabathia said.\n\nAfter allowing an 0-2 single to Ronny Cedeno, Tanaka struck out Domonic Brown swinging on a high 89 mph cutter. He ended the inning by getting Kelly Dugan to fly out.\n\nTanaka's 31 pitches were four fewer than the Yankees had allotted for him. His catcher, Francisco Cervelli, said that Tanaka seemed calm, like he had pitched in the majors before, while manager Joe Girardi thought it was important for Tanaka to put the first outing behind him.\n\n\"It is the place probably where he is at the most peace,\" Girardi said. \"Not having to answer questions. He is able to do his work. I think it was important for him to get it under his belt. Next time, he will be a starter.\"\n\nGirardi was unsure when Tanaka will pitch next.\n\nThe spring training game began at 3 a.m. Sunday in Japan, but that did not stop TV stations there from broadcasting the contest, which featured Tanaka alongside others Japanese greats from the present and past.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka received a rousing ovation after throwing two scoreless innings in his spring debut. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports\n\nTanaka was preceded on the mound by Hiroki Kuroda. Ichiro Suzuki played right field. And Hideki Matsui, who helped recruit Tanaka to the Yankees, threw batting practice in the pregame.\n\nKuroda said it was probably the most watched spring training game in Japan's history.\n\nThe focus on Tanaka's first exhibition pitches as a Yankee made slimmed-down Sabathia's first preseason start and Derek Jeter's second appearance of the spring part of the day's undercard. It is very unusual for the retiring Jeter not to be the main event.\n\n\"I had to do a lot of things to get him under the radar,\" Girardi said.\n\nDuring his appearance, #TanakaTime was trending in New York on Twitter.\n\nTanaka's every move has been monitored since he signed his lucrative deal with the Yankees in January.\n\nLed by general manager Brian Cashman, the club has tried to diminish expectations, pointing out the size of the contract was a result of the marketplace for a 25-year-old with talent.\n\nCashman said Tanaka could be a No. 3 starter, and Girardi has not decided yet whether Tanaka will start the third regular-season game in Houston or the fourth in Toronto.\n\nTanaka's side and bullpen sessions have been events, with each of the seven pitches (four-seam and two-seam fastballs, splitter, cutter, curveball, changeup and slider) in his repertoire being dissected to try to measure the amount of success he will have in the majors.\n\nThe Yankees have set up different rules compared with other pitchers to try to limit the distractions as Tanaka prepares.\n\nTanaka has not seemed affected by the scrutiny. He deals with two sets of press corps -- one from Japan and one from the United States -- talking to each daily and not seeming overwhelmed.\n\nAlthough Tanaka's debut was a big deal across two continents, it was spring training as usual for many of his teammates. Many arrived Saturday morning not even knowing Tanaka would be on the mound in the afternoon.",

Thank u for educating me i am learning all the time too 🌸 — Lorde (@lorde) December 21, 2017\n\nActivists have sought to economically and culturally isolate Israel since 2005, when a coalition of 170 organizations from Palestinian civil society called on \"people of conscience\" to employ non-violent tactics to pressure Israel into ending its military control of Palestinian territories and comply with international law in its treatment of Palestinians.\n\nThe BDS movement is modeled after a similar campaign in the 1970s and 80s to end apartheid rule in South Africa.\n\nIn response to the movement, numerous writers, artists and musicians have canceled events in Israel or declared their support for a cultural boycott. Among them are Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters, Gil Scott-Heron and Elvis Costello.\n\nCritics have said the movement unfairly targets Israel, is unhelpful to achieving a negotiated peace and is even anti-Semitic. British rock band Radiohead rejected calls to cancel its concert in Tel Aviv earlier this year. Thom Yorke, the band's frontman, said music is about \"crossing borders, not building them.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made defeating the BDS movement a priority of his administration. In March, the Knesset passed a law barring those who support boycotts against Israel or West Bank settlements from entering the country.\n\nGilad Erdan, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, said at the time the law was \"another step in our struggle against those who seek to delegitimize Israel while hiding behind the language of human rights.\" Critics slammed the law as an attack on free speech.\n\nLorde, who was awarded two Grammys in 2014 for her hit song \"Royals,\" has previously championed other political and social issues.\n\nSachs and Abu-Shanab noted Lorde's views in their letter, writing: \"We've watched as you've used your platform to draw attention to institutional racism, sexism and white privilege.

  "latent_5372": "Obama-era climate regulations are giving way to cybersecurity, infrastructure and nuclear power as top priorities for state groups descending on Washington this month to talk about how President Trump's election changes their energy priorities.\n\nPresident Obama's cherished Clean Power Plan is sinking fast under Trump.\n\nEven if the plan's climate rules make it out of a federal appeals court, the Supreme Court will have the final say, as Trump's nominee to replace conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia restores the nine-judge panel.\n\nThat has states embracing new energy realities under a Trump administration, especially with nearly 30 states' attorneys general opposing the climate plan in court, and one of them nominated to lead the EPA.\n\n\"I think we've taken a hiatus on Clean Power Plan because a big part of that is going to be obviously driven by a new Supreme Court justice,\" said Robert Powelson, new president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.\n\nHis group represents state economic regulators who decide what gets built and what doesn't to keep the lights on and industry humming.\n\nClimate regulation is toast, according to Powelson, who is from Pennsylvania, where fracked natural gas is king.\n\nHe sees natural gas reducing carbon dioxide emissions more effectively through the existing energy markets than through regulations enforced by the EPA.\n\n\"I come from a state where we are seeing tremendous reductions in the market-based decarbonization that is taking place in my state because of new state-of-the-art combined cycle gas plants that are driven by Marcellus [shale],\" which is the source of his state's natural gas boom, he said.\n\nPowelson doesn't have much sympathy for an EPA facing cuts under Trump of as much as half its staff.\n\n\"My governor is going to do a budget address here on Feb. 7 and he's talking about merging state departments,\" Powelson said. \"And look, I will be the first one to tell you, just from personal experience, between [the Waters of the U.S. Rule] and Clean Power Plan, I think a lot of state regulators on the environmental side and the economic regulator side, [utility commission] types, we were deeply troubled by just the lack of understanding about each one of our states on how we were going to meet these targets and how the targets were set.\"\n\nPowelson will head the state utility group at its first winter meeting (Feb. 12-15 in Washington) with a new president in the Oval Office for the first time in in eight years. The mood as the meeting approaches is one of \"excitement.\" Yet there is uncertainty about what Trump is planning for new infrastructure, siting pipelines and creating an atmosphere of \"cooperative federalism\" between the states and the federal agencies, he said.\n\nThe new administration says, \"Look, we're going to build things, we're going to site things, and we're going to do it very efficiently, and we're not going to have a command-and-control EPA, Energy Department or Army Corps of Engineers,\" Powelson said.\n\n\"It strikes a balance,\" Powelson said. \"States can't do everything on their own, and hence the need for what I call cooperative federalism and that can be seen in projects … like nuclear waste storage, new nuclear development, carbon capture storage, renewable integration and build out.\"\n\nPowelson sees new \"opportunity for the states to cooperate with the federal government\" under the new administration, including on renewable energy, developing clean coal technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, licensing, and building new nuclear reactors. Funding for clean coal suffered under Obama. He also failed to preserve existing nuclear plants, Powelson said. Instead he went all-out on renewables to the detriment on other zero-emission resources such as nuclear power.\n\nPowelson wants Washington to lead, helping states protect the grid from cyber attacks and hackers.\n\n\"Cyber is another big area where states are trying to build capacities within their own agencies, whether its fusion centers or state public utility commissions,\" he said. \"We take a lot of our cyber direction from the federal government and we build a lot of our capacity through federal agencies.\"\n\nOther state groups say similar things going into meetings this month in Washington. The National Association of State Energy Officials, representing energy offices run by governors, is holding its annual policy meeting in Washington Feb. 7.\n\nJeff Genzer, its chief counsel, says climate regulation is out and energy infrastructure is in. Still, state energy offices want Trump to preserve a number of programs at the Energy Department that help them meet their goals.\n\nAbout half the states have a renewable energy mandate, and that is unlikely to change even with the Clean Power Plan gone. Some Energy Department programs support these state mandates. They also want Trump to keep key programs in place to help low-income families with their energy bills.\n\nOne of the top issues at the NASEO meeting will be \"continued robust funding for the State Energy Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program,\" Genzer said.\n\nThese programs have been important for years. The weatherization program helps poor residents insulate their homes to cut energy costs. The State Energy Program includes grants to help states increase energy efficiency programs, increase renewable energy development, reduce energy costs, improve electricity and natural gas delivery reliability, promote economic growth, and improve environmental quality while reducing reliance on imported oil.\n\nWith the exception of promoting renewables, many of those same priorities are listed by the White House in Trump's America First energy plan, which seeks to promote environmental quality and to reduce dependence on foreign sources of oil by doing more fracking.\n\n\"We see enhanced energy emergency preparedness and response, including physical and cybersecurity as a key priority,\" Genzer said. \"This includes all energy sectors and infrastructure — oil, gas, propane (and other petroleum products), electric systems and natural gas systems.\"\n\nThe Energy Department's Office of Electricity is an important part of responding to cyber threats through grid modernization.\n\n\"Overall, state-federal cooperation in the energy area could be enhanced,\" Genzer said.\n\nDavid Terry, NASEO's executive director, said \"cybersecurity risks continue to rise across all critical infrastructure\" and continued federal support is more important than ever.\n\n\"Continuing federal support and improved coordination among the DOE, states, and private energy companies ... is needed to better prepare for and respond to energy supply emergencies,\" Terry said. \"Such emergencies arise to one degree or another regularly and range from relatively minor disruptions (e.g., small pipeline break) to the multi-fuel impacts of a major storm.\" And cyber threats are only adding to the need.\n\nGenzer said outside of the significant issues affecting states at EPA, Interior Department and Agriculture Department, he said the states' energy officials want the Energy Department to change by making the states an integral part of its planning and policy development.\n\n\"There is a clear need to increase the level of cooperation between state energy agencies and various pieces of the Department of Energy,\" Genzer explained. \"This includes policy ..., the Office of Electricity, Office of Fossil Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy and the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy divisions,\" he said. \"State policy activities range across all these entities within DOE, and stovepipes should be avoided.\"\n\nThere is also room for the state groups to come together through an unprecedented state collaborative called the 3N that was created to respond to the challenges posed by the EPA's climate rules. The 3N includes NARUC, NASEO and the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which are the state environmental regulators.\n\nBill Becker, executive director of the air agency group, said the 3N collaborative is fully functional and will be used to confront other challenges now that the Clean Power Plan is on hiatus.\n\n\"3N is probably one of the most effective inter-governmental processes that I think was ever developed because for the first time it brought together a very disparate set of governmental officials with varying missions and a number of competing constraints.\n\n\"And over the past few years, not withstanding that, the groups got together in small and large settings to tackle some really important issues, including but not limited to the Clean Power Plan,\" Becker told the Washington Examiner. \"Those relationships have been established, they are ongoing and while the individual responses vary widely in scope and magnitude, the fact is the process is set up to handle new and emerging problems.\"\n\nBecker said 3N can adapt to the changing policy environment now that Trump is in office. He spoke after meeting with his board to discuss priorities for 2017.\n\n\"The Clean Power Plan is on standby,\" Becker said. \"States are generally standing down, with the exception of a few. But it doesn't mean there isn't significant activity in many parts of the country.\"\n\nBut \"that's because the normal energy and economic activities ... are going in a certain direction,\" he said. \"Renewables, natural gas and other cleaner technologies have allowed agencies to pursue greenhouse gas reductions totally independent of the Clean Power Plan.\"\n\nBecker said the EPA plan was \"a necessary impetus\" for starting and continuing the trend, \"but even without the Clean Power Plan, if it is indeed struck down, these actions will continue to move forward and in some cases aggressively through normal, economic development and the relationships that have been established under the structure of 3N and other regional groups that have helped facilitate this.\"\n\nBecker said the focus of his group will likely be driven to implementing the core functions of the Clean Air Act, which is the principal responsibility of the state agencies he represents regardless of what happens to the climate regulations.\n\n\"Our association has been involved in climate change, but many, many other important activities,\" he said. \"We are responsible for implementing the Clean Air Act and providing tens of millions of people with clean air and a helpful environment. And because of that we are intent in making sure that the regulatory tools in the act and in regulation continue independent of the Clean Power Plan provisions.\"\n\nBecker's focus will not be on preserving the infrastructure of transmission lines and the nation's energy hardware as NASEO and NARUC, but on preserving the \"infrastructure of the Clean Air Act and making certain that state and local agencies have the tools and most importantly the funding to comply with these responsibilities.\"\n\nThe nation's regulatory agencies that Becker represents are more dependent on EPA grants and funding than the state agencies that Powelson, Genzer and Terry represent. \"The fear is if our funding to reduce ozone levels or fine particles or toxic air pollutants are diminished, then tens of millions of people's health will suffer,\" Becker added.\n\nRecent reports that Trump is poised to cut funding for the EPA and along with it a huge chunk of its staff have him and his members concerned.\n\n\"We are watching closely the extent to which EPA's program will be cut and we are worried about some of the things we have been reading, vis-a-vis the transition team, especially the aspirational goal of reducing staff at EPA from 15,000 to 5,000,\" Becker said. \"States and localities need a healthy and robust EPA in order for the national — not federal — but the national program to be administered effectively.\"\n\nThe bottom line is: \"EPA can't do it without the states. The states can't do it without EPA.\"\n\nBecker wants the agency to be more predictable and to be respectful of deadlines. He also wants it to respect the need for issuing guidelines for states \"so we know exactly the rules and elements of the playing field.\" Also, research from the agency is helpful to the states and needs to continue.\n\nBecker's main message is that there are \"many things we need from a healthy EPA\" while also respecting the idea of states and localities being the \"primary implementers.\" \"And in order for that to continue we need significantly more resources to do the job.\n\n\"I can't define the appropriate balance between the EPA's budget and the states, but the kinds of cuts that are being tossed around at EPA seem very concerning,\" he said. \"Moreover, no matter what happens to EPA, states and localities need a very significant increase especially under the Trump administration who wants to delegate even more responsibility to the states,\" he explained.\n\n\"We can't do more with less,\" Becker said. \"We can do more with more.\"",
  "latent_5613": "One of the more interesting aspects of FreedomWorks' justice reform project is studying the over-criminalization. It is an issue that many want to avoid, preferring instead to focus their efforts on other very worthy issues like sentencing and corrections reform. Of course, we support these efforts. With 4,500 to 5,000 federal criminal statutes and as many as 400,000 regulations carrying criminal penalties, over-criminalization is a problem, and it is one that does not get nearly enough attention.\n\nFreedomWorks has discussed over-criminalization before. In September, we published a white paper, The Over-criminalization Epidemic: The Need for a Guilty Mind Requirement in Federal Criminal Law, which highlighted the issue and promoted the concept of default mens rea, or a criminal intent provision that puts the onus on prosecutors to prove that someone who engaged in an unlawful activity knew they were committing a crime.\n\nIn 2013, the House Over-criminalization Task Force instructed the Congressional Research Service to provide a complete accounting of all federal crimes. The agency, however, was unable to provide the information because, according to Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, \"they lack the manpower and resources to accomplish this task.\"\n\nThe Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which FreedomWorks supports, does, in Section 109, touch on the issue. It requires the Attorney General to submit a report to the House and Senate judiciary committees of all federal criminal statutes and federal regulations carrying criminal penalties, as well as the penalties and mens rea, or criminal intent, requirements for the offenses. The legislation also requires the Attorney General make the report available on the Department of Justice website.\n\nUntil Congress to passes the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, we will just have to settle for Twitter. @CrimeADay, which, as the name suggests, documents some of the ridiculous laws and regulations in U.S. Code and the Federal Register.

  "latent_5697": "Video\n\nThe police arrested 185 people on Monday as protesters tried to block access to the New York Stock Exchange on the first anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street protests.\n\nDemonstrators had planned to converge from several directions and form what was called the People’s Wall around the stock exchange to protest what they said was an unfair economic system that benefited the rich and corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n\nLast year, protesters took over Zuccotti Park, not far from Wall Street, setting up an encampment that became an inspiration for similar Occupy campaigns around the world. But after being evicted from the park in November, the protests lost much of their energy, though their message of economic inequality has resonated in Washington and in the presidential campaign.\n\nOn Monday, the police countered the blockade planned by protesters with one of their own, ringing the streets and sidewalks leading toward the exchange with metal barricades and asking for identification from workers seeking access.\n\nProtesters marched though the streets, waving banners and banging drums while accompanied by bands playing “Happy Birthday.”\n\nAt several points during the morning, crowds of protesters numbering in the hundreds briefly blocked intersections before being dispersed, with arrests in some instances.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough organizers said more than 1,000 people participated in the demonstration, the roving groups did not appear to cause much disruption on Wall Street.\n\nOfficers sometimes surrounded large groups of protesters, though they did not appear to make mass arrests. But on several occasions, officers plunged onto sidewalks packed with protesters and arrested people after saying the crowds were blocking pedestrian traffic.\n\nAt one point, at Broad and Beaver Streets, a commander grabbed a man from a crowd standing on the corner. Protesters tried to pull the man back, but officers surged into the crowd and wrested the man away, placing him in handcuffs.\n\nOne of the more turbulent episodes took place along Broadway where several hundred people marched. Officers approached a man who had been yelling objections to the metal police barricades that cordoned off Wall Street. When the officers grabbed the man, he began shouting “I did nothing wrong,” but they removed him.\n\nAs they were leading the man away, a line of officers pushed away a large crowd of people, including news photographers. One officer repeatedly shoved news photographers with a baton, and a police lieutenant shouted at one point that no more photographs would be permitted, adding, “That’s over.”\n\nOrganizers said they had planned the protest to show that the Occupy movement still had vitality and to express continuing frustration with the economic environment.\n\nAmong those gathering early Monday was Oren Goldberg, 32, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, who said he had joined the protest partly because he felt the need to somehow register his conviction that the financial system was not operating properly.\n\n“It’s exciting to see any group of people attempting any sort of change,” he said, adding that Occupy participants were interested in “working toward a greater good than profiteering.”\n\nAs the protesters gathered as early as 6 a.m., police vans were parked on side streets throughout the financial district, and helicopters buzzed overhead. Men in suits walking to work passed contingents of officers posted on corners.\n\nSporadic marches continued through the afternoon, along with arrests.\n\nSeveral demonstrations took place outside financial institutions. Some people were arrested at a Bank of America branch opposite Zuccotti Park. Later the police arrested about a half-dozen people who sat down in front of Goldman Sachs headquarters on West Street while a crowd chanted “arrest the bankers.”\n\nAs the police directed the crowd to leave the area, people in the building could be seen gazing down from windows. Some of the protesters pointed up to the windows and shouted, “Goldman Sachs, we’ll be back,” as they began marching toward Zuccotti Park.\n\nAs night fell, a few hundred protesters gathered in the park. Their numbers declined, however, after dozens of police officers and private security guards walked through the park and trained powerful spotlights on those inside.\n\nAt one point, as the police arrested a woman inside Zuccotti Park, an officer told a city councilman, Jumaane D. Williams, to get down from a granite bench. Mr. Williams refused, saying he was a Council member and wanted to observe. After Mr. Williams refused a second order to get down, two officers shoved him with batons, knocking him off the bench.\n\nJoseph Goldstein contributed reporting.",

Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump has been on a thing recently of trying to make himself seem less racist, directing his message toward black Americans in particular. This Saturday he is taking his pitch (which Slate’s Jamelle Bouie has described, incidentally, as “patronizing, ahistorical nonsense”) to a Detroit church in what will be his first actual physical appearance in front of an audience of black people since he began campaigning.\n\nAs it happens, the New York Times got its hands on a copy of the scripted Q&A that Trump is set to perform in Detroit with pastor Wayne T. Jackson. The script mostly doesn’t sound like Trump on a verbal level—I will eat my Bible hat if he actually says anything remotely like “I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God”—and, in its ideology, it reads more like the work of a free-market economic think tank than the populist Trump campaign. In particular, it instructs Trump to imply that black people should not only reject affirmative action but in fact stop talking about racial discrimination altogether:\n\nAs President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential.

I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance.\n\n“Reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race?” Not only is this basically the same conservative-intellectual pitch that Republicans have been making ineffectively to black Americans since the Reagan era, it runs contrary to Trump’s recent rhetorical strategy of constantly highlighting issues of race to the point of tastelessness:\n\nDwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago.

  "latent_6078": "[John Brousseau]\n\nIf L. Ron Hubbard is responsible for the millions of words that spell out every aspect of Scientology, what, exactly, qualified David Miscavige to take over as church leader after Hubbard died in 1986?\n\nThat’s one of the questions that tonight’s episode of Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath tries to answer, and we think you’re going to find that answer pretty compelling. Once again, Leah Remini shows that she has huge respect for her audience, and isn’t afraid to dive deeply into Scientology’s arcane ideas and complex past.\n\nTo examine the church leader’s rise to power, Remini and Mike Rinder sit down in the first half of the episode with John Brousseau, certainly one of the best people to talk to if you want to know about David Miscavige.\n\nBrousseau and Miscavige were brothers-in-law for 16 years, for example.\n\nThat’s one of the things we learned about “J.B.” when we did our own two-part story about Brousseau’s really amazing experience in Scientology — from L. Ron Hubbard’s personal driver, to Tom Cruise’s fix-it man, to the guy who actually put the bars on the doors and windows of “The Hole” at Int Base.\n\nAnd in one of our favorite details, Brousseau was sitting in a van filled with audio equipment parked outside a Los Angeles hotel while inside the hotel, a wired David Miscavige was explaining to Mary Sue Hubbard that, because of her indictment and conviction in the Snow White Program prosecutions, she would have to step down from her post overseeing the church’s spy wing — the Guardian’s Office — and lose all power in the organization. That was in 1981, a couple of years before Mary Sue’s appeals ran out and she had to go to federal prison (she served a year of the five she was sentenced to for conspiracy in the Snow White break-ins), and more than a year after her husband L. Ron Hubbard had gone into total seclusion.\n\nJohn Brousseau witnessed that as well, and was the last person to shake Hubbard’s hand after he climbed into a van and was driven away by Pat and Annie Broeker, Hubbard’s companions in hiding during his final years.\n\nJust a few days before he died in 1986, Hubbard signed an order anointing the Broekers as “Loyal Officers,” superior to the rank of Captain in the Sea Org, in what seemed like a pretty clear statement that he expected the Broekers to run Scientology after he died. But soon after Hubbard’s death, a new order canceling the “Loyal Officers” decree was circulated as David Miscavige began systematically removing everyone who could make a claim for the church leadership position.\n\nAs Leah rightly points out, however, it was the Sea Org itself, created by L. Ron Hubbard, which required that kind of ruthless push for dictatorial control. If Miscavige hadn’t muscled others out of the way, someone else would have.\n\nBrousseau describes what Miscavige is like, and for even more anecdotes about Miscavige’s personality, please do check out our two-part series. There’s a fishing scene you really must read about if you haven’t already.\n\nBrousseau is also asked about one of the mysteries in Scientology that the public is perhaps more obsessed with than anything else: The disappearance of David Miscavige’s wife, Shelly.\n\nWe’ve written about Shelly vanishing from Int Base many, many times, and John Brousseau’s eyewitness account is one of the main reasons why we believe she’s been held at the CST Headquarters compound near Lake Arrowhead, California for the last 12 years.\n\nAnd in this episode, Brousseau adds a detail we hadn’t heard before, that he believes Shelly was undergoing intense sec-checking (interrogations) in the days leading up to her disappearance in the summer of 2005. And, like others, he says that Shelly isn’t going anywhere.\n\n“He [David Miscavige] will do everything he can to keep her where she is, until the day she dies,” Brousseau says.\n\nIn the second half of the episode, Leah and Mike talk with Gary Morehead, who went by the code name “Jackson” when he was assigned in his early 20s to be the head security officer at the secretive Int Base international management compound near Hemet, California.\n\n[Gary “Jackson” Morehead]\n\nIt was Morehead who helped develop the “blow drill” at Int Base, the complex set of strategies to track down and bring back any Sea Org member who made a run for it from the huge desert compound.\n\nMorehead explains that one of the ways the church tracked people was to put a travel agency in the organization itself, with a terminal at the Author Services building on Hollywood Boulevard, so that Scientology can simply look up who is flying when, which helps explain a lot.\n\nWhat was Gary’s breaking point, Leah asks him, and Morehead talks about his wife becoming pregnant while they were both still in the Sea Org — at a time when Sea Org women who became pregnant were pressured to have abortions, because having children was against the rules.\n\nMorehead is already on record, in a video he made with Mark Bunker, explaining that one of his jobs as security chief at Int Base was to help with that mission, putting pressure on young women to abort their pregnancies in the name of keeping up their work in the Sea Org. But now, he reveals that he even had to perform that duty on his own wife, convincing her to end her pregnancy.\n\nIt’s a heartbreaking moment, and if you know Gary as the unflappable and affable guy he is, it’s hard to watch him in such distress.\n\nThis show always seems to find a way to hit us in the solar plexus.\n\n——————–\n\n——————–\n\nPosted by Tony Ortega on September 12, 2017 at 07:00\n\nE-mail tips and story ideas to tonyo94 AT gmail DOT com or follow us on Twitter.

  "latent_6112": "There’s always something new in the never-ending, hyperventilating Trump drama. Over the last day or so, however, we’re seeing something a bit new: Trump caving or getting rolled on numerous fronts all at once. Just in the last 24 hours he appears to have been rolled so many times that one imagines his rough edges might start to be worn down until he becomes something more like a clumpy and perhaps oblong ball.\n\nHere are just three examples.\n\nLast night the White House released a readout of the President’s call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. That readout had this oddly worded sentence: “The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘one China’ policy.” This came after weeks of swaggering and provocative moves and statements all declaring that the ‘One China Policy’, which is foundational for the PRC, was ‘on the table.’ It is an eminently sane move but also a dramatic back down for President Trump.\n\nThen this afternoon EU foreign policy chief (in effect, the EU foreign minister) Federica Mogherini said that she had been assured in her meetings with top administration officials that the Trump administration intended to “stick to the full implementation of the [Iran nuclear] agreement.”\n\nNotably, she said she was unable to get similar assurances on White House relations with Russia and whether they would honor the path charted in recent years between the US and the EU. But on the Iran nuclear deal, the administration seems to have signaled, even if it won’t say openly, that it will honor the deal.\n\nNext came the on-going litigation over President Trump’s immigration executive order. Just 23 hours ago, in response to the unanimous denial by a three judge panel on the 9th circuit, Trump tweeted defiance.\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\n\nYet just a short time ago, CNN reported that the White House has decided not to appeal the 9th circuit decision to the Supreme Court. To be clear, many court watchers believe this is a wise strategy. With an evenly divided eight person Supreme Court, it seems likely that the President would do no better than a 4 to 4 tie, which would leave the 9th circuit decision in place. In other words, even a tie is a loss. This defeat is only on the temporary restraining order, not the merits of the case, where the government might have a better shot. The actual case now goes back to Judge Robart’s court to be judged on the merits.\n\nSo the strategy makes sense: stop fighting on this front and simply write a new executive order which takes cognizance of the statutory and constitutional issues which have been raised to date in the courts. But it is surprising or at least noteworthy that President Trump’s advisors were able to get him to go low energy and walk away from the fight.\n\nMy colleague Catherine Thompson notes that we have just crossed the hour into Shabbos, a threshold which news reports suggest sees Trump’s most transgressive behavior because his orthodox Jewish daughter and son-in-law are offline and not around to keep him in line. So things could change. But for the moment, it’s the most ego-bruising 24 hours Trump has been forced to accept in the decades long three weeks of his presidency.",

  "latent_6181": "llvmparse user manual\n\nTitle llvmparse Description LLVM assembly parsing standalone utilities Author Nikolaos Kavvadias 2012-2013 Copyright Nikolaos Kavvadias Contact nikos@nkavvadias.com Website http://www.nkavvadias.com Release Date 25 February 2013 Version 1.0.0 Rev. history v1.0.0 25-02-2013 First commercial release.\n\n1. Introduction llvmparse is a set of standalone parsers for the popular LLVM textual assembly format. This format is used as a human-readable representation of the LLVM IR (intermediate representation) which is used by the LLVM compiler (http://www.llvm.org). This version of llvmparse includes two standalone parsers: a flex/bison-based parser (compiled) and a TXL-based parser (interpreted) that are compatible with LLVM 3.1 and 3.2. TXL is a functional programming language that is commonly used for source-to-source transformation tasks (http://www.txl.ca). llvmparse will always be kept up-to-date with the latest official LLVM release.\n\n2. File listing The llvmparse distribution includes the files listed in the following table. There is a single release for llvmparse containing all source code, Windows (MinGW) binaries as well as Linux static binaries. /llvmparse Top-level directory build.sh clean-all.sh env-lin.sh env-win.sh test-all.sh Automated build script. Clean the generated debris files in /tests. Script for setting up the environment on Linux. Script for setting up the environment on Windows. Exercise all test cases found in /tests. /bin/lin Linux executable directory llvmparse.exe Static executable of the flex/bison-based parser for Linux platforms. /bin/win Windows executable directory llvmparse.exe Static executable of the flex/bison-based parser for Windows platforms. /doc Documentation directory AUTHORS LICENSE LLVMOSL.TXT README README.html README.pdf VERSION List of authors. End-user license agreement. The LLVM source code open-source license. This file. HTML version of README. PDF version of README. Current version of mprfgen. /src Source code directory Makefile llvm.Grm llvm.l llvm.y llvmparse.Txl llvmparse.c Makefile for building the flex/bison-based parser. TXL grammar for the LLVM assembly format. Flex/lex scanner for the LLVM assembly format. Bison/yacc grammar for the LLVM assembly format. Driver TXL program for the TXL-based parser. Driver C program for the flex/bison-based parser. /tests Directory for testing llvmparse *.c *.ll ANSI/ISO C source for a test case. LLVM textual assembly files generated by clang-3.2 (not included).\n\n3. llvmparse setup For using llvmparse, this distribution comes with ready-made native executables for Windows and Linux, which can be found in the corresponding /bin/exedir directory, where exedir is lin for Linux or win for Windows. In order to build llvmparse from source on your platform, just run the build.sh bash script from the command prompt. Cygwin or MinGW are suggested as POSIX emulation environments on Windows. First, change to the appropriate directory, for instance: cd /home/user/llvmparse/ assuming llvmparse was installed inside /home/user . A few environmental variables should be set and for this purpose the env-*.sh scripts can be used. For instance, a Windows installation requires the following: $ ./env-win.sh The llvmparse distribution can be built from sources by using: $ ./build.sh\n\n4. llvmparse usage The llvmparse parsers can be invoked as shown in the test-all.sh script. However, for exercising a single test case, this can be accomplished using the flex/bison-based parser as follows: $ cd $LLVMPARSE_PATH $ ./bin/llvmparse.exe fibo.ll >& fibo.txt which parses the test program fibo.ll with llvmparse.exe and stores the parsed program to fibo.txt . For using the TXL-based parser, it is suggested that the txl interpreter is visible. Usually txl is installed in the /usr/local/bin path in Linux and Cygwin/Windows systems. For MinGW/Windows systems, it is suggested that the Windows port of TXL is used. For instance, TXL 10.6 can be installed to /c/Txl106/ . The env-*.sh scripts can be used to set the appropriate value for the TXL_PATH environment variable. An example invocation of the TXL-based parser is as follows: $ $TXL_PATH/bin/txl -q -raw -o $fibo.txt $LLVMPARSE_PATH/src/llvmparse.Txl fibo.ll\n\n5. Running the test suite The test suite that accompanies llvmparse can be found in the /test subdirectory. It consists of C source code and the generated LLVM textual assembly files, which use the .ll suffix. These LLVM IR files can be exercised by running the top-level test-all.sh script: $ cd $LLVMPARSE_PATH $ ./test-all.sh The generated debris files (using the *.bisonparsed and *.txlparsed patterns) can be deleted using the corresponding clean-all.sh script: $ cd $LLVMPARSE_PATH $ ./clean-all.sh",
  "latent_6338": "Calls on Russia to restrain Syrian ally increase after Turkey says postmortems confirm uses of chemical weapons\n\nVladimir Putin has doubled down on his support for the Syrian government despite the release of postmortem results by Turkey that confirmed chemical weapons were used in an attack that killed at least 72 people in north Syria.\n\nThe Russian president attacked “groundless accusations” that Damascus was responsible for the assault, and called for a “detailed and unbiased investigation” into the deaths, a Kremlin statement said.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry has argued that Syrian planes were destroying chemical weapons, not deploying them, and said the airstrikes targeted a rebel storage depot for toxins. That claim has been widely dismissed as implausible by experts.\n\n'The dead were wherever you looked': inside Syrian town after chemical attack Read more\n\nAs firm evidence of chemical weapons use mounted – along with calls for Russia to restrain the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad – Putin’s spokesman attempted to put some distance between the two allies.\n\n“Unconditional support is not possible in this current world,” Dmitry Peskov told Associated Press, adding that Russia could not control the Syrian leader.\n\nBut Peskov also offered implicit support to the Damascus regime by repeating the argument that the chemical weapons that killed so many had belonged to rebels. Asked for proof, he said Russia’s military presence in Syria mean t it had “more wide information” about what was “going on there”.\n\nThe UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, was among those calling on Moscow to restrain Damascus, saying the “appalling” attack had to be “laid clearly at the door of the [Assad ] regime and its supporters”.\n\nHe told reporters: “[The UK is] consulting urgently with allies now to see how we can get Russia, which supports the Syrian regime, to put proper pressure on President Assad to stop these attacks once and for all .”\n\nWestern nations have been frustrated by the UN’s failure to respond to the attack – devastating even by the standards of a brutal civil war – because Russia has deployed its veto in the UN security council to protect Assad’s government from censure.\n\nBritain, France and the US have asked the security council to hold a vote later on Thursday on a resolution demanding an investigation of the suspected chemical attack in Syria, diplomats said.\n\nRussia had objected to previous drafts, and it was unclear whether they would support the la test draft, which was slightly revised after negotiations over the past two days.\n\nSyria chemical weapons attack: what we know about deadly air raid Read more\n\nTurkey on Thursday said the first conclusive evidence of the use of chemical weapons had been found in three victims of the Tuesday, who had died in Turkish hospitals after being brought from Syria for treatment.\n\nThe Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, announced that the results of the autopsies confirmed that chemical weapons had been used, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nThe postmortems were conducted by officials from the World Health Organization in Adana, southern Turkey, along with officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Bozdağ said.\n\nLater Turkey’s health ministry said 31 people injured in the attack who had been taken across the border showed signs of being exposed to the nerve agent sarin.\n\n“Evidence was detected in patients which leads one to think they were exposed to a chemical substance [sarin],” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe medical results from Turkey came as the Syrian foreign minister denied his government used chemical weapons in the attack. He also denied Syria had ever used them, even though reports from UN investigators have confirmed previous chemical attacks by both the Syrian government and Islamic State forces.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Damascus, Walid al-Muallem said: “The Syrian Arab Army has never used chemical weapons and will not use chemical weapons against Syrians and even against terrorists.”\n\nHe also cast doubt on the prospect of a fact-finding mission into the attack, claiming Damascus would need assurances that it would be impartial.\n\nThe attack killed 72 people, including 27 children, and injured 546 others, according to Unicef, making it one of the worst atrocities of the six-year war.\n\nThe postmortem results add to mounting evidence that the attack involved deliberate use of chemical weapons by a Syrian warplane. Aid agencies, including Médecins Sans Frontières and medics in Turkey, said patients showed clear symptoms of exposure to sarin.\n\nBut Muallem denounced the “chorus” of accusations against Syria, which he said was launched by countries known for their hostility towards Damascus.\n\nOn Wednesday, Donald Trump accused Assad’s government of going “beyond a red line” by conducting the attack which he said was an “affront to humanity”.\n\nBut when asked whether he would consider military intervention to remove Assad, the US president replied: “I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or another, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you … Militarily, I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I’m doing.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters shout slogans against Russia near its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, after a chemical attack killed scores of people including children in Idlib, Syria, on Tuesday. Photograph: Sedat Suna/EPA\n\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has warned Russia it “cannot escape responsibility” for the attack.\n\nDisplaying pictures of children killed in the attack at the UN in New York, she suggested that if the UN fails to respond to the atrocities the US may act to stop further chemical attacks by the Assad regime.\n\nSyria chemical attack has changed my view of Assad, says Trump Read more\n\nTheresa May appeared to play down the idea of supporting the US in any military action against the Assad regime, claiming the onus was on Russia to use its influence to stop the bloodshed.\n\n“What I would say is, all those backing that regime including Russia need to use their influence to stop Assad from bombarding and dealing with his people in such a way,” said the prime minister.\n\nRescue workers have gathered soil samples from the scene of the attack and sent them to western intelligence officials to determine precisely what nerve agent was used.\n\nWitnesses said at least one Syrian warplane dropped bombs on Khan Sheikhun at about 6.30am on Tuesday. Shortly afterwards, first responders were overwhelmed with patients suffering from acute breathing problems, foaming at the mouth and writhing in pain.",
  "latent_6352": "So how did Don Whittemore, a self-described straight, boring 61-year-old retiree, find himself at Ford Fest in a rainbow cape with an enraged man squeezing his throat? “For years I sat back and figured voting was all I had to do,” Whittemore said in an interview Monday, three days after the ugly incident at the barbecue for Mayor Rob Ford in Scarborough’s Thomson Memorial Park.\n\nDon Whittemore, 61, is grabbed around the neck by a man at Friday's Ford Fest in a Scarborough park. Whittemore is not gay but wore rainbow items to see what kind of reaction he would get from members of \"Ford Nation.\" ( CTV Toronto )\n\nSomething clicked when Ford emerged from rehab and went straight into re-election campaign mode. Whittemore joined “shirtless horde” protests challenging Ford on his unwillingness to address drug use and deceit. Then, moved as a youth by Black Like Me, the 1961 account of white American John Howard Griffin posing as black, so as to feel racist hatred first-hand, he decided to walk around Ford Fest with a pink umbrella, a large rainbow flag on his back, and a smaller flag in his pocket. “I had read about rampant homophobia in Ford Nation and thought this was an opportunity to see what it’s like,” he said. “I wasn’t protesting — I was hoping I could come back and say that nothing happened.”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nNot much did happen. He wandered for three hours, tweeting and having pleasant interactions with Ford Nation members and a handful of “Queeruption” members there to quietly protest Ford’s statements and council votes on gay issues. Bored, Whittemore was heading back to his car when he saw a crowd around the protesters, yelling slurs including “Go home, f----t”, and grabbing and ripping their signs. “I was horrified — absolutely horrified. The air was actually vibrating,” he said, adding he yelled back that the crowd was being homophobic and protesters had every right to be in a public park. One man yelled to his face: “How dare you be here? Rob is great,” then hit Whittemore’s forehead with an open palm, knocking off his hat before quickly walking away, he said. A shocked Whittemore was talking to reporters when the man rushed back and briefly squeezed his throat with one hand, an incident caught by a CTV news camera.\n\n“My throat is still sore,” Whittemore said Monday. “If he can sleep at night, good for him. I haven’t, but good for him.” He talked to a police officer but decided not to pursue charges, he says, for fear of payback attacks on the reputation of his family and friends. However, he said he would act as a witness if police decide to charge the man based on photo and video evidence.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nCouncillor Doug Ford initially apologized to Whittemore but then told the Star that Ford supporters told him the man was “screaming and shouting” and “looking for trouble” — something Whittemore flatly denies. On Saturday, Mayor Ford told CTV News he didn’t see the unruly crowd, “but it’s terrible that things like that happen. I apologize and we have to move on.” As for Whittemore, he wrote a lengthy blog entry and said he might revisit the incident, but, “Maybe I just want to go back to 7:30 July 25 2014 and take a different route to my car.”\n\nRead more about:",

  "latent_6552": "(CNN) The National Football League has upheld a four-game suspension of New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady for his role in the football tampering scandal known as \"Deflategate,\" the league announced in a news release Tuesday.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell, in affirming the suspension he handed down in May, said new information about the destruction of Brady's cell phone showed the four-time Super Bowl champion \"sought to hide evidence of his own participation in the underlying scheme to alter the footballs.\"\n\nDon Yee, Brady's agent and attorney, said Brady did nothing wrong.\n\n\"The appeal process was a sham, resulting in the commissioner rubber-stamping his own decision,\" Yee said.\n\nThe NFL Players Association said it would file an appeal, presumably in federal court, on Brady's behalf.\n\nNFLPA spokesman George Atallah told CNN's Rachel Nichols that media reports claiming the NFL offered to drop Brady's suspension are \"categorically false.\"\n\n\"The negotiations never got that far,\" Atallah told Nichols, adding that the players' union made an initial offer to the league.\n\nThe proposed deal was that the four-game suspension be eliminated, but Brady would pay a fine for failing to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nAtallah said league officials told them the NFL wouldn't even discuss anything unless Brady admitted his guilt.\n\nAt that point negotiations ended, Atallah told Nichols.\n\nBrady has denied he knew of any plan to alter footballs so that they would be underinflated, which would have made the balls easier to grip.\n\nThe NFL didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the negotiations.\n\nSaga of a cell phone\n\nOn March 6, Brady was interviewed by investigators hired by the NFL. The league says that it was informed months later that on or about that date, Brady told his assistant to destroy his cell phone that he had been used since early November.\n\nThat was a period that included the AFC Championship Game and the initial weeks of the subsequent investigation into the allegations of tampering with the footballs.\n\nThe investigators, according to Goodell's final decision, had asked Brady's lawyers for the cell phone several times, on and before February 28.\n\nThe destruction of the cell phone wasn't disclosed at Brady's interview with investigators when he was asked for it again.\n\nIt wasn't until June 18, almost four months after investigators had requested its data from Brady and five days before an appeals hearing, that Brady's lawyers informed the league. During the 10-hour long appeals hearing at NFL headquarters in New York, Brady said the phone had been destroyed because that was his usual practice when he got a new mobile phone.\n\n\"We presented the commissioner with an unprecedented amount of electronic data, all of which is incontrovertible,\" Yee said. \"I do not think that any private citizen would have agreed to provide anyone with the amount of information that Tom was willing to reveal to the commissioner.\"\n\nHe said electronic information was ignored by Goodell, and \"we don't know why.\"\n\nThe quarterback began using a new phone on March 6, leading the NFL to believe that the previous one had been destroyed that day.\n\nThe phone contained more than 10,000 text messages.\n\nBrady's lawyers also gave the league a letter from Brady's cell phone provider that the texts could no longer be retrieved.\n\nReacting to the decision to uphold the suspension, the NFL players' union said on its website: \"The fact that the NFL would resort to basing a suspension on a smoke screen of irrelevant text messages instead of admitting that they have all of the phone records they asked for is a new low, even for them, but it does nothing to correct their errors.\"\n\nGoodell failed to give Brady due process, the statement said.\n\nAttalah clarified that Brady and his lawyers gave the NFL records of the numbers texted from Brady's phone. Those documents didn't show the content of the texts, he said.\n\nCan anyone please explain to me why #TomBrady destroyed his cell phone if he had nothing to do with #DeflateGate? — George Wrighster (@georgewrighster) July 28, 2015\n\nBrady had denied involvement\n\nGoodell's decision is the latest chapter in a controversy that started when the New England Patriots were accused of using underinflated footballs to gain a competitive advantage in January's AFC championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nBrady denied involvement, but the NFL suspended him four games without pay in May. Brady appealed, setting up the decision by Goodell.\n\nThe Super Bowl-winning Patriots were punished, too.

  "latent_6698": "West Palm Beach could soon have a new shooting range and gun shop in a convenient location close to downtown. But Mayor Jeri Mouio was clear that she doesn’t support the idea – because she doesn’t like guns.\n\nIn a media briefing on Thursday, Mouio complimented the city’s planning department, saying it makes project recommendations based on code ordinances and standards in a partial and objective manner.\n\n“That doesn’t mean I always agree with their recommendations,” Mouio said. “I don’t like this gun range in our city.”\n\nCity planning department staff approved the development in an industrial zone, but construction of the shooting range requires a variance from the Planning Board because the location is within 1,000 feet of nearby homes. Parks do not have such a requirement, but the mayor indicated that after further review, code changes were likely to be considered to address future projects.\n\n“The fact that I don’t support it doesn’t mean that the process is going to be changed,” Mouio said of the current project. “There’s a process to follow.”\n\nGun rights advocates were quick to note their dismay at the mayor’s comments.\n\n“To deny law-abiding residents access to a range willing to serve them would be discriminatory against those who chose to exercise their constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms,” NRA spokeswoman Jacqueline Isaacs said in an email to BizPac Review. “For many, such a facility is a means to obtaining key firearm training and safety information – a benefit to all in the community.”\n\nThe mayor admitted that the project is following all the necessary rules.\n\n“This petitioner, this applicant has done everything he can do to make this a more palatable development,” she said. “But the fact that it’s a gun range is concerning to me.”\n\nMouio said she is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns and an advocate for common-sense gun laws. But when asked how those roles have anything to do with her opposition to a gun range, her answer was confusing, at best.\n\n“Well it’s probably a stretch in terms of a direct relationship,” the mayor said. “Research has shown responsible people use a gun range.”\n\nResidents of nearby neighborhoods also are up in arms over the proposed shooting range.\n\n“We want commerce in our city. That’s part of what makes it a great place to live,” Margie Yansura, a West Palm Beach resident, told local TV station WPTV. “But, when you have a business that could negatively impact its neighbors, then that is not the right business for that location.”\n\nThe neighborhood’s main complaint appears to be that people will be traveling to and from the range with weapons. Muoio says there isn’t a noise problem and the site is in a commercial area, so the developers have every right to be there.\n\n“I don’t like guns,” she said, adding that she would prefer another entertainment venue for the site, like paintball or laser tag – “an activity that everyone could enjoy.”\n\nWatch the mayor’s media briefing here.\n\nWatch the WPTV report here.",

Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNew York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony has responded to recent tragedies by imploring his fellow athletes to speak out and demand change.\n\nThe racial divide in the United States of America is reaching its boiling point. The tragic killings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, and countless others, as well as the unspeakable shootings of Dallas police officers, have the entire country seething in frustration and anger.\n\nNew York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony believes that those with the power of fame must use their unique platforms to speak out during these times of trial.\n\nAnthony wrote a deep and moving Instagram post in the wake of these recent tragedies. During the post, he implored people to, “Steer their anger in the right direction,” and call on public officials to get something done.\n\nThe post included a photograph that featured some of the most prominent athletes of the Civil Rights Movement, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Muhammad Ali, and Jim Brown.\n\nPerhaps the most pertinent quote from Anthony’s post was as follows:\n\n“We need each other. These politicians have to step up and fight for change. I’m calling for all my fellow ATHLETES to step up and take charge. Go to your local officials, leaders, congressman, assemblymen/assemblywoman and demand change. There’s NO more sitting back and being afraid of tackling and addressing political issues anymore. Those days are long gone. We have to step up and take charge. We can’t worry about what endorsements we gonna lose or whose going to look at us crazy. I need your voices to be heard. We can demand change. We just have to be willing to. THE TIME IS NOW. IM all in. Take Charge. Take Action. DEMAND CHANGE. Peace7\n\nThat’s a powerful statement from a professional athlete who understands what he’s risking by merely standing up for what he believes in.\n\nAt a time like this, a player cannot be afraid to risk their endorsements or their overall favorability. There are swooping changes that need to be made, and nothing will get done without immediate action.\n\nAthletes have always been influential figures in the United States of America, and their willingness to speak out has often led to change.\n\nAnthony, and many of his peers in both the NBA and other sports leagues, can make a difference. They have a platform to promote issues that the general population may either be unaware of or uneducated about.\n\nPosts like this provide the general population with a glimpse into the history of this country, and insight as to what can be done to facilitate change.\n\nThank you, Carmelo Anthony, for taking a stand for what you believe in.",
  "latent_6736": "This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nThe same group of the world's largest technology companies, including Facebook and Google, that aggressively opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) are now throwing their weight behind the recently released and amicably named alternative: OPEN. After California congressman Darrell Issa, a Republican, and Oregon's senior Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, introduced the new bill last week, civil rights groups seem like they've been too distracted trying to stop SOPA to notice the alternative approach. With good reason, too. On Tuesday, Lamar Smith introduced an updated version of SOPA he hopes will convince enough members of the House Judiciary Committee to send the bill to the Floor this week. Can Google, Facebook and their Silicon Valley friends -- not to mention an endless list of people who work on the Internet and are protesting the bill -- convince Congress to consider OPEN as a compromise, a solution to America's anti-piracy woes? It depends.\n\nSo far, it's very clear that tech companies hate SOPA. Until OPEN showed up last week, the only thing they could do about it was yell and scream about that fact. And boy were they boisterous. Indeed, legal experts agreed: SOPA did open a lot of dangerous doors, many of which could lead to the widespread censorship of the Internet. Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe recently even argued recently that the bill violates the First Amendment. Nevertheless, SOPA is still being considered by the House, and while many Reps have stood up in opposition to the bill, it has a fighting chance of moving forward, especially with Smith's update. The changes do make the bill sound less evil. \"The proposed changes include: clarifying that the bill is aimed at foreign Web sites, nixing language that would have required redirection from rogue sites, clarifying that service providers don’t need to block subdomains and narrowing the definitions of some key terms in the bill to focus on bad actors,\" explains Hayley Tsukayama at The Washington Post. But censorship is censorship, maintain its opponents. TechDirt's copyright correspondent Mike Masnick argues against the updated SOPA:\n\nWhat you get is something a little closer to what PROTECT IP is in the Senate. However, it still is a bill that requires censorship of the American internet for the first time, and which still contains broad definitions that will be abused by rightsholders. This isn't a fix. This is getting rid of the parts that were put in to be sacrificed on purpose, and still having a really bad bill.\n\nEnter OPEN. Unlike SOPA, the new bill does not suggest blocking domains and handing down strict punishments to copyright infringers through the Attorney General. Instead, OPEN sets up a process with several checks and balances that would send copyright infringement claims through the International Trade Commission. In a letter co-signed by Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo and five others, the titans of Silicon Valley propped up the Issa-Markey alternative -- it's called the Online Protection & ENforcement of Digital Trade act, in full. \"We commend your effort and look forward to supporting the legislation upon its formal introduction,\" the letter reads, pointing how the bill's \"approach targets foreign rogue sites without inflicting collateral damage on legitimate, law-abiding U.S. Internet companies.\"",

(You can watch some of the video below.)\n\nWhen Morgan pressed her for her views on gay marriage, she called the host \"rude\" several times and repeated that she was \"here to talk about my book\" and not the questions about sexual ethics that Morgan was putting to her. Morgan replied that these were subjects in her book, and, as such, she should be willing to address them.\n\n\"Don't you think as a host that if I say that's what I want to talk about that's what we should address?\" O'Donnell volleyed back in the split-screen interview.\n\n\"Not really, no\" Morgan replied, a cheeky grin discernible on his face. A moment later, O'Donnell appeared to be getting instructions from an aide to walk off the remote location, as her eyes darted to an unseen figure. \"Are we off? Are we done?\" she said to the person. Then she got up and walked away from the set, a large shadowy figure standing in front of the camera to block it.\n\n\"I'm still here,\" Morgan said, looking as much amused as surprised. \"It would appear the interview has just been ended,\" he said, before inviting O'Donnell to come back the next night. (No word on whether she'll accept.)\n\nThe interview began with O'Donnell seemingly in good spirits, laughing as she fielded questions about her campaign and even as she was shown the infamous clip of her on \"Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher\" talking about her dabbling in witchcraft.\n\nWhen the subjects of gay marriage and sexual ethics came up and O'Donnell tried to change the subject to Barack Obama, Morgan, refusing to back off, pressed her with \"Why are you being so weird about this?\"\n\nIt continued a strange night on CNN. Earlier, Anderson Cooper, host of \"AC360\" couldn't keep it together as he went through the infamous Gerard Depardieu urinating incident, giggling uncontrollably several times at some of the puns he was reading and finding himself nearly unable to complete the segment.\n\nO'Donnell, for her part, has been catnip for television, and particularly for viral-video enthusiasts.

Which is why I decided to come up with my own homemade fruit leather recipe.\n\nMuch like the way that leftover vegetables make great pickles, leftover fruit can be a good start to your own homemade fruit leather. My preference for a base is mixed berries, but that’s because we always have several bags of frozen mixed berries from Costco in the freezer for making smoothies\n\nHow to Make Fruit Rollups with a Dehydrator\n\nIf you have a dehydrator, fruit leather is super easy to make. Another popular recipe is my Garlic Beef Jerky. In fact, my kids sometimes call this fruit jerky instead of fruit leather or fruit rollups.\n\nMy home blender is a 4-cup model, so I’ll start by filling it almost halfway with thawed mixed berries that I buy in large quantities, such as these 4lb bags from Costco.\n\nThe key to making it shelf stable, and still pretty sweet, is the balance of lemon juice and honey. A good rule of thumb is to use 1T of Lemon Juice and 1T of Honey for every cup of fruit puree. The acid in the lemon juice is important here to prevent spoilage.\n\nSo what do you pour it on? There are commercially available sheets available for lining your dehydrator trays, but I’ve found that Parchment Paper works great. Just don’t use wax paper, or anything plastic based, or it will melt horrendously.\n\nHow Long to Dehydrate Fruit Leather\n\nThe minimum recommended temperature for fruit leather is 135 degrees. The trick is that every dehydrator runs quite differently due to the size of the device, accuracy of the heater and efficiency of the fan.\n\nMy suggestion is that you check in on your mixed berry fruit leather around 4 hours on your first attempt. Check each tray and look at how it’s setting up in the middle. If it’s still runny, obviously you need more time.\n\nCheck in again each hour to see how it’s doing. The fruit leather should start pulling up easily at the corners, but not get crusty on the parchment paper.",
  "latent_7296": "Ivanka Trump looks on as Donald J. Trump speaks during a campaign event at the Aston Township Community Center on September 13, 2016 in Aston, Pennsylvania. Mark Makela/Getty Images Across the country, Americans disturbed by Trump's campaign rhetoric are boycotting companies doing business with his family.\n\nA number of boycott campaigns, most notably #GrabYourWallet and The Donald J. Trump Resistance (DJTR), have popped up in the last month. As of November 28th, the #GrabYourWallet campaign has over 7.6 million impressions on Twitter (including retweets and likes) and The DJTR has over 39,000 likes on Facebook.\n\nThe majority of the targeted retailers, including Nordstrom and Sears, are continuing to sell clothing and home furnishings by Ivanka Trump and the president-elect.\n\nThis is no surprise to Robert Passikoff, the founder of Brand Keys, a marketing research firm that has studied Trump's brand power for the past 25 years.\n\n\"The boycott is an ideological reaction,\" he tells Business Insider. \"Brands don't tend to do well when they involve themselves with ideologies.\"\n\nAlthough Passikoff says there's no historical model to compare the Trump boycotts to (i.e. people not buying products connected to a brand that now has the US presidency), we can look to Trump's nationwide brand power over the past few years for some answers.\n\nBrand Keys continually surveys consumers nationwide about Trump, with each sample around 1,800 people. To gather its data for its Trump surveys, the firm asks people how much they think particular products are worth (both with and without Trump's name).\n\nThough Brand Keys normally conducts client-funded research, these surveys are part of an ongoing internal study. Passikoff says the firm did not track the political affiliation of its survey respondents until Trump declared his candidacy, but that there have been equal numbers of partipants who identify as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents since he entered the running. The following percentages — which span more than two decades — are therefore not completely non-partisan, but nonetheless offer insight about Trump's brand.\n\nBefore Trump declared his candidacy, the overall added value for Trump's brand was 25%. This means if an apartment complex normally sold at $1,000 per square foot, it could sell for $1,250 per square foot with Trump's name on it. Passikoff says A-list celebrities like Derek Jeter typically have an added brand value of about 15%.\n\nAfter Trump entered the race, his brand power decreased 20% for products like suits, ties, and jewelry, but increased for branded items geared toward wealthier Americans, like country clubs and luxury condos. When The Washington Post leaked audio of Trump making lewd comments about women in October, that percentage plunged to 8%.\n\nBut following the election, Trump's brand power increased 35% across every category.\n\n\"His name has more power now than ever,\" says Passikoff, who predicts the boycotts will do minimal damage to retailers' bottom lines and long-term reputations. He says that might not be the case for retailers that appeal to millennial voters — the majority of which didn't vote for Trump.\n\nOnly six retailers have stopped selling Trump products in the recent past. Macy's dropped Donald Trump menswear in 2015 after he said many Mexicans are rapists or criminals (but the company has kept Ivanka Trump products). On November 12, Shoes.com announced on Twitter that it was removing Ivanka Trump shoes from its inventory.\n\n\"We understand and your voices have been heard. We have removed the products from our website,\" Shoes.com tweeted to #GrabYourWallet supporters at the time, but the tweet was later deleted (the retailer later made a statement that the shoes weren't selling well). The other companies — Bellacor, Wayfair, Zulily, RueLaLa, and Stein Mart— removed Trump merchandise soon after the election. Some cited dwindling sales; others didn't provide an official statement.\n\nSome retailers that felt pressure from the boycotts have confirmed they will continue to carry Trump products. In an email sent to Nordstrom employees on November 21, co-President Pete Nordstrom wrote, \"Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results — if people don't buy it, we won't sell it.\" And since customers keep buying Ivanka Trump merchandise, it's not worth it for the company to drop her line, Fortune reported.\n\nShannon Coulter, a brand and digital strategist who started the #GrabYourWallet hashtag in October, believes that supporting Trump products will damage retailers' reputations in the long run.\n\nAfter Trump's win, she and other anti-Trump Twitter users made a Google Doc spreadsheet listing 49 retailers that do business with the Trump family. It includes information about Trump inventory carried by businesses along with contact information.\n\nIf these retailers choose to remove Trump products, it will prevent damage for their brands, Coulter says. She points to Christian Dior stores, which chose to fire creative director and designer John Galliano in 2011 after he made racist remarks in public.\n\nThe Dior brand, worth an estimated $20.2 billion, was able to ride out the controversy because it immediately dropped Galliano after a wave of public criticism.\n\n\"Dior didn't want its brand associated with racism,\" Coulter says. \"If a company like Nordstrom chooses to continue selling the products of someone [Ivanka Trump] who passionately campaigned for the KKK-endorsed candidate who likes to grab women by the genitals, that's going to have implications for the Nordstrom brand whether company executives like it or not.\"\n\nThe DJTR campaign is a similar effort to #GrabYour Wallet. Started by New York Daily News senior justice writer Shaun King, it calls for a boycott of various companies, founders, and CEOs that financially supported the Trump campaign and sell his family's products.\n\n\"We must make our money stand for the values and the people that we believe in. Otherwise, we are funding the very oppression, bigotry, and discrimination that we claim to hate,\" The DJTR website reads.\n\nEven though Trump threatened to enact racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic policies on the campaign trail, it will be difficult to tarnish his name. It is latched onto one of the most powerful brands in the world.\n\nCoulter says she and the anti-Trump movement will continue to boycott.\n\n\"As for backing down, no,\" she says. \"No plans to do that at all.\"\n\nCorrection — An earlier version of this story did not detail the political affiliation of Brand Keys' survey participants. The firm only did so after Trump declared his presidential candidacy.",

Sound familiar?\n\nBut how did the software get that bad? Presumably no one set out to make it like that? The answer is that the software is suffering from Software Erosion – the constant decay of the internal structure of a software system that occurs in all phases of software development and maintenance\n\nAt the architectural level, Software Erosion is seen in the divergence of the software architecture as-implemented from the software architecture as-intended. Note that when talking about the architecture as-intended I’m not speaking here about the initial planned architecture of the software system. Software architectures should evolve over time – this is to be expected as new requirements emerge – so the intended architecture is what your current conception of the architecture is. With software erosion what we’re talking about are unintended modifications or temporary violations of the software architecture.\n\nThe problem with software erosion is that its effects accumulate over time to result in a significant decrease in the ability of a system to meet its stakeholder requirements. Unless you take steps to actively pinpoint and stop software erosion it will gradually creep up on you and make changing the software further significantly harder and less predictable. In the worst case it could lead to the cancellation of the project or, for particularly significant projects, the closure of the business.\n\nTypes of Software Erosion\n\nTo begin to tackle software erosion you need an understanding of how it typically shows itself.

A bug fix or change in one clone instance is likely to have to be propagated to the other clone instances. Metric outliers e.g. very deep class hierarchies, huge packages, very complex code etc.\n\nA well-known example of software erosion was highlighted in a reverse-engineering experiment on two separate versions of ANT some years ago. ANT V1.4.1 (11 October 2001) and ANT V1.6.1 (12 February 2004) were reverse-engineered and the results were compared.\n\nAt the time ANT was built in three layers, from the top-down these were taskdefs, ant, utils. In the earlier version these layers were well separated and the ant layer was monolithic but small. In the later version the ant layer was still monolithic but had now become very large – making it harder to understand and work with. More problematically a new upward dependency from the lower-level ant layer to the top-level taskdefslayer had been introduced.\n\nThese types of erosion problems lead to code that is hard to understand, hard to modify and hard to test. But how do you know whether you’re suffering from software erosion?\n\nAre you suffering from Software Erosion?\n\nPerhaps the first thing to observe is that most projects will suffer from software erosion at some stage unless there is a conscious effort to pinpoint and stop such erosion. Even projects that are relatively short-lived can suffer from it. One example I have heard about involved a software project that had to be scrapped after only 6 months because it had already eroded badly.\n\nThere are some common things you can look out for when deciding how badly your software is suffering from software erosion:\n\nThe time, effort and risk in implementing new functionality increase – productivity and quality decrease and complexity increases. These are very common side effects when software erosion is present.\n\nNo one has responsibility for the architecture and knowledge of the architecture is held by a decreasing number of people.\n\nNo one on the team can tell you (or agree on) what the intended or implemented architectures are. If you don’t have an understanding of either of these then it’s very likely that software erosion has occurred and will continue to occur.\n\nor architectures are. If you don’t have an understanding of either of these then it’s very likely that software erosion has occurred and will continue to occur. The team hasn’t had a stable core membership throughout the software’s life. If someone leaves the team then that person’s knowledge of the architecture and software leaves with him or her. New people take time to get up to speed on the project, so mistakes are made and the software erodes further. If new people are unlucky enough to be introduced into a team where no one knows what the architecture is or should be, then the software will erode even faster as they make changes to it.\n\nLittle or no refactoring is sanctioned. Refactoring is the way to rollback software erosion once it has been pinpointed. Refactorings that remove architecture violations, eliminate code cycles, prune dead code, consolidate code clones and do away with metric outliers are particularly beneficial, because, by fighting software erosion, they clear the way for other refactorings, for bug fixes and for new features in the software.\n\nThere’s pressure to rewrite the software. When software has eroded badly it becomes really hard for developers to work with that software. Every change and bug fix takes significantly longer in practice than it should in theory. The code becomes brittle and so even the simplest change can have unexpected knock-on effects which lead to costly rework. I’ll say more on rewriting later.\n\nAt a detailed level, software erosion results in problems such as code living in the wrong place, layering violations (as seen above in the ANT example), complex cycles insufficient decomposition, big packages etc.\n\nCosts of Software Erosion\n\nIt can be hard to measure the cost of software erosion and convey this cost to non-technical people who often have to sanction work to stop software erosion. Even though software erosion causes reduced productivity, reduced quality and increased time-to-market, no one specific point of erosion causes these effects in isolation, rather it is the effect of multiple points of erosion that combine and reinforce each other to cause them.\n\nHowever, a study by the US Air Force Software Technology Support Centre (STSC) attempted to put some rough measure on the costs of software erosion. The researchers took two versions of a mature software system (50k LOC) and asked two different teams to perform the same maintenance task (adding approx. 3k of code) on their respective version. Version 1 was an existing system suffering software erosion. Version 2 was the same system but with the architecture restructured to remove erosion.\n\nThe results were staggeringly different. Team 1, working on Version 1, needed over twice as long as team 2 to complete this relatively short task. Furthermore, Team 1’s results contained more than eight times the number of errors than the work submitted by team 2, working on version2. Erosion in a small system such as this still had the potential to lead to significant problems when the software was maintained.\n\nCauses of Erosion\n\nBy now you should have some clues as to how software erosion comes about. It does not arise purely spontaneously. Software Erosion comes about through change.\n\nPressure for change comes from a variety of sources. The need to add new features to a product to help persuade people to buy it, changes to the environment within which the software is deployed e.g. to support different networking or GUI standards and technical changes, such as the desire to adopt new coding standards all have an impact on the software. Where the initial vision for the software doesn’t allow for change, such erosion effects will be seen very quickly.\n\nSoftware Erosion is also known as software decay or code rot and by similar terms. However, these don’t adequately capture the notion that it is forces external to the software that are ultimately the cause of problems within the software. Erosion is not something that just happens to the code without someone actively making such changes. This is why I feel that notion of software erosion more adequately describes this gradual wearing down of the ability to work effectively with the software.\n\nThe needs of the business can also contribute to software erosion. Even though deliberately eroding your software causes bigger problems down the line it may be in the best interest of the business to do this for some short-term gain. The problems build up quickly however if the business does this repeatedly without spending time to refactor the eroded code. Every developer is familiar with the ‘quick-fix’ that becomes a permanent feature.\n\nReal-World Examples of Software Erosion\n\nHow bad is this problem in practice? In 2007-08 I decided to investigate this question by running a number of workshops at different software events in the UK and by engaging in some discussions with some software practitioners further afield.\n\nAt every workshop I ran participants spoke about many different examples of systems suffering software erosion:\n\nSoftware with a large number of cyclic dependencies that ended up as brittle spaghetti code.\n\nSystems where business logic (with associated SQL) was captured in the software’s presentation layer – making it hard to replace this layer.\n\nA software system where the threading architecture eroded so badly over time that the system became unmaintainable and had to be scrapped.\n\nA single class used as a dumping ground for everything that didn’t have a better home.\n\nA ‘cancerous wart’ of a software system with ever increasing coupling between modules, packages etc.\n\nLots of code clones (copies and near-identical copies).\n\nUncontrolled code use – programmers grabbing code, classes and even variables from other parts of the software without any control on what could and couldn’t be used – once again led to significant erosion.\n\nSeveral examples of drive-by programming – team-membership constantly changing, programmers not understanding the architecture and so making mistakes when they coded and then moving onto their next project. One example of drive-by-architecting with similar consequences.\n\nProblems with obsolete software and hardware technology; a lack of skills in these obsolete technologies leading to further decay.\n\nSales-driven evolution – where there was no clear roadmap or scope for the software system and so the implemented software architecture inevitably diverged rapidly from the intended architecture.\n\nMerged companies with different cultures and different principles having to collaborate on a software system leading to decay.\n\nIn every workshop all but a few people either were working on projects that had eroded quite badly or had worked on such projects in the past.\n\nCase Study - Outsourcing of a 1MLOC C/C++ system\n\nI outline below a real-world case study in order to get you thinking further about software erosion. My recommendation is to spend 10-15 minutes (either on your own or with a colleague who is also reading this article) thinking about the questions before proceeding to the discussion.\n\nCase Study Project History\n\nA company developed a software system over a number of years. Six years ago the software was transferred to a company-owned outsourcing centre in India where it has been developed since that time. At the time of the transfer the organisation believed that the architecture of the system as intended was well documented and matched what was implemented.\n\nThe software is critical and cannot be thrown away easily.\n\nOver time more staff were added to the project to maintain a steady flow of new features. The company has a similar product that is maintained and evolved by 5 developers whereas the Indian department now has 50 developers.\n\nThe company recently compared the amount of work done by these two teams and assessed that they delivered roughly the same amount of work.\n\nPresent Situation\n\nActing on this difference in productivity the company compared the architecture from 6 years ago (as the outsourcing took place) against the architecture of the current code and found that many parts of the system have dependencies that are not intended.\n\nThe intended architecture was documented, so in theory all involved personnel could have compared actual to as-intended architecture. The initial architecture was probably appropriate for the current system (so it's a good architecture that has gone bad).\n\nThe company now intends to bring part of the software back under control in Germany while leaving part under control in India.\n\nQuestions\n\nThink about whether it is credible that software erosion led to this significant decrease in productivity? What do you think of the company's proposed solution?\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe software has been developed over a number of years; the team and their development processes; tools and technologies may have changed during this time. Given we can probably reason that the software has probably been modified a lot before it was handed over and so conclude that it’s likely that the architecture at the time of handover may have eroded.\n\nThere was a major personnel change 6 years ago when the project was handed over. The two different organisations will have different cultures, knowledge & skills. It is not clear that these differences will be lessened just because both organisations are part of the same multi-national. This could lead to further erosion.\n\nWe also have to consider the reasons for the switch and the way the switch took place. Did the organisation cut costs on the project when the software was handed over? Was there a backlog of work on the project that it was felt the new team could tackle sooner or better? How was the handover done? Did they redeploy the existing team elsewhere or did they fire them? Were people from the old team made available to help people from the new team get up to speed? How much time was the new team given to learn about the software before having to start modifying it? If there was no effective handover and insufficient time allowed for the new team to learn the architecture and the code base then erosion is more likely to have occurred.\n\nWe’re told that the ‘Software is critical and cannot be thrown away’. We’re also told that there’s been a steady flow of new features Both of these indicate that changes have and will take place implying that erosion could be present. This is confirmed by the assessment that there are a lot of unintended dependencies in the architecture as-implemented.\n\nMy belief is that it is credible that architectural decay contributed to the team’s problems but that it cannot be untangled from other issues.\n\nThere have been lots of changes over the years.\n\nAt the time of handover it wasn’t clear how closely the architecture as is matched the architecture as intended.\n\nThere were lots of staff changes – how well was the handover managed? – this was initially a comprehension task that needed management and technical support.\n\nStopping Software Erosion\n\nStopping software erosion requires management commitment. If managers are only interested in the short-term viability of their software projects then it is hard for developers to get the time and make the effort to tackle the problem. This does not excuse developers from doing what they can to fight erosion but will inevitably make their struggle less effective.\n\nIf management commitment is present then the following outline pattern can be used to stop software erosion. How you implement the pattern depends on what tools you have available, what domain your project lies in, how mature the erosion problem is etc.\n\nStopping Software Erosion – a Pattern\n\nStart out with a sustainable architecture. – All successful software systems evolve; make sure you have built in flexibility for future known changes. Assess your architecture using the most likely change scenarios – where is it flexible, where will it need to evolve? There are always tradeoffs here in the amount of time you can spend in architecture assessment and also in the ‘finished’ architecture. When implementation starts regularly visualize the architecture as the software changes. Get a feel for how close your implemented architecture is to your architectural vision – maybe you need to change the latter. Compare the architecture as-implemented to your architecture as-intended to see how they differ. With automated support this can be done as part of the software build. This step does rely on you at least having some vision of what your intended architecture is. If you don’t have this then you can gradually reverse engineer it from your architecture as-implemented. There are now many tools from very basic free ones through to very advanced commercial tools that can help with architecture visualization and checking. Use cycle detection, clone detection, metrics analysis and dead code detection to pinpoint software erosion. Again there are several free and commercial tools that tackle some or these tasks. Refactor the software to remove eroded code.\n\nStopping Software Erosion – Cultural Factors\n\nAs noted above, if top management doesn’t support the fight against software erosion then developers have their work cut out to stop erosion. With management support you can create a culture where stopping erosion is valued. This culture is likely to have characteristics such as – an emphasis on regular refactoring, clear assignment of responsibilities, sharing of architectural knowledge and work, frequent communication between the whole group.\n\nIn Designing Maintainability in Software Engineering: a Quantified Approach Tom Gilb describes one team’s ‘Green Week’ – one week set aside each month to focus on improving their software’s maintainability. This proved more successful for the team than their earlier one day a week approach and had the added benefit of making the development team feel empowered.\n\nA few words on rewriting\n\nBefore I wrap up I’d like to say a few words about software rewrites. As I noted earlier, pressure from development teams to rewrite software commonly manifests itself when that software has eroded. In the worst case the development team uses the excuse of a possible future rewrite to delay refactoring work to the software. When this occurs, the software continues to erode until it reaches a state where working with it becomes very difficult. Even if a rewrite may once have been avoidable if action had been taken the result is that a rewrite becomes inevitable due to the negligence of the team.\n\nAs a developer, when faced with a decision about rewriting some software you should always ask yourself whether you are planning to rewrite it for the right reasons. Is it because you cannot make the software maintainable or is it to get rid of code you haven’t tried hard enough to refactor or code that someone other than you has written? Worst still, is it just to get some hot new technology onto your CV?\n\nAs a manager ask yourself whether you can afford a rewrite? Do you have the right people with the right skills available for the right length of time? Do you understand the risks of new tools and technologies? Do you understand what you have to build? Are you rewriting the software or building something brand new? Worst still, how long will it be before your competitors catch up? In the Doomsday scenario, can your organisation handle the total failure of the rewriting project?\n\nIf you’re about to risk an expensive and lengthy rewrite of your software, are you really sure that you’ve exhausted every approach to fighting software erosion in your current code base?\n\nSummary\n\nAny successful software system is likely to evolve. Unless preventative work is undertaken the software will erode. As the software erodes the cost and risk of further development rises. It’s rarely too early to start fighting software erosion. The costs of software erosion start to bite very quickly once it sets in.\n\nThere are lots of different things that can be done to stop software erosion – you (just) need to work out what the best value approach is for your particular project. If you are a manager then create a culture where fighting software erosion is encouraged and supported. If you don't do this then no one will care about erosion. If you are an architect or developer then educate yourself about the different causes of erosion and the different approaches for fighting it. If you’re interested in finding out more, or sharing your ideas on stopping software erosion, then please get in touch.\n\nReferences\n\nSee http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2005/11/0511SangalWaldman.html for more information on the Ant case study and http://codefeed.com/blog/?p=98 for a brief early Ant project history.\n\nGeneral Background Reading:\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution: M M Lehman, J F Ramil, P D Wernick, D E Perry, W M Turski, \"Metrics and Laws of Software Evolution The Nineties View,\" metrics, p. 20, Fourth International Software Metrics Symposium (METRICS'97), 1997\n\nRefactoring in Large Software Projects: Performing Complex Restructurings Successfully, Martin Lippert, Stephen Roock, Wiley 2006\n\nBack to the archive list",

  "latent_7507": "Disclaimer: Although we do talk about French onion dip here, this article is really more about the general application of caramelizing onions.\n\nGet the Recipe Real French Onion Dip\n\nLike the He-Man Christmas Special, French onion dip is one of those things that's difficult to admit that you secretly really love. I mean, it's essentially mayonnaise that's designed specifically to make your breath smell really bad. On top of that, most commercial versions have a goopy texture and underlying backbone of dehydrated onion flavor that makes them quite hard to take seriously. Then again, who amongst you hasn't dipped your way through a jar of it while watching reruns of Mr. Wizard's World by yourself because your wife a) won't watch them with you and b) has moderately sensitive olfactory sensory apparatus* that oddly prefers fresh air to onion breath? Who, I ask?\n\nWouldn't it be great if there were a French onion dip that we didn't have to be mildly ashamed to consume in public? Preferably one made with real onions?\n\nThere are certainly no shortage of recipes out there, and the general method, unsurprisingly, begins with the same basic technique: cook down finely chopped onions over low, low heat to get their natural sugars to slowly and evenly caramelize. Once the onions are completely broken down to a deep brown, jam-like consistency, they're blended together with mayonnaise and sour cream, seasoned with a bit of salt and pepper, and you're done.\n\nIt's a simple process, and the results are infinitely better than any jarred versions, but my quibble with it is the same one that I have with French onion soup: it's a major pain in the cul. All that slow caramelizing takes a good 30 to 45 minutes of constant pot babysitting. Let it go just a bit too long or step away for five minutes, and you've burnt your onions, making the final product too bitter to use.\n\nAs with exercise and marriage I often think about how great it'd be if there were a method that could deliver the exact same (or better!) results without the massive time commitment.\n\nIt took me a week of cooking and over 20 pounds of onions to figure it out how.\n\nAllium Options\n\nFirst things first: What type of onion works best?\n\nThere are five basic onion varieties available in my local supermarkets: red, yellow, white, and sweet (either Vidalia or Walla Walla). You'd think that sweet onions are the way to go, offering you more sugars to caramelize, but upon cooking all four onion varieties side by side, the differences were less pronounced than I expected. All of them developed rich, caramelized flavor in about the same amount of time, but the red turned an off-putting muddy greenish-brown color. Ick. The sweet ones were marginally sweeter, but not enough that they were worth the premium price. They also lacked complexity. Of all of them, the yellow boasted the most flavor.\n\nTurns out that although sweet onions have about 25% more sugar in them, their flavor difference when raw has more to do with the amount of tear-inducing lachrymators they contain. Yellow onions have more pungent irritants than sweet, giving sweet onions the impression of actually being even sweeter than they really are. When you cook the onions down, these pungent compounds mellow out into more complex flavors, giving yellow onions a distinct edge over the sweet.\n\nSeeking Sweetness\n\nBefore we can figure out how to improve our end results, it's important to understand exactly what's going on when an onion browns.\n\nFirst, the onions begin by sweating . As they slowly heat up, moisture from their interior (they are roughly 75% water by weight) begins to evaporate, forcing its way out of the onion's cells, and causing them to rupture in the process. This breakdown of the cells is what causes onions to soften during the initial stages of cooking.\n\n. As they slowly heat up, moisture from their interior (they are roughly 75% water by weight) begins to evaporate, forcing its way out of the onion's cells, and causing them to rupture in the process. This breakdown of the cells is what causes onions to soften during the initial stages of cooking. As onion cells continue to break down, they release their contents, a complex mix of sugars, proteins, and aromatic compounds ( mercaptans, disulfides, trisulfides, thiopenes, and other such long, no-reason-to-memorize chemicals). This is when things start to smell really good, and incidentally, when you should get the dog to leave the room, unless you enjoy a permanent onion aroma on your pet's fur.\n\nOnce most of the liquid has evaporated and the temperature of the onion starts creeping up into the 230°F-and-above zone, caramelization begins to take place. This reaction involves the oxidation of sugar, which breaks down and forms dozens of new compounds, adding depth of flavor to your onions. Large sugar molecules like sucrose break down into small monosaccharides like glucose and fructose. Glucose and fructose separately are sweeter than a single sucrose molecule, making the overall flavor of caramelized sugars sweeter than the starting sugar.\n\nbegins to take place. This reaction involves the oxidation of sugar, which breaks down and forms dozens of new compounds, adding depth of flavor to your onions. Large sugar molecules like sucrose break down into small monosaccharides like glucose and fructose. Glucose and fructose separately are sweeter than a single sucrose molecule, making the overall flavor of caramelized sugars sweeter than the starting sugar. At the same time, the Maillard reaction takes place. Similarly to caramelization, the Maillard reaction will cause browning. However, the Maillard reaction is far more complex, involving the interaction of sugars, proteins, and enzymes. The products of the Maillard reaction number in the hundreds, and are still not fully identified. This is the reaction that causes browning on your toast or your steak when you cook it.\n\nIdeally, as the onion continues to cook, three things will complete themselves at the same time: 1: the complete softening of the onion's cell structure, 2: maximum caramelization (I.E. as brown as you can get before bitter products begin to develop), and 3: maximum Maillard browning (with the same caveat)\n\nBy enhancing and speeding up each of these stages, I should be able to improve my overall process.\n\nMission 1: Increase the Effects of Caramelization\n\nThe most obvious way to do this is to increase the amount of sugar we start with. The sugars in onions are glucose, fructose, and sucrose (a combination of one glucose and one fructose molecule)— exactly the same as the caramelization products of table sugar. Indeed, I found that adding just a touch of table sugar to the onions increased sweetness without affecting the overall flavor profile of the finished product.\n\nOn the other hand, it didn't speed things up at all the way I wanted it to. But what if I gave the caramelization a kick-start by cooking the sugar on its own before adding the onions?\n\nI tried it, cooking the sugar down in a dry skillet until it reached a deep golden brown before adding the onions and tossing them to coat them in the hot caramel. It worked like a charm, shaving a good 4 to 5 minutes off of my total cooking time, and giving me sweeter, more deeply caramelized end results.\n\nMission1: Accomplished\n\nTouching Base\n\nMission 2: Increase the Maillard Reaction\n\nThere are a number of things that affect the maillard reaction, but the overriding factors are temperature and pH. For now, I had no safe way to increase the temperature—cook the onions too hot, and the small pieces burn on their exterior before the interiors have a chance to release their chemicals. Low and slow is the only way to go.\n\npH, on the other hand, I've got a bit of control over. In general, the higher the pH (I.E. the more basic or alkaline), the faster the reaction takes place. I remember reading a story a couple years ago on Khymos.org in which the author managed to speed up the cooking time of onions by adding a pinch of baking soda, a powdered base.\n\nIndeed, in my testing on chicken wings, I found that adding baking soda to the skin can greatly increase browning. It also gave me chicken wings an odd chemical aftertaste. Would it work better with the onions?\n\nThe key is moderation. While large amounts of baking soda dramatically increased the browning rate (by over 50%!), any more than a 1/4 teaspoon per pound of chopped onions proved to be too much.\n\nYou may also notice that the baking-powdered onions are much softer. This is because pectin, the chemical glue that holds vegetable cells together weakens in higher pHs. That's why many British recipes for mushy peas calls for a soak in water dosed with baking powder (for similar reasons, you can par-boil potatoes in vinegar-spiked water to tenderize them without letting them break down).\n\nFaster breakdown means faster release of chemicals, which means faster overall cooking.\n\nMission 2: Accomplished. We're almost there!\n\nPlaying With Fire\n\nMission 3: Increase the Heat\n\nBack to heat. As I mentioned, the problem with increasing the heat to much higher than medium-low is that the onions begin to cook unevenly. Some bits and edges will start to blacken long before other bits even reach the golden brown stage. Additionally, the sticky sugars and proteins that get stuck to the bottom of the pan as the onions cook rapidly turn dark brown due to their direct contact.\n\nSo the question is: if you're cooking with high heat, what can you do to simultaneously even out the cooking across all the onions, to remove the sticky browned gunk from the bottom of the pan, and to regulate the overall temperature so that nothing burns?\n\nIf you've ever made a pan sauce, the answer is so blindingly simple that I'm surprised it's not completely common practice: just add water.\n\nAt first, adding water may seem counterproductive: it cools down the onions and the pan, forcing you to expend valuable energy heating it up and evaporating it.\n\nBut here's the deal. Both the browned patina on the bottom of the pan and the browned bits on the edges of the onions are made of water-soluble sugar-based compounds that happen to be concentrated in a single area. By adding just a small amount of liquid to the pan at regular intervals, these compounds get dissolved and redistributed evenly throughout the onions and pan. Even distribution leads to even cooking, which leads to no single part burning before the rest is cooked.\n\nSo what does this all mean for your onions? It means that you can cook them over a much higher flame (medium high works well—even maximum flame is feasible, though it requires a little attention) and every time they threaten to start burning, just add a couple tablespoons of water to even out the cooking, and you're smooth-sailing once again.\n\nMission 4: Accomplished\n\nBuilding the Dip\n\nSo with a couple of little tweaks, I'd managed to whittle down a 45-minute long procedure to not much more than 15 or 20 minutes, and to be honest, the flavor developed in that short amount of time is actually deeper and more complex than the standard, slow-cooked French onion soup method (incidentally, this process is perfectly adaptable to onion soup—just add a splash of sherry and some good chicken or beef stock to the onion base and simmer it down for a few minutes. Delicious!)\n\nAll that remained was to create a creamy dip for the intensely onion-y flavor base.\n\nI messed around a bit with softening cream cheese, strained yogurt, and crème fraîche, but in the end, none of them were better than the traditional blend of sour cream and mayonnaise. A splash of lemon juice added some brightness while a bit of Worcestershire sauce gave it a meaty, umami-ful backbone. Looking to up the umami factor even more, I decided to also add a touch of grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nThe good thing about going through 20 pounds of onions in a week is that now the walls, carpet and dog permanently smell like caramelized onions, my lovely wife no longer notices my breath.\n\n*A.K.A. her nose.\n\nMore tests, more results!

  "latent_7559": "Panasonic is showing off a prototype Ultra HD Blu-ray player in its booth here, and shockingly -- it's a Blu-ray player. The demo unit has a hole cut in the top, but we didn't spot any extra pixels leaking out anywhere. According to statements from various board members, licensing is on track to happen this summer and we could see discs by the end of this year. It's expected that Ultra HD Blu-ray will upgrade the format to handle 33GB layers (up from the 25GB per layer of current discs) and discs that hold as much 100GB of data. You'll need a new player to read the new discs, but the new players will be backwards compatible with existing Blu-ray movies. In our discussions with studio execs, we've heard that most movies encoded with HEVC (h.265, the new compression format for 4K video) should fit on dual-layer discs comfortably.\n\nThere's room for 60 fps video, HDR/Dolby Vision support, at least 10-bit color gradation and wide color gamut (read: better and more colors). Panasonic's prototype player spec says it can push video at up to 100 Mbps -- far higher than the 15 Mbps profiles we saw demonstrated by Netflix last year. Of course, there's a lot of work to be done before the spec is final, and we still haven't heard much about improvements to audio.\n\nBut what about those who have moved on to a discless lifestyle, or are just interested in a version of digital copies that can be carried around? The Secure Content Storage Association has stepped up and, like the BDA, says finalization of its spec is \"coming soon.\" We got a preview of what it's working on this week, when Samsung announced that its new TVs would support 4K downloads from M-Go, by using the SCSA's standards. We got a quick demo of what the consortium has planned and it most reminds us of what we've seen from internet stores for video games like Steam, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nWe'll still need to wait and see exactly how Hollywood studios implement the DRM, but it's set up so users can download copies of movies, store and watch them without hassle. There's an ability to copy, move or share the stored files, and users can access various profiles for different devices like TVs, phones or tablets. In a mocked-up player, users had the option to make a licensed copy, registered to them and playable on any device, or an unlicensed copy. That copy of the movie can be shared, but if someone else wanted to play it, they'd need to buy it from a store in order to unlock it for viewing.\n\nAlso built in is support for finding any compatible files across a network, so if the movie is stored on your NAS, a PC, a phone or tethered hard drive, it will pop up in the menu for playback. For better and/or worse, it all struck me as a sort of movie studio-designed variant of XBMC (oops, Kodi) or Plex.\n\nThe SCSA is also talking about quality, with support for Ultra HD, HDR and potentially things like high frame-rate video. It's also considering that customers might be able to upgrade their copies to a new version, so if, for example, a remastered HDR version of a movie comes out, it will be in your library. Our remaining questions cover things like studio/store support -- you can count on the usual names from Ultraviolet plus some newcomers, but we'll have to wait and see if Disney jumps in or goes its own way again. It appears that finding compatible devices won't be difficult, and Qualcomm is on board to make sure its chips (probably inside your phones/tablets already) are compatible.\n\nFormerly known as Project Phenix the SCSA is several years in the making; we'll see if that long gestation was enough to strike a balance between the desires of studios and the customers it hopes will want to pay for downloadable movies.",
  "latent_7564": "How Viagra Was Invented Accidentally And Became The Most Loved Mistake Of The Century\n\nBy Nishi Jain Updated: Aug 3, 2018, 10:24 IST 1.8K SHARES\n\nA Patent The Modern World Was Waiting For\n\nWith trials well in place, Pfizer was ready to bring in the century's best accidental invention. In 1996, the company got its magic drug patented, and in 1997, applied to US Food and Drug Administration for a license. The license was granted by the FDA on a priority basis, and on 27 March, 1998, Viagra was officially launched. Clearly, everybody was excited for the first ever oral treatment for erectile dysfunction.\n\n© Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images\n\nPeter Dunn and Albert Wood (mere chance?), both of whom worked at Pfizer, are credited as the inventors of the wonder drug Viagra (along with their team of pharmacists at Pfizer), though they maintained biochemist Robert Furchgott had a tremendous contribution in the work. Furchgott discovered that significant biochemical effects nitric oxide has on human body, a discovery that was crucial to the creation of Viagra. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery.\n\nThe Drug That Changed The Lives Of Millions Of Men\n\nViagra was an instant hit. As it reached the markets, it lapped up a huge consumer base that was probably waiting for a miracle. Within barely 3 months of its launch, doctors had written nearly 3 million prescriptions recommending Viagra. In just two years, the annual sales of Viagra had reached up to $1 billion. It is estimated that by 2008, over 35 million men had used the drug. Pfizer had hit the right nerve.\n\nViagra In Popular Culture\n\n© Reuters\n\nThe blue pill, as Viagra came to be called, carved a niche for itself in the market and found huge acceptance in popular culture. Because of its efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction, it soon gained popularity as a wonder drug that was seen as something more than just medicine. It gave men a chance to relive the pleasures of youth again, especially those suffering from the consequences of ageing.\n\nViagra was marketed through ads on radio and television, something very rare for a drug that was available through prescription only. It was a commodity waiting to be picked up by consumers. Celebrities, including politicians and sportspersons, stepped forward to promote the drug. Brazilian soccer star Pele apepared in Viagra ads and worked with Pfizer to create awareness for erectile dysfunction.\n\nOver the years, Viagra has come to be used for recreational purposes as well. It is seen by some as a performance-enhancing lifestyle drug, though studies have suggested it has limited effect on perfectly healthy men.\n\nToday, Viagra is a blessing for men with erectile dysfunction, and it has done much to remove the stigma from the health condition. Modern lifestyle has made problems like ED more common, especially among young people. It's a myth that it only affects the old and Viagra has helped shatter it. One of the most life-changing accidental inventions of the century, Viagra has given men (and their partners) a new lease of life.\n\nSources:\n\nDawn Connelly, The Pharmaceutical Journal, 'Three Decades of Viagra'\n\nAccessR, 'The Inventor of Viagra Dies at Age 92'\n\nVardenafilgen, 'History of the creation of Viagra'\n\nAccessR, 'The History of Viagra'\n\nPhoto: © Thinkstock Photos/Disha Bhatia (Main Image)",

  "latent_7856": "The owner of TV streaming links site SurfTheChannel was sentenced to four years jail-time at Newcastle Crown Court today. Anton Vickerman was previously found guilty of conspiracy to defraud for “facilitating” copyright infringement . The landmark case follows a sting operation by the MPAA, who partnered with the UK Federation Against Copyright Theft to obtain evidence against the site operator.\n\nIn 2010, SurfTheChannel.com was among the most-visited streaming link websites on the Internet. The site had more than 400,000 visitors a day who were mostly looking for popular TV-shows.\n\nThe website was a thorn in the side of the UK and US entertainment industries who went to extremes to bring the site down. Among other things, the MPAA and FACT hired an undercover agent to gain access to the defendants’ house under false pretenses.\n\nThe case eventually went to trial in May and today a judge at Newcastle Crown Court sentenced 38-year old site owner Anton Vickerman to four years imprisonment. Vickerman’s wife faced the same charges but was found not guilty in June.\n\nSurfTheChannel\n\nToday’s sentencing marks the first time that the owner of a linking website has been found guilty of conspiring to defraud the entertainment industry.\n\nA previous attempt at making the same charge stick against the owner of the OiNK BitTorrent tracker failed during 2010.\n\nAlthough SurfTheChannel did not store any copyrighted material itself, the site did organize links to copyrighted streams on third-party sites. According to the prosecution, the website was making at least £35,000 a month.\n\nThe UK Pirate Party is deeply concerned by the sentencing.\n\n“The way this issue was investigated, prosecuted and the resulting sentence are, deeply concerning, inappropriate and disproportionate given the activities that Anton Vickerman was engaged in. A four year prison sentence is twice the maximum that could have been handed down if Vickers had been charged with online copyright infringement,” party leader Loz Kaye says.\n\n“As we have said before, this was not a case brought using copyright law. The interest groups involved couldn’t present a case of copyright infringement and decided to press for the use of the common law offence of “conspiracy to defraud”. This offence is incredibly controversial in English law as it criminalises conduct by two or more parties that would not be criminal when performed by an individual,” he added.\n\nThe Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), the local anti-piracy group which played an essential role in the investigation, is delighted on the other hand.\n\n“This case conclusively shows that running a website that deliberately sets out to direct users to illegal copies of films and TV shows will result in a criminal conviction and a long jail sentence,” FACT Director General Kieron Sharp says.\n\n“The sentencing indicates the severity of the offenses committed and the sophistication of [Vickerman’s] criminal enterprise and should send a very strong message to those running similar sites that they can be found, arrested and end up in prison.”\n\nThe MPAA previously noted that it would use the sentencing of Vickerman to support the extradition process of TVShack owner Richard O’Dwyer. While the two sites were indeed comparable, the crucial difference is that O’Dwyer is not charged with fraud but copyright infringement.\n\nThat said, the sentencing today definitely spells trouble for UK-based website owners who operate similar streaming sites.",
  "latent_7930": "A Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Image credit, Ken Thomas.A new study in the journal Auk finds evidence that mercury contamination can modify the singing behavior of birds.\n\nKelly Hallinger and fellow researchers from William and Mary's Cristol Lab recorded and analyzed bird songs from four species at sites along the mercury-contaminated South River in Virginia. They also studied birds of the same species at nearby uncontaminated sites.\n\nThe researchers found that for three of the species - the Carolina wren, house wren, and song sparrow - songs at the contaminated sites contained a lower diversity of note types and were sung at lower tonal frequencies. Furthermore, both species of wren tended to sing shorter songs at the polluted sites.\n\nThese behavior changes could have negative consequences for avian populations. The study authors write:\n\n\"Because song plays a critical role in both mate attraction and territory defense, contaminant-induced changes… could severely depress male reproductive success. Song is therefore a potent mechanism through which contaminants such as mercury could affect fitness.\"\n\nThe study offers several possible explanations for the differences in birdsongs at mercury-contaminated sites:\n\n1) Mercury contaminated birds may suffer impairment in hearing high frequencies which in turn could cause them to preferentially sing lower notes - similar auditory impairment has been found in monkeys exposed to mercury.\n\n2) Mercury could cause stress during song learning. This would make sense given that the fourth species examined in the study, the eastern phoebe, did not exhibit differences in singing at the contaminated and reference sites. Unlike the other three birds, scientists believe that the phoebe does not learn songs but rather is predisposed to sing certain patterns.\n\n3) Contaminated birds might be in poorer condition and therefore sing in a way that is easier for them to perform.\n\n4) Other factors incidentally associated with the contaminated site could be causing the differences. However, the authors do not believe that this is the case. They collected data on surrounding land cover and found no difference between contaminated and reference sites.\n\nThis study adds to the growing body of work showing that environmental contaminants can have sub-lethal negative impacts for species. On the positive side, the findings indicate that if we listen closely enough, bird songs may give us a heads-up, warning about contamination issues in a particular area. The researchers write,\n\n\"Song may be a more sensitive indicator of environmental stress than tissue samples, which are traditionally used to evaluate contaminant effects, because song is the result of a combination of complex behavioral and physiological pathways.\"﻿\n\n--Reviewed by Rob Goldstein\n\nHallinger, K., Zabransky, D., Kazmer, K., & Cristol, D.

  "latent_8180": "Canadians have a long history of opening our hearts and minds to outside cultures and advocating for peace in the international community. The spirit of compassion and friendliness that pervades Canadian culture is sufficiently palpable that visitors are known to remark on our politeness and propensity for saying “sorry.”\n\nCase in point: Canada still uses gestation crates. Gestation crates are tiny metal cages in which breeding sows spend nearly their entire lives unable even to turn around, lie down comfortably, or engage in any natural behaviours. International animal welfare expert Dr. Temple Grandin has likened them to “asking a sow to live in an airline seat.” These crates are truly one of the cruelest forms of animal abuse, and are a major cause of the profound anguish depicted in the undercover footage recently released by Mercy For Animals Canada and covered by CTV’s W5. The use of gestation crates has been banned in nine U.S. states, Australia, New Zealand and the EU because the practice is recognized as inherently cruel to pigs. And yet their use is the norm in Canada, with no end in sight.\n\nPigs are sentient beings. This means they are capable of experiencing pain. Pigs, in fact, are widely considered to be highly social and one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. The footage released by Mercy For Animals Canada portrays the immense suffering of a great number of pigs who later wind up on our dinner plates. Many standard industry practices are shocking, such as castrating and cutting the tails off of piglets without administering painkillers, and killing piglets by “thumping” them against cold, hard concrete. Every veterinary expert who reviewed the undercover footage agreed that it reveals tremendous suffering that is completely unnecessary.\n\nHow could such a peaceful country condone such cruel practices? At Mercy For Animals Canada, we believe the answer is that most Canadians simply don’t know the truth about what happens to the animals behind closed doors. Canadians tend to believe that suffering on factory farms occurs mostly in the United States, but that things simply could not be so bad here at home. This is not surprising, as the animal agriculture industry goes to great lengths to hide its cruel and inhumane practices from the public. No member of the public can simply walk into a pig barn to see for themselves the conditions in which the animals are confined. That’s why undercover investigations of farms are the only way to expose the truth.",
  "latent_8241": "\"2011 Miyagi earthquake\" redirects here. For the aftershock that occurred on 7 April, see April 2011 Miyagi earthquake\n\nThe 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku (東北地方太平洋沖地震, Tōhoku-chihō Taiheiyō Oki Jishin) was a magnitude 9.0–9.1 (M w ) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on Friday 11 March 2011,[5][9][10] with the epicentre approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately 29 km (18 mi).[5][11] The earthquake is often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake (東日本大震災, Higashi nihon daishinsai)[12][13][fn 1] and is also known as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake,[28] and the 3.11 earthquake.\n\nIt was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.[10][29][30] The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133 ft) in Miyako in Tōhoku's Iwate Prefecture,[31][32] and which, in the Sendai area, traveled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland.[33]\n\nThe earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east, shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in),[34][35][36] increased earth's rotational speed by 1.8 µs per day,[37] and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting GOCE satellite.[38] Initially, the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre, but after about three years, the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed its original height.[39][40][41][42]\n\nThe tsunami swept the Japanese mainland and killed over ten thousand people, mainly through drowning, though blunt trauma also caused many deaths. The latest report from the Japanese National Police Agency report confirms 15,896 deaths,[43] 6,157 injured,[44] and 2,537 people missing[45] across twenty prefectures, and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation.[46]\n\nA report by the National Police Agency of Japan on 10 September 2018 listed 121,778 buildings as \"total collapsed\", with a further 280,926 buildings \"half collapsed\", and another 699,180 buildings \"partially damaged\".[47] The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse.[33][48] Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, \"In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan.\"[49] Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.[50]\n\nThe tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents.[51][52] Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen gas that had built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure resulting from the loss of electrical power. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.\n\nEarly estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion.[53] The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions.[54] The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history.[55][56]\n\nEarthquake\n\nA seismogram recorded in Massachusetts , USA\n\nThe 9.1-magnitude (M w ) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (20 mi),[5][57] with its epicenter approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes.[6][5] The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 M w by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8 M w , then to 8.9 M w ,[58] and then finally to 9.0 M w .[9] On 11 July 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1. Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, 130 km (81 mi) from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred 373 km (232 mi) from Tokyo.[5]\n\nThe main earthquake was preceded by a number of large foreshocks, with hundreds of aftershocks reported. One of the first major foreshocks was a 7.2 M w event on 9 March, approximately 40 km (25 mi) from the epicenter of 11 March earthquake, with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0 M w .[5][60] Following the main earthquake on 11 March, a 7.4 M w aftershock was reported at 15:08 JST (6:06 UTC), succeeded by a 7.9 M w at 15:15 JST (6:16 UTC) and a 7.7 M w at 15:26 JST (6:26 UTC).[61] Over eight hundred aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 M w or greater have occurred since the initial quake,[62] including one on 26 October 2013 (local time) of magnitude 7.1 M w .[63] Aftershocks follow Omori's law, which states that the rate of aftershocks declines with the reciprocal of the time since the main quake. The aftershocks will thus taper off in time, but could continue for years.[64]\n\nGeology\n\nTōhoku earthquake and aftershocks from 11 to 14 March\n\nHypocentral region boundaries (Source: The Japanese Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion)\n\nThis megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4 M w , which also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain.[65][66] Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed.[67] In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of M w 8.1–8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years.[68]\n\nThis earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu.[35][69] The Pacific plate, which moves at a rate of 8 to 9 cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) per year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate, building large amounts of elastic energy. This motion pushes the upper plate down until the accumulated stress causes a seismic slip-rupture event. The break caused the sea floor to rise by several metres.[69] A quake of this magnitude usually has a rupture length of at least 500 km (310 mi) and generally requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone in the area of the Honshu rupture is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of its earthquake to exceed 8.5 M w ; the magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists.[70] The hypocentral region of this earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki Prefecture.[71] The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500 km (310 mi) and a width of 200 km (120 mi).[72][73] Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events.[74] Other major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and in 1933.\n\nThe source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5–0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260–880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.[75]\n\nMost of the foreshocks are interplate earthquakes with thrust-type focal mechanisms. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes appeared in the aftershocks offshore Sanriku coast with considerable proportions.[76]\n\nThe strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture.[77] Three other prefectures—Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi—recorded an upper 6 on the JMA scale. Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a lower 6, recording an upper 5 in Tokyo.\n\nIn Russia, the main shock could be felt in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (MSK 4) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). The aftershock at 06:25 UTC could be felt in Yuzhno-Kurilsk (MSK 5) and Kurilsk (MSK 4).[78]\n\nEnergy\n\nThe surface energy of the seismic waves from the earthquake was calculated to be at 1.9×1017 joules,[79] which is nearly double that of the 9.1 M w 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people. If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year.[64] The seismic moment (M 0 ), which represents a physical size for the event, was calculated by the USGS at 3.9×1022 joules,[80] slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake.\n\nJapan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of 2.99 g (29.33 m/s2).[81][fn 2] The largest individual recording in Japan was 2.7 g, in Miyagi Prefecture, 75 km from the epicentre; the highest reading in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 0.16 g.[84]\n\nGeophysical effects\n\nPortions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) closer to North America,[34][35] making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before.[35] Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts.[35] A 400-kilometre (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 metres (2 ft 0 in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land.[35] One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 metres (66 ft),[85] and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft).[86] On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 metres (79 ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by 3 metres (9.8 ft).[87] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 metres (160 ft) east-southeast and rose about 7 metres (23 ft) as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.[88]\n\nThe Earth's axis shifted by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in).[34][35][36] This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day, the tilt of the Earth, and the Chandler wobble.[36] The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass.[89] The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Because of conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation.[90] These are expected changes[36] for an earthquake of this magnitude.[34][89] The earthquake also generated infrasound waves detected by perturbations in the orbit of the GOCE satellite, which thus serendipitously became the first seismograph in orbit.[38]\n\nSoil liquefaction was evident in areas of reclaimed land around Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu,[91][92] Chiba City, Funabashi, Narashino (all in Chiba Prefecture) and in the Koto, Edogawa, Minato, Chūō, and Ōta Wards of Tokyo. Approximately 30 homes or buildings were destroyed and 1,046 other buildings were damaged to varying degrees.[93] Nearby Haneda Airport, built mostly on reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced liquefaction, but damage was minimal.[94]\n\nShinmoedake, a volcano in Kyushu, erupted three days after the earthquake. The volcano had previously erupted in January 2011; it is not known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake.[95] In Antarctica, the seismic waves from the earthquake were reported to have caused the Whillans Ice Stream to slip by about 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in).[96]\n\nThe first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth's rotation came from the United States Geological Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost 4 m (13 ft). This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet. Calculations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory determined that the Earth's rotation was changed by the earthquake to the point where the days are now 1.8 microseconds shorter.[97]\n\nAftershocks\n\nJapan experienced over 1,000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 M w and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 M w .\n\nA magnitude 7.4 M w at 15:08 (JST), 7.9 M w at 15:15 and a 7.7 M w quake at 15:26 all occurred on 11 March.[98]\n\nA month later, a major aftershock struck offshore on 7 April with a magnitude of 7.1 M w . Its epicenter was underwater, 66 km (41 mi) off the coast of Sendai. The Japan Meteorological Agency assigned a magnitude of 7.4 M JMA , while the U.S. Geological Survey lowered it to 7.1 M w .[99] At least four people were killed, and electricity was cut off across much of northern Japan including the loss of external power to Higashidōri Nuclear Power Plant and Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.[100][101][102]\n\nFour days later on 11 April, another magnitude 7.1 M w aftershock struck Fukushima, causing additional damage and killing a total of three people.[103][104]\n\nOn 7 December 2012 a large aftershock of magnitude 7.3 M w caused a minor tsunami, and again on 26 October 2013 small tsunami waves were recorded after a 7.1 M w aftershock.[105]\n\nAs of 16 March 2012 aftershocks continued, totaling 1887 events over magnitude 4.0; a regularly updated map showing all shocks of magnitude 4.5 and above near or off the east coast of Honshu in the last seven days[106] showed over 20 events.[107]\n\nAs of 11 March 2016 there had been 869 aftershocks of 5.0 M w or greater, 118 of 6.0 M w or greater, and 9 over 7.0 M w as reported by the Japanese Meteorological Agency.[108]\n\nThe number of aftershocks was associated with decreased health across Japan.[109]\n\nEarthquake Warning System\n\nOne minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives.[110][111] The warning for the general public was delivered about 8 seconds after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern Tōhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger. According to the JMA Meteorological Research Institute [ja], reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship.[112][113][114]\n\nThere were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. Such discrepancies in the warning were attributed by the JMA to the system's inability to distinguish between two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, as well as to the reduced number of reporting seismometers due to power outages and connection fails.[115] The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this kind of situation.[116]\n\nTsunami\n\nAn upthrust of 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26 ft) along a 180 kilometres (110 mi) wide seabed at 60 kilometres (37 mi) offshore from the east coast of Tōhoku[117] resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands. Thousands of lives were lost and entire towns were devastated. The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile. Warnings were issued and evacuations were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific. Although the tsunami affected many of these places, the heights of the waves were minor.[118][119][120] Chile's Pacific coast, one of the furthest from Japan at about 17,000 kilometres (11,000 mi) away, was struck by waves 2 metres (6.6 ft) high,[121][122][123] compared with an estimated wave height of 38.9 metres (128 ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan.[32]\n\nJapan\n\nThe tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it was rated as a \"major tsunami\", being at least 3 metres (9.8 ft) high.[124] The actual height prediction varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at 6 metres (20 ft) high.[125] The tsunami inundated a total area of approximately 561 square kilometres (217 sq mi) in Japan.[126]\n\nWater column height on 11 March 2011 at DART Station, 690 NM southeast of Tokyo\n\nThe earthquake took place at 14:46 JST (UTC 05:46) around 67 kilometres (42 mi) from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30 minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography of the coastline.[127][128] Just over an hour after the earthquake at 15:55 JST, a tsunami was observed flooding Sendai Airport, which is located near the coast of Miyagi Prefecture,[129][130] with waves sweeping away cars and planes and flooding various buildings as they traveled inland.[131][132] The impact of the tsunami in and around Sendai Airport was filmed by an NHK News helicopter, showing a number of vehicles on local roads trying to escape the approaching wave and being engulfed by it.[133] A 4-metre-high (13 ft) tsunami hit Iwate Prefecture.[134] Wakabayashi Ward in Sendai was also particularly hard hit.[135] At least 101 designated tsunami evacuation sites were hit by the wave.[136]\n\nThe city of Rikuzentakata Iwate Prefecture , suffered extensive damage from the tsunami, with almost the entirety of the lower area of the city being destroyed.\n\nLike the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the damage by surging water, though much more localized, was far more deadly and destructive than the actual quake. Entire towns were destroyed in tsunami-hit areas in Japan, including 9,500 missing in Minamisanriku;[137] one thousand bodies had been recovered in the town by 14 March 2011.[138]\n\nAmong several factors causing the high death toll from the tsunami, one was the unexpectedly large size of the water surge. The tsunami walls in several of the affected cities had been constructed to protect against tsunamis of much lower heights. Also, many people who were caught in the tsunami thought that they were located on high enough ground to be safe.[139] According to the conclusions of a special committee on disaster prevention, which had been designated by the Japanese government, the tsunami protection policy had been intended to deal with only those tsunamis that had been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly; the committee therefore advised that in the future the policy should be changed to protect against the highest possible tsunami. Because tsunami walls had been overtopped by this tsunami, the committee also suggested that, besides constructing tsunami walls to a height that can protect against relatively frequent tsunamis, it is still necessary to teach citizens who are protected by tsunami walls how to evacuate if a largest scale tsunami should strike those places.[140][141]\n\nLarge parts of Kuji and the southern section of Ōfunato including the port area were almost entirely destroyed.[142][143] Also largely destroyed was Rikuzentakata, where the tsunami was three stories high.[144][145][146] Other cities destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami include Kamaishi, Miyako, Ōtsuchi, and Yamada (in Iwate Prefecture), Namie, Sōma, and Minamisōma (in Fukushima Prefecture) and Shichigahama, Higashimatsushima, Onagawa, Natori, Ishinomaki, and Kesennuma (in Miyagi Prefecture).[147][148][149][150][151][152][153] The most severe effects of the tsunami were felt along a 670-kilometre-long (420 mi) stretch of coastline from Erimo, Hokkaido, in the north to Ōarai, Ibaraki, in the south, with most of the destruction in that area occurring in the hour following the earthquake.[154] Near Ōarai, people captured images of a huge whirlpool that had been generated by the tsunami.[155] The tsunami washed away the sole bridge to Miyatojima, Miyagi, isolating the island's 900 residents.[156] A 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high tsunami hit Chiba Prefecture about 2½ hours after the quake, causing heavy damage to cities such as Asahi.[157]\n\nOn 13 March 2011, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) published details of tsunami observations recorded around the coastline of Japan following the earthquake. These observations included tsunami maximum readings of over 3 metres (9.8 ft) at the following locations and times on 11 March 2011, following the earthquake at 14:46 JST:[158]\n\nPeak tsunami wave height summits, color-coded with red representing most severe\n\n15:12 JST – off Kamaishi – 6.8 metres (22 ft)\n\n15:15 JST – Ōfunato – 3.2 metres (10 ft) or higher\n\n15:20 JST – Ishinomaki-shi Ayukawa – 3.3 metres (11 ft) or higher\n\n15:21 JST – Miyako – 4 metres (13 ft) or higher\n\n15:21 JST – Kamaishi – 4.1 metres (13 ft) or higher\n\n15:44 JST – Erimo-cho Shoya – 3.5 metres (11 ft)\n\n15:50 JST – Sōma – 7.3 metres (24 ft) or higher\n\n16:52 JST – Ōarai – 4.2 metres (14 ft)\n\nMany areas were also affected by waves of 1 to 3 metres (3 ft 3 in to 9 ft 10 in) in height, and the JMA bulletin also included the caveat that \"At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites.\" The timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to 15:21, between 26 and 35 minutes after the earthquake had struck. The bulletin also included initial tsunami observation details, as well as more detailed maps for the coastlines affected by the tsunami waves.[159][160]\n\nJMA also reported offshore tsunami height recorded by telemetry from moored GPS wave-height meter buoys as follows:[161]\n\noffshore of central Iwate (Miyako) – 6.3 metres (21 ft)\n\noffshore of northern Iwate (Kuji) – 6 metres (20 ft)\n\noffshore of northern Miyagi (Kesennuma) – 6 metres (20 ft)\n\nOn 25 March 2011, Port and Airport Research Institute (PARI) reported tsunami height by visiting the port sites as follows:[162]\n\nNOAA animation of the tsunami's propagation\n\nPort of Hachinohe – 5–6 metres (16–20 ft)\n\nPort of Hachinohe area – 8–9 metres (26–30 ft)\n\nPort of Kuji – 8–9 metres (26–30 ft)\n\nPort of Kamaishi – 7–9 metres (23–30 ft)\n\nPort of Ōfunato – 9.5 metres (31 ft)\n\nRun up height, port of Ōfunato area – 24 metres (79 ft)\n\nFishery port of Onagawa – 15 metres (49 ft)\n\nPort of Ishinomaki – 5 metres (16 ft)\n\nShiogama section of Shiogama-Sendai port – 4 metres (13 ft)\n\nSendai section of Shiogama-Sendai port – 8 metres (26 ft)\n\nSendai Airport area – 12 metres (39 ft)\n\nThe tsunami at Ryōri Bay (綾里湾), Ōfunato reached a height of 40.1 metres (132 ft) (run-up elevation). Fishing equipment was scattered on the high cliff above the bay.[163][164] At Tarō, Iwate, the tsunami reached a height of 37.9 metres (124 ft) up the slope of a mountain some 200 metres (660 ft) away from the coastline.[165] Also, at the slope of a nearby mountain from 400 metres (1,300 ft) away at Aneyoshi fishery port (姉吉漁港) of Omoe peninsula (重茂半島) in Miyako, Iwate, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology found estimated tsunami run up height of 38.9 metres (128 ft).[32] This height is deemed the record in Japan historically, as of reporting date, that exceeds 38.2 metres (125 ft) from the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake.[166] It was also estimated that the tsunami reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133 ft) in Miyako in Tōhoku's Iwate Prefecture. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 869 Sanriku tsunami.[167]\n\nA Japanese government study found that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent were caught in the tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water.[168]\n\nDelayed evacuations in response to the warnings had a number of causes. The tsunami height that had been initially predicted by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height; this error contributed to the delayed escape of some residents. The discrepancy arose as follows: In order to produce a quick prediction of a tsunami's height and thus to provide a timely warning, the initial earthquake and tsunami warning that was issued for the event was based on a calculation that requires only about 3 minutes. This calculation is, in turn, based on the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave. The amplitude of the seismic wave is measured using the JMA magnitude scale, which is similar to Richter magnitude scale. However, these scales \"saturate\" for earthquakes that are above a certain magnitude (magnitude 8 on the JMA scale); that is, in the case of very large earthquakes, the scales' values change little despite large differences in the earthquakes' energy. This resulted in an underestimation of the tsunami's height in initial reports. Problems in issuing updates also contributed to delays in evacuations. The warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after the earthquake occurred, by which time the calculation for the moment magnitude scale would normally be completed. However, the strong quake had exceeded the measurement limit of all of the teleseismometers within Japan, and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those seismometers. Another cause of delayed evacuations was the release of the second update on the tsunami warning long after the earthquake (28 minutes, according to observations); by that time, power failures and similar circumstances reportedly prevented the update from reaching some residents. Also, observed data from tidal meters that were located off the coast were not fully reflected in the second warning. Furthermore, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters reported a fluctuation of \"20 centimetres (7.9 in)\", and this value was broadcast throughout the mass media and the warning system, which caused some residents to underestimate the danger of their situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.[169][170]\n\nIn response to the aforementioned shortcomings in the tsunami warning system, JMA began an investigation in 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for a powerful earthquake that is capable of causing the JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning; instead, there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. There are plans to install new teleseismometers with the ability to measure larger earthquakes, which would allow the calculation of a quake's moment magnitude scale in a timely manner. JMA also implemented a simpler empirical method to integrate, into a tsunami warning, data from GPS tidal meters as well as from undersea water pressure meters, and there are plans to install more of these meters and to develop further technology to utilize data observed by them. To prevent under-reporting of tsunami heights, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than the expected amplitude will be overridden and the public will instead be told that the situation is under observation. About 90 seconds after an earthquake, an additional report on the possibility of a tsunami will also be included in observation reports, in order to warn people before the JMA magnitude can be calculated.[169][170]\n\nElsewhere across the Pacific\n\nShortly after the earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific. At 07:30 UTC, PTWC issued a widespread tsunami warning covering the entire Pacific Ocean.[171][172] Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands.[173] The United States National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas in most of California, all of Oregon, and the western part of Alaska, and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia, Canada.[174][175] In California and Oregon, up to 2.4-metre-high (7.9 ft) tsunami surges hit some areas, damaging docks and harbors and causing over US$10 million in damage.[176] In Curry County, Oregon $7 million in damage occurred including the destruction of 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) of docks at the Brookings harbor; the county has received over $1 million in FEMA emergency grants.[177] Surges of up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) hit Vancouver Island in Canada[175][not in citation given] prompting some evacuations, and causing boats to be banned from the waters surrounding the island for 12 hours following the wave strike, leaving many island residents in the area without means of getting to work.[178][179]\n\nFishing boats that were moved to higher ground in anticipation of tsunami arrival, in Pichilemu , Chile\n\nIn the Philippines, waves up to 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in) high hit the eastern seaboard of the country. Some houses along the coast in Jayapura, Indonesia were destroyed.[180] Authorities in Wewak, East Sepik, Papua New Guinea evacuated 100 patients from the city's Boram Hospital before it was hit by the waves, causing an estimated US$4 million in damage.[181] Hawaii estimated damage to public infrastructure alone at US$3 million, with damage to private properties, including resort hotels such as Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, estimated at tens of millions of dollars.[182] It was reported that a 1.5-metre-high (4.9 ft) wave completely submerged Midway Atoll's reef inlets and Spit Island, killing more than 110,000 nesting seabirds at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.[183] Some other South Pacific countries, including Tonga and New Zealand, and U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam, experienced larger-than-normal waves, but did not report any major damage.[184] However, in Guam some roads were closed off and people were evacuated from low-lying areas.[185]\n\nAlong the Pacific Coast of Mexico and South America, tsunami surges were reported, but in most places caused little or no damage.[186] Peru reported a wave of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) and more than 300 homes damaged.[186] The surge in Chile was large enough to damage more than 200 houses,[187] with waves of up to 3 metres (9.8 ft).[188][189] In the Galápagos Islands, 260 families received assistance following a 3 metres (9.8 ft) surge which arrived 20 hours after the earthquake, after the tsunami warning had been lifted.[190][191] There was a great deal of damage to buildings on the islands and one man was injured but there were no reported fatalities.[190][192]\n\nAfter a 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high surge hit Chile, it was reported that the reflection from those surges traveled back across the Pacific, causing 30–60 centimetres (12–24 in) surge in Japan, 47–48 hours after the earthquake, according to observation from multiple tide station [ja], including in Onahama, Owase, and Kushimoto.[193][194]\n\nThe tsunami broke icebergs off the Sulzberger Ice Shelf in Antarctica, 13,000 kilometres (8,100 mi) away. The main iceberg measured 9.5 by 6.5 kilometres (5.9 mi × 4.0 mi) (approximately the area of Manhattan Island) and about 80 metres (260 ft) thick. A total of 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi; 31,000 acres) of ice broke away.[195][196]\n\nAs of April 2012, wreckage from the tsunami spread around the world, including a soccer ball which was found in Alaska[197] and a Japanese motorcycle found in British Columbia, Canada.[198]\n\nLand subsidence\n\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported land subsidence based on the height of triangulation stations in the area measured by GPS as compared to their previous values from 14 April 2011.[199]\n\nScientists say that the subsidence is permanent. As a result, the communities in question are now more susceptible to flooding during high tides.[201]\n\nCasualties\n\nJapan\n\nMemorials amongst the ruins, Natori\n\nIn Japan, the National Police Agency has confirmed 15,896 deaths,[202] 6,157 injured,[203] and 2,537 people missing[204] across twenty prefectures.[47] In addition, some three thousands extra deaths have been identified as \"earthquake-related deaths\",[205][206] bringing the total number of deaths caused by the disaster to 19,575 as of 2017 September.[207]\n\nOf the 13,135 fatalities recovered by 11 April 2011, 12,143 or 92.5% died by drowning. Victims aged 60 or older accounted for 65.2% of the deaths, with 24% of total victims being in their 70s.[208] As of March 2012, Japanese police data showed that 70% of the 3,279 still missing were aged 60 or over, all found, including 893 in their 70s and 577 in their 80s. Of the total confirmed victims, 14,308 drowned, 667 were crushed to death or died from internal injuries, and 145 perished from burns.[209]\n\nTsunami damage between Sendai and Sendai Bay\n\n\"Earthquake-related death\" is defined as cases where the earthquake did not directly kill those people, however it act as a contributory factor that indirectly caused their death, for the purpose of relief fund distribution. Some of the most widely reported reason for these deaths include \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by life in temporary shelter\", \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by evacuation\", \"Delayed treatment due to the inoperative of hospital\", \"Physical and mental fatigue caused by stress from the earthquake and tsunami\". A few cases of suicide are also included. Most of these deaths occurred during the first six months after the earthquake and the number dropped thereafter, but as time has passed, the number has continued to increase. Most of these deaths occurred in Fukushima prefecture, where the prefecture government has suggested that they could be due to evacuations caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[210] These indirect casualties have already resulted in more deaths than the number of people killed directly by earthquake and tsunami within the Fukushima prefecture.[211][212][213][214]\n\nSave the Children reports that as many as 100,000 children were uprooted from their homes, some of whom were separated from their families because the earthquake occurred during the school day.[215] 236 children were orphaned in the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima by the disaster;[216][217] 1,580 children lost either one or both parents,[218] 846 in Miyagi, 572 in Iwate, and 162 in Fukushima.[219] The quake and tsunami killed 378 elementary, middle-school, and high school students and left 158 others missing.[220] One elementary school in Ishinomaki, Miyagi, Okawa Elementary, lost 74 of 108 students and 10 of 13 teachers and staff.[221][222][223]\n\nThe Japanese Foreign Ministry has confirmed the deaths of nineteen foreigners.[224] Among them are two English teachers from the United States affiliated with the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program;[225] a Canadian missionary in Shiogama;[226] and citizens of China, North and South Korea, Taiwan, Pakistan and the Philippines.\n\nBy 9:30 UTC on 11 March, Google Person Finder, which was previously used in the Haitian, Chilean, and Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes, was collecting information about survivors and their locations.[227][228]\n\nJapanese funerals are normally elaborate Buddhist ceremonies that entail cremation. The thousands of bodies, however, exceeded the capacity of available crematoriums and morgues, many of them damaged,[229][230] and there were shortages of both kerosene—each cremation requires 50 litres—and dry ice for preservation.[231] The single crematorium in Higashimatsushima, for example, could only handle four bodies a day, although hundreds were found there.[232] Governments and the military were forced to bury many bodies in hastily dug mass graves with rudimentary or no rites, although relatives of the deceased were promised that they would be cremated later.[233]\n\nNoted individual fatalities within Japan included 104-year-old Takashi Shimokawara, holder of the world athletics records in the men's shot put, discus throw and javelin throw for the over-100s age category. He was killed by the earthquake and tsunami at Kamaishi, Iwate.[234]\n\nAs of 27 May 2011, three Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members had died while conducting relief operations in Tōhoku.[235] As of March 2012, the Japanese government had recognized 1,331 deaths as indirectly related to the earthquake, such as caused by harsh living conditions after the disaster.[236] As of 30 April 2012, 18 people had died and 420 had been injured while participating in disaster recovery or clean-up efforts.[237]\n\nOverseas\n\nThe tsunami is reported to have caused several deaths outside Japan. One man was killed in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia after being swept out to sea.[238] A man who is said to have been attempting to photograph the oncoming tsunami at the mouth of the Klamath River, south of Crescent City, California, was swept out to sea.[239] His body was found on 2 April along Ocean Beach in Fort Stevens State Park, Oregon, 330 miles (530 km) to the north.[240]\n\nDamage and effects\n\nPanorama of the Hirota Peninsula in Rikuzentakata swept away\n\nAerial photo of Minato, devastated by both the earthquake and subsequent tsunami\n\nThe degree and extent of damage caused by the earthquake and resulting tsunami were enormous, with most of the damage being caused by the tsunami. Video footage of the towns that were worst affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing.[241] Estimates of the cost of the damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many regions.[242][243] Although Japan has invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which line at least 40% of its 34,751 km (21,593 mi) coastline and stand up to 12 m (39 ft) high, the tsunami simply washed over the top of some seawalls, collapsing some in the process.[244]\n\nA fire which broke out in Tokyo after the earthquake\n\nJapan's National Police Agency said on 3 April 2011, that 45,700 buildings were destroyed and 144,300 were damaged by the quake and tsunami. The damaged buildings included 29,500 structures in Miyagi Prefecture, 12,500 in Iwate Prefecture and 2,400 in Fukushima Prefecture.[245] Three hundred hospitals with 20 beds or more in Tōhoku were damaged by the disaster, with 11 being completely destroyed.[246] The earthquake and tsunami created an estimated 24–25 million tons of rubble and debris in Japan.[247][248]\n\nAn estimated 230,000 automobiles and trucks were damaged or destroyed in the disaster. As of the end of May 2011, residents of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures had requested deregistration of 15,000 vehicles, meaning that the owners of those vehicles were writing them off as unrepairable or unsalvageable.[249]\n\nPorts\n\nShip and crane damage at Sendai port\n\nAll of Japan's ports were briefly shut down after the earthquake, though the ones in Tokyo and southwards soon re-opened. Fifteen ports were located in the disaster zone. The north eastern ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were destroyed, while the Port of Chiba (which serves the hydrocarbon industry) and Japan's ninth-largest container port at Kashima were also affected, though less severely. The ports at Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma, Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako were also damaged and closed to ships.[250] All 15 ports reopened to limited ship traffic by 29 March 2011.[251] A total of 319 fishing ports, about 10% of Japan's fishing ports, were damaged in the disaster.[252] Most were restored to operating condition by 18 April 2012.[253]\n\nThe Port of Tokyo suffered slight damage; the effects of the quake included visible smoke rising from a building in the port with parts of the port areas being flooded, including soil liquefaction in Tokyo Disneyland's parking lot.[254][255]\n\nDams and water problems\n\nDam failure at Fujinuma\n\nThe Fujinuma irrigation dam in Sukagawa ruptured,[256] causing flooding and the washing away of five homes.[257] Eight people were missing and four bodies were discovered by the morning.[258][259][260] Reportedly, some locals had attempted to repair leaks in the dam before it completely failed.[261] On 12 March 252 dams were inspected and it was discovered that six embankment dams had shallow cracks on their crests. The reservoir at one concrete gravity dam suffered a small non-serious slope failure. All damaged dams are functioning with no problems. Four dams within the quake area were unreachable. When the roads clear, experts will be dispatched to conduct further investigations.[262]\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the calamity, at least 1.5 million households were reported to have lost access to water supplies.[50][263] By 21 March 2011, this number fell to 1.04 million.[264]\n\nElectricity\n\nGeographic divide between 50 hertz systems and 60 hertz systems in Japan's electricity distribution network\n\nAccording to the Japanese trade ministry, around 4.4 million households served by Tōhoku Electric Power (TEP) in northeastern Japan were left without electricity.[265] Several nuclear and conventional power plants went offline after the earthquake, reducing the Tokyo Electric Power Company's (TEPCO) total capacity by 21 GW.[266] Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake.[267] TEPCO, which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it could only provide about 30 GW. This was because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area was supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures.[268] The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and sustained major damage related to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution. The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures.[269] Voluntary reduced electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts.[270] By 21 March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to 242,927.[264]\n\nDamage to electricity transmission lines\n\nTōhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with additional power, because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco) cannot share electricity, because its system operates at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; this is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national power grid.[271] Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and Tōhoku, but their capacity to do so is limited to 1 GW. With the damage to so many power plants, it may be years before a long-term solution can be found.[272]\n\nIn an effort to help alleviate the shortage, three steel manufacturers in the Kanto region contributed electricity produced by their in-house conventional power stations to TEPCO for distribution to the general public. Sumitomo Metal Industries could produce up to 500 MW, JFE Steel 400 MW, and Nippon Steel 500 MW of electric power[273] Auto and auto parts makers in Kanto and Tōhoku agreed in May 2011 to operate their factories on Saturdays and Sundays and close on Thursdays and Fridays to assist in alleviating the electricity shortage during the summer of 2011.[274] Additionally, the public and other companies were also encouraged to conserve electricity in the 2011 summer months (Setsuden).[275]\n\nThe expected electricity crisis in 2011 summer have been successfully prevented thanks to all the setsuden measures, peak electricity consumption recorded by TEPCO during the period was 49.22GW, which is 10.77GW (18%) lower than the peak consumption in the previous year. The overall electricity consumption during the entire July and August was also 14% less than the previous year.[276] The peak electricity consumption within TEP's area was 12.46GW during the 2011 summer, 3.11GW (20%) less than the peak consumption in the previous year, and the overall consumption have been reduced by 11% in July with 17% in August compared to previous year.[277][278][279] Japanese government continue to ask the public to conserve electricity for several years until year 2016, when it predicted that the supply will be sufficient to meet demand, thanks to the deepening of the mindset to conserve electricity among corporate and general public, addition of new electricity providers due to the electricity liberalization policy, increased output from renewable energy as well as fossil fuel power stations, as well as sharing of electricity between different electricity companies.[280][281][282]\n\nOil, gas and coal\n\nFire at the Cosmo Oil refinery in Ichihara\n\nA 220,000-barrel (35,000 m3)-per-day[283] oil refinery of Cosmo Oil Company was set on fire by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, to the east of Tokyo.[284][285] It was extinguished after ten days, injuring six people, and destroying storage tanks.[286] Others halted production due to safety checks and power loss.[287][288] In Sendai, a 145,000-barrel (23,100 m3)-per-day refinery owned by the largest refiner in Japan, JX Nippon Oil & Energy, was also set ablaze by the quake.[283] Workers were evacuated,[289] but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so.[283]\n\nAn analyst estimates that consumption of various types of oil may increase by as much as 300,000 barrels (48,000 m3) per day (as well as LNG), as back-up power plants burning fossil fuels try to compensate for the loss of 11 GW of Japan's nuclear power capacity.[290][291]\n\nThe city-owned plant for importing liquefied natural gas in Sendai was severely damaged, and supplies were halted for at least a month.[292]\n\nIn addition to refining and storage, several power plants were damaged. These include Sendai #4, New-Sendai #1 and #2, Haranomachi #1 and #2, Hirono #2 and #4 and Hitachinaka #1.[293]\n\nNuclear power plants\n\nThe Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tōkai nuclear power stations, consisting of a total eleven reactors, were automatically shut down following the earthquake.[294] Higashidōri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection. Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools. The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant.[295] At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis.[296] Over 200,000 people were evacuated.[297]\n\n7 April aftershock caused the loss of external power to Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant and Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant but backup generators were functional. Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power lines and temporarily lost cooling function in its spent fuel pools for \"20 to 80 minutes\". A spill of \"up to 3.8 litres\" of radioactive water also occurred at Onagawa following the aftershock.[298]\n\nA report by the IAEA in 2012 found that the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, the closest nuclear plant to the epicenter of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, had remained largely undamaged. The plant's 3 reactors automatically shut down without damage and all safety systems functioned as designed. The plant's 14-metre-high (46 ft) seawall successfully withstood the tsunami.[299]\n\nEurope's Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger addressed the European Parliament on 15 March, explaining that the nuclear disaster was an \"apocalypse\".[300] As the nuclear crisis entered a second month, experts recognized that Fukushima Daiichi is not the worst nuclear accident ever, but it is the most complicated. Nuclear experts stated that Fukushima will go down in history as the second-worst nuclear accident ever. While it was not as bad as the Chernobyl disaster, it was worse than the Three Mile Island accident. It could take months or years to learn how damaging the release of dangerous isotopes has been to human health and food supplies, and the surrounding countryside.[301]\n\nLater analysis indicated three reactors at Fukushima I (Units 1, 2, and 3) had suffered meltdowns and continued to leak coolant water,[51] and by summer the Vice-minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, had lost their jobs.[302]\n\nAs of 2013, only two nuclear reactors in Japan have been restarted.[303]\n\nFukushima meltdowns\n\nLoose livestock roam the evacuation zone\n\nJapan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents.[304][305][306] Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal levels,[307] and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to 8 times normal levels.[308] Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant about 11 km (6.8 mi) south.[309] This brought the total number of problematic reactors to six.[310]\n\nIt was reported that radioactive iodine was detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, and Niigata, and radioactive caesium in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma.[311][312][313] Radioactive caesium, iodine, and strontium[314] were also detected in the soil in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated soil.[315] Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone, including Tokyo.[316] Food products were also found contaminated by radioactive matter in several places in Japan.[317] On 5 April 2011, the government of the Ibaraki Prefecture banned the fishing of sand lance after discovering that this species was contaminated by radioactive caesium above legal limits.[318] As late as July 2013 slightly elevated levels of radioactivity were found in beef on sale at Tokyo markets.[319]\n\nIncidents elsewhere\n\nA fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake.[295][320] The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor,[304] and was soon extinguished.[321] The plant was shut down as a precaution.[322]\n\nOn 13 March the lowest-level state of emergency was declared regarding the Onagawa plant as radioactivity readings temporarily[323] exceeded allowed levels in the area of the plant.[324][325] Tōhoku Electric Power Co. stated this may have been due to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accidents but was not from the Onagawa plant itself.[326]\n\nAs a result of 7 April aftershock, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power lines and lost cooling function for as much as 80 minutes. A spill of a couple of litres of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa.[298]\n\nThe number 2 reactor at Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically.[294] On 14 March it was reported that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working;[327] however, the Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump sustaining the cooling systems, but that two of three diesel generators used to power the cooling system were out of order.[328]\n\nWind power\n\nNone of Japan's commercial wind turbines, totaling over 2300 MW in nameplate capacity, failed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, including the Kamisu offshore wind farm directly hit by the tsunami.[329]\n\nTransport\n\nA highway bridge damaged and severed\n\nJapan's transport network suffered severe disruptions. Many sections of Tōhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged. The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011.[330][331] All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city.[332] In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed.[333] Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day—12 March.[334] Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11–12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland.[335]\n\nA tsunami wave flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST,[129] about 1 hour after the initial quake, causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly suspended operations after the quake, but suffered little damage and reopened within 24 hours.[255] Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.[336][337]\n\nVarious train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East suspending all services for the rest of the day.[338] Four trains on coastal lines were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued shortly after 8 am the next morning.[339] Minami-Kesennuma Station on the Kesennuma Line was obliterated save for its platform;[340] 62 of 70 (31 of 35) JR East train lines suffered damage to some degree;[251] in the worst-hit areas, 23 stations on 7 lines were washed away, with damage or loss of track in 680 locations and the 30-km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant unable to be assessed.[341]\n\nThere were no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended.[255] The Tōkaidō Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the Jōetsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March.[342]\n\nDerailments were minimized because of an early warning system that detected the earthquake before it struck. The system automatically stopped all high-speed trains, which minimized the damage.[343]\n\nThe Tōhoku Shinkansen line was worst hit, with JR East estimating that 1,100 sections of the line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons, will need repairs. Services on the Tōhoku Shinkansen partially resumed only in Kantō area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara,[344] and Tōhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March between Morioka and Shin-Aomori.[345] Services on Akita Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 18 March.[346] Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the pre-earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September.[347]\n\nThe rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20 minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5 minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sōbu Main Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line were all stopped for the day.[348] This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nDamaged utility pole in Ishinomaki\n\nCellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area.[349] Immediately after the earthquake cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity. On the day of the quake, American broadcaster NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with working phone or Internet.[350] Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to reroute around affected segments onto redundant links.[351][352] Within Japan, only a few websites were initially unreachable.[353] Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks,[353] and some American telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon,[354] T-Mobile[355] and VoIP companies such as netTALK[356] and Vonage[357] have offered free calls to (and in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche Telekom.[358]\n\nDefense\n\nMatsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defense Force in Miyagi Prefecture was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base and resulting in damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training Squadron.[359][360][361] 12 of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining 6 were slated for repair at a cost of 80 billion yen ($1 billion), exceeding the original cost of the aircraft.[362]\n\nSpace center\n\nJAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) evacuated the Tsukuba Space Center in Tsukuba, Ibaraki. The Center, which houses a control room for part of the International Space Station, was shut down and some damage was reported.[363][364] The Tsukuba control center resumed full operations for the space station's Kibo laboratory and the HTV cargo craft on 21 March 2011.[365]\n\nCultural properties\n\n754 cultural properties were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures (at Zuigan-ji, Ōsaki Hachiman-gū, Shiramizu Amidadō, and Seihaku-ji); 160 Important Cultural Properties (including at Sendai Tōshō-gū, the Kōdōkan, and Entsū-in, with its western decorative motifs); one hundred and forty-four Monuments of Japan (including Matsushima, Takata-matsubara, Yūbikan, and the Site of Tagajō); six Groups of Traditional Buildings; and four Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties. Stone monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage Site: Shrines and Temples of Nikkō were toppled.[366][367][368] In Tokyo, there was damage to Koishikawa Kōrakuen, Rikugien, Hamarikyū Onshi Teien, and the walls of Edo Castle.[369] Information on the condition of collections held by museums, libraries and archives is still incomplete.[370] There was no damage to the Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi in Iwate Prefecture, and the recommendation for their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in June was seized upon as a symbol of international recognition and recovery.[371]\n\nAftermath\n\nRescue operations in the floodwaters in downtown Ishinomaki\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included both a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the Tōhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force – Tōhoku, led by Lieutenant General Eiji Kimizuka), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1 billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¥10 trillion ($122 billion). In comparison to the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range.[372]\n\nThe aftermath of the twin disasters also left Japan's coastal cities and towns with nearly 25 million tons of debris. In Ishinomaki alone, there were 17 trash collection sites 180 metres (590 ft) long and at least 4.5 metres (15 ft) high. An official in the city's government trash disposal department estimated that it would take three years to empty these sites.[373]\n\nIn April 2015, authorities off the coast of Oregon discovered debris that is thought to be from a boat destroyed during the tsunami. Cargo contained yellowtail jack fish, a species that lives off the coast of Japan, still alive. KGW estimates that more than 1 million tons of debris still remain in the Pacific Ocean.[374]\n\nHumanitarian response\n\nHungary Japanese students collecting funds for the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami at the University of Pécs\n\nEmergency vehicles staging in the ruins of Otsuchi , Japan following the tsunami\n\nAccording to Japan's foreign ministry, 116 countries and 28 international organizations offered assistance. Japan specifically requested assistance from teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States.[375]\n\nMedia coverage\n\nAnti-nuclear protest following the disaster\n\nJapan's national public broadcaster, NHK, and Japan Satellite Television suspended their usual programming to provide ongoing coverage of the situation.[376] Other nationwide Japanese and international TV networks also broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the disaster. Ustream Asia broadcast live feeds of NHK, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Nippon TV, Fuji TV, TV Asahi, TV Tokyo, Tokyo MX, TV Kanagawa, and CNN on the Internet starting on 12 March 2011.[377] YokosoNews, an Internet webcast in Japan, dedicated its broadcast to the latest news gathered from Japanese news stations, translating them in real time to English.[378]\n\nIt was noted that the Japanese news media has been at times overly cautious to avoid panic and reliance on confusing statements by experts and officials.[379]\n\nIn this national crisis, the Japanese government provided Japanese Sign Language (JSL) interpreting at the press conferences related to the earthquake and tsunami.[380] Television broadcasts of the press conferences of Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano included simultaneous JSL interpreters standing next to the Japanese flag on the same platform.[381]\n\nAccording to Jake Adelstein, most Japanese media accepted and parroted the misinformation put out by the Japanese government and TEPCO about the unfolding Fukushima nuclear crisis. Notable exceptions, according to Adelstein, were newspapers Sankei Shimbun and Chunichi Shimbun which questioned the accuracy of the information coming from the government and TEPCO. Because of the unquestioning nature of most Japanese media to hold to the \"party line\", many Japanese mid-level officials and experts spoke to foreign media to get their opinions and observations publicized.[382]\n\nAtsushi Funahashi, director of Nuclear Nation notes that \"when the overseas media was calling Fukushima a 'meltdown,' the Japanese government and media waited two months before admitting it.\"[383]\n\nNine days after the earthquake hit, a visualization and sonification were uploaded to YouTube allowing listeners to hear the earthquake as it unfolded in time. Two days of seismic activity made available by the IRIS Consortium were compressed into two minutes of sound. The large number of views made the video one of the most popular examples of sonification on the web.[384]\n\nAlso, following the earthquake, for the first time in Japanese history, the Emperor addressed the nation in a pre-recorded television broadcast.[385][386]\n\nScientific and research response\n\nSeismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake — in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo.[387][388] The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called Tokai earthquake, predicted to take place in that region.[389] However, occurring as it did 373 km (232 mi) north east of Tokyo, the Tōhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists. While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude.[388][389] The Headquarters For Earthquake Research Promotion setup by Japanese government have then reassessed the long term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that, combining with researches on 869 Sanriku earthquake, an earthquake similar to this one (with a magnitude of M w 8.4–9.0) would take place in the area between off the coast of Pacific side of the Northeast Japan in an average of every 600 years intervals (See also Seismicity of the Sanriku coast), and it is also assessed that a tsunami-earthquake with a tsunami magnitude scales (Mt) between 8.6 and 9.0 (Similar to 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Mt for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake is 9.1–9.4) will have a 30% chance to occur within 30 years.[390][391]\n\nThe quake gave scientists the opportunity to collect a large amount of data so as to model in great detail the seismic events that took place.[34] This data is expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing as it does unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects.[392] Gravimetric data from the quake has been used to create a model for increased warning time compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves.[393]\n\nResearchers have also analysed the economic effects of this earthquake and have developed models of the nationwide propagation via interfirm supply networks of the shock originated in Tōhoku region.[394][395]\n\nResearchers soon after the full extent of the disaster was known launched a project to gather all digital material relating to the disaster into an online searchable archive to form the basis of future research into the events during and after the disaster. The Japan Digital Archive is presented in English and Japanese and is hosted at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Some of the first research to come from the archive was a 2014 paper from the Digital Methods Initiative in Amsterdam about patterns of Twitter usage around the time of the disaster.\n\nAfter the 2011 disaster the UNISDR, United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, held its World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Tohoku in March 2015, which produced the Sendai Framework document to guide efforts by international development agencies to act before disasters instead of reacting to them after the fact. At this time Japan's Disaster Management Office (Naikakufu Bosai Keikaku) published a bi-lingual guide in Japanese and English, Disaster Management in Japan, to outline the several varieties of natural disaster and the preparations being made for the eventuality of each. In the fall of 2016 Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED; Japanese abbreviation, Bosai Kaken; full name Bousai Kagaku Gijutsu Kenkyusho) launched the online interactive \"Disaster Chronology Map for Japan, 416–2013\" (map labels in Japanese) to display in visual form the location, disaster time, and date across the islands.\n\nAn expedition named Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project have been conducted in year 2012–2013 to drill oceanfloor boreholes through the fault-zone of the earthquake and gathered important data about the rupture mechanism and physical properties of the fault that caused the huge earthquake and tsuanmi which devastated much of northeast Japan.[396][397]\n\nSee also\n\n(Note: Does not include all radiation readings from Fukushima Daini site) Fukushima radiation comparison to other incidents and standards, with graph of recorded radiation levels and specific accident events.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences",

The centre speaker in the top line of the square is used for dialogue. The left and right speakers on either side of the centre speaker are used to create stereo sound for music and other sound effects in the film. The left and right rear speakers create the surround sound effect.\n\n5.1 surround sound (\"five-point one\") is the common name for six channel surround sound audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in home theatre.[citation needed] It uses five full bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel (the \"point one\").[1] Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS, SDDS, and THX are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of digital broadcast and music.[2]\n\nAll 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a front left and right, a center channel, two surround channels and the low-frequency effects channel designed for a subwoofer.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nA prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed \"quintaphonic sound\", was used in the 1975 film Tommy.[3]\n\n5.1 dates back to 1976[citation needed] when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on Todd-AO 70 mm film prints. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, Logan's Run) did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with Apocalypse Now. Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.\n\nWhen digital sound was applied to 35 mm release prints, starting with Batman Returns in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70 mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35 mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70 mm format. Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by KODAK and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of Days of Thunder and The Doors using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.\n\n5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid 90s Laserdisc releases, with among the earliest being Clear and Present Danger and Jurassic Park (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 “matrixed” tracks). Blu-ray and digital cinema both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.\n\nA system of digital 5.1 surround sound has also been used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the Moulin Rouge, created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985 a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with Solid State Logic, based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG.[4] The console included ABCDEF channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in Dakar.\n\nApplication [ edit ]\n\nChannel order [ edit ]\n\nThe order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in WAV files is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, Low-frequency effects, Surround Left, Surround Right.[5]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nSuggested configuration for 5.1 music listening.\n\nRegarding music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a centered positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.\n\nFor play-back of 5.1 music recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have been released and propose the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):[6]\n\nfive speakers of the same size for front, center and surround\n\nidentical distance from the listeners for all five speakers\n\nangle adjustment regarding viewing direction of audience: center 0°, front ±22.5° for movies ±30° for music, surround ±110°\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_8577": "If only Americans watched more Fox propaganda, they might not overwhelmingly oppose the GOP tax scam.\n\nAfter answering softball questions on Fox News Thursday morning about the GOP’s tax scam bill (“Does this mean people get to spend more at Christmas?”), Donald Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, announced that the only reason so many voters don’t like the bill is because not enough voters watch Fox News.\n\nOr something.\n\nEssentially, Mulvaney argued to host Steve Doocy that American voters aren’t smart enough to understand how wonderful the GOP tax scam is, and they’re being duped by the news media:\n\nDOOCY: People don’t like to pay taxes to you would think this would be a good story you. And yet Mick, the Quinnipiac poll came out and it shows that 57 percent of American don’t like it, as opposed to 26 percent who do. Can you explain to me why people don’t like the idea of a tax cut? MULVANEY: Sure. Because if you turn to any channel besides this one, all you’re going to hear is bad news about this particular bill. I was walking into work this morning and listening to radio here in Washington, D.C. And it was one negative story after another about this tax bill. No one is focusing, as you folks do. On what’s good for people in this bill. So if you get your news here, you probably like it, because you focused on what’s good for you. But if no, you don’t.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll referenced by Fox News found that 64 percent of American voters think the GOP plan benefits the wealthy the most.\n\nIn truth, a large portion of Republican voters don’t even like this monstrosity of a tax giveaway to the super rich, so it’s not clear how the White House would try to spin that fact. Supposedly, those are Republicans who don’t watch Fox News? Or those are Republicans who watch Fox News but don’t pay close enough attention? Only have it on in the background?\n\nThe whole idea — that an administration is trying to pass a transforming piece of tax legislation and the reason nobody likes it is because a couple cable news channels are being mean — is absurd.\n\nThe way you convince voters that legislation is good for them is you have an open, transparent process where the bill is debated over many, many months.\n\nInstead, apparently afraid that contents of the tax giveaway bill would spark widespread protests, the GOP has essentially kept the bill hidden from public view, refusing to having meaningful hearings or allow experts to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, tax bill polling numbers that are piling up are staggering and historic. That’s all the more amazing considering U.S. voters, of course, traditionally like the idea of getting a tax cut.\n\nNo major party in recent history has ever tried to pass a piece of legislation so universally despised as the GOP tax bill, let alone present the bill as the cornerstone to the party’s legislative agenda.\n\nA recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll found that just 32 percent support the GOP tax plan. That’s actually on the high end of recent polling, yet that’s still the lowest level of public support for any major piece of legislation enacted in the past three decades, including the Affordable Care Act in 2009.\n\nEven worse for the GOP, Public Policy Polling found that “by a 23 point margin voters say they’re less likely to vote for a member of Congress next year who supports it.”\n\nApparently, if we all just watched Fox News, we’d be cheering the GOP’s plan to permanently slash the corporate tax rate, make it harder for students to pay for college, and to decimate longterm funding for Medicare and Social Security.",

A floor-mate of mine, with whom I hung out occasionally, told me over lunch that she was at college primarily to find a “good husband.” I nearly choked on my sandwich. I had assumed that the notion of the “Mrs. Degree” was a relic of my parents’ era—if not my grandparents’. Surely it had gone the way of the home economics major and women’s dormitory curfews.\n\nYears later, I — along with my co-director, Elizabeth A. Armstrong — would embark on a five year ethnographic and longitudinal study of a dormitory floor of women at a public flagship in the Midwest. As part of my dissertation, I also interviewed the women’s parents. What I found brought me back to my first year of college. A subset of parents wanted their daughters to be “cookie-baking moms”—not successful lawyers, doctors, or businesswomen. They espoused gender complementarity—a cultural model of how women should achieve economic security that relied on a co-constructed pairing of traditional femininity and masculinity. That is, men were to be economic providers and women supportive homemakers. This was a revised “Mrs.” Degree, in the sense that marriage during college, or even right after, was not desirable. College women were to build the traits and social networks that would hopefully land them a successful husband eventually, but it was assumed best to wait until men had proven themselves in the labor market before entering a marriage.\n\nThis was not the only cultural model to which women on the floor were exposed. In fact, those coming in primed for complementarity were in the minority. However, as I show in my article, “The Revised MRS: Gender Complementarity at College,” far more women left college leaning toward gender complementarity than their previous gender socialization suggested. Something was happening on the college campus — where women were, ironically, out-achieving men — that shifted them toward performing an affluent, white, and heterosexual femininity, marked by an emphasis on appearance, accommodation to men, and a bubbly personality.\n\nI argue that gender complementarity is not just a characteristic of individual women, but is actually encouraged by the institutional and interactional features of the typical, four-year, public state school. Midwest U, like other schools of its kind, builds a social and academic infrastructure well-suited to high-paying, out-of-state students interested in partying. The predominately white Greek system — a historically gender-, class-, and racially-segregated institution — enjoys prominence on campus. An array of “easy” majors, geared toward characteristics developed outside of the classroom, allow women to leverage personality, looks, and social skills in the academic sphere. These supports make it possible for peer cultures in which gender complementarity is paramount to thrive. Women who want to belong and make friends find it hard — if not impossible — to avoid the influence of the dominant social scene on campus, located in fraternities and Greek-oriented bars.\n\nThis structure of campus life is not incidental. In recent years, cuts to state and federal support for higher education have led mid-tier public institutions like Midwest U to cater to the socially-oriented and out-of-state students who arrive with gender complementarity interests. These class-based processes have implications for the type of social and academic climate that all students find upon arriving at Midwest University.\n\nThe problem is, however, that most women need to accrue the skills and credentials that translate into a solid career. An institution supporting gender complementarity does them a serious disservice — potentially contributing to gendered differences in pay after college. The situation is particularly problematic for students not from the richest of families: Affluent women espousing complementarity form the type of networks that give them reasonable hope of rescue by a high-credentialed spouse, and heavy parental support means that they can afford to be in big cities where they mix and mingle with the “right” men. Women from less affluent backgrounds lack these resources, and are often reliant on their own human capital to make it after college.\n\nThe gradual shift from higher education as a public good — funded heavily by the state — to a private commodity — for sale to the highest bidder — has significantly stalled not only progress toward class equality, but certain forms of gender equality as well. Change is going to require unlinking the solvency of organizations like Midwest U from the interests of those can afford, and thus demand, an exclusionary and highly gendered social experience.\n\nLaura T. Hamilton, PhD is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Merced. Her recently published article, “The Revised MRS: Gender Complementarity at College,” appears in the April 2014 issue of Gender & Society; this post originally appeared at their blog. She is the author of Parenting to a Degree: How Family Matter’s for College Women’s Success and, with Elizabeth Armstrong, Paying for the Party: How Colleges Maintain Inequality.",
  "latent_8680": "Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers recently published results of a study in the PlosOne journal, where they show an investigational agent can prevent tumor growth and metastasis in mice models of prostate cancer with a common chromosomal abnormality.\n\nThe drug, YK-4-279, is the first compound that can directly target a commonly found chromosomal translocation in 50% of prostate cancers, called an ETS fusion whereby two normal genes break from a chromosome and fuse together onto another location. This leads to the production of new genes, resulting in novel proteins that have a deleterious function and increase the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells.\n\n“Having a compound that works in mouse models brings us closer to early phase human clinical trials,” said the study’s lead investigator, Aykut Üren, MD, associate professor of molecular oncology at Georgetown Lombardi in a university news release. “However, we are only mid-way through that process. We need to establish the potential side effects and figure out the best way to administer this compound in a human clinical study.”\n\nDr. Üren and colleagues used mice with a compromised immune system and injected them with two different prostate cancer cell lines. “YK-4-279 was very effective against the mice with ETS fusion and was not effective against the mice without it,” added Dr. Üren. “That demonstrated to us the specificity with which the drug works, and gave us a good reason to expect a similar response in patients with ETS fusion-positive prostate cancer in future clinical trials.”\n\nAdditionally, the team observed that the animals could tolerate long-term treatment of 6 to 12 weeks with the agent, which was able to inhibit the proliferation of primary tumors along with their capacity to metastasize to the lungs.\n\nYK-4-279 was developed as part of the GUMC Drug Discovery Program, which is directed by Milton Brown, MD, PhD, also a co-author on the paper. This experimental drug is also being studied for the treatment of a rare pediatric cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma.",

Voice actor Japanese English As Carbink Shōzō Iizuka Unknown\n\nDace (Japanese: ダイイ Di) appeared in Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction. It is the elder Carbink of the four.\n\nHistory\n\nDace in its youth\n\nWhile Dace was journeying in the Allearth Forest, it stumbled across several Pokémon that were running from Yveltal. Due to Yveltal's Oblivion Wing, Dace's life force was being drained. Dace was about to be weakened until Xerneas arrived and used its Fairy Aura to restore the forest.\n\nLater, when Merrick was about to tell Diancie something, Dace stepped in instead. Dace told Diancie about the Heart Diamond losing its powers. Diancie didn't believe Dace at first and accused it of exaggerating but Dace convinced her to take it seriously. Dace recommended Diancie to see Xerneas after her powers of creating a Heart Diamond failed.\n\nLater, after Ash and the others escaped from Riot's Greninja, they entered the Diamond Domain and Dace appeared and explained that the Heart Diamond's life was no more. Dace and the others left the Diamond Domain and arrived in the Allearth Forest. It warned Ash and his friends about Yveltal causing destruction if one would disturb its cocoon.\n\nWhen Yveltal woke up from its slumber in the cocoon, Dace was not turned into stone as the Oblivion Wing didn't hit it. After Xerneas stopped Yveltal from damaging the forest, Dace was able to reunite with Merrick, Bort, and Allotrope after they were turned into stone. Back in the Diamond Domain, Dace watched as Diancie successfully created another Heart Diamond.\n\nPersonality and characteristics\n\nThe Carbink servants with Diancie\n\nThe Carbink servants are considered to be Diancie's bodyguards as they raised her when she was young. Out of the four Carbink, Dace was considered to be the most serious.\n\nMerrick, Bort, and Allotrope are very loyal to Diancie, and are very dedicated to protecting her no matter what the situation. The three are almost always seen escorting Diancie wherever she goes and also began to worry when Diancie had fled from them to go to the big city. However, Merrick, Bort, and Allotrope can sometimes get annoyed with Diancie when she is oblivious to their situations, such as when they were panicking due to being chased by a group Ariados, yet she told them to help Pangoro and greeted it. This is also seen when Diancie is playfully running from them even though they had serious news for her. Merrick is capable of speaking telepathically, and appears to be the leader servant of the three. Bort and Allotrope, however, appear to be incapable of speaking telepathically.\n\nDace is shown to be quite knowledgeable, especially about the Allearth Forest as well as the powers of Xerneas and Yveltal. It used this knowledge to advise Ash, his friends, and Diancie while they were in the Allearth Forest. It is shown to have given Diancie the objective to find Xerneas and its Fairy Aura. However, it is quite serious and was rather annoyed with Diancie when she took it lightly. It also was annoyed when Diancie replied to it with \"okie-dokie!\", telling her that a simple yes was good enough. Like Diancie and Merrick, Dace can speak via telepathy.\n\nVoice actors\n\nIn the manga\n\nDace in the seventeenth movie adaptation\n\nThe Carbink servants in the seventeenth movie adaptation\n\nIn the movie adaptations\n\nThe Carbink servants appeared in the manga adaptation of the seventeenth movie.\n\nNames\n\nMerrick\n\nLanguage Name Origin Japanese マジマ Majima English, German, Spanish Merrick Possibly from melée, small cut gem diamonds Italian Quarzio From quarzo, quartz Korean 메슈머 Mesyumeo Similar to its Japanese name Chinese ( Mandarin ) 馬吉馬 / 马吉马 Mǎjímǎ Transliteration of its Japanese name\n\nBort\n\nLanguage Name Origin Japanese ナイト Knight Possibly from -(n)ite, a common suffix for mineral names English, Italian Bort From bort, shards of poor quality diamond Spanish Carbono From carbono (carbon), the chemical element diamonds are made of Korean 나이트 Knight Transliteration of its Japanese name Chinese ( Mandarin ) 奈特 Nàitè Transliteration of its Japanese name\n\nAllotrope\n\nLanguage Name Origin Japanese ジョーク Joke English, Italian Allotrope From allotrope, different forms of the same element.

Google didn't help matters at all when in the fall of 2010, \"Google engineer Patrick Brady stated unambiguously that Android is not Linux” That was never true. Android has always been Linux.\n\nWhat's also true though is that Google took Android in its own direction, a direction that wasn't compatible with the mainstream Linux kernel. As Greg Kroah-Hartman, head of the Linux Driver Project and a Novell engineer, wrote in Android and the Linux kernel community, \"The Android kernel code is more than just the few weird drivers that were in the drivers/staging/androidsubdirectory in the kernel. In order to get a working Android system, you need the new lock type they have created, as well as hooks in the core system for their security model. In order to write a driver for hardware to work on Android, you need to properly integrate into this new lock, as well as sometimes the bizarre security model. Oh, and then there's the totally-different framebuffer driver infrastructure as well.\" As you might imagine, that hasn't gone over well in Android circles.\n\nThis disagreement sprang from several sources. One was that Google's Android developers had taken their own way to address power issues with WakeLocks. The other cause, as Google open source engineering manager Chris DiBona essentially said, was that Android's programmers were so busy working on Android device specifics that they had done a poor job of co-coordinating with the Linux kernel developers.\n\nThe upshot was that developer circles have had a lot of heated words over what's the right way of handling Android specific code in Linux. Linus Torvalds dropped the Android drivers from the main Linux kernel in late 2009. This doesn't mean that Android isn't, but it has become something of a Linux fork. That doesn't, however, as some recent reports had it that Android and Linux are somehow in a fight with each other. Or, even, as one claim had it in March 2011, that Android was somehow in danger of being sued by Linux because of Gnu General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2) violations. As Linus himself said at the time, claims that the Android violated the GPL were “totally bogus. We’ve always made it very clear that the kernel system call interfaces do not in any way result in a derived work as per the GPL, and the kernel details are exported through the kernel headers to all the normal glibc interfaces too.”\n\nStill, it seemed as if Android and Linux were moving more on parallel paths than together, and that is indeed the case. At LinuxCon, Torvalds explained, that “there's still a lot of merger to be done. ... but that eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it will probably not be for four to five years.”\n\nKroah-Hartman added that one problem is that \"Google's Android team is very small and over-subscribed to so they're resource restrained It would be cheaper in the long run for them to work with us.\" Torvalds added that \"I'm not at all afraid of forks... even when forks happen there are all these points of pain where two groups have had different issues, it just takes a while for people to join back, but the joining will happen. We're just going different directions for a while, but in the long run the sides will come together so I'm not worried.\"\n\nKroah-Hartman,pointed out that for years Google's in-house Linux that it uses for servers, was a fork of the Linux 2.4 for many years. Torvalds explained that Google did this because they had made so many performance tweaks to improve it for Google's search engine. He also added that many other companies tweak Linux for their particular uses. Fortunately, thanks to the GPLv2, all the significant changes come back to the mainstream kernel.\n\nSo, for the next few years, Android, while still a Linux, is indeed a Linux fork. In the long run, though, Torvalds is sure that Android will return to the mainstream Linux kernel. For better or worse though that may not be until 2016. Fortunately, for all end-users and almost all Android developers none of this will make any real world difference.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nGoogle and Motorola Mobility: It's all about the patents\n\nSun CEO explicitly endorsed Java's use in Android: What do you say now Oracle?\n\nGoogle needs to clean up its Android Market malware mess\n\nReport: Android steals 20% of tablet market share from iPad",
  "latent_9150": "With Mike Flynn seeking an immunity deal and evidence mounting that House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes coordinated with the White House to take pressure off Donald Trump—ostensibly a target of the committee’s current investigation into Russia’s election interference—Sean Spicer is desperate for the media to talk about anything else. And so on Friday, running out of excuses to defend the president’s unfounded claims that Barack Obama (or perhaps the British government) “wiretapped” him—both allegations denied by the directors of the F.B.I. and the N.S.A.—the White House press secretary began to volunteer a series of increasingly tangential and conspiratorial stories he suggested the press should be chasing instead.\n\nThe leaks are the real scandal\n\nDuring his daily press briefing Friday, Spicer repeatedly pushed the White House press corps to ignore the potential intent, subject, or substance of surveillance that may have incidentally swept up Trump or members of his associates, and to focus solely on the fact that the information was leaked at all. “American citizens who were not government employees at the time potentially were surveilled, had their information unmasked, made it available, was politically spread. All this should be very concerning to people, that people serving in government, who are providing classified information, misused, mishandled, and potentially did some very, very bad things with classified information,” he said. “That astonishes me that that is not the subject of this. That all of this is happening in our country. The potential that that happened should concern every single America.”\n\nObama really did spy on Trump\n\nResponding to questions about Nunes, Spicer attacked the media for not covering what he said was growing evidence to support Trump’s wiretapping claims. In particular, he pointed to statements made by a former Obama official who previously raised concerns about surveillance. “On March 2, the day before the president’s tweet, comments by senior administration official and foreign policy expert Dr. Evelyn Farkas, together with previous reports, raised serious concerns on whether there was an organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information to political purposes,” Spicer asserted.\n\nFarkas was indeed deputy assistant secretary of defense for Eurasia, Russia, and Ukraine, but she left the Obama administration in 2015—more than a year before Trump was elected president or the alleged wiretapping would have occurred. Recently, Farkas appeared on MSNBC, during which she said she’d urged then-president Obama to gather evidence of Trump’s ties to Russia. “I became very worried, because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more,” she said. She did not say that Obama or member of his administration had ordered surveillance of Trump Tower or leaked any classified information. But that didn’t stop Spicer from trying to forge the connection, even when a reporter directly pointed out that Farkas wasn’t working at the administration when Spicer suggests Trump was being spied on. “Dr. Farkas’s admissions alone are devastating,” Spicer said. “We’re committed to working with the House and Senate committees to get to the bottom of what happened here.”\n\nSpicer later accused Obama, again, of illegally wiretapping Trump. “What continues to come to light in terms of Obama officials admitting off or on the record consistent with what Farkas says, that there was clearly an attempt to do something politically motivated with the intelligence out there and the question is, why,” Spicer said. “More and more the substance that continues to come out on the record continues to point to exactly what the president was talking about on March 5.” But he then walked back the claim after a reporter asked if he had evidence of wiretapping. “No, I don’t,” Spicer said.\n\nOn Twitter Friday afternoon, Farkas herself called for an end to Spicer’s conspiracy theory.\n\nClinton is the real Russian puppet\n\nSpicer also brought up Hillary Clinton’s past dealings with Russia as evidence that the defeated Democratic nominee presented a far more nefarious figure than Donald Trump. “It was Hillary Clinton who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy,” Spicer said, laying out the potential conspiracy. “She said on Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off one fifth of our country’s uranium. Paid speeches. Paid deals. Personal calls from Vladimir Putin, if you really want to talk about the Russian connection.”\n\nWhen he was later pressed on details of Clinton’s Russian dealings, he doubled down. “What I’m saying is, when you talk about connections to Russia, you look at the Obama administration’s connections, you have the Clinton Foundation concern with some of the donations she’s got,” he said. “You have her husband getting a personal call from Putin. When you compare the two sides, it’s night and day between our actions and her actions. When you want to look at a clear connection to Russia, there’s a clear one there.”\n\nAs a brief reminder, Trump’s former campaign manager was literally paid millions of dollars by a Russian oligarch and close Putin ally to advance the Kremlin’s interests around the world and “greatly benefit the Putin Government,” according to the terms of his own $10 million per year contract.",

But I am sure in my head I had not done it.'\n\nHe denied the prosecutor's assertion that he had drunk too much and 'simply saw the pose and took the opportunity to rub your hand over her body'.\n\nHe also denied showing off to his friends at the ball and denied getting 'carried away with drink, fun and the atmosphere'.\n\nThe commando, who works on Navy fleet protection at Faslane, Scotland, said that groping was serious.\n\nTelford, a marine for four years, who had been given a caution for an assault in 2015, said he had drunk six pints of lager during the boozy ball attended by 2,000 students.\n\nHe told the jury: 'I was drunk. I was a bit more jolly after a few pints. I remember everything, I remember the incident.'\n\nHe said he had photobombed the group by the stage before one of the victim's friends launched a 'tirade' against him for alleging groping her.\n\nTelford said: 'I hadn't done anything. I just walked off. I acted nonchalantly. I laughed it off.'\n\nThe victim's friend told the jury they had been having fun dancing and then posing for the photos - as she held up her pal's leg in the air.\n\nShe said a hand then rubbed up and down on her friend's vagina about three times.\n\nShe told the court: 'I am 99.9% sure in my heart it was him who touched her.\n\n'I saw a hand coming from the same direction he had been standing. We were in a pose. The hand touched her body.'\n\nThe jury was told that Telford won the King's Badge as the top recruit in his troop while at Commando training in Devon.\n\nHe also excelled in jungle training and a senior officer said he had a 'maturity above and beyond his years'.\n\nPrivately educated Telford became a maritime sniper and his behaviour was 'faultless and he was highly regarded' by the Corps.\n\nProsecutor Brian Fitzherbert had said: 'This defendant Thomas Telford sexually assaulted a young woman on the dance floor at the Exeter University graduation ball.\n\n'Put in simple terms he groped her.'\n\nThe victim said: 'I was not drunk. I had obviously been drinking. I did not feel impaired in any way and was in control of myself.\n\n'I was posing for a picture with my friend.'\n\nThe brown haired graduate said she then felt 'someone touching my stomach around my belly button and move down to my vagina'.",

REUTERS/Mark Blinch The Supreme Court has just ruled that gay marriage is legal nationwide, in a huge victory for gay-rights advocates just a little over a decade after Massachusetts became the first state to legalize gay marriage.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy issued the 5-4 ruling, finding that the Fourteenth Amendment — which guarantees \"equal protection under the law\" and the right to \"due process of law\" — requires a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex.\n\n\"The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons can together find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality,\" Kennedy wrote. \"This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Kennedy expressed why marriage is necessary for true gay equality.\n\n\"As the state itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects,\" he wrote in the ruling joined by the court's liberals, justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.\n\nLater on in the opinion, Kennedy wrote, \"Especially against a long history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm.\"\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy has consistently voted for gay rights. The decision signifies a major advance in gay rights. It was just in 2003 that Kennedy wrote a majority opinion striking down Texas' sodomy law. Before 2004 no states recognized gay marriage, and that year many states went as far as banning same-sex marriage.\n\nIn his opinion, Kennedy also addressed the argument that voters should be allowed to decide gay marriage.\n\n\"Of course, the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights,\" he wrote.\n\nKennedy identified four principles that demonstrate why same-sex couples should have the right to marry.\n\n1. The right to \"personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy.\"\n\n2. \"The right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals.\"\n\n3. The right to marry \"safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education.\"\n\n4. Marriage is a \"keystone of the nation's social order.\"\n\nThis was the second time America's high court took up same-sex marriage. The first time, in June 2013, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion striking down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), in a ruling that allowed the US government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where they were already legal.\n\nBut the court declined to rule on the broader question about gay marriage: Is there a constitutional right to gay marriage?\n\nA gay pride flag being waved in front of the Supreme Court. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson The court's 2013 decision on DOMA has spawned battles across the country over same-sex marriage — including one in Alabama, where courts have issued conflicting rulings leading to an uncertain fate for gay couples.\n\nThat latest case reviewed a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to uphold same-sex marriage bans in Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and looked at whether those bans violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn their petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, same-sex couples argued that Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban \"marks the same-sex relationships and the families they create as less valuable and less worthy of respect than opposite-sex relationships.\"\n\nThat mark creates a stigma, the petition continued, that is \"incompatible with the bedrock Constitutional principles animating the Fourteenth Amendment.\"",

  "latent_10144": "There can be only one.\n\nWe all know this catchphrase/tagline from the Highlander franchise—or even if we don’t know where it’s from, most of us have somehow absorbed it as a classic geekana saying, a thing that needs to be spouted in low, somber tones and indicates a fight to the death with Only One left standing.\n\nBut unfortunately, weirdly, frustratingly—this little phrase also keeps coming up as a concept that gets applied to media with protagonists and creators who are not straight white dudes, and therefore apparently unicorns. And as cool as being a unicorn seems in theory, it doesn’t usually lead us down the path of screaming, “I know everything! I am everything!” in the grand tradition of Connor MacLeod. Who, come to think of it, had a tendency to sound kind of like that guy in your English Lit class who keeps trying to explain why the Brontes are “overrated” right before inviting you to his open mic night.\n\nYou don’t know everything, Connor. And being anointed the Only One kind of sucks.\n\nI saw Wonder Woman three times opening weekend, with three different groups of friends, most of them women. It was exhilarating and emotional, one of those moments where it feels like everyone is mind-melding in the grand communal pool of feelings soup. For me, a longtime superhero fan who can still call up the sensation of trying to perfect Lynda Carter’s trademark spin, it also felt like the realization of something I’d always longed for—but I didn’t know quite how much I needed it until it was being poured into my eyeballs. One of comics’ most iconic female superheroes, centered in her own epic.\n\nOf course, the sweeping comparisons started immediately. Wonder Woman is clearly better than any other female superhero ever! Wonder Woman is clearly inferior to X superheroine from before! Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel are going to fight it out to the death in long paragraphs of thinkpieces everywhere to see which one is the Ultimate Onscreen Female Superhero, because that is apparently the only way we’re allowed to talk about them!\n\nWhy is there this instant urge, when we’re finally being given something that hasn’t been represented a ton onscreen, to declare it The Best, The Worst, The Only One? Why, if we’ve been waiting so long for a female-centered superhero epic, do we want to settle for Only One female-centered superhero epic? Also, cross-brand restrictions aside, why can’t we imagine a world where Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel go for a milkshake instead of fighting each other to the death?\n\nI think Wonder Woman is an important movie and an important moment in time. But we shouldn’t try to make it more important by denigrating everything that’s come before and everything that will come after, by insisting it must stand alone in order to be important at all.\n\nI had this same feeling about some of the commentary around Rey (Daisy Ridley), the resilient would-be Jedi in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (who returns to presumably Jedi even harder in the upcoming The Last Jedi). I loved Rey wholeheartedly and I loved how centered she was in the narrative. I did not love some of the rapturous posts that claimed Star Wars had finally given us a “strong” female character who is not “a love interest.” Princess-now-General Leia (Carrie Fisher) was never anyone’s love interest—she was a full protagonist alongside Luke and Han, she was strong enough to strangle a pervy space slug, and the romantic subplot unfolded mostly from her POV. Han was her love interest. To deny that she didn’t crack the slide-y futuristic space door open for Rey—and to diminish her role in order to raise Rey up—seems like yet another example of this weird, Only One erasure.\n\nWhat tends to emerge a lot with this kind of erasure is the idea that female characters in particular can only be “strong” in a certain specific way in order to be considered strong, period. Leia was lauded for going from Princess to General—even though her personality remained exactly (and awesomely) the same. In a similar vein, Robin Wright’s fierce Antiope in Wonder Woman was rightfully gushed over—but some of the most popular memes/bits of commentary used the premise that Buttercup, Wright’s haughty princess in The Princess Bride, was a lesser sort of hero. Can’t Buttercup—who after all, did the best with the often shitty hand she was dealt—simply be a different sort of hero? A different sort of strong?\n\nOr to put it another way: if the apocalypse hits, don’t you want Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel and Rey and Leia and Antiope and Buttercup fighting by your side?\n\nWhen the zombies are about to eat my face off, I don’t want to be forced to choose Only One.\n\nAll the examples I’ve talked about so far are white women. But before I get into how Only One-ism is even worse for women of color, here’s something else I’ve been thinking about: when white women characters are held up as the Only One, they are also held up as universal. Every woman should be able to relate to Wonder Woman—even though she doesn’t look like every woman. She is the ultimate hero and we need no others—even though some of us are still waiting to see ourselves centered that way in stories.\n\nWonder Woman is an important step in the representational march, but we need to start seeing these characters people want to put forth as Only Ones as steps rather than pinnacles. To do otherwise erases not only the characters who came before, but the characters who will come after—the characters who will hopefully represent an even wider range of the audience reveling in their adventures onscreen.\n\nThis is another reason we need more characters, representing even more experiences within various marginalized identities—but stamping out the idea of the Only One seems to get progressively tougher the more intersecting identities you have. I am an Asian American woman who writes Asian American superheroines. I have been told all of the following things by white people as if they are the highest of compliments:\n\nThat I am the Only One doing that! (No.)\n\nThat the protagonist of my first book, Heroine Complex , is the only Hapa protagonist of a series EVER. (Nope!)\n\nThat people should buy my work because it “has diversity.” (Not because it’s good, because diversity and quality can apparently never exist within the same sphere.)\n\nMake no mistake: I am very proud of the representational steps people feel my work has made. As I’ve said many times before, it would have blown my mind and changed my world if I’d seen a book with two Asian American women (and one of them Hapa!) superheroines on the cover as a child. And it means the world to me when women of color readers in particular tell me they can see themselves in Evie and Aveda, my protagonists—or that they were pleasantly surprised to see that the Asian characters in the book are not Only Ones. ’Cause, you know, Asian people are often friends with other Asian people.\n\nWhat the well-meaning statements from white people seem to miss is this: I don’t want to be the Only One. I want readers of today to have more than I did when it comes to opportunities to imagine themselves as heroes. Not every Asian American woman is going to connect to my characters, not every Asian American woman is going to find my stories to her taste. No character can possibly be all things to all people, and I want every reader to be able to find that character who is going to be mind-blowingly important. Only One-ism sometimes means those characters and creators won’t even be given the chance. I’ve heard plenty of stories about Asian authors telling Asian stories getting rejected because a publisher “already has an Asian book”—possibly one of the most “wha-huh?” examples of Only One-ism, as if Only One experience exists within an entire huge umbrella identity.\n\nOne of the best experiences in my journey with the Heroine Complex books has been… well. The moments where I’m not the Only One. The summer the first book came out, there were two other awesome Asian American superheroine SF/F novels written by Asian American writers—Last Call at the Nightshade Lounge by Paul Krueger and Not Your Sidekick by C.B. Lee. To be able to bond and team up with these writers, to be able to recommend each other’s books to readers looking for more, was a delight. Writing can be lonely. Anything that gives you a sense of community is essential when it comes to keeping the demons of Only One-ism from encroaching. And hopefully, when we lift each other up, it only lays the groundwork for that representational march to keep marching on.\n\nI’m writing this on the eve of the book launch party for Heroine Worship, the second book in the series. This book was fed and nurtured by my various Asian American communities—the local artists, the online geekerati, the girl gangs and near and far. It would not, could not exist without the strength of a community that deserves to see their wide range of experiences reflected in stories everywhere.\n\nIt is not an Only One. I am not an Only One. And I cannot imagine being any other way.

  "latent_10187": "Penguins need shootout to deny Red Wings' rally\n\nDETROIT (AP)  The Pittsburgh Penguins passed their first test after another setback.\n\nJames Neal (FSY) scored the only goal in the shootout, giving Pittsburgh a 5-4 victory against the Detroit Red Wings after it blew a four-goal lead Monday night.\n\n\"We let it slip away a bit and no one likes to see that,\" Neal said. \"But when you come back and win in the shootout, it's a great feeling.\"\n\nThe win picked up a team that was knocked down a couple hours before the game.\n\nPenguins forward Matt Cooke (FSY) was suspended by the NHL for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs for an elbow to the head of New York Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh (FSY) during a 5-2 home loss Sunday.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" teammate Jordan Staal (FSY) said. \"Matt's a big part of our team. He plays on the edge. He has to find a way to play on the edge but play clean.\"\n\nPascal Dupuis (FSY) had two goals and an assist to help Pittsburgh build a big lead. Tyler Kennedy (FSY) put Pittsburgh ahead 4-0 at 13:16 of the second period, ending goalie Jimmy Howard's (FSY) night. Joey MacDonald (FSY) stopped all 10 shots he faced before the shootout.\n\n\"Howie would like to have the first one back, but I think we hung him out to dry on the other ones,\" Detroit coach Mike Babcock said. \"Mac didn't have much work, but he made some good saves for us and gave us two rounds in the shootout with an opportunity.\"\n\nHenrik Zetterberg's (FSY) goal — redirected off a Penguins player — started Detroit's comeback late in the second period, and Mike Modano (FSY) tied it midway through the third.\n\nBrent Johnson (FSY) stopped 37 shots for the Penguins, who gave Marc-Andre Fleury (FSY) the night off, and denied Todd Bertuzzi (FSY), Modano and Danny Cleary in the shootout.\n\nPittsburgh has had to get used to playing without injured stars Sidney Crosby (FSY) and Evgeni Malkin (FSY). Now the Penguins will try to catch the Atlantic Division-leading Philadelphia Flyers for the best record in the Eastern Conference without another key player.\n\nCooke was suspended for the fourth time in three seasons with the Penguins, and the repeat offender wasn't backed up by his boss. General manager Ray Shero released a statement before the game saying head shots have no place in hockey.\n\n\"We've told Matt in no uncertain terms that this kind of action on the ice is unacceptable and cannot happen,\" Shero said.\n\nModano said the NHL has to crack down on those players who are marring the sport.\n\n\"A handful of guys in those intense situations can't seem to control themselves,\" Modano said.\n\nCrosby took at least one too many hits to the head and has been forced to sit out since Jan. 5 because of a concussion. Malkin was lost last month for the season after he tore two ligaments in his right knee.\n\nDetroit was missing a star, a standout and a role player.\n\nPavel Datsyuk (FSY) and Johan Franzen (FSY) missed their second consecutive game with lower-body injuries, and Jiri Hudler (FSY) was out for a third game because of an upper-body ailment.\n\n\"Both teams had to play without substantial guys,\" Pittsburgh coach Dan Bylsma (FSY) said. \"Still a pretty good game.\"\n\nThe Red Wings started strong, taking the first five shots and preventing Pittsburgh from getting a puck on Howard for nearly five minutes, and finished with a flurry of offense in regulation.\n\nIn between, Pittsburgh was dominant.\n\nDupuis scored his first goal on a wide wraparound at 15:14 of the first period, shooting the puck between Howard's right skate and left knee. Chris Kunitz (FSY) scored on a rebound of Dupuis' shot with 43 seconds left in the period.\n\nDupuis had a short-handed goal midway through the second. He mishandled the puck that bounced off the end boards toward him but took advantage of the second chance. Dupuis had recorded a season-high three points 31 minutes in.\n\nWhen Kennedy scored off his own rebound to make it 4-0, Babcock replaced Howard with MacDonald.\n\nZetterberg scored with 2:19 left in the second, Valtteri Filppula (FSY) had a goal early in the third, and Cleary and Modano scored 2:21 apart midway through the period to make it 4-4.\n\n\"It was a good point for us,\" Babcock said.\n\nNotes: Modano, who missed half the season with a wrist injury, scored his first goal since Nov. 3 in his 12th game back. \"It's taken a long time to get up to speed with these guys,\" he said. \"After three months off, it has been quite an adjustment.\"... Cooke will miss the last 10 games of the regular season, costing him $219,512.20, and at least four playoff games. ... Crosby skated Monday, but there isn't a timetable for his return to the lineup. ... Pittsburgh beat Detroit 4-1 on Jan. 18 at home. ...

  "latent_10189": "Image via Wikipedia\n\nApparently the Pirate party of Sweden decided to take thing one step further and has announced the world’s first Pirate ISP which will be focused on protecting their user’s privacy and take the MAFIAA and the rest of the gang head on. I assume it’s going to be protected via the governmental immunity the parliamentary members have so it’s going to be much more difficult to shut down, although the US copyright industry will definitely focus all their political muscle in order to nip this in the bud. Remember how they managed to have the Swedish authorities raid the Pirate Bay Offices even though they were legal under Swedish law.\n\nI find this a very good example of turning the state’s weapons against it, but ultimately I don’t know how successful it will be (but naturally I hope to be proven wrong). Of course this doesn’t mean that “The system works” since they’re in effect trying to combat the system in the first place. No. Rather what is happening is that they’ve found a loophole in the system which allows them to use it in a way the ruling elite didn’t plan to. This is a very good way to use the system actually but the problem is ultimately that the power still relies on the ruling elite. And when the new material circumstances make previous rules work against them, then they will make sure that the previous rules are modified enough to suit their interests.\n\nAt the moment, I can foresee a few ways they are going to go around shutting this down or neutering it\n\nChange the law to make this illegal. Perhaps they will disallow parliament to be involved in business. Perhaps they will stop political immunity from affecting businesses run from parliamentary members. Sure, this may harm the already established interests but given how much the IP lobby (and remember, the US is practically surviving on IP at the moment) is set to loose if this idea starts to spread to other countries, they might be willing to compensate those who will be harmed by new laws handsomely, so that this particular tactic becomes impossible. Certainly the parliamentary members might try to fight this on constitutional grounds but seeing as how easy it was to find biased judges to oversee the Pirate Bay case, and how important this decision will be, this is certainly going to be stacked against the small amount of people behind the Pirate party.\n\nCreate a moral panic about child porn. Someone (planted or not) is going to start sharing child porn through the Pirate ISP which will then force the pirate party in a very precarious political decision. Either it will be seen as supporting or covering child porn and other nasty stuff, or the Pirate Party will have to start keeping logs and other tracking measures, which can then be used by law enforcement to track down file sharers. Perhaps they will attempt to provide the info only for child porn and not for piracy, but that’s how it always starts anyway.\n\nDisconnect the Pirate ISP from the Internet. I don’t know how possible this is, but it could be possible that the anti-pirate outfits as well as the USA and its nation-bitches will attempt to block any connection coming from the IPs assigned to the Pirate ISP. This would not require a legal precedent but it will require a lot of logistics and coordination of many nations, which might in turn make in unrealistic or simply impossible given the distributed nature of the net. This means that the US could by itself try to protect its IP interests by blocking its own people from accessing the Pirate ISP addresses but what they’re most interested in – extracting the wealth from the developing nations though IP – will be severely harmed as the poor people will simply route via the Pirate ISP for the piracy fix.\n\nTry to muscle Sweden into compliance via Trade Sanctions. They WTO might allow others to embargo Sweden in order to put them into a very bad imports/exports situation, therefore creating civil unrest and hopefully blaming this on the Pirate Party and their ISP and attempt to kick them out of parliament.\n\nI can see the second point being used in conjunction with the first point for the most effect. If those two fail, it will be the 3rd and 4th one, as they do not require the compliance of the Swedish people. Whatever happens though, once again the system will have to reveal its true nature (protecting the plutocracy at the expense of the will of the people) and will once again show how using the state’s tools cannot work if it’s creating too many headaches for the ruling elite.\n\nOf course, I might be wrong and the Pirate ISP will be a success, nothing will be able to take it down and in one fell swoop, Sweden will be liberate file-sharing, which will in turn trigger a chain reaction in the other nations and their own Pirate Parties. But given how much is at stake here, I truly believe we’ll see all the weapons against harmful reformism come into play. It will be interesting to watch, no doubt.\n\nRelated articles by Zemanta\n\nSpread the love: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr",
  "latent_10317": "For federal state and local law enforcement agencies, a little-known practice giving them the power to take Americans’ property, cash, and cars has proven to be a boon over the last decade.\n\nAccording to a new report from the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, the federal government has seen a substantial increase over the last 13 years in the amount of money deposited into forfeiture funds governed by the Departments of Justice and Treasury—the two federal agencies that typically conduct forfeitures.\n\nIn 2014, the Institute for Justice found that net assets, or what’s left over after expenditures, into the agencies’ forfeiture funds reached $4.5 billion—an increase of more than 4,600 percent from 1986, when the Justice Department’s fund was first created. Net assets in the Justice Department’s and Treasury Department’s forfeiture funds first topped $1 billion in 2007 and have moved upward steadily over the last seven years.\n\nAdditionally, from 2001 to 2014, the Justice Department and Treasury Department deposited a combined $29 billion in their respective forfeiture funds, the Institute for Justice found.\n\n“One of the most basic economic principles is that incentives matter, and they matter not just to individuals but also to groups,” the Institute for Justice wrote in its report. “In allowing agencies to keep some or all of what they forfeit, civil forfeiture laws permit, if not encourage, law enforcement to police for profit. And agencies have responded with zeal.”\n\nCivil forfeiture is a tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize cash, cars, and houses if they are suspected of being related to a crime. Originally, the tool was viewed as a way to combat drug trafficking and money laundering. However, as law enforcement budgets have become increasingly strapped for cash—and forfeiture proceeds have increased—civil forfeiture has been dubbed “policing for profit” by critics.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of stories have arisen involving innocent Americans who had property forfeited yet were never charged with a crime. Additionally, civil forfeiture has been called a “gold mine” and “pennies from heaven” by the very law enforcement officials who benefit from the proceeds of cash, cars, and property forfeited.\n\nIn just seven states and the District of Columbia, law enforcement is prohibited from accessing forfeiture proceeds. In several of those states, such as Missouri and New Mexico, all of the proceeds from cash, cars, and houses seized go directly into each state’s general fund.\n\nHowever, in the remaining 43 states, more than 45 percent of forfeiture proceeds are directed back to police departments and prosecutors. At the federal level, agencies using civil forfeiture to seize property can keep 100 percent of the proceeds.\n\n“Giving law enforcement a financial stake in civil forfeiture distorts law enforcement priorities,” the Institute for Justice wrote in its report. “Allowing law enforcement agencies to reap financial benefits from forfeitures encourages the pursuit of property over the impartial administration of justice.”\n\nLaw enforcement’s ability to keep the proceeds from cash, vehicles, and houses seized has provided police and prosecutors with a direct profit incentive, the group warned.\n\n“These allowances represent a significant opportunity for agencies to self-fund through civil forfeiture, and evidence suggests that agencies are taking full advantage,” the group said in its report.\n\nIn response to backlash from critics of civil forfeiture, who argue the practice is being abused by law enforcement, more than a dozen states have introduced or passed legislation to protect property owners and make it more difficult for law enforcement to forfeit property from innocent Americans.\n\nAdditionally, groups including the Institute for Justice have launched three lawsuits in federal court. One targets the use of civil forfeiture in Arizona, another challenges law enforcement in the District of Columbia, and the third—the Institute for Justice’s—protests civil forfeiture in Philadelphia.\n\nDespite these challenges to civil forfeiture in state houses and the federal courts, law enforcement agencies across the country still have a way to skirt state restrictions on civil forfeiture and adhere to federal forfeiture laws instead.\n\nThrough a Justice Department program called Equitable Sharing, law enforcement agencies are subject to federal forfeiture laws through two ways: first, if the conduct leading to the seizure violated federal law, and if local and state law enforcement agencies turn seized property over to the federal government through “adoptions”; and second, if local and state law enforcement agencies work in conjunction with the federal government through joint task forces or investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies participating in the Equitable Sharing program receive up to 80 percent of the proceeds from the cash, vehicles, and houses seized, and in 2014, more than 3,000 state and local agencies participated in the program, the Institute for Justice found.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2013, the Justice Department payments to local and state law enforcement agencies participating in Equitable Sharing topped $4.7 billion, according to the group’s report. Additionally, payments tripled from 2000 to 2013.\n\nIn January, the Justice Department altered its policies related to the Equitable Sharing program, prohibiting federal adoptions. The Treasury Department followed suit.",
  "latent_10338": "Marijuana affects the brain. But marijuana DOES NOT kill brain cells, although there is more evidence that marijuana cause brain damage. We offer a brief review of research on marijuana and the brain below.\n\nMarijuana and the brain\n\nMarijuana affects your brain. The main active ingredient in marijuana is called THC. THC affects the nerve cells in different parts of the brain. As THC binds to nerve receptors in the brain (Ex. in the nucleus accumbens, the cerebellum or the basal ganglia) the brain responds by altering functions in the body or mind. This is why you can feel high on weed, or experience heightened sensory perception, or become clumsy. Each of these effects begin as chemical reactions in the brain.\n\nHippocampus – THC alters how information is processed in the hippocampus and can result in lost memory, difficulty with attention and focus. Memory loss and weed are at the center of current research on the brain.\n\nCerebellum and basal ganglia – THC binds to cannabinoid receptors in these parts of the brain and impairs balance, posture, coordination, and reaction time.\n\nNucleus accumbens – THC activates the brain’s reward system by stimulating brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. This is why you feel high when you smoke weed.\n\nMarijuana and long term changes in the brain\n\nExperts have not linked chronic cannabis to permanent structural changes in the brain. But marijuana’s effects on the brain can build up over time. In addition to possible decreases in mental flexibility and focus over time, potheads are at higher risk of changing serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain (thereby affecting depression and anxiety), developing schizophrenia and/or mood disorders. Although no official evidence exists linking brain deterioration to chronic marijuana use, critical life skills have been self-reported by potheads to worsen over time. Marijuana can negatively affect:\n\ncareer achievement\n\ncognitive abilities\n\nmental health\n\nphysical health\n\nsocial life\n\nNot to mention memory loss…\n\nPerhaps when you’re asking, “Does weed kill brain cells?”, you really want to know if weed makes you stupid, or if memory loss is permanent when you smoke. The short answer is that most THC-related effects on the brain wear off after acute exposure, or are restored when you abstain from marijuana for 4-8 weeks. However, experts do not yet know of the long term effects and permanent changes marijuana can cause on the brain, especially to memory processing\n\nAs people age, they lose neurons in the hippocampus, which decreases their ability to learn new information. This is part of the normal aging process. But when you smoke weed, you may actually speed up the loss of these neurons, resulting in loss of memory. In fact, chronic THC exposure in animals has been shown to quicken related loss of hippocampus neurons. Rats exposed to THC every day for 8 months (approximately 30 % of their lifespan) showed a level of nerve cell loss that equaled that of unexposed animals twice their age.\n\nIn conclusion, although chronic marijuana use does not kill brain cells directly, smoking daily can trigger early loss of memory and alter your brain in ways that we do not yet know.\n\nMarijuana problems?\n\nEating weed to get high is a sign that you can get addicted to marijuana. But in addition to psychological symptoms of addiction, physical symptoms may also be present. Are you noticing a loss of memory or brain function as a result of smoking chronic weed? Are you worried that you cannot stop smoking weed because you may get depressed? Or do you think you should cut back on your weed intake? These are all signs that you may be addicted to marijuana. You CAN get help. Please leave your questions here, and we’ll direct you to information or services for weed addiction. We respond to all earnest queries personally!",
  "latent_10365": "There has been considerable debate about the representation of human population genetics in a recent book by journalist Nicholas Wade: A Troublesome Inheritance. A letter http://cehg.stanford.edu/letter-from-population-geneticists/signed by 143 scientists, including 16 members of the PLOS Genetics Editorial Board, and PLOS founder Mike Eisen, criticized the book in the New York Times Book Review on August 8, 2014. As there is widespread interest in this issue from our Editorial Board, we have invited Marcus Feldman to publish his book review in PLOS Genetics.\n\nIn 1969, Arthur Jensen ignited a decades-long debate when he wrote that it is a “not unreasonable hypothesis that genetic factors are strongly implicated in the average Negro–white intelligence difference” [1]. From this he inferred that educational interventions in communities whose members have lower measured intelligence quotient (IQ) could not succeed.\n\nThe errors in Jensen's choice of data [2] and statistical methods used to compute a heritability of about 80% for measured IQ were pointed out by numerous geneticists and statisticians. 25 years after Jensen's incendiary paper, Herrnstein and Murray's book, The Bell Curve [3], drew inferences similar to Jensen's that differences among races and social classes in IQ were genetically based. The Bell Curve elicited a flood of strong criticisms of the data used, the statistical analyses, and the policy inferences [4]. Much of the criticism of Jensen and Herrnstein and Murray centers on their interpretation of heritability of IQ. In 1975, Richard Lewontin and I [5] stressed the failure of the heritability statistic to do what these authors claim; namely, to show that IQ is largely genetically determined and hence that traits related to IQ, such as educational or economic success, would be impervious to environmental intervention.\n\nAs pointed out by Nicholas Wade in the first half of A Troublesome Inheritance, we are now in a genomic age, where individual differences at the level of DNA can be detected. The early chapters present a hodgepodge of historical ideas about race, aggression, and genetics. On page 57, Wade gives an inkling of what will come in the last half of the book: “important aspects of human social behavior are shaped by the genes” and “these behavior traits are likely to vary from one race to another, sometimes significantly so” [6].\n\nWhereas inferences on the causes of human behavioral variation referred to above were based on correlations between relatives, on pages 97–99 Wade develops his arguments for the genetic basis of social behaviors in the second half of A Troubled Inheritance from results on worldwide variation in DNA polymorphisms, namely microsatellite polymorphisms (The Rosenberg-Feldman studies) [7], [8] and single nucleotide polymorphisms (another Stanford study) [9], from the Human Genome Diversity Panel [10]. Here, as in his previous journalism about these studies, Wade exhibits a complete lack of understanding of their implications. For example, he does not mention the finding, stressed in both studies, that only 5%–10% of the worldwide genomic variation is between continental groups, while the vast majority is between individuals within populations.\n\nUsing data from 15 protein genes, R. C. Lewontin in 1972 [11] was the first to point out that the overwhelming majority of human genotypic variation is within populations, and that continental “races” differed little genetically. 25 years later, Barbujani et al. [12] came to the same conclusion from their study of 109 DNA markers. Wade (page 120) criticizes Lewontin's conclusion that “racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance” as representing Lewontin's “political stake in the issue.”\n\nFrom the data and analyses of worldwide molecular genomic variation, Richard Lewontin and I amplified the conclusions of Lewontin and Barbujani et al. as follows: “The repeated and consistent results on the apportionment of genetic diversity…show that the genes underlying the phenotypic differences used to assign race categories are atypical of the genome in general and are not a reliable index to the amount of genetic differentiation between groups. Thus, racial assignment loses any general biological interest. For the human species, race assignment of individuals does not carry with it any general implication about genetic differentiation” [13]. The increased resolution on patterns of human variation that we now have has enabled us to understand a great deal about human migration, admixture, population size, and natural selection. However, it has not told us that the earlier studies underestimated the biological reality of race.\n\nEven though the between-continent fraction of genetic variation is small, as the reader discovers on leaving the first half of A Troublesome Inheritance, Wade's erroneous interpretation of its significance for racial differences becomes the basis for his entry into the “speculative arena at the interface of history, economics, and human evolution” (page 15). In the second half of the book, he claims that differences among continents in economic development, social institutions, and social behaviors are based in genetics. This classic correlation–causation error cannot be excused on the grounds that Wade is just speculating; continents can be distinguished genetically; they also have different economic and social histories. One cannot conclude, as Wade does, that the former causes the latter.\n\nThe first paragraph of chapter seven summarizes Wade's process of inference: “Each of the major civilizations has developed institutions appropriate for its circumstances and survival. But these institutions, though heavily imbued with cultural traditions, rest on a bedrock of genetically shaped human behavior; and when a civilization produces a distinctive set of institutions that endures for many generations, that is the sign of a supporting suite of variations in the genes that influence human social behavior.” I will focus on two of the studies invoked by Wade to justify his totally unfounded claims that differences in the societies of different continents (which he terms “races” even though in a biological sense they are not understood as such) are due to their genetic differences.\n\nThe first is by Gregory Clark, an economic historian who studies changes in interpersonal violence, literacy, the propensity to save, and the propensity to work in the English population from 1200 CE to 1800 CE [14]. As Wade puts it on page 154, during this period “the nature of the people had changed.” Between 1200 and 1800, “these behavioral changes in the English population…gradually transformed a violent and undisciplined peasant population into an efficient and productive workforce.” On pages 159–161, Wade explains how this happened. “Clark has uncovered the simple genetic mechanism…the rich had more surviving children than the poor.” And further, “Most children of the rich had to sink in the social scale,” and as a result, “their social descent had the far reaching genetic consequence that they carried with them the same behaviors that had made their parents rich.”\n\nAgainst the argument that changing culture may have been involved in the 600-year process, Wade states (page 160) that these “behaviors emerged gradually over several centuries, a time course more typical of an evolutionary change than a cultural change.” To justify his claim that 600 years is enough time to have produced “significant changes in social behavior” (page 161) of the English, Wade leans on experiments by Belyaev, who artificially selected silver foxes for tameness. The strength of this selection was extreme: “typically not more than 4 or 5 percent of male offspring and about 20 percent of female offspring have been allowed to breed” [15]. The strongest natural selection on humans is orders of magnitude weaker than this “sufficiently intense” artificial selection imposed on the foxes (page 161). Few evolutionists would agree that 600 years, that is, about 25 generations, is long enough for such significant behavioral changes to be due to human genetic evolution; here and elsewhere in the book, Wade uses “evolutionary” where it is obvious that he means “genetic.” “Ingrained” is another euphemism he occasionally uses. For example, on page 177, “Tribal behavior is more deeply ingrained than are mere cultural prescriptions. Its longevity and stability point strongly to a genetic basis.” Galton and Pearson would have approved of Wade's espousal of a genetic basis for class differences; there is more than a whiff of eugenics here.\n\nWade devotes almost four pages of chapter seven, the longest chapter in the book, to IQ. After claiming (page 190) that “intelligence is almost certainly under genetic influence,” he goes on to discuss the relationship between wealth and IQ and invokes the work of Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen, in particular their book IQ and Global Inequality [16].\n\nLynn is known for his work as an associate editor of The Mankind Quarterly, described by the famous psychologist Leon Kamin as a “vulgarly racist” [17] journal. Lynn's 1991 paper on IQ of Africans is described by Kamin as “truly venomous racism, combined with scandalous disregard for scientific objectivity” [17]. In 2002, Lynn wrote the nonsensical statement: “The conclusion that there is a true association between skin color and IQ is consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors are partly responsible for the black–white difference in intelligence…the evidence that a statistically significant correlation is present confirms the genetic hypothesis” [18]. In placing so much emphasis on Lynn's work (which was strongly supported by the notorious Pioneer Fund, which also supported William Shockley and was chaired by an even more notorious scholar, J. Philippe Rushton), Wade has apparently chosen to ignore important studies on IQ and environment such as those by Brooks–Gunn et al. [19] and Turkheimer et al. [20]. Brooks–Gunn found that “adjustments for economic and social differences in the lives of black and white children all but eliminate differences in the IQ scores between the two groups,” suggesting that socioeconomic status (SES) might be an important contributor to high heritability estimates. In the same vein, Turkheimer et al. found that heritability of IQ depended strongly on SES: there was a high heritability in higher SES environments, but not in low SES environments. By omitting reference to such studies that find very strong environmental contributions to IQ, while focusing on Richard Lynn, the book takes a very hereditarian stance.\n\nWade gives the appearance (page 192) of care in interpreting Lynn and Vanhanen: “It is hard to know which way the arrow of causality may be pointing, whether higher IQ makes a nation wealthier or whether a wealthy nation enables its citizens to do better on IQ tests.” However, from his statement (page 203) about “the strong heritability of intelligence” and his belief (page 160, referring back to Clark) that in England “the children of the rich carried with them inheritance for the same behaviors that made their parents rich,” we can only assume that Wade believes there is a genetic basis for both IQ and wealth. His “arrow of causality” has two points, with genetics responsible for both IQ and wealth.\n\nThis section of the book is redolent of the claims of Jensen, as well as Herrnstein and Murray, mentioned at the beginning of this review. It also harks back to claims by Taubman [21] in the 1970s, based on correlations between relatives, that variation between individuals in wealth has a strong genetic basis. It is most informative to compare Goldberger's 1977 [22] criticism of Taubman's analysis with related negative evaluations of studies on heritability of IQ. By invoking Richard Lynn on racial variation in IQ and wealth, Wade departs from his “speculative arena,” leaving us to infer that he is a devout hereditarian.\n\nWade goes even further than proposing a genetic basis for continental variation in wealth; he would have us believe that differences in economic and political institutions among populations have a genetic basis. On page 196, he criticizes the book Why Nations Fail by Acemoglu and Robinson [23] because “they have ruled out the obvious possibility that variations in human behavior are the cause of good or bad institutions.” Variation in institutions is why “a part of the world has grown steadily and vastly richer over the past 300 years.” He concludes that a reasonable explanation for this variation “is available in terms of human evolution.”\n\nWade is using “evolution” here to mean the production and maintenance of genetic differences, and “variations in human behavior” is his euphemism for racial, and hence (in his understanding) genetic differences. He appears to backtrack slightly in the final chapter (pages 240–241), where he poses the paradox “that people as individuals are so similar yet human societies differ so copiously.” His resolution of the paradox is that these societal differences “stem from the quite minor variations in human social behavior…that have evolved within each race during its geographical and historical experience.” Again, “evolved” must be understood in genetic terms: it is “because of their institutions—which are largely cultural edifices resting on a base of genetically shaped social behaviors—that the societies of the West and East Asia are so different.”\n\nWe can juxtapose Wade's conclusions on the genetic basis of racial differences in wealth, economies, and institutions with those of Ashraf and Galor on a similar topic. Their claim was that the high and low molecular genetic diversity characteristic of African and Native American populations, respectively, “have been detrimental for the development of these regions,” while “the intermediate levels of diversity associated with European and Asian populations have been conducive for development” [24]. Wade's use of worldwide patterns of human molecular genetic variation to define races and his inference that genetic variation between races explains their economic differences are qualitatively similar to Ashraf and Galor's thesis. Speculation aside, readers of A Troublesome Inheritance are advised to heed the admonition by Guedes et al. concerning Ashraf and Galor: “bold claims on the basis of weak data and methods can have profoundly detrimental social and political effects” [25].\n\nWade's premise is that molecular population genetics has shown sufficient variation between continents to define races. He argues (page 126) that these genetic differences are responsible for differences in individual social behaviors that “undergird” societal institutions, which themselves differ among races. Ironically, the molecular genomic data that have become available in the last fifteen years—the very data that Wade argues we need to bravely acknowledge—explain in terms of admixture, gene flow, demographic change, etc., why human genetic variation is arrayed the way it is. Echoes of the hereditarian arguments about racial difference in IQ and the reductionist arguments of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology resound in A Troublesome Inheritance. I have no trouble with the existence of human genetic variation. It is Wade's dangerous interpretation, however speculative, of the meaning of human genetic variation that is indeed troublesome.",

That's right, prices continued to climb setting new records in both boroughs in more than one category. For starters, Brooklyn and Queens set new records for median and average sales price. Brooklyn's median sales price now dangles around $676,250, meaning that it's the only boroughManhattan includedwhere the median sales price has exceeded its pre-Lehman high. Elliman market reports compiler Jonathan Miller chalks this up to Brooklyn's new post-recession identity as destination. Brooklyn's growing cachet isn't news to anyone who's been paying attention the last few years. But here's just how much things have changed for the borough: the median sales price in Brooklyn is now 25-percent above its pre-recession high in 2007. Neither Manhattan nor Queens sales prices have even caught up to their 2007 numbers yet.\n\nThat said, neither Queens nor Manhattan (which we canvased last week) is too far behind. The median sales price in Queenscomprised in Elliman data of LIC, Astoria, Woodside, and Sunnysideis now $450,865, which is 14-percent more than it was at this time last year and only six percent less than its pre-Lehman high. Not only has Queens blasted its median and average sales records in Q3, but it's also set new records for one- through three-bedroom apartments, condos, co-ops, and luxury apartments. Talk about a hot quarter. To what can Queens owe all of its success? \"We don't have fast and loose credit this time around,\" Miller says, \"so if price [in Manhattan or Brooklyn] is too high there isn't some 'magic' your local mortgage broker can do to get you the financing you need.\" The consistent rising prices and crunch of inventory is putting more stress on Queens, driving prices higher.\n\nThe search for affordability also in part drove the median rent in Queens ($2,954) to outpace the median rent in Brooklyn ($2,953) in Augustby all of $1. Although that sounds impressive, Miller says that happens about every four to five months, because the market in Queens is so volatile, yet consistently high.\n\nIt wasn't a blockbuster month for Brooklyn rents, but that doesn't mean they're not climbing. September was the sixth consecutive month that median rental prices were up year-over-year. Rents in the borough are down about five percent from August, but that can be attributed to nothing more than seasonal flux. But it wouldn't be Brooklyn if at least some new records weren't set: the median price for a one-bedroom of $2,896 is the highest it's been since 2008, and the median rental price in the north (Williamsburg, Greenpoint) and east (Crown Heights, East NY) regions of Brooklyn is peaking.\n\nAlthough Brooklyn's gaining on Manhattan, Manhattan rents continue to dominate. September's median rent of $3,437 is the highest its been since the recession, trailing only behind the all-time record of $3,695 in February 2009. Year-over-year, the median rental price in Manhattan has now been on the rise for 19 consecutive months.\n\nOther real estate firms also report similar numbers. Cocoran's Brooklyn Q3 sales market report says that the borough's median price of $623,000 is 28 percent above last year's figure, representing the highest annual median price gain since 2008, at least. Sales between $1 million and $2 million were accountable for 20 percent of sales in Brooklyn in Q3, and the sale of properties priced between $0 and $350,000 (a bleak sampling, this way) was down 12 percent from this time last year.\n\nMNS also found that rental prices in Brooklyn were up in Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Bed-Stuy, but down in Crown Heights and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens (although nominally), where Elliman saw gains. This might be because of how the two firms crunch their numbers; Elliman uses median when MNS uses average. Whatever way they go about milking their stats, MNS also found that Manhattan's red hot. The map below can speak for itself.\n\nTL;DR: Q3 brought new records for median and average sales prices in both Brooklyn and Queens. Brooklyn's median sales price is the only to exceed its pre-Lehman high (and by a whole 25 percent.) Sales market prices in Queens are trailing, but not by all that much. In September, Queens's median rent outpaced Brooklyn's by all of $1, which isn't all that uncommon. Manhattan's median rent in September of $3,437 is the highest its been since the recession (the all-time record is $3,695 in February 2009.)\n\n· Brooklyn Q3 2015 Sales [Elliman]\n\n· Queens Q3 2015 Sales [Elliman]\n\n· Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens Rental Market Report - September 2015 [Elliman]\n\n· Brooklyn Q3 Sales Report [Corcoran]\n\n· Manhattan Rental Market Report September 2015 [MNS]\n\n· Brooklyn Rental Market Report September 2015 [MNS]\n\n· Queens Rental Market Report September 2015 [MNS]\n\n· As Manhattan Prices Keep Climbing, Inventory Plummets [Curbed]\n\n· Market Reports archives [Curbed]",
  "latent_10463": "Image copyright Science Photo Library\n\nIn his column today, the FT's Martin Wolf assesses the economic record of the coalition government. But any assessment of the current government's record can't just begin in 2010, they did not inherit a blank slate, any more than the incoming Labour government did in 1997.\n\nWolf today writes that \"the argument that the UK economy was in a grossly unsustainable state in 2007 is largely ex-post rationalisation.\" That's a point recently made by Oxford Economics Professor Simon Wren-Lewis in a series of posts arguing against what he terms \"media macro\" - or macroeconomic reporting - that he feels bears no relation to reality.\n\nThis question - of whether the UK economy was in a sustainable or an unsustainable position in 2007 is important. It doesn't just help us judge the performance of the last two governments but it may also give us clues to the state of the economy today.\n\nProf Wren-Lewis's case against an unsustainable boom is straightforward.\n\nFirstly he notes that, while there was clearly a boom in house prices, that isn't necessarily reflective of the wider state of the economy.\n\nSecondly he turns to the concept at the heart of this economic debate: \"output gap\". That's the gap between how much output the economy is actually producing and the level of output which would keep inflation constant.\n\nIn simple terms it's a way of thinking about the relationship between the demand side of the economy (spending) and the supply side (or the economy's ability to produce goods and services).\n\nThe output gap is not something that can be 'measured', only 'estimated' and that can make it a difficult guide to policy\n\nA positive output gap suggests an economy is at risk of overheating: the demand for goods is outstripping supply and one would expect prices to rise. If the output gap is negative, then the opposite is happening: the economy's ability provide goods and services is not being matched by adequate for demand for that output.\n\nAs Prof Wren-Lewis notes, back in 2007 the Treasury, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies and international observers such as the IMF and the OECD all believed the UK output gap was small. That's a strong case against an unsustainable boom.\n\nAs Wren-Lewis argues, there was also little sign of a problem in the unemployment data, inflation or interest rates.\n\nProductivity growth\n\nSubsequently the IMF and OECD have both - in retrospect - raised their estimates of the UK output gap in 2007 substantially. In effect they now argue that although they did not see it at the time, the UK's position in 2007 was indeed unsustainable.\n\nThe output gap is not something that can be \"measured\", only \"estimated\" and that can make it a difficult guide to policy.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Martin Wolf is the chief economics commentator at the Financial Times\n\nFurther support for Wren-Lewis and Wolf's position can be found in a study published in 2011 by the London School of Economics on the UK's economic record since 1997. It found that the UK enjoyed a strong performance in terms of growth and employment until 2007 and that crucially this was underpinned by strong productivity growth.\n\nA plausible story can be told, that the UK enjoyed a strong performance in terms of economic growth, employment and productivity from 1997 until 2007, when it was knocked off course by global events and financial crisis. But there are at least three reasons to think this might not be the whole picture.\n\nFirst, as has since gained relatively widespread acceptance - growth by 2007 has become unbalanced. That's a point that is now made by politicians from all the major parties.\n\nIn particular the UK's tax base had become overly reliant on too few sectors. This was a point made by the OBR in July 2011, which argued that the fall in revenue from the finance and housing sectors post-2008 was \"one of the primary drivers of the severe deterioration in the UK public finances in recent years, exposing the risks to sustainability of reliance on revenue from these sectors\".\n\nMiracle or mirage?\n\nSecond, there are reasons to fret that the strong productivity performance that underpinned growth was not all that it appeared to be.\n\nAndy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, has argued that what was seen at the time as a \"productivity miracle\" in financial services may have actually been a \"mirage\". As banks ran more risks their profits increased and they appeared to be much more productive but eventually those risks turned bad.\n\nThis offers a partial and pessimistic answer to the UK's high-profile productivity puzzle: it may be that productivity growth didn't suddenly fall off a cliff in 2008, it was actually weaker than it appeared all along.\n\nFinally, though, most of the above analysis has concentrated on the traditional ways in which we score macroeconomic performance - growth, jobs and productivity - looked at through an alternative frame that performance looks impressive. An important Bank of England research paper published in 2011 provides that alternative frame.\n\nRather than focusing on just GDP and other \"real\" factors it takes seriously financial factors - the flow of credit between different sectors, changes in asset prices and the state of household, company and bank balance sheets. As the authors of that paper concluded:\n\n\"While real activity and consumer prices were stable, asset prices, financing flows and balance sheets were manifestly not. There were two distinct episodes in financial markets over this period: the tech boom of the 90s and the credit expansion of the 2000s. When the credit boom collapsed it completely overwhelmed the system.\"\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption The Bank of England looked at an alternative measure of performance that included household, company and bank balance sheets\n\nIt's this analysis which really demonstrates the importance of what might sound like a sterile academic and historical debate.\n\nA focus on balance sheets, asset prices and credit flows rings alarm bells about the state of the UK economy in 2007. It suggests that the experience of 2008 onwards was not just a sudden bolt from the blue but the result of fundamental imbalances in the UK economy.\n\nWhile credit growth has been much weaker in recent years than before 2007, there are reasons to worry that the UK's current recovery is demonstrating some of the same patterns.\n\nThe household savings ratio (the amount of their income saved by households in aggregate), which rose in 2009 and 2010, has now fallen back to roughly where it was in the middle of the last decade. Asset prices (from shares to houses) have risen strongly and the UK is running its largest current account deficit (borrowing from the rest of the world) since the Second World War.\n\nThe economics profession is divided on whether the UK's position in 2007 was unsustainable or not. But if it was unsustainable in 2007 then there are reasons to worry it might be becoming so once again.",
  "latent_10484": "The creation of one successful machine would be a great accomplishment for any inventor. But with Mr. Redmond, a small man who at an interview wore a brown herringbone vest buttoned at every hole and a white dress shirt rolled up at the sleeves, you get the feeling that he would have invented many more had he not been held back.\n\nMr. Redmond invented his first machine, a high-speed wrapping machine for frozen foods, when he was still in his teens. While in the Army during World War II, he worked on a team designing a high-speed camera for use in the nuclear development project at Los Alamos, N.M. After the war, he moved back to New York City to work for his father, who owned Dexter Bishop Inc., a wholesale restaurant food supply business. The company packaged butter pats for restaurants and institutions.\n\nAT the time, butter pats were arranged in rows on large pieces of greaseproof paper, then folded and sold by the pound. Restaurants would then unfold the paper and transfer the pats one by one onto paper cards.\n\nIn 1959, Mr. Redmond reconfigured the machine to put the pats on small squares of paperboard, cover them with greaseproof paper and stack them so that they could be sold in packs. His machine, which saved time and money for restaurants, airlines, hotels and other customers, was an instant hit.\n\nBut trouble began just as Mr. Redmond started work on designing a machine that would load the stacks onto trays. Mr. Redmond's father sued him, contending waste of money and mismanagement. The case dragged on for 11 years, ending in a settlement. In the meantime, his royalties from his butter pat machine patent grew to $80 million.\n\nAfter his father died in 1982, Mr. Redmond created the dispenSRpak, but operating the family business would often distract him from pursuing other inventions. He gradually downsized the business from 50 to 6. ''I want to get out of running a business,'' he said. ''I'm lousy at it.''\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nHis company, Sanford Redmond Inc., created after his settlement, has remained in a rundown building in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the South Bronx. Its large machine shop, with just two workers, feels like a graveyard. The fields of offices are empty. Mr. Redmond and his relentless flurry of ideas are its pulse, however faint.\n\nHis new packaging designs are promising: they are much less expensive to produce than current designs and use much less plastic. ''The way to help the environment is not to recycle,'' he said. ''It is to use less plastic.''\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is also the general philosophy of environmental groups. ''In a case like food packaging, especially condiment packaging,'' said Richard Denison, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense, an advocacy group in Washington, ''using the least amount of materials is really the optimal approach.'' Chances for recycling are minimal for most condiment packages, each of which is used just once, usually outside the home.\n\nMr. Redmond's designs are also timely, as a European trend toward reducing packaging waste is picking up speed in the United States.\n\nHIS dispenSRpak II, for instance, uses much less plastic than his original and costs less than one-third as much to produce. Then there are the cream dispensers. Current varieties have aluminum-coated paper tops; Mr. Redmond was unhappy with the way the liquid squirts upon opening them and then spills over when set down. To use his version, you just snap the corner of the lid, then squeeze the desired amount through a valve. When you stop, it doesn't drip. Even if you shake it, no liquid spills out. A similar design, with a slightly larger valve, can be used for jellies, jams, even liquid laundry detergent.\n\nHe has also come up with a new ketchup packet that has a snap in the corner instead of a tear line. If you don't use all the ketchup, you can reseal the snap.\n\n''His packages are very innovative and very interesting,'' not only for the design, but for the cost saving potential, said Koji Goto, the manager of the paper and packaging department of Mitsubishi.\n\nFor now, the likelihood of a lone inventor joining forces with this corporate giant is uncertain. If Mr. Redmond fails, he plans to build the machines himself and try to sell them. Or -- he winced at the thought -- retire to his home in Connecticut and collect royalties on the butter pat machine, which he says amount to roughly $2 million a year.\n\nSitting behind his desk, leaning back in his tattered orange leather chair with his arms crossed above his head, it was easy to see that this is not what he wants. His grandfather was an inventor, too. It is in Mr. Redmond's blood. He loves machines -- large, complex machines -- and would not settle for tinkering with gadgets at home. He is much more concerned about creating machines than in what they produce. He doesn't even eat butter.",
  "latent_10587": "Paperback Edition, Penguin Books UK - 1999\n\nThe Surgeon of Crowthorne: A Tale of Murder, Madness and the Love of Words is a book by Simon Winchester that was first published in England in 1998. It was retitled The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary in the United States and Canada.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIt tells the story of the making of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and one of its most prolific early contributors, Dr. W. C. Minor, a retired United States Army surgeon. Minor was, at the time, imprisoned in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, near the village of Crowthorne in Berkshire, England. The 'professor' of the American title is the chief editor of the OED during most of the project, Sir James Murray. Murray was a talented linguist and had other scholarly interests, and he had taught in schools and worked in banking. Faced with the enormous task of producing a comprehensive dictionary, with a quotation illustrating the uses of each meaning of each word, and with evidence for the earliest use of each, Murray had turned to an early form of crowdsourcing (a word not coined until the 21st century)—enlisting the help of dozens of amateur philologists as volunteer researchers.\n\nHistory of creation [ edit ]\n\nA journalist with three decades of experience, and the author of a dozen travel-inspired books, Winchester's initial proposal to write a book about an obscure lexicographer met with rejection. Only when Harper Collins editor Larry Ashmead read the proposal and championed the book did Winchester pursue the necessary research in earnest.[1] Of the project Ashmead said \"we can make lexicography cool\".[2] It was Ashmead who persuaded Winchester to call the US edition The Professor and the Madman (over Winchester's objection that Murray was not a professor), saying \"No one here knows what the hell a Crowthorne is.\"[2]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nThe book was a major success.[3][4][5] Winchester went on to write The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary (2003) about the broader history of the OED.\n\nCinematization [ edit ]\n\nThe movie rights for the book were bought by Mel Gibson's Icon Productions in 1998.[1] John Boorman wrote a script and was at one time tapped to direct, as was Luc Besson.[1][6][7] In August 2016 it was announced that Farhad Safinia was to direct an adaptation, called The Professor and the Madman, starring Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor.[8]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nEditions [ edit ]",
  "latent_10589": "Drakkhen is an early-3D western role-playing video game, initially developed for the Amiga and Atari ST, and subsequently ported to several other platforms, including MS-DOS and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was a very early game in the North American SNES library, and as such, received almost universal coverage in previews of the then-upcoming SNES in gaming magazines of 1990 and early 1991. In February 2018, the DOS version of the game was made available on Steam[1] and in June 2018 on GOG.com.[2]\n\nDrakkhen was notable for being among the first role-playing games to feature a three-dimensional playing field and for being an early example of the real time tactics genre. It did not employ a fully 3D game engine, instead implementing a hybrid approach using vectors and bitmapped character-scaling algorithms. Drakkhen features an animated day-night cycle, and the ability to wander freely about the game world, both rarities for a game of its era. The game spawned a sequel, Dragon View, for the SNES.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nA player may freely travel the entirety of Drakkhen's game world not long after beginning a new game, although this can be unwise in practice. Chance encounters with hostile monsters are regular, and unlike many other RPGs, the player may be attacked while stationary. All battles against foe are automated by default, but allow the player to micromanage their four combatants. The player is given more time to focus on the real-time tactics of each enemy encounter, such as activating defense magic, moving around, or switching weapons on the fly. The player's party may also be accosted at night when viewing constellations in the sky, or any time after bumping into a half-buried urn. Players may attempt to flee from attackers, but defeating foes grants all party members experience points that go towards leveling up and improving character stats. Each of the four characters in the player's party have health points, magic points for spellcasting, power, defense, physique, fortune, intelligence, knowledge, and agility; each stat listed has a direct effect on how a character plays. Character stats are assigned by the player at the start of the game using a cap-and-trade system. Each party member[a] fills one of the four roles: scout, wizard, fighter, and priest, each with different strengths and abilities.[3] Items can be purchased from traveling merchants who ambush the party, or at the tavern. Items are categorized as armor, weapons, healing items, rings, and misc. (such as torches).[3]\n\nPast castles[b] can be revisited at any time, which themselves act like Temples found in Legend of Zelda games. Castles are self-contained levels with obstacles, loot, enemies, and maze-like architecture.\n\nThe Shadowman just before engaging the player's party\n\nSome standout enemies are \"enormous\" and imposing such as the black, stationary canine heads that rise out of the ground and growl while shooting bolts from their eyes in the event the player kicks one of the many urns. These encounters are quickly fatal to new players who don't know any better.[4] They offer no experience points, suggesting that kicking an urn is frowned upon by the game. Another notorious difficult enemy is the \"Shadow Man\", a tall figure that can unexpectedly emerge from the ground, accompanied by an ominous tune. Enemies of this power are usually far from the starting area, but are nevertheless accessible to unsuspecting players. The game contains over one hundred different enemy types, including all variants of the Drakkhen soldier.[5]\n\nDifferences between computer and SNES game [ edit ]\n\nIn general, the SNES version of Drakkhen is drastically different to the point of being more than a typical port.\n\nPredating both Ultima Underworld (1992) and Eye of the Beholder (1991), Drakkhen was among the first action RPGs to utilize a permanent, real-time, text-adventure log window, demonstrating large influence from MUD games. This log functions like a dungeon master, frequently telling the player how much damage an attack did, explaining the outcome of intended actions, acting as the player's five senses, et cetera.[4] This feature was de-emphasized for the SNES. The computer versions made heavier use of the adventure game buttons within castles to solve deeper and more plentiful obstacles. The originals were criticized for lacking a compass, which the SNES developers took to heart when they made changes to the new version. The SNES doesn't use a visual compass but instead tells the player which of the 360-degrees he or she faces anytime the game is paused.[4] The computer versions allow for greater nuance when traveling the 3D island, playing to the strength of utilizing a mouse cursor, while the SNES version uses the control-pad. As such, maneuvering around scenery is clunkier on SNES.\n\nThe short story collection that came with the game, aside from expanding the story of the game itself, also incorporated clues as to what the player needed to do, what enemies would be difficult, and other such context that the player was expected to know before playing.[6] The SNES re-release of Drakkhen didn't come with this supplemental book that was written by Gary Gygax, who had a hand in designing the gameplay and story of the original, as well as many enemies. This exclusion was likely because the game story was entirely rewritten, which nevertheless rendered the SNES version without the context necessary to experience the game the way the developers intended. The SNES version has far fewer NPCs that can be approached.\n\nFleeing any battle in the SNES version is as simple as tapping the L and R bumpers, which makes all battles outside castles entirely optional, as this doesn't give enemies time to attack. The interface was changed to utilize visual means to more quickly communicate ideas, and the clutter originally covering the left half of the screen was condensed into the bottom. In the original two versions, crossing the borders between continental divisions would require a wait while the game loaded. In the SNES version, crossings are instantaneous; however, if the player attempts to cross between areas before the first few story beats, they are sharply rebuked.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe original French release\n\nThe setting of Drakkhen is a large rectangular island, divided laterally into four smaller regions. Each region has its own terrain and climate and is ruled by two members of the Drakkhen caste, with all of them living in their own castle. The continent is bounded on all sides by a vast ocean; walking into this, or any other body of water, will result in the drowning of all party members.\n\nMuch of the game is spent traveling between castles, carrying out various political missions at the behest of the ruling Drakkhen elite. A player may also wander around without having a particular goal or destination, perhaps in the spirit of adventure, or exploration, or to fight wildlife, monsters, and strange supernatural entities, who may yield loot if they are defeated. Serious setbacks can easily occur through the death of one or more party members in combat, and bringing them back to life will often involve difficult and arduous travel in order to reach an Anak, where healing and resurrection are performed pro bono. If all four characters succumb to injury or drowning, the player will be informed of the dire consequences for the game world, before being returned to the title screen.\n\nStoryline [ edit ]\n\nInside one of the castles\n\nThe story differs depending on which version is being played.\n\nThe original versions [ edit ]\n\nLong ago, the magic of \"the world\" faded away with the slaying of the final dragon by a selfish paladin all the while a plague is decimating humanity. Long after, a caravel ship of foreign countrymen shipwrecked on the island where the final dragon died, only to be attacked and sunk by a foe unknown and unseen from their perspective.[6] These foes revealed themselves to be lizard-people, thought to be the evolved survivors of the ancient dragons and the dominant people of the island. Four survivors made it ashore and vowed to stick together. They soon discovered that to take back the island in the name of humanity and to end the curse, they will need to pillage the nine gem tears and use them to summon the dragon god.[6] To their surprise, certain princes and princess of the Drakkhen clan offer their support—even their life—for the party, believing that their kind was never meant for Earth. As such, the four heroes get caught up in an ongoing war between those acting for the survival of their own kind, and those who see themselves as abominations.\n\nAn included short story book expands the backstory.\n\nSNES alternate storyline [ edit ]\n\nThe storyline for the SNES game is the result of a broken translation and rewrite of the original, as well as lack of supplemental stories. Drakkhen was developed by a French team, which was then translated into Japanese for the Super Famicom, which was then translated to English and further rewritten with help from the original French developers. To exemplify the telephone effect of all this, the original game contained a French translation of an Emily Dickinson poem as quoted by a mysterious wizard, and that French translation of an English poem was then translated further into Japanese for the Super Famicom version, and then translated again back into English from Japanese. The version of the Dickinson poem that survived into the SNES version of the game is almost unrecognizable and difficult to comprehend.\n\nAccording to the SNES game, a subset of humans known as the Drakkonian people are presently doomed, for the dragon gods of the four elements judged them as unworthy and are soon to put an end to their survival. Each god has a son and daughter dragon prince and princess who rule the island of Drakkhen. Drakkhen, himself, is a 5th dragon god, one who the other four stole eight of the nine, magic, blue artifacts (the Nine Tears) from, to do their cruel bidding upon the Drakkonian people. Four warriors stepped up to the challenge of proving their worth as a people to Drakkhen.[3] Their agreement is that if they can recover his eight Tears, their people will be spared, and the four Gods, their offspring, and their offspring's lizard-people armies will all perish instead. Like in the other version of the story, some sons and daughters of the Gods agree to help the player even if it means they suffer extinction for doing so, demonstrating a deep selflessness.\n\nContinental divisions [ edit ]\n\nThe Drakkhen map (SNES)\n\nArctic Wasteland Domain of the Prince and Princess of Air, both of whom live in large glacier-shaped castles. Swampland (dark green) Domain of the Prince and Princess of Water, the former living in a large castle and the latter in what resembles a pagoda. This area has the greatest number of rivers and lakes. Grassland (light green) Domain of the Prince and Princess of Earth, who live in identical-looking castles. This is where the adventure begins. In the centre is a glowing boundary that is heavily guarded. Desert Domain of the Prince and Princess of Fire, the former living in what resembles an Aztec pyramid and the latter in a large Taj Mahal or mosque-like building (incorrectly called a \"minaret\").\n\nMusic and audio [ edit ]\n\nThe Anak music is arguably derived from the song 12 O'clock by Greek composer Vangelis.\n\nThe SNES version of the game censors the screams of the \"Love Monster.\" In the original, a shadow shaped like a frantic, giant woman repeatedly shouts \"I love you\" in a chorus of demonic voices, but in the SNES version, she instead moans not unlike how other enemies do.[5] This may be related to Nintendo wanting to keep their reputation as a family-friendly operation without any traces of sensuality.\n\nDrakkhen is known for its unusual sound effects; in lieu of speech, monsters and NPCs make noises that resemble belching, chittering, or inarticulate rumbling. Early releases made only limited use of music during gameplay, but the game's soundtrack was expanded for the SNES version.[7]\n\nDevelopment and ports [ edit ]\n\nDrakkhen was originally released in 1989 by Infogrames two years after being presented at gaming expos. It was translated for North American release in 1990 by Draconian, a label from Data East. By the time review copies of the original were given to the press, Infogrames claimed to have no \"immediate\" intention of porting the game.[4] The many subsequent computer ports were unannounced until the DOS port was about to be released in late 1989. In 1991, Drakkhen was ported to the Super Nintendo by Kemco-Seika, who made several revisions to the game, mostly by necessity.[8]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nDrakkhen was a commercial success, with sales above 350,000 units.[9]\n\nDrakkhen for the SNES attracted a modest cult following and was fairly well received by English game critics when first released in 1989. The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #160 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.[10] Editor Paul Rand of Computer and Video Game Magazine gave the original versions 83 out of 100, praising the music and graphics, but found the value of the game to be lukewarm. He was also impressed by the imagination of the creatures and the sense of terror some enemies gave off.[4] The German translation of the 1989 versions of the game were met with mixed reception.[citation needed]\n\nRetrospective reception of the SNES version is very mixed, with many calling it confusing and \"unplayable\" by modern standards, while others find it appealing for its experimental nature, \"cryptic\" translation, and intense absurdities.[5]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ The player decides the gender of each character. The Fighter, when female, becomes an Amazon Warrior. ^ Often inaccurately referred to as \"dungeons\" in the game.\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
  "latent_10649": "Rep. Jeff Essmann, R-Billings (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nHELENA – The head of the state Republican Party has come out against a mail ballot bill for a special election to replace a seat expected to vacated by Montana’s lone congressman, saying they give Democrats an inherent advantage.\n\nHis comments prompted a strong response from some election and county officials, one of whom called his remarks “a sad chapter in the history of the Republican Party.”\n\nRep. Jeff Essmann, R-Billings, chairman of the Montana Republican Party wrote Tuesday in an email to fellow Republicans that while he believed it Senate Bill 305 was introduced on behalf of many county commissioners who want to reduce the cost of a special election to replace Rep. Ryan Zinke, the bill will have long-term negative impacts to the future election prospects of Republicans at all levels in Montana.\n\nZinke is soon expected to be confirmed to be the secretary of the interior in the Cabinet of President Donald Trump. Once that occurs, Gov. Steve Bullock will call a special election within 100 days.\n\nEssmann said Democrats would have an “inherent advantage due to their ability to organize large numbers of unpaid college students and members of public employee unions to gather ballots by going door to door.”\n\nSB 305, sponsored by fellow Republican Steve Fitzpatrick, a senator from Great Falls, has been described as a one-time exception to do a federal election by mail ballot. The Montana Association of Clerks and Recorders, requested the mail ballots for the special election and said the $3 million spent on the Nov. 8 general election was the most expensive statewide election on record.\n\nFitzpatrick denied his bill would favor Democrats and said he met with several lawmakers Wednesday morning to discuss the bill.\n\nHe said the results show there is no correlation that mail ballots bring better results for Democrats.\n\nFitzpatrick noted that Republicans had big wins of major seats in November. They retain majorities in the House and Senate and won many statewide seats.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the bill remained with the state Senate Administration Committee.\n\nEarlier this year, Secretary of State Corey Stapleton estimated a special election would cost $2 million.\n\nLewis and Clark County Commissioner Susan Good-Giese called Essmann’s remarks a “sad chapter in the history of the Republican Party.”\n\n“As Republicans, we stand for fiscal conservatism and SB 305 allows us to spend considerably less on this unbudgeted, unanticipated special federal election,” she said via email. “I don’t think people realize that the cost of running elections is borne entirely by counties, using property tax revenues.”\n\nEssmann said he expected some opposition from within the party.\n\n“I know that my position will not be popular with many fiscally conservative Republican County commissioners or the sponsor of HB 305,” he wrote. “They may be well intended, but this bill could be the death of our effort to make Montana a reliably Republican state.”\n\n“It is my job to remind us all of the long term strategic advantage that passage of this bill would provide to our Democrat opponents for control of our legislature and our statewide elected positions,” he wrote.\n\nCascade County estimates it would cost $145,000 or more to do the election by polling place and counties, which did not budget for the cost, would be responsible for funding, officials said. By doing mail-in ballots, it will cost the county $65,000-$70,000.\n\nThe elections will be funded by taxpayers, officials said\n\nEssmann may find some support on the other side of the aisle as Rep. Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, D-Crow Agency, told members of the Senate State Administration Committee on Monday during a hearing of SB 305 that the bill was another example of suppressing the Native American vote.\n\nStewart-Peregoy said tribes have undergone litigation with counties in order to get equal access to the polls through satellite offices. She feared it would not be fair to people who live on reservations who vote at those satellite offices.\n\nFitzpatrick said and amendment had been added that ensured that any settlement between tribes and the Voting Rights Act would be honored.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/2m9ngPM",
  "latent_10659": "These are lists of regions and countries by their estimated real gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), the value of all final goods and services produced within a country/region in a given year. GDP dollar (international dollar) estimates here are derived from PPP estimates.\n\nMethodology [ edit ]\n\nIn the absence of sufficient data for nearly all economies until well into the 19th century, past GDP cannot be calculated, but at best only roughly estimated. In a first step, economic historians try to reconstruct the GDP per capita for a given political or geographical entity from the meagre evidence. This value is then multiplied by estimated population size, another determinant for which as a rule only little ancient data is available.\n\nA key notion in the whole process is that of subsistence, the income level which is necessary for sustaining one's life. Since pre-modern societies, by modern standards, were characterized by a very low degree of urbanization and a large majority of people working in the agricultural sector, economic historians prefer to express income in cereal units. To achieve comparability over space and time, these numbers are then converted into monetary units such as International Dollars, a third step which leaves a relatively wide margin of interpretation.\n\nThe formula thus is: GDP (PPP) = GDP per capita (PPP) x population size\n\nIt should be stressed that, historically speaking, population size is the far more important multiplier in the equation. This is because, in contrast to industrial economies, the average income ceiling of premodern agrarian societies was quite low everywhere, possibly not higher than twice the subsistence level.[1] Therefore, the total GDP as given below primarily reflects the respective historical population size, and is much less indicative of contemporary living standards than, for example, estimations of past GDP per capita are.\n\nAccording to the 20th-century macroeconomist Paul Bairoch, a pioneer in historical economic analysis,\n\nit is obvious that by itself the volume of total GNP has no important significance, and that the volume of GNP is not by itself the expression of the economic strength of a nation.\n\nRather, Bairoch advocates a formula combining GNP per capita and total GNP to give a better measure of the economic performance of national economies.[2]\n\nWorld [ edit ]\n\nIn his 1995 book Economics and World History, economic historian Paul Bairoch gave the following estimates in terms of 1960 US dollars, for GNP from 1750 to 1990, comparing what are today the Third World (Asia, Africa, Latin America) and the First World (Europe, North America, Japan).[3]\n\nGNP (PPP) in billions of US dollars Year 1960 dollars 1990 dollars Third World[A] First World[B] Third World[A] First World[B] 1750 112 35 495 155 1800 137 47 605 208 1830 150 67 662 296 1860 159 118 702 521 1900 184 297 813 1,312 1913 217 430 958 1,899 1928 252 568 1,113 2,508 1938 293 678 1,294 2,994 1950 338 889 1,493 3,926 1970 810 2,450 3,577 10,820 1980 1,280 3,400 5,653 15,015 1990 1,730 4,350 7,640 19,210\n\nA ^ Third World refers to Asia (excluding Japan), Africa, and Latin America.\n\nB ^ First World refers to Europe, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Japan.\n\nThe following estimates are taken exclusively from the 2007 monograph Contours of the World Economy, 1–2030 AD by the British economist Angus Maddison.[4]\n\nGDP (PPP) in millions of 1990 International Dollars Country / Region 1 1000 1500 1600 1700 1820 1870 1913 1950 1973 1989 2008 Austria 213 298 1,414 2,093 2,483 4,104 8,419 23,451 25,702 85,227 124,791 198,004 Belgium 135 170 1,225 1,561 2,288 4,529 13,716 32,347 47,190 118,516 166,396 246,103 Denmark 72 144 443 569 727 1,471 3,782 11,670 29,654 70,032 93,728 135,037 Finland 8 16 136 215 255 913 1,999 6,389 17,051 51,724 84,092 127,676 France 2,366 2,763 10,912 15,559 19,539 35,468 72,100 144,489 220,492 683,965 1,000,286 1,423,562 Germany 1,225 1,435 8,256 12,656 13,650 26,819 72,149 237,332 265,354 944,755 1,302,212 1,713,405 Italy 6,475 2,250 11,550 14,410 14,630 22,535 41,814 95,487 164,957 582,713 906,053 1,157,636 Netherlands 85 128 723 2,072 4,047 4,288 9,952 24,955 60,642 175,791 247,906 411,055 Norway 40 80 183 266 361 777 2,360 5,988 17,728 44,852 76,733 132,365 Sweden 80 160 382 626 1,231 3,098 6,927 17,403 47,269 109,794 149,415 193,352 Switzerland 128 123 411 750 1,068 2,165 5,581 16,483 42,545 117,251 141,599 190,328 UK 320 800 2,815 6,007 10,709 36,232 100,180 224,618 347,850 675,941 940,908 1,446,959 12 country total 11,146 8,366 38,450 56,784 70,988 142,399 338,979 840,612 1,286,434 3,660,561 5,235,115 7,402,911 Portugal 180 255 606 814 1,638 3,043 4,219 7,467 17,615 63,397 102, 922 154,132 Spain 1,867 1,800 4,495 7,029 7,481 12,299 19,556 41,653 61,429 266,896 454,166 797,927 Other 1,240 504 632 975 1,106 2,110 4,712 12,478 30,600 105,910 169,648 343,059 Total Western Europe 14,433 10,925 44,183 65,602 81,213 159,851 367,466 902,210 1,396,078 4,096,764 5,961,851 8,698,029 Eastern Europe 1,956 2,600 6,696 9,289 11,393 24,906 50,163 134,793 185,023 550,756 718,039 1,030,628 Former USSR 1,560 2,840 8,458 11,426 16,196 37,678 83,646 232,351 510,243 1,513,070 2,037,253 2,242,206 United States 272 520 800 600 527 12,548 98,374 517,383 1,455,916 3,536,622 5,703,521 9,485,136 Other Western offshoots 176 228 320 320 306 951 13,119 65,558 179,574 521,667 856,847 1,448,542 Total Western offshoots 448 748 1,120 920 833 13,499 111,493 582,941 1,635,490 4,058,289 6,560,368 10,933,678 Mexico 880 1,800 3,188 1,134 2,558 5,000 6,214 25,921 67,368 279,302 491,767 877,312 Other Latin America 1,360 2,760 4,100 2,629 3,788 9,921 21,097 94,875 347,960 1,110,158 1,735,919 3,168,621 Total Latin America 2,240 4,560 7,288 3,763 6,346 14,921 27,311 120,796 415,328 1,389,460 2,227,686 4,045,933 Japan 1,200 3,188 7,700 9,620 15,390 20,739 25,393 71,653 160,966 1,242,932 2,208,858 2,904,141 China 26,820 26,550 61,800 96,000 82,800 228,600 189,740 241,431 244,985 739,414 2,051,813 8,908,894 India[A] 33,750 33,750 60,500 74,250 90,750 111,417 134,882 204,242 222,222 494,832 1,043,912 3,415,183 Other east Asia 4,845 8,968 20,822 24,582 28,440 36,451 53,155 122,874 256,938 829,023 2,021,528 5,154,979 West Asia 10,120 12,415 10,495 12,637 12,291 15,270 22,468 40,588 106,283 548,120 855,130 1,905,346 Total Asia (excl.

By Bryan Haig, who has characterized Maddison's figures for 19th century Australia as \"inaccurate and irrelevant\",[5], by W. W.

J. MacPherson has described Maddison's work on India and Pakistan of using \"dubious comparative data.\"[7] Maddison's estimates have also been critically reviewed and revised by the Italian economists Giovanni Federico[8] and Elio Lo Cascio/Paolo Malanima (see below).[9]\n\nHowever, economist and journalist Evan Davis has praised Maddison's research by citing it as a \"fantastic publication\" and that it was \"based on the detailed scholarship of the world expert on historical economic data Angus Maddison.\" He also added that \"One shouldn't read the book in the belief the statistics are accurate to 12 decimal places.\"[10]\n\nEurope [ edit ]\n\nThe following estimates were made by the economic historian Paul Bairoch.[11] Contrary to most other estimates on this page, the GNP (at market prices) is given here in 1960 US dollars.

Walter Scheidel/Steven Friesen determine GDP on the relationship between certain significant economic indicators which were historically found to be plausible; two independent control assumptions provide the upper and lower limit of the probable size of the Roman GDP.[16]\n\nB ^ Decimal fractions rounded to the nearest tenth. Italic numbers not directly given by the authors; they are obtained by multiplying the respective value of GDP per capita by estimated population size.\n\nThe GDP per capita of the Byzantine Empire, the continuation of the Roman Empire in the east, has been estimated by the World Bank economist Branko Milanović to range between $680 and 770 (in 1990 International Dollars) at its peak around 1000 AD, that is the reign of Basil II.[24] The Byzantine population size at the time is estimated to have been 12 to 18 million.[25] This would yield a total GDP somewhere between $8,160 and 13,860 million.\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nGDP of the Roman Empire\n\nGDP of the Byzantine Empire\n\nMilanovic, Branko (2006): \"An Estimate of Average Income and Inequality in Byzantium around Year 1000\", Review of Income and Wealth, Vol. 52, No. 3, pp. 449–470\n\nEuropean GDP per capita\n\nBairoch, Paul (1976): \"Europe's Gross National Product: 1800–1975\", Journal of European Economic History, Vol. 5, pp. 273–340\n\nAngus Maddison — reviews and revisions",

Fresh and sweet, corn is one of the summer's greatest pleasures.\n\nWhat I love most about this easy corn chowder is that it's simple yet hearty and creamy without the cream. I substituted the cream with some Silk unflavored almond milk, and it worked brilliantly without the added calories and fat.\n\nCorn has been getting a bad rap lately. In 2011, Monsanto announced plans to grow genetically modified sweet corn on 250,000 acres, roughly accounting for 40% of the sweet corn market. By the way, the problem isn't that the corn is GMO, the problem is that all GMO crops are drenched in Roundup also known as glyphosate. Glyphosate is an herbicide that has been linked to numerous diseases. GMO crops were created to withstand glyphosate. You can read more about glyphosate here.\n\nGMO corn can be found in the produce department of most grocery stores, farmstands and farmers' markets. It can also be found in processed foods that contain sweet corn.\n\nThe best way to avoid GMO corn is to eat certified organic sweet corn.

  "latent_10821": "Mercedes inaugurated its new five-story branch near the Hudson River in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday. Just three weeks before that, Volkswagen ceremoniously opened its first American production site for 23 years.\n\nNew York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn gave a warm and enthusiastic address at the opening ceremony: \"Mayor Bloomberg has declared today 'Mercedes-Benz Day' for all five districts. We feel honored to welcome Mercedes to the 11th Avenue!\"\n\nThe new showroom goes over five floors\n\nThe flagship store is a glass building spread over some 30,000 cubic meters. It's the boast of the Stuttgart-based firm, and a model for all American car showrooms, which the company refers to by their German name Autohaus.\n\nThe store is designed to encapsulate everything Mercedes stands for - and that's why the company dug deep: \"We have invested $1.4 billion to deliver the dream, which everyone earns, who buys a Mercedes,\" stressed Ernst Lieb, president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA at his opening speech.\n\nThe efforts of Mercedes aren't coming from nowhere. Demand for cars in the United States has been growing since 1960. With 254 million registered vehicles, there are currently more cars in the country than people with licenses to drive them.\n\nGerman cars are too expensive\n\nBut German manufacturers find it hard to get a hold on the market. Mercedes and BMW have only managed to grab a small slice of the US market, with 1.9 percent each of the market share.\n\nMercedes launched the Hybrid SUV in New York in 2009\n\nThe so-called \"Big Three\" US car makers (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) make up half of all cars sold in the country. Market leader General Motors has around 21 percent alone. Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturers Toyota, Honda and Nissan all punch well above the German competition.\n\nOne hurdle could be that Americans regard German cars as luxury vehicles. For most Americans the \"pain threshold\" - how much money people are willing to pay for quality - is much lower than in Europe. That's why Volkswagen is now producing the \"America-Passat\" in the United States, and is marketing it for around $10,000 less than the German equivalent.\n\nAccording to Rebecca Lindland, market analyst at IHS Automotive, the Germans have to expand the range of models on offer. Above all crossovers - such as a cross between a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a sedan - like the Mercedes ML.\n\nHan Tjan, the New York spokesman for Daimler, agreed. He said the company is also building up its range, and he's confident that there \"a lot of fantastic products in the pipeline.\"\n\nVolkswagen takes another stab\n\nVolkswagen is making the new Passat in Tennessee\n\nMercedes isn't the only German carmaker that wants to make more of an impact. The headquarters of Volkswagen, Germany's biggest car manufacturers, is only a block away from the glitzy Mercedes showroom.\n\nVW has an ambitious goal: the company wants to become the biggest carmaker in the world by 2018. But to do that it needs the American market. Volkswagen currently sits in ninth place with a market share of 2.8 percent. In order to increase US distribution, the new VW-plant was opened a few weeks ago in the state of Tennessee.\n\nThe difficulty of conquering the American market was proven by the company 23 years ago: Volkswagen was forced to close its first American plant in Pennsylvania - it was, coincidentally, also the first foreign car production site on US soil.\n\nAuthor: Simon Berg / jli\n\nEditor: Sean Sinico",
  "latent_10899": "Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark’s Announcement Offers Little to Excite Me\n\nLast week, an announcement was made that should have thrilled me beyond belief. Being a lifelong fan of Transformers and having thoroughly enjoyed the High Moon Studios games (War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron), I have anxiously awaited the third installment in the first truly good adaptation of Transformers this generation. What did we get instead? Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark.\n\nJust hearing the title made me cringe. Regurgitating like food-poisoned processed nuggets from McDonald’s, I recalled Michael Bay’s horrid, sacrilegious debauchery of the Transformers franchise and, shortly after, discovered that Hasbro will in fact be taking cues from Bay’s universe with the new game, specifically the upcoming fourth film Age of Extinction. As if that wasn’t enough of a kick in the pants, Hasbro also gave the axe to High Moon Studios, placing developer Edge of Reality at the helm.\n\nI have nothing against Edge of Reality (I don’t think I’ve played a single game they’ve developed), but like changing a good director in a film series, bringing in new developers usually ends up being a bad thing. If High Moon Studios had botched the first or second Cybertron game, changing developers would have made sense. However, High Moon crafted two solid games with a well thought-out amalgam of Transformers universes to create their own unique adaptation that managed to satisfy (most) fans of the G1 series.\n\nCan Edge of Reality do a good job? I won’t count them out just yet, but certainly they don’t have the playful vision High Moon does that made the games work so well. Grimlock was included in Fall of Cybertron because director Matt Tieger thought, “How cool would it be to have a robotic space T-rex?” How many other developers base a hefty chunk of their game off such a nerdy, whimsical inquiry?\n\nOn that note, my biggest concern about Rise of the Dark Spark stems from the fusion of High Moon’s universe with Bay’s. In no way do these two universes fit into the same continuity. In the movies, Megatron was chasing the Allspark while also serving a master who wanted to destroy Earth and plotting on the side with an Autobot defector. (Sound ridiculous put together? They’re not much better as standalone stories.) In the High Moon games, Megatron was actually his own master (gasp) and was attempting to use Dark Energon, which he alone can wield, to take control of Cybertron. Their exodus has nothing to do with an Allspark, which is what initially brought them to Earth in the film series.\n\nTo hammer home this point, let’s look at an aforementioned character. Grimlock is already slated to appear in Rise of the Dark Spark, but his appearance will be based on his Age of Extinction look. While it is admittedly cool-looking, it’s vastly different from his appearance in Fall of Cybertron, yet Hasbro asserts Rise of the Dark Spark is a sequel to the Cybertron games.\n\nCall me a nerd, but things like continuity errors irk me more than probably anything else. Aside from that, Michael Bay’s films were…well, horrible (with the exception of the first film, which I acquiesce was pretty good). No doubt Hasbro wants to shift the focus of the video game series to attempt to ride the coattails of the films’ financial success, but for fans of Transformers, it’s a bad move and honestly a slap in the face. The element that made the Cybertron games so great was its faithfulness to the source material. Anything involving Michael Bay’s films cannot stay true to the source material. His depiction of Megatron in the second and third films is evidence enough.\n\nWatching the trailer, you can already see the influence the films have had over the game. Fall of Cybertron had several brilliant trailers, all of them for the most part avoiding the horrible trailer cliches that Rise of the Dark Spark falls victim to. It looks more like the film than the High Moon games, and it’s so, so disappointing.\n\nWill I be keeping an eye on the development of Rise of the Dark Spark? You bet. I’m curious to see how the game will turn out, and I’m willing to give it a fair shot. Am I at all hopeful it will live up to High Moon’s games or even prove that enjoyable? No, and unless Bay and his abomination is removed from the game, I won’t ever.\n\n0 Shares",

  "latent_11702": "When Garrincha died in 1983, Brazil’s Professional Athletes Association proposed that he be the first player to be buried at the Association’s recently built cemetery, a middle-class mausoleum. Former teammate and friend Nilton Santos overruled them; Garrincha’s body lies in an isolated, tired-looking cemetery. Whatever happened in between, Garrincha was born into Brazil’s working class. That is where he should rest.\n\nBesides, there are more appropriate methods of commemoration. Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana is the most iconic stadium in world football. The home dressing room is named after Garrincha, Brazil’s ‘Angel with bent legs’.\n\nWe should not know Garrincha’s name, nor his story. He should have been just another Brazilian born into poverty, raised in poverty, living and dying in poverty. He was born with a deformed spine, his right leg bent badly outwards and his left leg six centimetres shorter and curved inwards. Doctors were concerned that he would never walk unaided, let alone play professional sport. Garrincha ended up taking Brazilian football to heights it had never before climbed.\n\n“One day he came home with a little bird in his hand,” recalled his sister years later. “On seeing the bird, I said to him ‘Look, it’s just like you. It flies around a lot, but it’s no good for anything. It’s a Garrincha [little bird]’.” A nickname was born.\n\nHaving started working in a factory at the age of 14, Garrincha had no interest in becoming a footballer despite impressing for the works team. It was not until he reached 19 that he was persuaded to train with Botafogo. The story goes that Garrincha nutmegged Brazil international Nilton Santos within 15 minutes of training with the side. Santos immediately persuaded Botafogo to give him a professional deal.\n\nGarrincha became a symbol of Botafogo, playing over 600 games for the club and scoring close to 250 goals. Within nine years of his professional debut – he scored a hat-trick, naturally – Garrincha had become a double World Cup winner and one of only three players in history to win the Golden Ball and Golden Boot at a World Cup. The ‘little bird’ had learnt to fly.\n\nRather than allowing his physical disabilities to hold him back, Garrincha instead turned them into an advantage. The bend of his legs to the left tricked defenders into thinking he would move that way, but Garrincha learned to dip both ways almost in the same movement. Brazil teammate Leonidas remarked that Garrincha “played with the ball as a kid with a toy”.\n\n“It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right,” Wales left-back Mel Hopkins said. “He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time.”\n\nIt would be myopic to merely describe Garrincha as a footballer, and wholly inaccurate to call him a sportsman. He had a childish, simple view of the game that made it enjoyable pursuit rather than sport. He played for fun and to entertain rather than to win. He was, as Ruy Castro describes in his wonderful biography, ‘the most amateur footballer professional football ever produced’.\n\nGarrincha seemed to gain energy from beating defenders like the rest of us do from breakfast. On his first World Cup start, a win over Soviet Union in 1958, he dribbled past five players in the first minute alone. One French journalist present described it as ‘the greatest three minutes in the history of football’. After the game, Garrincha asked his teammates why the Soviets were so distraught. Completely unaware of the format of the tournament, the winger assumed that there was still a second leg to play.\n\nIn any other player, such a carefree attitude would have been to the detriment of on-field performance. With Garrincha, it created and defined him. He was the perfect fan player, carrying an innocence and selflessness that made it never about him and all about the ball. Pele may be the poster boy of Brazil’s success, but Garrincha is the leading factor behind the Selecao’s reputation for beautiful football.\n\nHis country knew him as ‘the joy of the people’. As Brazilian football writer Alex Bellos wrote in his book Futebol: ‘Pele is an international reference point, and one who is simple to understand: a poor black man who became the best in the world through dedication and skill. But Brazilians do not love him the way they love Garrincha.’\n\nThis was football as artform, a celebration of individual spontaneity rather than team sport. Garrincha played the game in a manner that people dreamt about but never expected they would witness. Sport is now driven by the end result, the bottom line, but Garrincha was infatuated by the means. A team could not survive with 11 Garrinchas, but it could thrive with one.\n\nCrucially, Garrincha’s nonchalance enabled him to perform at his peak on the biggest stage. To him, World Cup matches were not big matches, but a replica of everything that had gone before. Pressure is not forced upon an individual, but created in their own mind.\n\nIn his book, Castro relays an anecdote about Garrincha’s attitude to money: ‘When he was given a bonus after the World Cup, he handed the cash to his wife, who hid it under the children’s mattress. Years later, they remembered the money, and discovered a rotting mass of sodden paper. The bonus had been destroyed by bedwetting.’\n\nIf that story describes someone playing purely for the love of the game, it also hints at the extreme tragedy that matched Garrincha’s on-field majesty. His life was a trainwreck of addiction, pierced by 90-minute periods of clarity. Only on the field was he safe from his personal demons. Football was his salvation, but could only be a part-time saviour.\n\nIn hindsight, Garrincha never stood a chance. His father was an alcoholic, dependent on the Brazilian spirit Cachaca made from sugarcane juice. He began drinking from a young age, and reportedly lost his virginity to a goat. A damaging addiction to alcohol and sex had already been established long before his Brazil debut. It was that, not football, that would span the majority of his life.\n\nPut simply, Garrincha was incapable of saying no. He was childlike, mentally and emotionally immature and sent into a spiral of addiction without support or protection. Former teammates spoke of a “childish spirit” and a “love of the ladies”, but these are thin facades, euphemistic veils draped over serious psychological issues. By the peak of his career, Garrincha was drinking a bottle of Cachaca before matches.\n\nAfter his international career ended in 1966, Garrincha became a football drifter, touting himself around Europe and South America desperate to play the game. As the offers decreased, the time he spent with the devil only increased.\n\nWhen on the pitch, something clicked for Garrincha. He didn’t need to rely on his vices, only the natural skill that perhaps made him the most talented player in the history of the game. Sadly, some people are stuck to a conveyor belt of addiction, a devastating cocktail of nature, nurture and cognitive disorder. Garrincha suffered at the hands of all three.\n\nIn April 1969, Garrincha was driving his car while drunk when he crashed into a lorry, killing his mother-in-law. On a separate occasion he ran over his father but did not stop. Both incidents caused heartache that only increased his drinking. Garrincha also fathered at least 14 children, had numerous affairs and separated from his second wife in 1977 after he was violent towards her during argument. Six years later he was dead, cirrhosis of the liver sending him into an alcoholic coma from which he never recovered. He was just 49.\n\nThere is a cliched image of the rock star footballer burning the candle at both ends, living a life off the field but delivering on it. The reality contains far less swagger and swank than you’d think, and far more sadness.\n\nNow, Garrincha would be cared for and cherished, his mental illness treated. Instead his naivety was exploited, a circus freak who was underpaid by clubs and forced to have knee injections to perform. A man of few words, the media trawled through his private life and made profits from the spoils. Rarely given a voice, Garrincha spoke through his football but, away from the field, he was mute. He was abandoned by his sport, needing to be loved but with nobody to love him. Garrincha may have been killed by alcohol, but fame was as an accomplice.\n\nBy the time Brazil truly appreciated Garrincha’s fall, it was far too late. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined the streets as his funeral car crawled to the cemetery, thousands more waiting to bid farewell by his graveside. By the time all had left, the cemetery was half destroyed. Football had lost one of its greats. Garrincha had fallen through the cracks.\n\n‘In the entire history of football no one made more people happy,’ Eduardo Galeano once wrote of Garrincha. The man who had become a symbol of Brazilian hope had warped into a tale of destruction through addiction. The ‘joy of the people’ had become despair.\n\nDaniel Storey",

What are the main findings?\n\nResponse: The impact of firearm carrying on public health and public safety is a topic of considerable interest in the US. Nonetheless, contemporary national data on some of the most fundamental questions about the scope of firearm carrying among adults in the US do not exist. We used data collected through a nationally representative survey designed by investigators at Harvard University and Northeastern University and conducted in 2015 to understand why, how frequently, or in what manner (i.e., concealed or openly) US adults carry loaded handguns on their person. We also examined the prevalence of handgun carrying among this group by the stringency of state laws regulating concealed carry permits.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nResponse: We found that about 9 million adult handgun owners carry their loaded handgun on their person on a monthly basis, and about 3 million of whom do so daily. Of those who carried, about 82% carried primarily for protection, 79% had a concealed carry permit, 66% always carried concealed, and 11% always carried openly. Compared with handgun owners who did not carry a loaded handgun, those who carried were younger on average and more likely to be male. Those who carried were also more likely to self-identify as conservative, live in Southern regions of the United States, have grown up in a firearm-owning household, own both handguns and long guns, and have been threatened with a firearm in the past 5 years. We also found that proportionally fewer handgun owners carried a concealed loaded handgun if they lived in states with laws that allowed issuing authorities substantial discretion in granting concealed carry permits. Several handgun owners who did not have a concealed carry permit still carried their handgun concealed even though they lived in states that required a permit.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nResponse: The effect of increasingly permissive firearm carry laws on firearm carrying behavior should be studied. It is also important to investigate to what extent illegal firearm carrying behavior continues among those who were denied a permit. A better understanding of firearm carrying (both concealed and open) among adults and its relationship with the state laws can inform future policy and practice related to public health and public safety.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: Thank you for your contribution to the MedicalResearch.com community.\n\nCitation:\n\nAli Rowhani-Rahbar MD, PhD, MPH, Deborah Azrael PhD, Vivian H.

  "latent_11754": "Jerry Coyne put it this way: “New York Times officially opposes stupid rules of Catholic hospitals.”\n\nHe’s referencing a recent editorial entitled “When Bishops Direct Medical Care,” in which the editorial board takes on the case of Tamesha Means, on whose behalf the ACLU is filing suit against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the party they hold “ultimately responsible for the unnecessary trauma and harm” she suffered as a patient in a Michigan hospital.\n\nMeans was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke; she proceeded to Mercy Health Partners, the only hospital in her county, which is required to abide by the USCCB’s Ethical and Religious Directives. Because this document forbids abortion in all cases, Means was not informed that termination was an option. In fact, it was the safest option for her; there was almost no chance the fetus would survive, and the situation could have led to infection and death for the mother. In fact, Means was discharged from the hospital twice in excruciating pain, and was being discharged a third time, despite being feverish with infection, when her delivery began. The fetus died anyway; luckily, Tamesha Means survived.\n\nIn a non-Catholic hospital, the standard of care requires doctors to at least notify patients that termination of a non-viable pregnancy represents their best chance at survival in this situation. The Ethical and Religious Directives, however, prohibit doctors from terminating or even informing patients about the availability and/or advisability of such alternatives so they might seek assistance elsewhere. That was an unlikely solution in any case for Means, since Mercy Health was the only hospital in her area. But she never got the chance, and the ACLU’s research shows that she is far from the only patient to suffer a similar dilemma.\n\nEnter the New York Times, who responded to the case with interest, perhaps because it is the first to bypass a lawsuit against the hospital and instead target the men Coyne calls “the big guys with the hats who give the orders.” They succinctly cut to the heart of the issue, writing:\n\nCatholic hospitals account for about 15 percent of the nation’s hospital beds and, in many communities, are the only hospital facilities available. Allowing religious doctrine to prevail over the need for competent emergency care and a woman’s right to complete and accurate information about her condition and treatment choices violates medical ethics and existing law.\n\nThe Church’s rejection of abortion also mirrors the Hippocratic Oath that gave rise to the very idea of medicine as a profession […] The Church holds that all human life, both before and after birth, has inherent dignity, and that health care providers have the corresponding duty to respect the dignity of all their patients. This lawsuit argues that it is legally “negligent” for the Catholic bishops to proclaim this core teaching of our faith. Thus, the suit urges the government to punish that proclamation with civil liability, a clear violation of the First Amendment.\n\n, president of the USCCB, released a statement in which he attempts to defend Catholic hospitals’ reproductive health care on grounds of religious freedom, a line of argument dismissed as “unpersuasive” in the Times piece. Kurtz insists that all claims of substandard care inspired by the Ethical and Religious Directives are “baseless,” invoking the Hippocratic Oath to help explain how a non-viable fetus at eighteen weeks’ gestation is as much a patient as Means herself, not medically or philosophically different:\n\nInterestingly, while Kurtz takes care to note that “the death of any unborn child is tragic,” he doesn’t actually mention the possibility that a woman might die in childbirth or as a result of pregnancy complications like the infection that endangered Tamesha Means, or that the death of such a woman might also be a tragedy.\n\nOnce again, the Times editorial board swiftly dismissed the Church-approved “religious freedom” argument:\n\nThe bishops are free to worship as they choose and advocate for their beliefs. But those beliefs should not shield the bishops from legal accountability when church-affiliated hospitals following their rules cause patients harm.\n\nIn what kind of moral universe should the bishops’ freedom to “proclaim” their faith outweigh a medical patient’s right to access accurate information about her own body and make decisions about her care? The document in question certainly involves religious directives, but this level of control over other people’s health care is about as unethical as it gets.",

The health minister's move comes after McGuinty spent months rejecting opposition calls for Caplan's resignation.

Such a move would set dominoes tumbling and could see new assignments for Children and Youth Services Minister Deb Matthews, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid and Environment Minister John Gerretsen, among others. Caplan, who was not available for comment, is scion of one of the most prominent Liberal families in Ontario. His mother, Elinor Caplan, was health minister under premier David Peterson. She left cabinet under a cloud in 1986 but returned the following year and later served as a federal minister.\n\nMPP for Don Valley East since 1997, the affable Caplan, a married father of two young sons, has many friends and admirers in the party. His departure had them in shock. \"None of this happened on his tenure – it's all under George,\" said a senior Liberal, referring to Smitherman, health minister from 2003 until 2008. \"But with the report coming out, David takes the fall and is a good soldier.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAnother long-time friend fought back tears as she described Caplan as \"competent, capable and compassionate.\" A high-ranking official insisted Smitherman's mayoral ambitions \"aren't part of the equation\" as McGuinty replaces Caplan, but conceded another shuffle looms to address that situation. Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak, who called Caplan's ousting \"long overdue,\" said Smitherman deserves to be punished for the eHealth scandal since he was in charge longer. \"Smitherman should be gone. Quite frankly, he has one foot already in the mayor's campaign office.\" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Caplan should have resigned last June when the eHealth scandal erupted with details of $16 million in untendered contracts and consultants earning $3,000 a day while expensing snacks and meals. \"It's no surprise ... the minister decided to fall on his sword,\" said Horwath. \"I don't believe this is the end of the situation, though. I believe there's a lot more work this government needs to do to restore the confidence of the public.\" McGuinty has banned untendered contracts for high-priced consultants in the wake of the eHealth debacle. Also under the microscope in Wednesday's report are the actions of the senior bureaucrat at health, deputy minister Ron Sapsford, who the Star reported Tuesday collects almost $500,000 a year in salary and benefits funnelled through a Hamilton hospital. Sapsford is in charge of day-to-day operations in the health ministry, and oversaw contracts for eHealth. The Liberals conceded they need to improve disclosure of how senior bureaucrats are paid. Lucrative salaries for Sapsford and other senior bureaucrats are being channelled through hospitals such as University Health Network and Hamilton Health Sciences to skirt government pay guidelines, a practice Horwath called being \"paid through the back door.\" \"It's a good question whether that's the best way to do it,\" acknowledged Smitherman.\n\nRead more about:",

They were warned by the terrorists but still they kept on supporting my daughter.\"\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to the British and Pakistani governments, the latter of which is paying for her treatment. And he thanked medical teams in both countries for the care they have provided. \"She got the right treatment, at the right place, at the right time,\" he said.\n\nYousufzai, who was accompanied at the news conference by Malala's 12-year-old brother, detailed the days since Malala was shot in her hometown of Swat.\n\nShe was initially taken to an area hospital, then transferred to a hospital in Peshawar and on to Islamabad, undergoing surgery to remove part of her skull so that her injured brain could swell unimpeded.\n\nBy the time Malala was flown to Britain, doctors had placed her in a medically induced coma.\n\n\"She was in a very bad condition,\" her father said.\n\n\"She is lucky to be alive,\" Dr. Dave Rosser, the medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, told reporters.\n\nBut he described Malala's prognosis as \"excellent.\"\n\nShe does not appear to have suffered significant brain damage, he said. \"There's no real areas of concern, at this stage,\" he added.\n\nHe said she is tired, but \"managed a big smile\" when she saw her family. The teenager is able to breathe on her own, her father said.\n\nRosser said Malala can walk \"with very little help, just a nurse's arm on her elbow for support, and she \"appears to have very good memories of both the last few days of her care and events prior to this incident,\" he said.\n\nBut he said hospital staffers have not asked the girl about the shooting itself. \"Asking people to relive the memories increases the chance of post-traumatic stress,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the girl was to undergo blood tests and tests on her hearing and vision, \"just to make sure that we're not missing anything,\" since the bullet entered her skull above her left eyebrow, he said.\n\nRosser said an infection that had troubled doctors last week has cleared.\n\nOnce Malala has regained strength, doctors will reconstruct her skull either by replacing the fist-sized piece of bone that they removed in Pakistan, or with a titanium plate, Rosser said.\n\nIn addition, doctors may operate on her jaw, he said.\n\n\"She shouldn't need to be in hospital for more than a few weeks, maybe a couple of months at the most,\" he said.\n\nMalala has been thinking about school during her recovery, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family Thursday.\n\n\"The mission she has taken forward and the education awareness that has spread across Pakistan is all Malala's doing,\" he said, according to PTV. \"Our entire nation should be proud of her love for the soil of her country.\"\n\nWhen Malala returns to Pakistan, he said, \"we will provide her with complete security, despite anyone's refusal, to ensure that something like this never happens again. The attack on Malala was a mindset of people who don't want to see this country progress.\"\n\nRosser said he would not discuss any security precautions the hospital may be taking.\n\nThe Taliban have claimed responsibility for the shooting in the conservative Swat Valley but don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke.\n\nThousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery.\n\nMalala initially gained international attention in 2009, writing a blog about her life as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan.",

  "latent_12465": "Evan J. Smith Freelancer October 16, 2017 Photos By: Courtesy of Ford\n\nMustang enthusiasts are excited experience the thrill of Ford’s high-tech 2018 Mustang GT that’s equipped with a 460 horsepower 5.0L engine and backed by either the improved six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic. The popular pony wears a lowered, aggressive nose and a list of high-tech features including the optional MagneRide suspension. Thankfully, traction will not be a problem thanks to the all-new Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires developed specifically for the 2018 Ford Mustang GT.\n\n“We took everything we learned at the track, including feedback from professional drivers, to create a tire custom-tuned for Mustang GT,” said Gary Swingle, Michelin tire engineer. Ford and Michelin engineers used data from the Ford GT supercar and the Shelby GT350 Mustang to develop a custom high-performance summer tire that provides optimal wet and dry grip, improved braking distance and enhanced lateral handling performance.\n\nAccording to Swingle, “Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires have been fitted for some of the top performance cars in Europe, and will make their mass-market North American debut on Mustang GT.”\n\nRubber meeting the road will measure 275/40-19 out back and 255/40-19 for the front. In fact, the new Michelin tire helped the Mustang achieve record sub-four-second 0-60 mph times and they to go along with its available drag mode and 10-speed automatic transmission. “A variety of factors make the Pilot Sport 4 S tire uniquely tuned for Mustang,” said Swingle. “An ultra-reactive tread pattern adapts continuously to the road, and a hybrid belt of aramid and nylon ensures optimum transmission of steering input to the road.”\n\nConstruction of the tire includes a hybrid elastomer to form its outer rib, which delivers exceptional dry grip to help relieve stress under hard cornering. A middle rib, along with an inner rib with a new mix of functional elastomers and silica, delivers excellent wet grip for improved braking. This will equate to high level of grip for the street, strip, occasional track day or autocross. Mustang owners are also interested in aesthetics, and the Michelin tires feature a racy tread design with a premium look along with a velvet effect applied to accentuate graphics on the outer wall.",

  "latent_12601": "Share. The Vita's first FPS misses the bull's-eye. The Vita's first FPS misses the bull's-eye.\n\nLooking back at IGN's previews of Resistance: Burning Skies, the same idea keeps popping up: this is a handheld first-person shooter that feels like its console brethren. After shoehorning FPS games onto portables for years, having a true dual-stick shooter on the go is exciting -- it's just that Resistance: Burning Skies isn't. Burning Skies is a competent shooter with presentation problems that does little to thrill you.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nLike most shooters these days, Resistance: Burning Skies is broken into two parts -- single player and online multiplayer. The solo campaign casts you as Tom Reilly, a New York firefighter thrust right into the action as the Chimera invade America for the first time. (Thus, this is a story set between Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2.) Tom's just doing his job and rescuing people, but when the Chimera abduct his wife and kid in front of him, he's committed to the fight until he gets them back (translating into six chapters of gameplay that should take you six or fewer hours).\n\n“ Burning Skies is a competent shooter with presentation problems that does little to thrill you.\n\nUnfortunately, most of that is straightforward and mindless. Tom rarely speaks, and when he does, it's rarely about his emotions. We're just some dude blasting and hacking our way across a bridge because getting there is the objective and we're hoping to find some weapon upgrades on the linear path. There are cutscenes between each chapter, but they're always told from another character's perspective. We never get a genuine moment with Tom, so why should we care about his motivation?\n\nAs such, the action is the main focus in Resistance: Burning Skies, and again, it's competent but lackluster. If you want to shoot things and peek out of cover, Burning Skies has it, but it doesn't have much more than that. Each time you run into a room, there are a bunch of Chimera to shoot. Most of these guys will just stand there and fight from one spot. Bosses are a breeze, and I think that has something to do with the way the game is controlled on the Vita.\n\nSee, the dual sticks and shoulder buttons allow for the console FPS basics that everyone knows. It's tight, responsive and going to make most feel at home. However, the Vita makes up for the buttons it's lacking with the front touch screen and the rear touch pad. You can double tap the back touch to run, and tap or hold the front touch to melee, interact with the environment and utilize each of the eight guns' secondary fire modes.\n\nHere's where the breezy feeling meets the controls. These touch mechanics work and were only annoying when I'd accidentally melee a door or fire a tag round into the floor trying to interact with an object. However, holding the screen to fire an RPG or mark an enemy for the Bullseye takes time, and I think that's why the enemies aren't all that challenging; they're giving you a chance to use the touch screen mechanics.\n\nThere's a Burning Skies Trophy for killing a bunch of Executioners -- huge enemies each with a cannon for an arm -- but when one of these guys would show up, I'd stand in the open, tag the cannon with the Bullseye, and then empty a clip from cover. The game gave me ample time to do this without getting blown away by the beast. I didn't need a crazy strategy or to stay on my toes. It was as if the game was saying \"Use the secondary now!\" Even though the game does offer different difficulties, I found the ones unlocked from the get go to be like this but with less health for Tom.\n\nIn the spots where I did die, Burning Skies became all the more frustrating due to its poor checkpoint system. Sometimes, I'd start quite a ways back from where I perished (the bridge section), and other times I'd start before a pivotal moment and have to listen to the same conversation over and over (the final boss).\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nWhen you switch to multiplayer, you lose the gripes about story and the ho-hum enemies, but you don't find the hook that'll make Resistance: Burning Skies a must have. Good for up to eight players, the online options are limited at best. There are no clans, a handful of maps, and perks that are just unlockable weapons and mods from the single-player campaign. If you're aching for a handheld shooter, the game's three modes (deathmatch, team deathmatch and survival) will be here for you, but I don’t know how much of a community will sprout up around this.\n\nInterestingly, one of my biggest complaints about Resistance: Burning Skies is the game's audio. The orchestral score is beautiful, but it doesn't seem to get used all that often. Instead, it seemed like my soundtrack was my own footsteps as I ran through single-player and multiplayer. In multiplayer, another issue arose where I'd be all alone in an area but gunfire would sound as if it was raining down on me. No matter where I was in a match, it sounded like I was in the heat of battle as long as someone somewhere was using his or her gun.\n\nGreg is the executive editor of IGN PlayStation, cohost of Podcast Beyond and host of Up at Noon.

  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nThe redbrick bank in Weir, Kan., in a building cater-corner from the mortuary on Main Street, does not look much like a candidate for the bank of the future.\n\nInside, an Emerson boombox with a fully extended silver antenna is tuned to KJMK, Classic Hits. The huge steel vault, from the Mosler Safe Company, was used to lock up former owners of the bank overnight during an armed heist in 1959. And the storage room in the back contains an old, unlabeled bottle of brown moonshine.\n\nBeneath these holdovers, though, the Citizens Bank of Weir — or CBW, as it was renamed — has been taken apart and rebuilt, from its fiber optic cables up, so it can offer services not available at even the nation’s largest banks.\n\nThe creation of the new bank, and the maintenance of the old one, are the work of a couple who were born in India and ended up in Kansas after living in Silicon Valley and passing through jobs at Google and Lehman Brothers.\n\nSuresh Ramamurthi, 46, and his wife, Suchitra Padmanabhan, 44, bought CBW largely with their savings in 2009, just after the financial crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey were happy to continue the business of making loans and holding the deposits of residents of Weir, a town of 686 people (though that count was taken before a few residents ended up in the mortuary across from the bank). But their real goal was to find solutions to logjams that continue to vex consumers all over the country, such as the obstacles that slow money moving from one bank to another and across international borders.\n\nTheir work is an unusual experiment: a new kind of mom-and-pop business trying to reshape a highly regulated and innovation-resistant industry. The new services that CBW is providing, like instant payments to any bank in the United States, direct remittance transfers abroad and specialized debit cards, might seem as if they should be painless upgrades in an age of high-frequency trading and interplanetary space missions. But with most banks, it still takes longer to send money to another country or even to another state than it does to travel the same distance.\n\nThe slowness of current methods of moving money is a widely acknowledged problem in the financial industry. The Federal Reserve has been holding meetings for its initiative, called Faster Payments, which has the goal of devising safe and speedy payment methods.\n\nBut hastening the movement of money creates risk for banks, because it generally means less time to catch fraudulent transactions. Having paid fines and penalties for the outsize risks they took before the financial crisis, banks are loath to take on new risks. They have been occupied with “getting their house in order,” rather than introducing products, according to Steve Kenneally, the payment systems specialist at the American Bankers Association.\n\nCBW, on the other hand, is starting from the ground up, with one tiny bank, so it has less to lose. The experiment is a long way from changing the world, and it could easily flop, but it is already winning praise.\n\n“I can’t think of another chartered financial institution that has a similar profile,” said Elizabeth McQuerry, a former payments specialist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, who is now a consultant at Glenbrook Partners, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. “They are an innovative institution for a bank of any size.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the largest annual conference for global banks, in September, Ms. McQuerry said “the biggest idea” she saw at the entire event was new CBW software that can judge the risk involved in any transaction in real time.\n\nCBW is already providing its new services to businesses far from Weir — including several start-ups in Silicon Valley — and is positioning itself to provide accounts to ordinary consumers who live outside Kansas.\n\nIn the coming weeks, it is expecting to roll out what it refers to as a bank account of the future, which will make it possible to send wire payments and create customized debit cards online. As with many upstarts, though, CBW could have its broadest impact from larger banks eventually imitating it.\n\nMr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan live in Topeka, the state capital, but they make frequent trips to Weir, almost three hours away in Kansas’ southeastern corner, to check on their only physical branch. They stand out with their Silicon Valley ways — Mr. Ramamurthi wears a Fitbit bracelet — and rapid conversational patter. But they view Weir as a crucial part of the business. It was running the Weir bank that taught them how to cash checks, make loans and, yes, deal with bank robberies.\n\n“These are things I never would have learned sitting in Silicon Valley,” Mr. Ramamurthi said.\n\nHow to Buy a Bank\n\nA federally regulated bank is not an impulse buy. For Mr. Ramamurthi, the idea ripened when he was working for Google in its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters in 2004 and 2005. Assigned to work on Google Checkout, the company’s financial software, he saw how even a tech colossus like Google was leashed, unable to try new things because it was not a bank, and did not have direct access to the basic networks for transferring money.\n\nIt is a rare passion, but Mr. Ramamurthi is the sort who gets exercised about bottlenecks in the financial system. One of his beefs is with the Automated Clearing House, or A.C.H. system. The A.C.H. was designed to replace checks and to bring money transfer into the electronic age, and it does facilitate direct deposits and online bill payments — both widely used conveniences. But the technology was created in the 1970s and has not changed significantly since. The clunky system, which takes at least a day to deliver money, has become so deeply embedded in the banking industry that it has been hard to replace.\n\nMs. Padmanabhan became accustomed to her husband’s frequent rants about settlement and clearing — a passion that grows out of a broader curiosity about the way money works. During a long drive through the flat expanses of eastern Kansas, Mr. Ramamurthi talked about growing up in southern India. Before long, he was extemporizing on monetary policy, trade restrictions and resource allocation.\n\n“There is inequity across time in resources among human beings,” he said, recalling the ebbs and flows of wealth in Bangalore, India, his hometown. “You may be poor today, but when the harvest comes you will be richer for a few months.”\n\n“When you are managing inequity across time,” he said, “a bank — which is a store of value of many people — has the ability to alleviate and smooth those inequities.”\n\nPhoto\n\nHe finally got around to pursuing a bank when he left Google in 2005 and moved to Topeka. His wife and their two sons had moved to the city in 2002, when she got a job at Security Benefit, a money management firm; Mr. Ramamurthi then started commuting between California and Kansas.\n\nOnce in Topeka, he worked on a few projects — advising the state pension board, for instance — but he mostly worked on convincing his wife of the wisdom of buying a bank.\n\nShe was the ideal partner for the project. Her early career was spent at Lehman Brothers and Bankers Trust, in New York and Hong Kong, analyzing bonds and other loanlike securities. She was also the practical balance to his dreamy instincts. Or, as she puts it: “I’m the mom, who’s like ‘You know what? I don’t want any of the messy stuff on the carpet.’ ”\n\nOnce she was on board, the couple began working with a bank turnaround specialist, who scouted out potential banks for sale. After a few miscues, the consultant found the Weir bank, which was owned by a local family and had hit hard times.\n\nGetting a bank charter, even one from a troubled bank, isn’t easy. Start-ups and enormous companies, like Walmart, have been turned down by regulators, who are responsible for protecting insured banks from the risks involved in nonbank business activities. Last year, for instance, 10 bank charter transfers were approved, out of 17 applications.\n\nThe couple had to apply to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as Kansas bank regulators, to buy the bank in Weir.\n\nThe process began with a seven-page application; regulators responded with 26 pages of questions. In their application, the couple said they wanted to keep the bank in Weir alive, while working on new payment systems, which they described in detail. After 10 months, including many sleepless nights spent gathering thousands of pages of evidence, the couple received regulators’ approval.\n\nThey bought the bank at a difficult time for Weir. A coal and lead smelting center for the area early in the last century, it had once supported multiple newspapers and an opera house. But the town had a decades-long decline, and, in 2008, the brick plant and the last grocery store closed, leaving only the funeral home and the bank on the desolate main street.\n\n“We were afraid we might lose our bank,” said Saundra Stricklin, the mayor of the town for the last seven years. “But we trust God and do a lot of praying, and it’s worked out well.”\n\nCookies and Check Scanners\n\nIn their first year owning what was then the Citizens Bank of Weir, Mr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan spent a lot of time at the Economy Inn and Suites on the outskirts of Pittsburg, Kan., the nearest sizable town — Weir being too tiny to sustain a hotel.\n\nFrom the start, Ms. Padmanabhan was responsible for the bank’s basic business, which at that point included about $7.5 million in deposits and $3.5 million in loans, most of them for mortgages on houses and farms.\n\nThe couple had no big ambitions to change this business. They maintained the outward look and feel of the place — including the bank calendars with a “Domestic Animal Gestation and Mating Table” on the back, and the beat-up green stools behind the teller desks. But they did want to understand and improve it.\n\nMr. Ramamurthi, always the public face for the couple, took up a place behind one of the three teller desks. He immediately noticed inefficiencies. Checks were scanned and entered into the system only at the end of the day. He brought check scanners to each teller window, while rewiring the phones and computers himself.\n\nAnother innovation was free cookies and cider on Friday afternoons.\n\n“It’s kind of a town thing,” the mayor said, “ ‘Did you get your cookie yet?’ you’ll hear people say.”\n\nThe couple also invested in new security cameras after a robbery in 2011, when employees were forced, at gunpoint, onto the floor. The robbers, who made off with a few thousand dollars in cash, were caught within hours and later convicted. But the robbery shocked Mr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan, who hadn’t expected it in a town with a name that is jokingly said to be an acronym for “Where Everyone Is Related.”\n\nBattling the Bottlenecks\n\nWhile business at the Weir bank continued as usual, bigger changes were occurring under the surface, as Mr. Ramamurthi went to work on the digital plumbing of the expanding online bank.\n\nAs he and his wife had hoped, buying an established institution allowed them to examine how money transfers and payment technology worked in a traditional bank — something that was hard to see in detail from the outside — and to consider how to make changes.\n\nHis first discovery was that nearly all banks rely on a few big, and not terribly agile, outside vendors to provide all the software that makes bank computer systems work. Mr. Ramamurthi found a small technology provider that would be more flexible and allow him to begin tweaking the software.\n\nThe most obvious problem to attack was the difficulty of making instant money transfers from one bank account to another. This is already possible in many countries, including Mexico and Britain, but in the United States the primary option that consumers have to transfer money is still the A.C.H. payment. Requests for A.C.H. transfers are collected by banks and submitted in batches, once a day, and the banks receiving the transfers also process the payments once a day, leading to long waits. Wire transfers move faster, with some being settled in hours, but they cost significantly more, and are still not instant.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast year, big banks helped scuttle a plan that would have expedited the A.C.H. system, in part because it would have jeopardized the fees they earn from wire transfers. Large banks are experimenting with faster transfer systems, like QuickPay from JPMorgan Chase, but these are generally instant only between customers of certain banks.\n\nCBW went to work on the problem by using the debit card networks that power A.T.M. cash dispensers. People use debit cards to make payments or withdraw cash from their accounts, but Mr. Ramamurthi’s team engineered a system so that a business could collect a customer’s debit card number and use it to make an instant payment directly into the customer’s account — or into the account of a customer of almost any other bank in the country. This costs the customer a few dollars, but is still significantly cheaper than a wire transfer, which generally costs $10 to $40.\n\nA few other companies offer a similar service, but they are not banks, and most have less reach than CBW’s program. Some health insurance companies already use CBW’s instant payments to disburse claims payments.\n\nThe process of sending money internationally is even more cumbersome. Most American banks use a few so-called correspondent banks to wire money overseas, requiring multiple steps, each one adding fees and eating up time. To avoid this gantlet, Mr. Ramamurthi flew to India and Mexico and struck deals with banks to accept transfers directly from CBW and deliver the money the same day. CBW offers transfers to India through a site it created called globalremit.com that charges $2.50 for the first $1,000 transferred.\n\nCBW was also one of two American banks that signed up with a Silicon Valley start-up called Ripple that is trying to pioneer a cheaper way to move money between any currencies.\n\nThe fees from all of this work now dwarfs the money that CBW makes in Weir. In the last quarter, the bank earned $60,000 from its loans, and $720,000 from the rest of its business, up from around $57,000 in the years before the new owners took over.\n\nExecutives at big banks grumble that the sorts of innovations that CBW is trying are possible only because regulators don’t watch smaller banks closely, and that regulators would never let larger banks try such untested methods. In the past, a number of banks that have worked with start-ups were slapped by regulators for allowing problematic transactions. So far, at least, CBW has not been on the receiving end of any such regulatory action, according to government records.\n\nEarly on, Mr. Ramamurthi said, he realized that he had to dedicate much of his programming muscle to finding new ways to spot questionable transactions. He has hired a dozen engineers, who mostly work out of Topeka. They have developed a back-end system that can almost instantly rate the risk of any transaction by looking at 20 to 40 factors, including a customers’ transaction history and I.P., address where the transaction originated. It was this system that Ms. McQuerry, the former Fed official, praised as the “biggest idea” at the recent bank conference.\n\nMuch of the initial work on these projects has been done by a technology company called Yantra, which Mr. Ramamurthi founded in 2012 to build software that could be introduced through CBW. This year, he opened a Yantra office in Lawrence, Kan., the home of the University of Kansas. The office occupies a storefront that had housed a hookah bar.\n\nYantra and CBW have tried many of their new systems with other tech start-ups. The instant money transfers are used by Omney, a Silicon Valley payments firm, and Moven, which allows customers to sort transactions and spend money with a wave of a smartphone.\n\nBut Mr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan are eager to do the biggest work through CBW. Within the bank, one of the most significant projects is creating “contextual” debit and credit cards, which can be set for particular purchases, such as those at specific stores, or at specific times. A parent, for example, could create a debit card for a child that could be used during lunch hours only in the ZIP code near the child’s school.\n\nLike most other banks, CBW offers online banking services, but the town’s mayor prefers to do her banking on Main Street, especially when her niece, who is a teller, is working, or when the cookies are out.\n\n“Hank gets his oatmeal raisin,” the mayor said of her husband. “And I get my chocolate chip.”\n\nMr. Ramamurthi did get the recently opened Quik Shop on Main Street set up with a new device that lets customers pay with their smartphones. Even with all their big ambitions, Mr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan are continuing to keep a close eye on Weir.\n\n“It’s like a bonsai tree,” he said. “It’s still a full tree. It’s just smaller.”",

  "latent_13031": "Two-and-a-half hours into Michael Cimino’s epic Western, Heaven’s Gate, a band of townsfolk bustles into a hotel room to wake up a dead-drunk federal marshal (Kris Kristofferson). The marshal is so shocked that he kicks one of his visitors away, and then drives the others back with the crack of a bull-whip. It’s a short, simple sequence – and Cimino filmed it 52 times. “That’s all we shot that day,” groans Sandra Jordan, the key costumer, in a documentary about the production. “And it went on and on and on and on.”\n\nHeaven’s Gate has been a synonym for Hollywood folly\n\nIt is thanks to Cimino’s perfectionism that Heaven’s Gate is now feted as a masterpiece. There are five-star reviews all over the DVD box, and the film was ranked at number 98 in BBC Culture’s poll of the 100 greatest American films. But the director’s painstaking methods also explain why the film went four times over budget and a year behind schedule. When it finally premiered, 35 years ago, its soundtrack could barely be heard over gossip about Cimino’s self-indulgence and the studio’s impatience. The critics pronounced it an “unqualified disaster”, and the viewing public agreed. Ever since, Heaven’s Gate has been a synonym for Hollywood folly.\n\nIt had all started so promisingly. Cimino had been an advertising whizz-kid who moved into film with the Clint Eastwood/Jeff Bridges crime caper, Thunderbolt & Lightfoot, in 1974. His follow-up was an elegiac Vietnam drama, The Deer Hunter, a critical smash that went on to win five Oscars, including best picture, in 1979.\n\nAny studio would have been keen to finance his third film, but none was keener than United Artists: its top executives had just walked out over a disagreement with UA’s parent company, Transamerica, so their replacements were desperate to be associated with a prestigious hit. One of those replacements was Stephen Bach. “Heaven’s Gate was to be the proud centerpiece of the new administration’s slate of pictures,” he wrote in his book about the debacle, Final Cut. “Our Lawrence of Arabia, our Doctor Zhivago, set in the American West.”\n\nThe film’s subject was the Johnson County War of 1889-1893, a conflict between Wyoming’s biggest cattle ranchers and the immigrant homesteaders who challenged their monopoly. In Cimino’s version of events, the cigar-puffing patricians of the Stockgrowers’ Association compile “a death list” of 125 Central and Eastern Europeans they have classed as cattle rustlers, and they recruit a small army of mercenaries to wipe them out.\n\nBut Cimino wasn’t just planning a series of shoot-outs. Heaven’s Gate was to be a work of art: a monumental American saga encompassing roller-skating and baseball, a graduation waltz at Harvard, and a steamboat puffing through Newport. At its heart would be a tragic love triangle between Kristofferson’s noble marshal, the Association’s ruthless sharp-shooter (Christopher Walken), and the bordello madam they both adore.\n\nThe men are so much more attractive that the audience will wonder why they’re having sex with her instead of each other – Stephen Bach\n\nBut who could play the madam? When the role was turned down by the era’s leading female stars, Jane Fonda and Diane Keaton, Cimino chose Isabelle Huppert, never mind that few people in America had heard of the French starlet. Bach and his fellow UA executive, David Field, were dismayed, but they struck a deal with their director. They would fly to Paris and meet Huppert, and if she impressed them, she could have the role. She didn’t.\n\nIn Final Cut, Bach says that Huppert was “too young... too French... too contemporary... too uncertain in her reading. She was simply wrong.” When Cimino dug in his heels, Bach raised one last ungentlemanly objection: “For Christ’s sake, Michael. Kristofferson and Walken are so much more attractive than she is that the audience will spend the entire film wondering why they’re [having sex with] her instead of each other!” But Cimino stuck to his guns and Bach and Field surrendered theirs. Production hadn’t even started, but everyone knew where they stood. Bach and Field had learnt that they couldn’t trust Cimino, and Cimino had learnt that he could get his own way.\n\nInto the wild\n\nWorse still, as far as the studio was concerned, was that the film was to be shot far from Hollywood, on location in Wyoming, and the only producer there to keep an eye on Cimino was his close friend, Joann Carelli. She wasn’t about to ask him to cut any corners. And so, Cimino set about making what is still the most gloriously scenic and meticulously detailed Western ever seen. Every ingredient had to be impeccable, even if that meant building a Wild West town, piling the roads with thousands of tonnes of earth, transporting a vintage steam train from a museum in Montana at a cost of $150,000, and signing up 1200 extras, all of whom were dressed in authentic period costumes, and many of whom were sent to a daily “Cimino Camp” where they were taught everything from horse-riding and shooting to rollerskating and cock-fighting. One day, a crowd of those extras sat around for hours while Cimino waited for the light to change, and when an Assistant Director suggested, mid-afternoon, that it might be time for a lunchbreak, Cimino snapped, “Lunch? This is bigger than lunch!” The cast and crew nicknamed him “Ayatollah Cimino”.\n\nSix days into filming, he was five days behind schedule, and had spent $900,000 on a minute-and-a-half of usable footage. Two weeks into filming, the studio calculated that, at the rate he was going, Heaven’s Gate was going to cost them £1m per minute of running time. Something had to be done. But when another UA executive, Derek Kavanagh, was dispatched to Wyoming to rewrite Cimino’s schedule, the director responded by dictating and posting a memo: “Derek Kavanagh is not to come to the location set. He is not to enter the editing room. He is not to speak to me at all.” The budget grew from a proposed $7.5m to an agreed $11.6m to a total of $44m.\n\nEven in a real battle you don’t do it over and over again – Jeff Bridges\n\nSome of the tales of Heaven’s Gate are hair-raising. In a making-of documentary, Jeff Bridges, who played a local entrepreneur, recalls that when it was time to film the climactic battle scenes, the actors would be woken at 3:30am, and driven for three hours along dirt roads to the site. Once there, it was mostly actors, rather than stunt-riders, who had to race their horses full-pelt through clouds of dust, guns blazing. Bridges was terrified by the lack of safety precautions. “Even in a real battle,” he comments, “you don’t do it over and over again.”\n\nMost of the on-set folklore, however, isn’t about a lunatic taking dangerous risks, but about an artist labouring to make the best film possible. “From someone on the outside it would look like it was almost too much,” says Bridges, “but it never appeared that way to me. It was like, oh, this guy really cares.”\n\nKristofferson says the same thing. “I bet Michelangelo cared. I bet Picasso cared. Anybody who believes in his artistic vision – I bet they care. I probably didn’t care that much! But I was glad to be working with somebody who did!”\n\nYou might suspect Mr Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect – The New York Times\n\nThe critics didn’t see it that way. When production eventually wrapped, Cimino set about editing over a million feet of footage down to the two-to-three-hour film which his contract specified. Locking himself into the cutting room, and working for days without sleep, he finished the job just in time for the New York premiere on 18 November 1980. But the film was nearly four hours long – and the premiere felt longer.\n\nBridges remembers the audience’s befuddled silence. “After all that work,” he grimaces. “Ugh, it was terrible.” And there was worse to come. The reviews in the next morning’s newspapers condemned the film as a pretentious, obscure, meandering, extravagant fiasco. Vincent Canby sounded its death knell in The New York Times. “Heaven’s Gate fails so completely,” he wrote, “that you might suspect Mr Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect.”\n\nCompromised position\n\nWounded and exhausted, Cimino chose precisely the wrong moment to compromise. At his request, UA pulled the film from cinemas so that he could edit it down to a more palatable two-and-a-half hours and re-release it the following spring. It was an honourable plan, but the message it sent was that the New York critics were right to mock Heaven’s Gate. The film made a paltry $3.5m at the US box office – and the humiliation continued.\n\nCimino’s reputation plummeted. Transamerica sold off United Artists, effectively killing the studio. And Heaven’s Gate was blamed for ending the freewheeling glory days of Hollywood in the 1970s, and for ushering in the corporate blockbusters of the 1980s. A decade later, when reports emerged of Dances With Wolves going over budget, Kevin Costner’s Western was nicknamed “Kevin’s Gate”. Cimino’s pride and joy had become a punchline.\n\nBut he may just have the last laugh. His original cut of Heaven’s Gate earnt rapturous reviews when it was shown in Britain in 1982. Thirty years after that, he presented a restored-and-tweaked version at the Venice Film Festival, and its reception was even more euphoric. It was Canby and his fellow critics who looked ridiculous now; Heaven’s Gate looked magnificent.\n\nTo viewers who binge-watch ten-hour HBO series, Heaven’s Gate seems a lot less problematic\n\nIt has its flaws, of course. The siege engines in the closing battle smack of Mel Brooks silliness, and the supposed friendship between Kristofferson and Walken’s characters isn’t established. But so much of Heaven’s Gate is patently splendid that it is mind-boggling that anyone could pronounce it an “unqualified disaster”. And the scenes which were slammed in 1980 as being symptomatic of waste and excess – the Harvard waltz, the massed rollerskating – are the scenes which take your breath away.\n\nPerhaps Cimino was ahead of his time. To viewers who binge-watch 10-hour HBO series, Heaven’s Gate seems a lot less problematic than it must have done to viewers hoping for a rootin’ tootin’ Western in 1980. The film’s political concerns seem uncannily contemporary, too. To see the lines of immigrants, trudging across the plains, their possessions stuffed into suitcases and wagons, is to be reminded of photographs of Syrian refugees. And to hear the Stockgrowers denouncing these immigrants as “thieves and anarchists... an ignorant, degraded gang of paupers” is to imagine a screenwriter parodying some of Donald Trump’s more divisive remarks.\n\nHowever unwelcome Heaven’s Gate may have been in 1980, there hasn’t been a more urgently topical film in 2015.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

  "latent_13079": "Whirlwind I Whirlwind computer elements: core memory (left) and operator console Product family \"Whirlwind Program\"[1]/\"Whirlwind Project\"[2] Release date April 20, 1951 ( )\n\nCircuitry from core memory unit of Whirlwind.\n\nCore stack from core memory unit of Whirlwind.\n\nWhirlwind I was a Cold War-era vacuum tube computer developed by the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory for the U.S. Navy. It was among the first digital electronic computers that operated in real-time for output, and the first that was not simply an electronic replacement of older mechanical systems.\n\nIt was one of the first computers to calculate in parallel (rather than serial), and was the first to use magnetic core memory.\n\nIts development led directly to the Whirlwind II design used as the basis for the United States Air Force SAGE air defense system, and indirectly to almost all business computers and minicomputers in the 1960s.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. Navy approached MIT about the possibility of creating a computer to drive a flight simulator for training bomber crews. They envisioned a fairly simple system in which the computer would continually update a simulated instrument panel based on control inputs from the pilots. Unlike older systems like the Link Trainer, the system they envisioned would have a considerably more realistic aerodynamics model that could be adapted to any type of plane. This was an important consideration at the time, when many new designs were being introduced into service.\n\nThe Servomechanisms Lab in MIT building 32[3] conducted a short survey that concluded such a system was possible. The Navy decided to fund development under Project Whirlwind, and the lab placed Jay Forrester in charge of the project. They soon built a large analog computer for the task, but found that it was inaccurate and inflexible. Solving these problems in a general way would require a much larger system, perhaps one so large as to be impossible to construct.\n\nIn 1945, Perry Crawford, another member of the MIT team, saw a demonstration of ENIAC and suggested that a digital computer was the solution. Such a machine would allow the accuracy of the simulation to be improved with the addition of more code in the computer program, as opposed to adding parts to the machine. As long as the machine was fast enough, there was no theoretical limit to the complexity of the simulation.\n\nUntil this point, all computers constructed were dedicated to single tasks, and run in batch mode. A series of inputs were set up in advance and fed into the computer, which would work out the answers and print them. This was not appropriate for the Whirlwind system, which needed to operate continually on an ever-changing series of inputs. Speed became a major issue: whereas with other systems it simply meant waiting longer for the printout, with Whirlwind it meant seriously limiting the amount of complexity the simulation could include.\n\nTechnical description [ edit ]\n\nDesign and construction [ edit ]\n\nBy 1947, Forrester and collaborator Robert Everett completed the design of a high-speed stored-program computer for this task. Most computers of the era operated in bit-serial mode, using single-bit arithmetic and feeding in large words, often 48 or 60 bits in size, one bit at a time. This was simply not fast enough for their purposes, so Whirlwind included sixteen such math units, operating on a complete 16-bit word every cycle in bit-parallel mode. Ignoring memory speed, Whirlwind (\"20,000 single-address operations per second\" in 1951)[4] was essentially sixteen times as fast as other machines. Today, almost all CPUs perform arithmetic in \"bit-parallel\" mode.\n\nThe word size was selected after some deliberation. The machine worked by passing in a single address with almost every instruction, thereby reducing the number of memory accesses. For operations with two operands, adding for instance, the \"other\" operand was assumed to be the last one loaded. Whirlwind operated much like a reverse Polish notation calculator in this respect; except there was no operand stack, only an accumulator. The designers felt that 2048 words of memory would be the minimum usable amount, requiring 11 bits to represent an address, and that 16 to 32 instructions would be the minimum for another five bits — and so it was 16 bits.[5]\n\nThe Whirlwind design incorporated a control store driven by a master clock. Each step of the clock selected one or more signal lines in a diode matrix that enabled gates and other circuits on the machine. A special switch directed signals to different parts of the matrix to implement different instructions.[citation needed] In the early 1950s, Whirlwind I \"would crash every 20 minutes on average.\"[6]\n\nThe design used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes.\n\nWhirlwind construction started in 1948, an effort that employed 175 people. including 70 engineers and technicians. In the third quarter of 1949 the computer was advanced enough to solve an equation and display its solution on an oscilloscope,[7]:11.13[8] and even for the first animated and interactive computer graphic game.[9][10] Finally Whirlwind \"successfully accomplished digital computation of interception courses\" on April 20, 1951.[11][7]:11.20–21 The project's budget was approximately $1 million a year, which was vastly higher than the development costs of most other computers of the era. After three years the Navy had lost interest. However, during this time the Air Force had become interested in using computers to help the task of ground controlled interception, and the Whirlwind was the only machine suitable to the task. They took up development under Project Claude.\n\nWhirlwind weighed 20,000 pounds (10 short tons; 9.1 t).[12]\n\nThe memory subsystem [ edit ]\n\nThe original machine design called for 2048 (2K) words of 16 bits each of random-access storage. The only two available memory technologies in 1949 that could hold this much data were mercury delay lines and electrostatic storage.\n\nA mercury delay line consisted of a long tube filled with mercury, a mechanical transducer on one end, and a microphone on the other end, much like a spring reverb unit later used in audio processing. Pulses were sent into the mercury delay line at one end, and took a certain amount of time to reach the other end. They were detected by the microphone, amplified, reshaped into the correct pulse shape, and sent back into the delay line. Thus, the memory was said to recirculate.\n\nMercury delay lines operated at about the speed of sound, so were very slow in computer terms, even by the standards of the computers of the late 1940s and 1950s. The speed of sound in mercury was also very dependent on temperature. Since a delay line held a defined number of bits, the frequency of the clock had to change with the temperature of the mercury. If there were many delay lines and they did not all have the same temperature at all times, the memory data could easily become corrupted.\n\nThe Whirlwind designers quickly discarded the delay line as a possible memory—it was both too slow for the envisioned flight simulator, and too unreliable for a reproducible production system, for which Whirlwind was intended to be a functional prototype.\n\nThe alternative form of memory was known as \"electrostatic\". This was a cathode ray tube memory, similar in many aspects to an early TV picture tube or oscilloscope tube. An electron gun sent a beam of electrons to the far end of the tube, where they impacted a screen. The beam would be deflected to land at a particular spot on the screen. The beam could then build up a negative charge at that point, or change a charge that was already there. By measuring the beam current it could be determined whether the spot was originally a zero or a one, and a new value could be stored by the beam.\n\nThere were several forms of electrostatic memory tubes in existence in 1949. The best known today is the Williams tube, developed in England, but there were a number of others that had been developed independently by various research labs. The Whirlwind engineers considered the Williams tube, but determined that the dynamic nature of the storage and the need for frequent refresh cycles was incompatible with the design goals for Whirlwind I. Instead, they settled on a design that was being developed at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. This was a dual-gun electron tube. One gun produced a sharply-focused beam to read or write individual bits. The other gun was a \"flood gun\" that sprayed the entire screen with low-energy electrons. As a result of the design, this tube was more of a static RAM that did not require refresh cycles, unlike the dynamic RAM Williams tube.\n\nIn the end the choice of this tube was unfortunate. The Williams tube was considerably better developed, and despite the need for refresh could easily hold 1024 bits per tube, and was quite reliable when operated correctly. The MIT tube was still in development, and while the goal was to hold 1024 bits per tube, this goal was never reached, even several years after the plan had called for full-size functional tubes. Also, the specifications had called for an access time of six microseconds, but the actual access time was around 30 microseconds. Since the basic cycle time of the Whirlwind I processor was determined by the memory access time, the entire processor was slower than designed.\n\nMagnetic core memory [ edit ]\n\nJay Forrester was desperate to find a suitable memory replacement for his computer. Initially the computer only had 32 words of storage, and 27 of these words were read-only registers made of toggle switches. The remaining five registers were flip-flop storage, with each of the five registers being made from more than 30 vacuum tubes. This \"test storage\", as it was known, was intended to allow checkout of the processing elements while the main memory was not ready. Main memory was so late that the first experiments of tracking airplanes with live radar data were done using a program manually set into test storage. Forrester came across an advertisement for a new magnetic material being produced by a company. Recognizing that this had the potential to be a data storage medium, Forrester obtained a workbench in the corner of the lab, and got several samples of the material to experiment with. Then for several months he spent as much time in the lab as he did in the office managing the entire project.\n\nAt the end of those months he had invented the basics of magnetic core memory and demonstrated that it was likely to be feasible. His demonstration consisted of a small core plane of 32 cores, each three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Having demonstrated that the concept was practical, it needed only to be reduced to a workable design. In the fall of 1949, Forrester enlisted graduate student William N. Papian to test dozens of individual cores, to determine those with the best properties.[7] Papian's work was bolstered when Forrester asked student Dudley Allen Buck[13][14][15] to work on the material and assigned him to the workbench, while Forrester went back to full-time project management. (Buck would go on to invent the cryotron and content-addressable memory at the lab.)\n\nAfter approximately two years of further research and development, they were able to demonstrate a core plane that was made of 32 by 32, or 1024 cores, holding 1024 bits of data. Thus, they had reached the originally intended storage size of an electrostatic tube, a goal that had not yet been reached by the tubes themselves, only holding 512 bits per tube in the latest design generation. Very quickly a 1024-word core memory was fabricated, replacing the electrostatic memory. The electrostatic memory design and production was summarily canceled, saving a good deal of money to be reallocated to other research areas. Two additional core memory units were later fabricated, increasing the total memory size available.\n\nAir defense networks [ edit ]\n\nAfter connection to the experimental Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar at Hanscom Field using Jack Harrington's equipment and commercial phone lines,[16] aircraft were tracked by Whirlwind I.[17] The Cape Cod System subsequently demonstrated computerized air defence covering southern New England.[specify] Signals from three long range (AN/FPS-3) radars, eleven gap-filler radars, and three height-finding radars were transmitted over telephone lines to the Whirlwind I computer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Whirlwind II design for a larger and faster machine (never completed) was the basis for the SAGE air defense system IBM AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central.\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nThe Whirlwind used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes. An effort was also started to convert the Whirlwind design to a transistorized form, led by Ken Olsen and known as the TX-0. TX-0 was very successful and plans were made to make an even larger version known as TX-1. However this project was far too ambitious and had to be scaled back to a smaller version known as TX-2. Even this version proved troublesome, and Olsen left in mid-project to start Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). DEC's PDP-1 was essentially a collection of TX-0 and TX-2 concepts in a smaller package.[dubious – discuss]\n\nAfter supporting SAGE, Whirlwind I was rented ($1/yr) from June 30, 1959, until 1974 by project member, Bill Wolf.\n\nKen Olsen and Robert Everett saved the machine, which became the basis for the Boston Computer Museum in 1979. It is now in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.\n\nAs of February 2009, a core memory unit is displayed at the Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation in Waltham, Massachusetts. One plane[clarification needed], on loan from the Computer History Museum, is on shown as part of the Historic Computer Science displays at the Gates Computer Science Building, Stanford.\n\nThe building which housed Whirlwind was until recently home to MIT's campus-wide IT department, Information Services & Technology and in 1997–1998, it was restored to its original exterior design.[18]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

Italian bond yields also rose slightly, reflecting investor nervousness.\n\nHowever, traders were reassured in part by the result of Europe's other crucial vote this weekend, which saw Austria reject a populist, far-right candidate for president.\n\nAnd a market meltdown had also been avoided because \"the next steps are far from clear for Italy and traders are not panicking yet\", said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nNevertheless, Holger Schmieding, an analyst at Berenberg, said the risk that Italy could choose to leave the euro had increased with the referendum.\n\n- 'A people's victory' -\n\nPopulists in Italy and throughout Europe rejoiced at Renzi's downfall, with the founder of the anti-establishment Five Star movement Beppe Grillo calling for an election \"within a week\".\n\nGrillo said a snap election should be held on the basis of a recently adopted electoral law designed to ensure the leading party has a parliamentary majority -- a position the populist movement could find itself in at the next election.\n\n\"The people have won,\" Matteo Salvini, head of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League party cheered on Twitter, with Marine Le Pen of France's far-right National Front sending him and the Italian people \"congratulations on this victory\".\n\nBritian's eurosceptic Nigel Farage, who spearheaded the \"Brexit\" campaign, said the vote looked \"more about the euro than constitutional change\".\n\nMost analysts see immediate elections as unlikely because the failure of the constitutional changes has put a spanner in a recent electoral reform, making a parliamentary majority almost impossible.\n\nThe most probable scenario is a caretaker administration dominated by Renzi's Democratic Party taking over until an election due to take place by the spring of 2018.\n\nFinance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan is the favourite to succeed Renzi as prime minister and the outgoing leader may stay on as head of his party -- which would leave him well-placed for a potential comeback to frontline politics at the next election, whenever it is.\n\nPadoan cancelled a trip to Brussels Monday.\n\nEU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici rushed to calm the troubled waters, insisting that while there was \"political instability\", Italy was nonetheless \"extremely stable.

  "latent_13767": "I am out of town this week on a special project – more details will follow when I have the green light to start promoting it. So my posting will be a bit erratic this week.\n\nJust a quick post for today. I want to point out that Age of Autism, the anti-vaccine propaganda blog of Generation Rescue, has really gone over the top in their witch hunt against anyone who dares try to educate the public about vaccines and correct the constant flow of misinformation that comes from the anti-vaccine ideologues. Their chosen method of attack is alleged conflicts of interest – and it is truly a witch hunt.\n\nThe core features of a witch hunt are that the accusation of guilt is treated as being equal to guilt, and that the rules of evidence of so fluid and vague that even “spectral” evidence is accepted – anything that creates even the impression of guilt.\n\nThe target of their latest smear is my colleague David Gorski, in a post by the truly clueless Jake Crosby. David saw this one coming, and even tried to head it off by telling Jake, both privately and publicly over at SBM, that his information is incorrect or at least misleading. Jake, apparently, is uneducable.\n\nJake is running a particular witch hunt known as the “pharma shill gambit.” The game here is to find any tenuous connection between a scientist and a pharmaceutical company and then try to pull the Jedi mind trick on readers and convince them the connection is a genuine conflict of interest. Jake would have his readers believe that because David is employed by Wayne State University, and because Wayne State received research grants from Sanofi-Aventis, and Sanofi-Aventis manufactures vaccines – therefore David indirectly receives money from the vaccine industry, and this is an undisclosed conflict of interest (which he has already disclosed, but explained is not a conflict). Got it?\n\nKeep in mind, David does not get research grant money from Sanofi-Aventis or any pharmaceutical company. He has not received any pharmaceutical money at all in 14 years – somewhat unusual for an academic medical researcher. He has never done vaccine research. He has never been paid to consult for vaccine, lecture about vaccines, or express an opinion about vaccines. He is squeaky clean.\n\nBut according to Jake – everyone salaried by every university that has ever received money from any pharmaceutical company that has ever produced a vaccine – is a shill for the vaccine industry.\n\nIt would be laughable if these clowns were not actually using this kind of spectral evidence to conspiracy-monger and scare parents away from a safe and effective health care measure.",
  "latent_13803": "OPINION – It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. In an effort to protect the American public from its excesses, alcohol was effectively outlawed nationwide in 1920 with the ratification of the 18th Amendment.\n\nBut sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.\n\nIn 1931, Franklin P. Adams penned a ditty describing the conundrum this legislation created:\n\nProhibition is an awful flop.\n\nWe like it.\n\nIt can’t stop what it’s meant to stop.\n\nWe like it.\n\nIt’s left a trail of graft and slime,\n\nIt won’t prohibit worth a dime,\n\nIt’s filled our land with vice and crime.\n\nNevertheless, we’re for it.\n\nThe double-think described in Adams’ poem was as real as could be. Prohibition greatly empowered government while simultaneously creating unparalleled growth opportunities for organized crime. But it did little to curb the age-old desire for strong drink among the American people.\n\nThe best thing that can be said about the Prohibition Era is that American politicians still acknowledged that they had no authority to implement it by legislation alone. This is why they had to persuade enough states to implement the Volstead Act in order to amend the Constitution.\n\nOnce the 18th Amendment was in place, government grew, freedoms shrank, and a whole new class of criminals was created overnight. The nature of alcohol itself had not changed. It was still a product that had been used for medicinal and recreational purposes for millennia. Then, suddenly it was illegal.\n\nThe public’s demand for alcohol did not dissipate out of respect for the law. Instead, it remained nearly constant and to satisfy the ongoing demand, those seeking alcohol were forced to do business with shadowy suppliers.\n\nBy removing the legitimate distillers from the light of day, where market forces could impact the quality of their booze, the new suppliers enjoyed a dangerous, government-enforced monopoly. This meant that they could sell tainted or poisonous liquor with no fear of liability.\n\nGreed and sociopathic behavior were the defining characteristics of the underworld alcohol producers.\n\nBut Prohibition’s corrupting effect on government was also cause for concern. Bribery of police and other government officials was common. Legislators were lobbied and paid handsomely to keep Prohibition in place because it artificially raised the profit margins for the illegal suppliers.\n\nProhibition also fed the insatiable addiction to power that attracts some people to government service in the first place. In this case, the desire to control the behavior of others led to the unconscionable official act of poisoning industrial alcohols in order to scare the public away from unlawful booze.\n\nBy some estimates, at least 10,000 Americans died from drinking liquor that had been deliberately poisoned by their own government.\n\nAfter 13 years of growing corruption, a skyrocketing murder rate, and increasing disregard for the law, Prohibition was repealed with the ratification of the 22nd Amendment. Surprisingly, the state of Utah may have played a role in the repeal of Prohibition, despite pleas from LDS church leaders to keep it in place.\n\n80 years later, alcohol is legally available to adults who choose to imbibe. Government still loves to tax and regulate its use, but we don’t have beer truck drivers killing one another over which stores will sell their product.\n\nThere is still a societal price to pay even when an intoxicating substance is legally available. But instead of pre-emptively removing an entire society’s freedom over fears of what they might do, we instead hold drinkers accountable for their behavior.\n\nProhibition was a great object lesson in what happens when we empower the state to handle actions we may find morally objectionable, but that do not cause actual harm to others.\n\nMatthew Woll testified about Prohibition before a judiciary subcommittee in 1926 stating:\n\nPrivate morals and personal conduct can not be controlled, much less advanced, by fiat of law. Appeal for a higher morality and improved conduct must be directed to the mind and conscience of the people, not to the fear of government.\n\nThe most important lesson from the failure of the 18th Amendment is that prohibition is a cure that is worse than the disease it falsely claims to cure. This holds true whether we are applying it to alcohol, drugs, foodstuffs, guns, or any other substance.\n\nIt empowers government at the expense of our liberties. It creates incentive for criminal gangs by artificially inflating their profits. But most damaging of all, prohibition punishes everyone without affording individual due process.\n\nIt cannot make us better people.\n\nBryan Hyde is a news commentator and co-host of the Perspectives talk show on Fox News 1450 AM 93.1 FM.

And Berkeley has a new solar financing program that lets homeowners pay the cost of their solar systems over 20 years, a program that San Francisco and other cities plan to emulate.\n\nA typical home solar system generates about 3 kilowatts of power. The installation cost in California averages roughly $8.10 per watt, according to Adam Browning, executive director of the Vote Solar advocacy group, meaning the typical cost is $24,300.\n\nThe state rebate is now $1.55 per watt for homeowners in Pacific Gas and Electric Co. territory. So the average rebate is worth $4,650, bringing the overall cost down to $19,650. Although it's unclear just how the stimulus provisions will work, several solar industry sources said they expect the federal tax credit to be based on a solar system's price after the state rebate is subtracted. So for the typical California homeowner, the 30 percent tax credit will be worth $5,895, cutting the overall cost to $13,755.\n\nFinally, the Berkeley program allows homeowners to borrow the cost of installation from the city's Sustainable Energy Financing District and pay it annually on their property tax bills. So they'll pay minimal up-front costs.",

We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nBack in 1415, with the decadent Borgio papacy nearly 80 years away and the Reformation’s challenge more than a century away, there was no hint that catastrophe was approaching Catholicism itself, even when a three-way battle for the Holy See made a pope resign.\n\nNow, as Pope Benedict XVI prepares to retire on Thursday and his successor’s selection process starts Friday, it takes no church historian to realize that the world’s best-organized faith is in deep moral, institutional and political crisis.\n\nThe writer is a Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nSimilarly, it takes no fortune-teller to predict that the next pope will be expected to impact an embattled Vatican’s relevance in a world wedged between a largely post-religious north and an increasingly Islamist south.The 117 cardinals and archbishops who will convene Friday in the Sistine Chapel are expected to produce a new pope within 24 days, during which they will meet daily in order to hear and scrutinize each other before finally selecting someone in their midst and sending white smoke to billow through the chimney atop St. Peter’s Square.THE MOST vexing crisis pervading the conclave will be the sex-abuse scandals that have shaken the Catholic world in recent years.The abuses, whose main victims were thousands of boys ages 10 to 14, resulted in cover-ups, investigations, prosecutions, convictions and high-profile resignations – most memorably Boston’s Archbishop Bernard Francis Law in 2002 – as well as a flood of lawsuits that have forced some dioceses to shut down entire churches and some to declare bankruptcy.The span of the sex-abuse allegations – multiple countries in four continents over more than half a century – has made some suspect that, just like the dioceses of San Diego, Portland and Tuscon were compelled to declare financial bankruptcy, the entire Church might as well declare moral bankruptcy.The consequent institutional crisis, which the National Catholic Reporter has described as one of the worst in the Church’s history, comes at a time when Catholicism is steadily losing followers.The US has lost more than 1,000 parishes over the past two decades, and European church attendance has plunged to well under 50 percent even in Catholic bastions like Spain and Ireland.While these trends have been accelerated by the recent scandals, they also reflect a rich West’s post-religious Zeitgeist highlighted by abandoned churches’ reincarnation as quaint real estate projects.This, in essence, is the major internal challenge Catholicism faces as its top clergy gather to anoint their new leader. Though this crisis had long matured by the time Benedict began his eight-year papacy, the image problem the Church faced when he entered office has not changed and was in fact exacerbated with this papacy’s own share of brouhahas, from financial disorders in the Vatican’s innermost banking to document leaks from the pope’s innermost chambers.Beyond image, there is no indication that the deeper theological value at play in the sex scandals – clerical celibacy – will be seriously reviewed any time soon. The conservatives who have efficiently resisted contraception and family planning are believed to vastly outnumber the liberals, a ratio that leaves consideration of priestly marriages and feminine priesthood highly unlikely.Moreover, with Islam steadily expanding in Europe while evangelical churches sprout from Brazil to Africa, Catholicism is challenged not only morally but also geographically. Symbolically, Rome’s own great mosque, whose construction was financed by Saudi Arabia, seats 12,000 worshippers representing an estimated one million Muslims throughout Italy whose quest to build yet more mosques is facing political resistance.Understandably, then, some are beginning to eulogize Catholicism as a declining faith whose colorful ceremonies and sprawling business interests can no longer conceal its moral crisis and political irrelevance.Such eulogies have been made in the past and proved premature.BACK IN 1978, with some 100 million Catholics trapped beyond the Iron Curtain while communism coran the world, Stalin’s famous disparagement of the pope as a general with no divisions seemed vindicated.Hardly a decade of history had turned on its head.The daring appointment of a charismatic Polish bishop as pope was soon followed by hugely attended masses beyond the Iron Curtain. Communism’s subsequent downfall was at least partly related to Catholicism’s underestimated energy and untapped resources. Catholicism had displayed such resilience previously, during the Counter-Reformation, when it retook much of the turf it had previously lost to Protestantism.It follows that when the Conclave convenes next Friday, it will try to define the turf it must conquer this century if it is to restore its diminishing historic relevance.While the Church must find a way to restore its following in Europe and North America, that is essentially a defensive battle.To go on the offensive the way it did under John Paul’s leadership, the Vatican will have to seek a geopolitical niche where it can have a relative advantage. And in today’s perplexed international system, such a niche actually exists and begs to be filled. Circling the entire globe, it runs along the cleavage that separates the rich north from the poor south.With Islam mainly in the south, Protestantism mostly in the north and other faiths lacking global reach and pretensions, Catholicism is the only religion firmly positioned to suspend bridges across this fault line. Similarly, with the rich world perplexed in the face of capitalism’s moral failures and economic malfunctions in recent years, the Cardinals may think they can inspire a counter-greed Zeitgeist of chastity and charity.The selection of a charismatic pope from the Third World would help change the subject from recent decades’ sex scandals and the affairs that haunted Benedict’s papacy to issues of wealth and poverty and north-south relations.Then again, to make such a choice, the Conclave must share a sense of historic urgency of the sort it felt in the face of communism’s assault. The Italian names that have been touted – Milan Archbishop Angelo Scola and Cardinal Angelo Bagnasca of Genoa – like Canada’s Marc Ouellet, may fail to deliver such dramatic change. Then again, a choice like Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana is considered problematic because of his anti- Islamic militancy. Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines has been more careful and, at 56, is also younger than the others, who are between the ages of 65 and 72.The next pope may well be someone whose name has not come up at all. But whoever he is, the choice will immediately be interpreted as a statement either for or against change. The Church, after all, did not always confront history’s challenges as successfully as it fought communism. Next month’s choice will therefore be judged by the extent that it resembles one of two precedents: the vision with which the papacy confronted communism or the impotence with which it met fascism.WHILE RELEVANT for a broad range of issues, from clerical morality and Western greed to north-south relations and Islamist expansion, one issue that does not stand to be affected by the papal succession is the Jewish world.Theologically, the transition since Vatican II’s retreat from Christianity’s historic accusations against the Jews has since matured and become a quiet harmony, albeit one where many still find room for improvement.Politically, the Vatican’s full recognition of the Jewish state two decades ago and the papal visits here by both John Paul and Benedict have cemented a normal relationship between the Jewish people and its former archenemy, a relationship Israel can only dream to someday have with its current enemies.Ironically, the Vatican’s current relations with the Jews are much better than its relations with the millions of disenfranchised Catholics whom the new pope will be expected to somehow appease.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

My style is weakening my opponent little by little. Aldo does it with one big KO strike.\"\n\n-- Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight title challenger Chan Sung Jung tells UFC.com that he believes his striking is nowhere as deficient as people are making it out to be when compared with his UFC 163 opponent Jose Aldo. \"Scarface\" is considered to be one of the best strikers in all of mixed martial arts (MMA) and his 13 career (technical) knockout victories prove that to be true. Jung, while respectable on the feet, has won a majority of his fights by submission and it would seem likely that his best chance of upsetting the Brazilian for the 145-pound title on Aug. 3, 2013 would be to take the fight to the ground. That may ultimately be what \"The Korean Zombie\" plans to do when the cage door closes, but he wants it to be known that if he equals or betters Aldo in the stand up department come fight night, you shouldn't be surprised.\n\nFor more news and notes on UFC 163: \"Aldo vs. Jung,\" visit our complete event archive here.",
  "latent_14008": "DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Monday it will press managers of the Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Alabama to respect the right of workers to discuss organizing a local union while on the factory floor.\n\nAn American flag flies in front of the United Auto Workers union logo on the front of the UAW Solidarity House in Detroit, Michigan, September 8, 2011. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nLast week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Mercedes-Benz U.S. International must rescind a rule in its employee handbook prohibiting workers from talking about a union in work areas while not on work time.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that Mercedes-Benz had to be ordered to simply allow workers to discuss their right to organize,” said Kirk Garner, a longtime Mercedes-Benz worker. He is also a member of UAW Local 112, established in October, and served as a witness in the NLRB case.\n\nA Mercedes-Benz statement emailed on Monday evening said the company has been and remains neutral on the issue of unionization “with the decision left to our team members.”\n\nIt also said an older version of the employee handbook “regarding rules for solicitation and this has been addressed in the 2014 handbook recently distributed to team members.”\n\nThe UAW said it wants Mercedes Benz to follow the policy it has for plants outside the United States which “acknowledges the human right to form trade unions” and “respects the right of collective bargaining.”\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama is Daimler’s only plant worldwide that does not offer employee representation.\n\nLast summer, an administrative law judge issued a ruling that was affirmed by the NLRB last Wednesday.\n\nThere are about 2,500 full-time and 1,000 “temporary” workers at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\nThe UAW has been trying to organize workers at several foreign-owned plants in the U.S. South, including Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) plants in Canton, Mississippi, and in Smyrna, Tennessee.",
  "latent_14040": "With Alberta stuck in recession for a second straight year and the province’s jobless rate at a 21-year high, a coalition of 15 major business groups is seeking direct talks with Premier Rachel Notley and her cabinet in a bid to halt the carnage.\n\nIn a letter sent to Notley’s office late Friday, the alliance — comprised of 15 associations whose corporate members employ hundreds of thousands of workers in such sectors as oil and gas, manufacturing, retailing and construction — says the province’s increasingly “dire” economic outlook prompted their collective call for action.\n\n“Albertans from all walks of life are experiencing hardships not seen in decades,” the letter states.\n\n“Low energy prices have crippled Alberta’s energy industry, affecting businesses both directly and indirectly associated with energy production. Business and consumer confidence are nearing all-time lows and the provincial unemployment rate is soaring.”\n\nWhile the alliance concedes the steep plunge in oil prices and the economic devastation it has wrought are beyond the government’s control, it argues that various NDP policy initiatives — including higher corporate and personal taxes, a planned carbon tax, and current and proposed future hikes to the minimum wage — have compounded Alberta’s lingering economic misery.\n\n“We also acknowledge that the Alberta government is facing a significant budget shortfall,” the letter notes. “Together, we must find a way to balance the provincial budget while at the same time setting the conditions for economic success. One cannot happen without the other.”\n\nThe three-page letter is signed by a broad cross-section of industry groups, including: the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Alberta Enterprise Group, the Retail Council of Canada, the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, the Canadian Home Builders’ Association-Alberta, Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, the Merit Contractors Association and the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors.\n\nAlberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci, who is set to table the province’s 2016-17 budget on April 14, has indicated the deficit is likely to exceed $10 billion for the coming fiscal year, roughly $5 billion above previous projections.\n\nAlthough the coalition is specific about its policy concerns, it took pains to applaud the Notley government’s efforts to win better market access for Alberta’s energy. It also supports the “pragmatic approach” taken during the recent royalty review, which largely left rates unchanged.\n\nThe coalition now urges the government to extend that approach by imposing a “moratorium” on any new policies that would “have a detrimental impact on the ability of businesses to create and preserve jobs, attract capital or effectively compete in a global market,” at least until Alberta’s economy rebounds.\n\n“Specifically, we ask that tax increases be categorically ruled out, that the proposed increase in the minimum wage be delayed, and that the coming carbon tax be made truly revenue neutral with offsetting tax reductions,” the letter states.\n\n“Secondly, we ask that the government move quickly on a number of other areas that will allow businesses and their employees to confidently make decisions with certainty about the environment within which they operate,” by providing details on job creation strategies or measures to mitigate the impact of the carbon tax on small or mid-sized businesses.\n\n“As a first step toward identifying and implementing meaningful solutions, we respectfully request a meeting with you (Notley) and your cabinet colleagues to begin a dialogue on these issues and identify a path forward,” the letter concludes.\n\n“In the coming days, we will be in touch with your office in order to arrange a suitable time to meet and further lay out our ideas for preserving jobs and prosperity for Albertans.”\n\n“All we are asking for is an opportunity to engage in a dialogue with the government around issues that pertain to our members,” says David MacLean, vice-president of Alberta Enterprise Group, whose firms employ about 150,000 workers in sectors such as manufacturing, energy, construction and financial services.\n\n“Times are tough, and there have been significant changes, particularly since the new government came in, that have had a negative impact on business,” he adds.\n\n“When the NDP came to power we expected change. Albertans voted for change. However, there are a number of policies that have come into effect or are about to come into effect that are hurting our members’ bottom lines. We haven’t called for those policies to be reversed, but we’d ask that the government commit to no further dramatic increases to the cost of doing business in Alberta.”\n\nRichard Truscott, vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) for Alberta and British Columbia, echoes that message.\n\n“Small business confidence in Alberta right now is at the lowest point we’ve ever recorded in the 40-plus year history of CFIB, anywhere in the country. It’s right off the cliff and it continues to drop,” he says.\n\n“A lot of our members are feeling very desperate. There’s a lot of despair and a lot of anger that their voices are not being heard. So the government would be wise to listen and to find ways to support the backbone of our economy,” he adds.\n\n“If they don’t, we’re going to see a lot of business failures, a lot of people continuing to lose their jobs, and a bad situation that is going to get a lot worse. I don’t want to be alarmist, but the future is looking awfully bleak right now for small businesses in this province.”\n\nglamphier@postmedia.com\n\nLetter to Premier Notley\n\nThe groups who signed the letter:\n\nAlberta Enterprise Group\n\nAlberta Roadbuilders and Heavy Construction Association\n\nCanadian Federation of Independent Business\n\nCanadian Association of Geophysical Contractors\n\nCanadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors\n\nCanadian Home Builders’ Association-Alberta\n\nCanadian Institute of Steel\n\nCanadian Manufacturers and Exporters\n\nLandscape Alberta\n\nMerit Contractors Association\n\nPetroleum Services Association of Canada\n\nProgressive Contractors Association of Canada\n\nRestaurants Canada\n\nRetail Council of Canada\n\nThe Talent Pool",

  "latent_14267": "After months of waiting, a Ninth Circuit panel has finally responded to Google's plea, supported by public interest groups (including EFF), journalists, librarians, other service providers, and law professors, to reconsider its disastrous opinion in the case of Garcia v. Google. The good news is that we managed to get the panel to revisit its opinion. The bad news is that it essentially doubled down.\n\nQuick background: several months ago, and over a vigorous dissent, a panel majority ordered Google to remove copies of the notorious Innocence of Muslims film from YouTube. Why? Because one of the actors in the film insists she has a copyright interest in her performance and, based on that interest, claims to have a right to have the video taken offline. Actress Cindy Lee Garcia—who was tricked into appearing on-screen, overdubbed, for five seconds—sued Google to have the footage removed. The district court refused and Garcia appealed. The Ninth Circuit concluded Garcia's copyright claim was \"doubtful\" but nonetheless ordered Google to remove the film from YouTube and take steps to prevent future uploads.\n\nThe uproar was immediate, for good reason. As we and others explained, the order amounts to a prior restraint of speech, something that should never happen where the underlying claim is \"doubtful.\" (In fact the Copyright office later refused to register Garcia's performance). The majority dismissed that concern by claiming that the First Amendment doesn’t protect copyright infringement, which missed the point. The First Amendment does protect lawful speech, which is why courts shouldn’t issue censorship orders in any but the rarest circumstances, and only where it is highly likely that the speech is actually unlawful. What is worse the panel’s ruling was accompanied by a gag order forbidding Google from discussing the ruling for almost a week.\n\nThe amended opinion issued today recognizes some of our concerns but continues to sidestep the key issues. Notably, the amended opinion does not address our most basic concern: that the court applied the wrong standard altogether. The takedown order was a mandatory preliminary injunction, which should never occur unless the law and the facts clearly favor the person asking for it. What is worse, the court gave short shrift to the public interest. Innocence of Muslims is doubtless a highly offensive video, but it is also part of the historical record. Thanks to the injunction, the public can continue to discuss the video—but we can't see what we are discussing.\n\nThe amended opinion dismissed several other concerns on procedural grounds, insisting that the district court can consider them later:\n\nNothing we say today precludes the district court from concluding that Garcia doesn’t have a copyrightable interest, or that Google prevails on any of its defenses. ... After we first published our opinion, amici raised other issues, such as the applicability of the fair use doctrine, see 17 U.S.C. § 107, and section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, see 47 U.S.C. § 230. Because these defenses were not raised by the parties, we do not address them. The district court is free to consider them if Google properly raises them.\n\nAnd:\n\nFirst Amendment protections are ‘embodied in the Copyright Act’s distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopyrightable facts and ideas,’ and in the ‘latitude for scholarship and comment’ safeguarded by the fair use defense.” Golan v. Holder, 132 S. Ct. 873, 890 (2012) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 560 (1985)). Google hasn’t raised fair use as a defense in this appeal, see page 11 supra, so we do not consider it in determining its likelihood of success. This does not, of course, preclude Google from raising the point in the district court, provided it properly preserved the defense in its pleadings.\n\nThis is profoundly disappointing. When a case clearly implicates the public's right to access the historical record, courts shouldn't kick the can down the road. And as the amended dissent recognizes, the panel had ample legal authority to address the flaws in its opinion, rather than referring them to another court.\n\nGoogle's request for a rehearing en banc (i.e., a rehearing by the entire court rather than just a three-judge panel) is still pending, so the Ninth Circuit has another chance to revisit the case. Let's hope it does so.",
  "latent_14328": "By Chuck Campbell of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nTrae Crowder zigged when you thought he would zag.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"liberal redneck\" from Knoxville entered the fray of debate about public-restroom use by transgender people this week, and in the process he turned the image of the bigoted redneck upside-down and became an improbable ally to the LGBT community.\n\nSee his video (WARNING: Profanity and language some may find objectable)\n\nCrowder, 30, posted a video to his Facebook account Wednesday afternoon, and 48 hours later the video had passed 13.8 million views and climbing by the minute. In the video, the shirtless, baseball-cap-wearing West Knoxvillian is temperamental, employing his deep, rural Tennessee accent to say he's \"fired-up, son.\" Yet just when viewers might have expected a stereotypical transgender-bashing, Crowder goes in the opposite direction.\n\n\"What do you think is going to happen?\" by letting transgender people use their restrooms of choice, he asks in an incredulous tone. \"You do know that transgender people have existed forever, right? What bathrooms you think they've been using?\" He dismisses the notion of sexual predators using the guise of transgenderism to prey on children in restrooms, especially \"not with their mouth-breathin' troglodyte daddy 12 feet outside the door just dyin' to punch somethin' different. It don't make no sense.\"\n\nCrowder continues: \"You're freaked out, the thought of a man wantin' to be a woman disgusts you … because you lack the capacity to understand it.\" He goes on to say the next generation is growing up \"to be more open-minded, and that's happenin' whether you like it or not.\"\n\nThe not-safe-for-work video is replete with expletives as Crowder makes his point.\n\nCrowder, a part-time comedian for the last five years who has two preschool boys with his wife, Katie, says the video only took about five minutes to record and 20 minutes to edit, though he had put in quite a bit of forethought to decide what he was going to say.\n\n\"I wanted to let people know that they have friends in places they might not expect,\" Crowder said Friday afternoon, \"and to also show my more stereotypical fellow Southerners that if (other) people acted the way they act but said things they didn't like, they probably wouldn't take too kindly to that. … I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.\"\n\nCrowder moved to Knoxville in 2010, having grown up in rural Clay County near the Kentucky border. He said that of all the responses he gets, the ones that anger him most are \"the ones accusing me of faking the whole thing or faking the accent. … I grew up rough as hell in the backwoods of this state, so anybody that wants to question my 'red cred' is barking up the wrong damn tree.\"\n\nHe admits that he generally isn't as aggressive with his opinions in his day-to-day life, but what he expresses in his videos \"are my beliefs.\"\n\n\"I voted for Obama twice,\" he says, adding he's been \"a lifelong advocate for LGBT rights and am not religious at all. So the 'liberal' part (of 'liberal redneck') is fully accurate too,\" Crowder said.\n\nHe said some of his favorite responses to the video have come from, \"actual trans people and other members of the LGBT community saying how much it means to them to hear someone like me taking up for them after all they've been through,\" and also, \"other born-and-bred liberal Southerners telling me how much they appreciate me showing other people we're not just a bunch of inbred hicks down here.\"\n\nThe latest video wasn't his first. In another recent Crowder video post, he blasts a that would have designated the Bible as the state book of Tennessee.\n\nIn that video he warns that those who try to proselytize to his children are \"gonna have trouble out of me, you can believe that. And if this offends anybody, I don't give really a damn because I'm tired of not being able to stand up for what I believe down here in the South.\" He concludes by blasting rednecks for wanting an official book anyway: \"Don't act like y'uns read. Y'uns don't read.\"\n\nAlthough the Tennessee legislature passed the Bible bill earlier this month, Gov. Bill Haslam vetoed it, and the state House of Representatives refused to override his veto on Wednesday.\n\nThe viral response to the transgender video has been \"surreal. Utterly. My head is spinning for sure,\" Crowder said, adding that 95 percent of the reactions \"have been extremely supportive.\"\n\nWhat will he do next?\n\n\"Buddy ask me next week,\" Crowder said. \"I'm still reeling at the moment.\"\n\nThen he promised, \"there will definitely be more videos, though. That much is for sure.\"",

I think any animal you send back will have a bit of a culture shock.\"\n\nHe said educating people in China that there was no medical value in rhino horn would be hard as they had been brought up their entire lives to believe it.\n\nBut he said he believed technology could help in the fight - potentially fitting transmitters to horns, or using unmanned drone aircraft to monitor the movement of both rhino and poachers.\n\nAs he fed Zawadi, a five-year-old female now in Tanzania, Prince William explained that his love of rhino stemmed from his time helping to hand rear them at a friend's reserve in Kenya.\n\nHe explained that despite looking \"bombproof\", they were sensitive creatures with wonderful characters.\n\nBut his tone changed as he explained how Max, one of those he fed, was killed just this year by poachers in an act he described as a \"complete waste\".\n\n'Someone's mantelpiece'\n\n\"Sadly, he ran into the wrong people and he is now on someone's mantelpiece somewhere probably,\" he said.\n\nThe duke said he wanted to send a message of support to all those taking part in the fight to stop the killing of rhino, but he also wanted to see more education and awareness raised about the issue.\n\nTusk Trust chief executive Charlie Mayhew said the killing of both white and black rhino was out of control.\n\nImage caption The three black rhino are settling into their new home at Mkomazi National Park in northern Tanzania\n\nHe said 13 black rhino were killed in South Africa in 2007, compared with 434 just four years later.\n\nRecent rumours that rhino horn powder cured a prominent (but unnamed) politician's cancer have seen prices rise higher than those for gold.\n\nThe Aspinall project had been a collaborative effort, with charities and big business coming together - a message echoed by the duke.\n\n\"These guys are prehistoric looking. They are the most incredible things and do we really want to live in a world 20, 30 years down the line where there's no such thing as a 'big five' [elephants, lions, rhino, cape buffalo and leopard]?\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be the big four, then possibly the big three and then where do we go after that?\n\n\"Are our grandchildren ever going to be able to see the big five?

  "latent_14609": "Blue Jays ace David Price recently sat down for The Interview with Sportsnet magazine.\n\nHere, in the first of a three-part Q-and-A we’re featuring on Sportsnet.ca this week, the 30-year-old lefty talks about the Jays’ scooter gang, his nerves on the mound, the power in Toronto’s lineup, and what it’s like to be so popular.\n\nIn Part 2 (Thurs., Aug. 27) and Part 3 (Fri., Aug. 28) Price covers topics including his love of ice cream, his potential plans to become a Canadian citizen, and what percentage chance he gives himself of being a Blue Jay next year.\n\nWhere do you live in Toronto?\n\nYou want my address?\n\nYeah.\n\nNo! [Laughs.]\n\nI’m kidding. Do you live in a condo, close to here?\n\nYeah, I live in a condo. It’s pretty close.\n\nDid you sign a long-term lease on your Toronto condo?\n\nNo, I did not sign a long-term lease. [Laughs.]\n\nDid you think about it?\n\nI probably wouldn’t stay in that same place if I was back here next year.\n\nMaybe you could look into buying a house in the next couple of weeks.\n\nI’ll have to wait and see how things play out first.\n\nOK, OK. How do fans react when they see you on the street?\n\nI was riding my scooter back to the Park Hyatt, the hotel I was staying in, and my scooter almost died because I stopped so many times, taking pictures with everybody. It’s a good problem to have.\n\nI heard you got an electric scooter for everyone on the team.\n\nThe guys that aren’t making the minimum and have made some money in this game, they paid me. But the guys that haven’t hit arbitration yet, or are still making the league minimum, I took care of those guys, yeah.\n\nAre you a real scooter enthusiast?\n\nI definitely like stuff like that—I rode dirt bikes as a kid, and always rode my bike. James McCann in Detroit, our catcher there, he got one for himself and it just took off. We’d leave every day together from the hotel, we’d ride to the field. We’d all get together after the game, we’d ride back to the hotel. It saves you money; you’re not getting Ubers or cabs or black cars, whatever it is. And it’s just fun.\n\nWho’s in the Jays scooter gang?\n\nA ton of people. Kevin Pillar, [Ryan] Goins, [Josh] Donaldson, [Jose] Bautista, Eddie [Edwin Encarnacion], [Dioner] Navarro.\n\nDo you wear matching leather jackets?\n\nNo, not yet. If we can get some custom shirts made or something—and the longer you’re in it, the more miles you get, you get patches. That would be fun. I’ve logged a lot of miles on my scooter.\n\nThe Jays bats have been compared to cars crashing and a beer league softball team. How would you describe them?\n\nBeer league softball—that was definitely a compliment. It’s an extremely powerful lineup. All the guys have the ability to hit the ball over the fence, but we have our table setters at the bottom of the lineup that do an extremely good job of just getting on and making sure the top of our lineup has guys on base and in scoring position. It makes it so tough for pitchers. You know you have to make a really good pitch, because if you don’t, it can be three or four runs extremely quickly.\n\nIf you were pitching against this team, how would you prepare?\n\nOoh. It’s definitely a lineup that you have to be locked in for. You can’t take an inning off, you can’t take a pitch off. There’s never a moment where you can kind of relax against this lineup; it’s always threatening. And to be on this side of it, you never feel like you’re out of a game. It doesn’t matter how many outs you have left and how many runs you’re down. With this type of lineup you can always win.\n\nDo you ever feel nervous out there?\n\nEvery game I pitch, I’m nervous. Once you throw that first pitch and get out there and get involved in the game, it goes away. But leading up to the game, I’m nervous for every start. Even in spring training I’m nervous. I care too much.\n\nHow about your debut here, when you had the bases loaded. Were you nervous then?\n\nNo, there weren’t nerves. I needed to make a couple pitches. And I was fortunate enough to get that first out to pop up to Tulo [Troy Tulowitzki] in shallow centre, and he made a really good catch over his shoulder, and then turned and fired a rocket right to Smoakie [Justin Smoak] in front of the mound. That was a very big play. And then to get [Aaron] Hicks with a strikeout and same thing with [Kurt] Suzuki. Those guys have swung the bat well against me in their careers, so those were two good bats. One pitch could have been very big; a guy hits a double down the line or a double in the grass or a home run. I needed to make some pitches in that situation and I was able to do it.\n\nWhat’s it like to be this popular?\n\n[Laughs.] It’s pretty mind-blowing. I never expected it to get to where it is right now. It’s definitely taken off way more since I was traded here to Toronto. It’s crazy.\n\nIt was crazy even before you threw a pitch in a Jays uniform.\n\nYeah. I always took time for all the fans here in Toronto. I spent my birthday here [in 2011]. People who worked in the camera well would always bring me popcorn. I came out to get it probably 30 minutes before the game, and they had everybody in that section over there sing me “Happy Birthday.” That was probably one of the coolest things that’s happened to me on the baseball field that wasn’t during the game.\n\nWhat was the coolest?\n\nThis year in Boston, we were out there for early BP and a bunch of little league teams were taking a tour of Fenway. All these kids were just going nuts and yelling at me and chanting my name. That was really cool.\n\nThis interview appears in the current issue of Sportsnet magazine.",

  "latent_14725": "MEDIA RELEASE FROM DOH\n\nHONOLULU – The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed a new case of hepatitis A infection in a food service employee on Hawaii Island. The employee has a history of exposure on Oahu and worked at the fast food and catering restaurant, Sushi Shiono Waikoloa, located in the Waikoloa Beach Resort, Queen’s MarketPlace at 69-201 Waikoloa Beach Drive, from July 5 through July 21, 2016 (actual dates: July 5-8, 11-15, and 18-21).\n\nThe department is advising persons who consumed any food products from this store during this period that they may have been exposed to the disease. The likelihood that patrons of this business will become infected is very low. However, as a precaution, unvaccinated individuals should contact their healthcare providers about the possibility of receiving hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin, which may provide some protection against the disease if administered within the first two weeks after exposure.\n\nSince the outbreak began in mid-June, there have been 93 confirmed cases of hepatitis A, 29 of which have required hospitalization. All cases have been in adults who were on Oahu during their exposure periods. DOH continues to investigate and is working to identify the source of infection for this outbreak.\n\n“Preventing exposure from infected food handlers is difficult because patients with hepatitis A are most contagious one to two weeks before symptoms start,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park. “It is possible that other food service establishments will be affected with additional new cases.”\n\nAffected food service establishments who are unable to notify their customers directly are listed on the DOH website at health.hawaii.gov/docd/hepatit…. These businesses are not sources of this outbreak. At this time, no infections have been linked to exposure at these businesses; the list is provided to prevent possible new cases.\n\nHawaii State law requires all unvaccinated food handlers (persons who directly prepare, serve, or handle food) who are contacts of confirmed cases be tested for infection and have a negative hepatitis A IgM test before returning to work. A “contact” with the case is defined as unvaccinated household members, unvaccinated sexual contacts, anyone sharing illicit drugs with a case, anyone sharing food or eating or drinking utensils with a case, anyone consuming ready-to-eat foods prepared by an infectious food handler with diarrhea or poor hygiene. Once an infected food handler has been identified, DOH staff coordinate directly with the owners and managers of the affected food service establishments to ensure their employees are tested before resuming their work.\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A infection include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, diarrhea, and yellow skin and eyes. Individuals, including food service employees, exhibiting symptoms of hepatitis A should stay home and contact their healthcare provider.\n\nWhile vaccination provides the best protection, frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and warm water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, and before preparing food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Appropriately cooking foods can also help prevent infection.\n\nAdditional information about hepatitis A can be found on the DOH website at\n\nhealth.hawaii.gov/docd/hepatit….\n\nFor a statewide list of vaccinating pharmacies, visit\n\nhealth.hawaii.gov/docd/files/2… or call the Aloha\n\nUnited Way information and referral line at 2-1-1\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) is investigating a cluster of hepatitis A infections on Oahu. HDOH staff are conducting interviews with the cases in an effort to identify the source of infection.\n\nIdentifying the source of infection continues to be a challenge because of the long incubation period of the disease and the difficulty patients have in accurately recalling the foods consumed and locations visited during the period when infection could have taken place.\n\nHealthcare providers have been informed and are asked to notify HDOH immediately if they have a patient they suspect may be infected.\n\nIndividuals who are interested in being vaccinated should contact their healthcare providers.\n\nCONTACTS OF CASES\n\nUnvaccinated contacts of cases should talk to their healthcare providers about the possibility of receiving hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin, which may provide some protection against the disease if administered within the first two weeks after exposure.\n\nA contact is defined as:\n\nAll unvaccinated household members\n\nAll unvaccinated sexual contacts\n\nAnyone sharing illicit drugs with a case\n\nAnyone sharing food or eating or drinking utensils with a case\n\nAnyone consuming ready-to-eat foods prepared by an infectious food handler with diarrhea or poor hygiene\n\nNote: A food handler is any person who directly prepares, serves, or handles food.\n\nUnvaccinated food handlers who are contacts of cases must have a negative hepatitis A IgM test before they return to work.\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nAn employee of the following food service business(es) has been diagnosed with hepatitis A. This list does not indicate these businesses are sources of this outbreak; at this time, no infections have been linked to exposure to these businesses. The likelihood that patrons of these businesses will become infected is very low.

  "latent_14915": "Another article published on the brilliant In Bed with Maradona\n\nEngland 7 – 1 Spain. It’s hard to imagine such a scoreline. But then this was long before Xavi Hernández and Andrés Iniesta. The location was Highbury, North London, and the year was 1931, smack in the middle of the Great Depression.\n\nHaving triumphed 4-3 at the Estadio Metropolitano in Madrid in May 1929, Spain rocked up at Highbury as the only continental side to have achieved victory over England. The hosts, led in attack by the iconic Dixie Dean, responded in emphatic fashion.\n\nHighbury had an official capacity of 55,000, but on 9th December 100,000 people flooded the streets surrounding the stadium in anticipation of the match. The Daily Sketch’s L.V. Manning depicted the chaos as police and ambulance men were hopelessly outnumbered: “Where there should have been orderly queues outside the gates there were swirling mobs,” he wrote.\n\nAs the 2.15pm kick-off time drew nearer, the thousands still stranded outside the stadium were becoming increasingly agitated. In front of the Gillespie Road entrance, the crowd was so tightly packed that the gates collapsed under their weight. Those closest to the front spotted the opening and gleefully hurdled the wreckage without the need of a ticket.\n\nThe turmoil did not end at kick-off. “The touchlines at the Gillespie Road end of the ground looked like a battlefield,” continued Manning, referring to the dozens of injured spectators receiving treatment at the side of the pitch. At one point, England winger Ellis Rimmer had to tiptoe cautiously through the stretchers of wounded just to take a corner in front of the overloaded North Bank. “Fainting women were handed down over the heads of the crowd like human shuttlecocks,” added Manning.\n\nOn the pitch, England did nothing to ease the excitement as they found themselves two goals up after four minutes. John Smith – a 33-year-old inside-forward from South Shields – struck first with a 20-yard drive, before Everton’s Tommy Johnson added another a few minutes later. After 32 minutes, Smith collected Dixie Dean’s lay-off and smashed the ball in off the underside of the bar for his second. England added a fourth two minutes after half-time through Derby County’s Sammy Crooks. Crooks, one of 17 children from a coalmining family in County Durham, then turned provider as Dean headed his cross home. Johnson and Crooks both completed their doubles before Basque striker Guillermo Gorostiza notched a late consolation for the visitors.\n\nIn goal for Spain, RCD Espanyol and Real Madrid legend Ricardo Zamora was making his 35th international appearance. When the sides had met two years previously in Madrid, the man referred to as El Divino had carried on playing despite breaking his sternum. In his trademark turtleneck jumper and flat cap, Zamora stepped out at Highbury with a reputation befitting his status as one of the highest paid players in Europe (he earned £30 per week). That reputation took a battering in North London. “All who went to watch had expected something better from Zamora,” rued the Daily Herald, England’s leading socialist newspaper.\n\nFor one reporter, Zamora’s performance bordered on the ridiculous: “He did not understand English rules,” wrote Hannen Swaffer on the Herald’s front page: “Once, when Dean charged him in possession, he so misinterpreted what ‘charging’ means that he nearly pulled off Dean’s trousers,” he quipped.\n\nIn reply, the beleaguered goalkeeper cited the playing conditions: “Outside the goals there was a mass of mud,” he said. “Every time I tried to jump I slipped. I felt sure that I could stop the first goal and when I failed I was so disheartened that I did not seem able to play properly after.” He was not alone in feeling deflated at Spain’s humiliation. Swaffer, continuing to poke fun at the visitors, wrote, “The crowd sympathised with Spain’s linesman, who, as the goals piled up against his side, stood in one place on the line, not running down with the players, as is the custom, but looking such a picture of smitten woe that the crowd could not help laughing.”\n\n“Spain must have been placed in a rather false light by their victory over England in 1929,” reflected the Manchester Guardian, before asserting that goal scorer Gorostiza and half-back Francisco Gamborena were the only Spanish players of “international class”. The wet, muddy Highbury turf had not accommodated Spain’s fabled ‘tiki-taka’ and their short passing game had proved ineffective. “We are used to playing on good turf with plenty of spring,” pleaded Zamora, while in the Daily Sketch, Manning observed, “Their glaring weakness was that they knew nothing about the science of the long pass.”\n\nBack in Spain, the press lamented a “catastrophic” defeat, and the crowds gathered in Puerta del Sol Square in Madrid greeted news of the scoreline with disbelief. Remarkably, Spain had lost by the same margin against Italy at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. It remains the heaviest defeat in their history.\n\nCatalan daily, La Vanguardia – one of Spain’s longest-running newspapers – offered extensive and ‘exclusive’ analysis of the match. “England were absolutely dominant,” ran the sub-heading on 10th December. Like Ricardo Zamora, La Vanguardia attributed the result, in large part, to the Highbury playing surface: “The pitch was very soft. The conditions were detrimental to Spain, while hugely beneficial to England, whose players found it ideal.” A few days later, dejected football correspondent, Miguel Cabeza, wrote: “We are sorry for the great pain we have suffered in London.” He went on to bemoan the way in which the result may affect England’s already strained relationship with the rest of Europe: “After this result, the English will surely revert to regarding all that is continental with the same sneering attitude that was customary during Victorian times.”\n\nIn a match where Spain’s weaknesses had been so ruthlessly exposed, some bitterness was quite understandable, and the Highbury turf had indeed played a large part in their downfall. However, La Vanguardia also reserved praise for England’s defensive performance. Fullbacks Tom Cooper and Ernie Blenkinsop (who had been handed the captain’s armband) were singled out for their outstanding contributions, while there was a general acceptance of the effectiveness of England’s “scientific” approach to long passing.\n\nThe English FA’s promise of a third, deciding friendly match between the two nations never came to fruition, but that was probably in the best interest of both sides. England, who would remain unbeaten on home soil against continental opposition for another two decades, were granted time to bask in the glow of their victory, while Spain were left licking their wounds.",
  "latent_14935": "Ziggurat Con Status Defunct Genre Role-playing video game Location(s) Camp Adder Country Iraq Inaugurated 2007 Attendance 30 +/- Organized by United States Army\n\nZiggurat Con was a role-playing convention held on June 10, 2007. It was remarkable for being the only known role-playing video game convention held in a war zone.[1] The con was held on the grounds of the Ali Airbase and Camp Adder in Iraq, both housing large numbers of North American Armed Forces personnel. It was named after a ziggurat from the ancient city of Ur that is on the base grounds.[2] Admission was free to all U.S.-allied military personnel and civilian contractors posted in Iraq.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nZiggurat Con was as a soldier-run event.[1] The convention was organized by active duty military service personnel deployed to Iraq by the United States Armed Forces, and by contractors to the United States government. It was originally scheduled for June 9[3], but was moved to the 10th to help preserve operational security.[citation needed]\n\nPart of the base's Community Activity Center hosted the convention. The Memorial Theater showed anime, the ping pong room and mini-theater held pen-and-paper role-playing games, and role-playing video games were held in the console gaming room at the MWR Activity Center. The convention's first organizer was Convention Chair SPC David Amberson. SPC Amberson is looking for someone who will take the reins and hold a second Ziggurat Con, and has a couple of prospects already.\n\nSPC Amberson noted that a distinct lack of morale was plaguing the troops stationed in Iraq. This was especially true after troops first heard about the three-month extension over the news or from family members as early as two weeks prior to announcements by their own chain of command.[citation needed] To help combat this low morale, Amberson organized the friends he played Dungeons & Dragons with regularly and scheduled a convention to give games, dice, and other goodies to the troops he was stationed with.\n\nAs there are no stores near the base where these games can be bought, Ziggurat Con was dependent upon private sponsorship[4] and internet orders. Game manufacturers and private individuals donated supplies, including rule books and dice. A number of groups formed in the United States to collect and ship gaming supplies for the convention. Operation Dice Drop in Oregon is one such group.[5] The ultimate goal of the Con was to give every coalition service member and civilian contractor in attendance at least one item to take home and keep.[citation needed] This was achieved quite easily, and many soldiers even took boxes of goodies with them to their individual living areas.[citation needed]\n\nNotes [ edit ]",
  "latent_15003": "This will be a fairly short post. I’m labeling this Part I as I’m hoping to give a more full report once I see this work through. It would be good to get some feedback and more eyes on this in the mean time though! Lots of credit to bluss here - he provided an awesome library and lots of support (and code to steal) for this work.\n\nRecently I implemented bluss’ matrixmultiply in rusty-machine. Matrixmultiply is an awesome, lightweight library that provides fast, native implementations of matrix multiplication in Rust.\n\nThe gains were pretty huge (upwards of 10x improvements on my naive implementation) and this inspired me to see if we could get even better by using multithreading.\n\nParallelizing matrix multiplication isn’t easy and there are a few different approaches. For now I have been playing around with a pretty simple divide and conquer implementation. The idea is that we find the largest dimension and if it is greater than some threshold we split the matrix along it and repeat recursively on the two new halves. Once we are below the threshold we perform our usual matrix multiplication. The algorithm is summarized nicely here. I’m using rayon to achieve the parallelism.\n\nInitial results are looking pretty good!\n\ntest linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_100 ... bench: 221,813 ns/iter (+/- 28,576) test linalg::matrix::mat_paramul_128_100 ... bench: 213,257 ns/iter (+/- 16,667) test linalg::matrix::mat_blasmul_128_100 ... bench: 107,305 ns/iter (+/- 14,451) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_1000 ... bench: 1,994,442 ns/iter (+/- 79,774) test linalg::matrix::mat_paramul_128_1000 ... bench: 1,147,764 ns/iter (+/- 136,592) test linalg::matrix::mat_blasmul_128_1000 ... bench: 996,405 ns/iter (+/- 109,778) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_10000 ... bench: 21,185,583 ns/iter (+/- 794,584) test linalg::matrix::mat_paramul_128_10000 ... bench: 11,687,473 ns/iter (+/- 638,582) test linalg::matrix::mat_blasmul_128_10000 ... bench: 10,278,981 ns/iter (+/- 973,273) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_100000 ... bench: 210,618,866 ns/iter (+/- 4,908,516) test linalg::matrix::mat_paramul_128_100000 ... bench: 112,120,346 ns/iter (+/- 6,052,281) test linalg::matrix::mat_blasmul_128_100000 ... bench: 102,699,089 ns/iter (+/- 9,024,207)\n\nThe BLAS benchmarks are taken from ndarray using openblas. For comparison, here is the old implementation:\n\ntest linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_100 ... bench: 2,078,298 ns/iter (+/- 132,209) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_1000 ... bench: 20,901,834 ns/iter (+/- 576,653) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_10000 ... bench: 228,113,515 ns/iter (+/- 2,512,868) test linalg::matrix::mat_mul_128_100000 ... bench: too damn long /iter (+/- ____)\n\nThis was run on my pretty average laptop with 4 cores. The implementation is still basic and so there is some overhead that can be removed quite easily.\n\nWhat next?\n\nFirst I’m going to try trimming off some of this overhead. In the process I’ll hopefully make some of the code a little safer to use. I’ve had to break a couple rules to get this implementation up and running (allowing cloning of mutable raw pointers, and Sync / Send ing them too…).\n\nI’ll also take a deeper look at the matrixmultiply library to see if we can introduce the BLIS multithreading - this may give us better performance.\n\nAfter this I’m going to see if I can optimize some of the other native linear algebra within rusty-machine. Starting with inverses (probably). This won’t be included as part of this series of posts.",

This 2014 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group.\n\nYour team: Detroit Lions\n\nYour 2013 record: 7-9, with a 1-6 finish (including a kicker destroying them single-handedly) that led to the ouster of Jim Schwartz (he took all his Kid Rock CDs with him!) and the hiring of...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour coach: Jim Caldwell. HOLY SHIT, JIM CALDWELL! You really did that. My God. I remember when the Lions made this hiring, I thought to myself, \"You know, right before the season starts, I'm gonna remember that the Lions hired Jim Caldwell, and I will still be shocked.\" And I am. I'm flabbergasted. This is the single worst coaching hire since the Chargers hired Norv Turner. Go ahead and ask Chargers fans about the Norv Turner years. They will tell you that, even with a touch of modest success, they spent that entire time, wire-to-wire, waiting for Norv to be fired. And so it is with Jim Caldwell. He didn't even fire Gunther Cunningham! There's no hope here. There's just Caldwell staring off into space, like he's trying to summon a really deep thought that he can't quite capture. He'd be an awesome coach for, like, a river.\n\nKeep in mind that Schwartz was fired mostly because the Lions are a talented but remarkably aimless team. For Lions games, referees use special penalty flags that shoot out very small additional penalty flags, like a roman candle for any time Ndamukong Suh decides to commit 60 personal fouls while holding. This team desperately needed a strong personality, and it's not like the job was unappealing. The Lions job came prefab with Megatron and Fat Stafford and everything. And yet, THIS was the best they could do. Even Ken Whisenhunt turned them down to go coach the Titans, and the Titans have a Pinto at quarterback. We are approaching Week 1 and the reality of Jim Caldwell as the Lions coach, and I really don't think you guys are emotionally prepared for it. How can you be? It's just gonna hit you like a brick.\n\nYour quarterback: Matt Stafford, shown here going through his progressions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI bet Matt Stafford is already looking forward to participating in celebrity golf pro-ams. That's the vibe he gives off. He is a man of leisure who just happens to occasionally play quarterback effectively. If he throws 15 interceptions in a crushing 45-44 defeat (the Lions obviously blow a 44-10 lead here), Stafford is probably just fine going back to his McMansion to dick around with his Brookstone putting green. Stafford is like a decade-long QB carousel encapsulated into a single player.\n\nIt's like Dave Krieg. Dave Krieg played in Seattle forever and didn't really accomplish anything, so fans hear his name and they're like, \"Oh yeah! Boy, he was here for a while!\" That's how Stafford will end up: The Guy That Was Here.\n\nWhat's new that sucks: In case Stafford gets hurt reaching over to grab one of your French fries, the Lions signed Dan Orlovsky. I do believe I remember the last time he was here…\n\nI don't quite know how he's still in the league. Anyway, in addition to Blind Freddy here, the Lions signed Golden Tate away from the Seahawks. Tate will bring all of Seattle's insufferability and none of its football acumen. (Also, he will bang your wife.) To support Stafford, the team also drafted tight end Eric Ebron, who dropped over 11% of passes thrown to him in college and says a \"mental blockage\" is preventing him from being able to secure the football in his hands. So that sounds promising. Why have one Brandon Pettigrew when you can have two?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make matters worse, an epidemic of fatness is plaguing the Lions as a whole. Nick Fairley got busted down to second string for being overweight. And then there's former QB Scott Mitchell…\n\nHOLY SHIT! He looks like he ate the sun. And here I thought you people in Michigan were destitute. Turns out you're swilling half & half by the gallon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, this remains a team built exclusively for fantasy football purposes. Stafford will throw deep to Megatron a zillion times. Reggie Bush will have a few nice games before suffering some kind of nagging injury that stays with him for months and causes him to be a gametime decision at all times. And actual winning or losing will be completely beside the point. A Lions game in which Calvin Johnson scores twice is the real victory.\n\nOne last new tidbit: Owner William Clay Ford died this offseason. But don't worry, Lions fans: There are still PLENTY of Fords left to ruin the team for generations to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat has always sucked: There is an arms race of suffering out there between the Bills and Browns, and by now you know that the Lions also belong in that distinguished group of disabled puppy teams. There's long line of horrible coaches and QBs, and Matty Millen, and no Super Bowl appearances. But do you know what the worst part is? It's the fact that other teams HATE losing to a team like the Lions. Losing to the Lions feels like losing three games in one. Everyone who walks away from a loss to the Lions is like, \"I knew we were bad, but goddamn.\" Even in their present, somewhat talented incarnation, losing to Detroit is the kind of thing that gets other coaches fired and other QBs benched. They are the eternal benchmark for how far other franchises can fall. Losing to Detroit offers a brief glimpse into BEING Detroit, and it is cold and dark and scary.\n\nDue to the city's notorious economic decline, Detroit is currently experiencing an explosion in reverse snobbery. Every slideshow of Detroit ruin porn is accompanied by a braying Michigander (and they really do bray; I've heard the accent) screeching STOP LOOKING AT OUR RUIN PORN! And people who stay in Detroit like to pretend they are realer and more loyal than other Americans even though metro Detroit actually has a higher household income than Dallas, San Diego, Kansas City, Phoenix, and lots of other places. It's got filthy rich suburbs just like any other town. The city itself died because ZERO people stuck around as they were fleeing the corruption and high crime rates (and black people, because Michigan people are crazy racist) just so they could be closer to some shitty casinos in Canada. You did this to yourself, Detroit. YOU are the disloyal ones. So don't get up on your moral high horse and yell at me when I want to look at moss growing in the Silverdome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, the secondary still sucks. And Eminem is the worst.\n\nWhat might not suck: Stafford can stay consistent and Caldwell's even temperament can help cool down Suh and Joique Bell really is good enough to… You know what? I can't do this. This is all crazy talk.\n\nHear it from Lions fans!\n\nTom:\n\nSince the NFC Central was renamed the NFC North in 2002, the Lions have not won the division. To make matters worse, we have only finished 2nd ONCE during that time, with an abysmal 6 finishes in dead last in the division. And just to make the stats seem even more absurd, there have been FOUR seasons since 2002 in which the Lions have gone 0-8 in the division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandon:\n\nNdomuhkong Suh is a great player, but possibly the biggest dickhead in Detroit sports history, and Kirk Gibson played here twice. Suh dicked around naming an agent, and then flatly refused to enter talks to restructure his deal, meaning this season for him is damn near a $20 mil cap hit, precluding the team from signing any meaningful free agents. This is also not bringing up his tendency to try to actually murder people with his cleats, and his crapload of penalties per season. The Lions said NOTHING about the failure to restructure Suh's deal. Now, I understand that the team can't come out and say \"This asshat cost us free agents\" but at least address it in the media? Say something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames:\n\nWorst secondary in the league for 56 years running.\n\nRobert:\n\nWilliam Clay Ford finally died and got replaced by… William Clay Ford.\n\nChris:\n\nBack in 2008, I was living in Texas and the Lions were coming off a 7-9 season in which they actually started 6-2. Since the first game was against rookie Matt Ryan, I thought it was a stone cold lock that we would be off to a good start, as we were led by the always-feared Jon Kitna. On Matty Ice's first play from scrimmage, he threw a skinny post to Michael effing Jenkins for a 62-yard TD. That caused me to chug my first beer of the day. From there on, I chugged my drink every time something terrible happened. By the end of the first quarter, I was drunk. By the start of the 4th, I had downed three pitchers, numerous shots, and blacked out. I spent $250 on a bar tab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin:\n\nOur entire draft philosophy seems to revolve around the idea that, if we just get one more offensive weapon, we'll be Super Bowl bound.\n\nRandy:\n\n1. Literally the last position of need on the field was tight end, so naturally we go out and draft a tight end in the first round. Didn't even flinch when it happened. 2. Our defensive secondary consist of a scarecrow, Plank from \"Ed, Edd and Eddy,\" a hot dog vendor and Glover Quin (that poor bastard). 3. Our beer prices are some of the highest in the league, because management knows people with pay ANYTHING to drink this team off. 4. If Kris \"Brickhands\" Durham wasn't Matt Stafford's roommate in college, he would be bagging groceries for a living. Instead, he got the second highest amount of targets last season. 5. Ndamljhhoig Suh would stomp on an elderly women in the middle of a grocery store for no reason, and he would also wait until a cop is present to do so. 6. I had more 2013 fantasy football playoff wins than this team has in my lifetime. Also, the last time we were in the playoffs, the other team never punted. The defensive coordinator was signed to an extension within the next 48 hours, because Lions. 7. The only things Nick Fairley didn't eat this offseason is himself. 8. I actually think this team believes turnovers inside the ten yard line still earn points. Hell, they do it at least 10 times a season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen:\n\nImagine a version of the film Groundhog Day, devoid of joy, on repeat, without a third act resolution. That's what every Sunday is like for a Lions fan.\n\nZODIAC MOTHERFUCKER:\n\nI ALREADY COVERED THE CURSED HISTORY OF THE DETROIT LIONS LAST TIME AROUND BUT HOLY SHIT 2013 WAS A MELTDOWN OF FUKUFUCKINGSHIMA PROPORTIONS. JESUS CHRIST THE LIONS GAVE THE DIVISION AWAY LIKE A FUCKING ENTERTAINMENT CENTER ON CRAIGSLIST. AND YOUR NFC NORTH CHAMPIONS? A TEAM WITH NOT SIXTEEN NOT FIFTEEN NOT FOURTEEN NOT THIRTEEN NOT TWELVE NOT ELEVEN NOT TEN NOT FUCKING NINE BUT EIGHT FUCKING WINS. THINK ON THAT SHIT. THE LIONS HAD A MOTHERFUCKING ROSE PETAL PATH TO THE DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP LAID OUT WITH THE FUCKING STARS ALIGNED AND SMILING DOWN: EARLY DIVISION WINS. WEAKBITCH SCHEDULE. RODGERS SIDELINED WITH A FRACTURED CLAVICLE. SMOKIN' JAY CUTLER OUT WITH A STRETCHED VAG. EVEN THE VIKINGS WERE STILL ROLLING WITH THAT FUCKING POX PONDER. AND HOW DID THE DETROIT LIONS RESPOND TO SUCH A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE? SAME AS ALWAYS: BY FUCKING THE DOG. HARD OH BUT HERES THE FIX: LETS HIRE SIDELINE CORPSE JIM CALDWELL! I MEAN SHIT DUDE USED TO GET HIS LUNCH EATEN BY A BUNCH OF FUCKING BASKETBALL SCHOOLS BUT HEY I BET THE GUY WHO GOT OWNED BY THE FUCKING EAST CAROLINA PIRATES IS SURE TO TAKE US TO THE TOP! WHAT A FUCKING LOSER. EVEN DRUNK DRIVINGASS COCAINE SNITCH TIM ALLEN BAGS ON THIS FUCKING GUY. AND IF THAT WERENT DEPRESSING ENOUGH HEY LOOK WHOS BACK IT'S DAN ORLOVSKY. DAN \"WHOOPS I JUST RAN OUT THE BACK OF THE ENDZONE LIKE A FUCKING DUMBASS\" FUCKING ORLOVSKY. JESUS CHRIST THE BUCS MUSTVE BURIED THAT MOTHERFUCKER IN THE PET SEMATARY. FUCKING CALDWELL DRAGGING THIS ASSHOLE BACK INTO DETROIT LIKE HALF A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER STUCK TO HIS SHOE. \"NOPE DONT NEED A NUMBER THREE HERE! ORLOVSKYS GOT IT COVERED.\" THAT AINT JUST A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. THATS A DINNER READY TO BE FUCKING SERVED AT LEAST WE FINALLY TOOK DAVID AKERS OUT BACK AND SHOT HIM. FUCKING GUY KICKED LIKE A FUCKING SABOTEUR. KERRY VON ERICH COULDVE MADE SOME OF THE FIELD GOALS THAT MOTHERFUCKER BRICKED SUHS GOT NINE TOES OUT THE DOOR AND IM STILL SITTING HERE WEARING HIS JERSEY LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT AND I SWEAR TO GOD IF THAT CALIFORNIA ASSHOLE JOE FAURIA STARTS DANCING DURING A GAME THEYRE WELL ON THEIR WAY TO LOSING AGAIN IM GONNA MAKE PERSONALLY GODDAMN SURE THAT IT WAS A SMART DECISION TO DRAFT A THIRD TIGHT END* *WORD IS THE LIONS SIGNED LIKE NINE MORE TIGHT ENDS SINCE I STARTED TYPING THAT SENTENCE. THE FUCKING SQUAD IS 33 1/3% TIGHT ENDS AND MEANWHILE THE SECONDARY LOOKS LIKE THE FUCKING 26TH TURN IN A GAME OF JENGA SHITS AND GRINS THOUGHT ID ASK MY OLD MAN FOR SOME FUEL FOR THIS FIRE. HE STARTED QUOTING NIETZSCHE. I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THAT MOTHERFUCKER KNEW HOW TO READ. FUCKING LIONS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill:\n\nTerry Bradshaw commented on how the Lions \"Have made the right choice\" and were getting \"A great football man\" when they hired Matt Millen.\n\nJeff:\n\nSince 1958, literally every team has more playoff wins than the Lions.\n\nDerek:\n\nFuck Matt Millen in the ass with Henry Clay Ford's rotten skeleton.\n\nTracey:\n\nHonolulu Blue is hands down the worst blue. And I love the color blue. When I was in law school, in the midst of the 0-16 season, a friend came up to me and very seriously (well as serious as you can be after 4-6 beers) proclaimed he'd stopped watching the Lions and that it was the greatest relief of his life. He was aglow, I've never seen a grown man with such a wide smile on his face. He went on to say, \"I didn't know it was possible to feel good on Sundays in the fall.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam:\n\nMost teams manage to find competent starters, and in some cases Pro Bowlers, in the 2nd round of the draft. The Detroit Lions, however, manage to select every bust imaginable in this cursed round, without fail. Since 2001, when we drafted Shaun Rogers and Dominic Raiola (who is somehow still starting on this team, despite leg-whipping every DT in sight, and resembling that guy in your bowling league who takes it wayyyy too seriously), these have been our 2nd round draft picks: 2002: Kalimba Edwards 2003: Boss Bailey 2004: Teddy Lehman (and we traded back into the 1st round for Kevin Jones...stellar) 2005: Shaun Cody 2006: Daniel Bullocks 2007: Drew Stanton, Ikaika Alama-Francis, Gerald Alexander (only the Lions could screw up THREE 2nd picks in the same year) 2008: Jordan Dizon 2009: Louis Delmas 2010: None (traded back into 1st round for Jahvid Best, even though he almost died on the field at Cal) 2011: Titus Young, Mikel Leshoure (my favorite...we basically traded the rest of our draft to move up for Leshoure. And we all know about the Titus Young fiasco) 2012: Ryan Broyles, and his non-existent ACLs 2013: Darius Slay 2014 Kyle Van Noy I mean, I understand being inept, but even the shittiest GMs around the league luck into a decent 2nd round pick here and there. Nope, not the Lions. Not Matt Millen, not Martin Mayhew, and not any other schmuck parading around in our front office. We are cursed. I'm gonna go play in traffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert:\n\nOur \"best\" CB Chris Houston was signed to an extension though he was hurt. We knew he was hurt and still signed him.\n\nDan:\n\nFor the past decade we had a group of about 12 guys that got season tickets together. Then it was 10. Then 8. Now we are down to 6. Last season after missing the playoffs after the 6-2 start we almost cancelled completely. 2 guys opted to renew because it was an excuse to get out of the house on and avoid housework/wives on Sunday mornings. Another guy opted to renew because he enjoys the Bdubs pre-game all you can eat wing buffet and the refillable popcorn buckets at the stadium. The rest of us are just morons. We never stay till the end anymore. Not to beat traffic, but to beat heartache. We leave at any point in the 2H if the Lions are leading so we leave on a \"high\" note. We've seen the same game over and over. Lions score a TD take the lead then collapse during the last 5 minutes of the 4th quarter. Usually involves a Stafford pick. Instead of stockpiling WR's, we are now stockpiling TE's. The only thing the Ford's did right was make the new stadium a dome. Expecting people to pay money to see this dumpster fire team in an outdoor stadium in Michigan weather would be a worse decision that the Ford/Firestone alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan:\n\nLogan:c\n\nBecause Brett (I have a 3-inch penis) Farve's home record against us is 19-0. Yes, that's right, in his entire long-ass career he beat us at home every single fucking time. Fuck Brett Farve and fuck the Lions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim:\n\nFuck Joey Harrington, fuck Matt Millen, and fuck Jim Schwartz with a red flag tied to a marshmallow-roasting fork. And fuck Matt Millen a couple more times just to be sure.\n\nToast:\n\nOur fans are so desperate for anything to cheer for that they'll give Barry Sanders a standing O anytime he comes to a Lions game, despite that piece of shit retiring THE DAY BEFORE TRAINING CAMP OPENED.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSawyer:\n\nThis Lions team is basically what would happen if China ever made an NFL team. It was founded in a big manufacturing city that quickly turned into a war zone like ghost town. At the surface, we're flashy as hell: Megatron, Stafford, Suh, etc. We have everything that would make a casual spectator blindly trust us to succeed. But halfway through the season Stafford goes brain dead, the secondary's knees explode, and everything malfunctions into one heaping mess.\n\nTim:\n\nMy only child was born 4 days before the last Lions playoff victory. I am now a grandfather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew:\n\nAs fans, our decades of prayers and dreams of meaningful change to get a winning team were finally answered when the owner died (lifelong battle of richman rot), only to be vanquished by the owner's son stating, \"We will maintain course\". My prayers have changed to having an asteroid hit and wipe out Ford Field.\n\nJohnny:\n\nByron Maxwell, Kam Chancellor, and Richard Sherman were all drafted with picks that the Lionstraded to the Seahawks. Who did the Lions get with those trades? Lawrence Jackson, Rob Sims (who's good, to be fair), and Mikel Leshoure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank:\n\nI recently moved to Upstate New York and when I first let slip to someone that I was a Lions fan, his reaction was to laugh and say, \"Ha wow, no offense but your life must suck during football season!\" This man was wearing a hat and jacket both emblazoned with the Bills logo.\n\nStu:\n\nI live in West Michigan, and that's far enough from Detroit (geographically and spiritually) that most of the people here pull for Green Bay, or MSU. Sometimes when they find out you're a Lions fan they gloat, but usually they just look at you with a sort of sad pity. Being a Lions fan is sort of like being in a relationship with an alcoholic: they keep telling you they want to get better, they keep showing flashes of promise that make you remember why you fell for them in the first place. But nothing ever gets better. They keep destroying themselves but you just can't look away. This year we got rid of Shaun Hill, a perfectly fine #2 QB who played well for us, and replaced him by bringing back fucking Dan Orlovsky. Shaun Hill will probably end up throwing for ten thousand yards and winning every game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRob:\n\nI'm from Michigan originally and have been a Lions fan for all of my thirty-eight years. I live in Los Angeles now but still wear a Lions hat every day. A homeless man saw me on the street and said, \"Aw, man, Lions fan? I feel sorry for you, bro.\"\n\nAndrew:\n\nI wear a Mike McMahon jersey to most home games I attend, usually it's met by comments of, \"Man I wish we still had Mike McMahon.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris:\n\nI once stated the following: \"Joey Harrington's got Roy Williams, Mike Williams, Charles Rogers, Marcus Pollard, and Kevin Jones! Who are other teams going to cover?!\" My enthusiasm was entirely legitimate.\n\nJoe:\n\nIn 1948 they hired Indiana University's head coach to be coach and GM. They then wore IU's red and white uniforms. After some 2-11 suckage, they went back to blue and silver at home, but kept the red/white for road games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary:\n\nLate last year, a Detroit newspaper posted an online slideshow (of course) showing the names, photos, and accomplishments of prominent Detroit-area sports figures who died in 2013. Amongst the \"sports figures\" who passed away were two panhandlers who begged for money outside Detroit sporting venues.\n\nMihir:\n\nAaron Rodgers and Jay Cutler managed to miss like half the season, yet we still missed the playoffs and finished in third last year. The division was gift wrapped and this team, which has one playoff win in 56 years, still managed to screw it up. After deciding that Jim Schwartz's headset-spiking victory celebrations were a thing of the past, the team then hired a coach whose record is 38-83 when Peyton Manning isn't his starting quarterback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNate:\n\nLast year, my brother and I went to a Lions game in Detroit. We've been Lion fans living in Chicago since we moved here as kids back in 1987. We make a yearly pilgrimage to watch them (lose) every year. We went to the Bucs game, thinking they would win, which of course they didn't. But it was how they lost, yet again. The best part of the trip was this guy sitting in front of us. Truly Lionized, doesn't give a shit anymore because he knows no matter what, the Lions will bungle it. The whole game—during big plays, touchdowns, defensive stops, desperate jumbotron pleas to be loud, this guy is quietly seated. Doesn't move. We get to the end of the game, Lions driving with under a minute and Stafford launches the pass to Calvin Johnson. Ball hits him in the numbers, then his knees, and it gets picked—ballgame. But it was the guy that made the moment. In real time: Stafford throws the ball to wide open Megatron - crowd roars with anticipation, he shifts for the first time in his seat. Megatron catches it for .000000001 second - guy rises to cheer, thinking my God this might happen Ball hits Megatron's knee - he starts to sit down, knowing what's coming Ball gets picked -he's already seated, slight head shake that screams \"Same Old Lions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt:\n\nDo you know Matt fucking Stafford is on pace to retire as the highest paid NFL player of all time? God damn it.\n\nKyle:\n\nStafford will sidearm-throw his way into 350 yards and 6 interceptions a game, and our cornerbacks will give the Cowboys pass defense a shot at finishing 31st. The Lions are a fucking turd wrapped in gold leaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin:\n\nI am now 30 years old. The prime of my life is gone. I work, I'm married, I'm thinking about having kids. During the 1/3 (if I'm lucky) of my life that has passed so far, the Detroit Lions have won exactly one playoff game. I was too young at the time to remember that game. Worse, that was their only playoff win in 57 years. The Lions have now wasted the primes of two generational talents (one of the top five running backs ever and top five wide receivers ever by anyone's calculation). The most boring, bland, uninspiring, underwhelming coach in recent memory is their head coach. What do I have to believe that the next third of my life is going to be any different?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg:\n\nWayne Fontes and Erik Kramer are still their only Coach/QB combo to win a playoff game in my father's lifetime.\n\nKyle:\n\nI hate hate other Lions fans. I live about 1,800 miles away and nothing disgusts me more than seeing another Lions fan at a bar on Sundays. I hope they choke on a chicken wing and put us all out of their misery. We sell out a stadium built to resemble a Ford plant where our forefathers were used as chattel until their backs were broken by the same fucking family that asks us to pay for a product they've never shown any fucking desire to improve. We willingly fuck up our Thanksgivings—giving up one of the few days off we get a year to spend with family—watching our team drown the fun out of a great sport like some batshit postpartum mom. We do that every. fucking. year. We buy jerseys of guys like Suh who was probably a scholarship away from being the next Ted Bundy and we treat Reggie Bush like he'll give us a golden shower of greatness because he worked well in a winning college system back when everyone had Nokia brick phones. On top of all that, we willingly raise our children in this abusive, caustic fucking environment. My friend from college posts pictures of his infant son in Lions gear online. I feel within my rights to call child protective services. Late fall/early winter is already fucked enough in Michigan without having to freeze, get laid off AND watch the silver n' blue limp in to the finish for another 5 wins. Fuck this team and anybody who would support it, myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex:\n\nThe Lions are using practice jerseys made of recycled garbage this year. Like our secondary, they're repurposed castoffs that we hope will hold together long enough to make it through an entire game.\n\nChristian:\n\nI swore I was done after Matt Stafford outsucked Eli in Week 16 last season to eliminate the Lions from playoff contention. Everything was in place for the Lions to win their first division title since before I was born (I'm 20) and host a home playoff game. Cutler and Rodgers were out for extended periods of time and the Lions were 6-3 with a division lead. But alas, Matt \"I don't need a quarterbacks coach\" Stafford threw 12 interceptions in the final seven games, leading to Jim Schwartz shot out of a cannon to Buffalo. And how do they look to improve the team in the offseason? Management brings in a head coach who appears to have taken his last breath during the Bush administration and ignored a secondary that let Andy Dalton throw for 372 yards and three TDs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry:\n\nHere is a fun fact that many people don't know. In 2011, the Lions made a trade during the 2011 draft with the Seattle Seahawks in order for us to move up and get Mikel Leshoure. We agreed to swap the 154th pick for the 157th. The Seahawks used the 154th pick on Richard Sherman.\n\nAFC South: Titans | Jaguars | Texans | Colts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFC South: Falcons | Buccaneers | Panthers | Saints\n\nAFC West: Chargers | Chiefs | Raiders | Broncos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFC West: Rams |Cardinals | 49ers | Seahawks\n\nAFC North: Steelers | Bengals | Browns | Ravens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFC North: Bears | Packers\n\nWanna be part of the Deadspin NFL previews?

  "latent_15247": "The global economy is faltering again with growth rates “sliding back into the morass [they have] been stuck in for some time”, according to the Brookings Institution-Financial Times tracking index.\n\nIn a publication ahead of this week’s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the results will reinforce fears that many countries have become caught in a vicious circle of low growth, popular discontent and a backlash against trade and openness, resulting in more economic weakness.\n\nThe annual meetings will encourage policymakers to pursue inclusive and faster global growth as international organisations, finance ministers and central bank governors seek to reassure the public they can co-operate and that they have the necessary tools to break five years of economic disappointments.\n\nHanging over the meetings is the fear that the failure to improve living standards in advanced and emerging economies was important in the UK’s vote to leave the EU, may propel Donald Trump to the US presidency and will strengthen the hands of populists such as Marine Le Pen in France.\n\nThe Brookings-FT Tiger index — tracking indices for the global economic recovery — suggests the world economy is still struggling to grow strongly. The index compares many separate indicators of real activity, financial markets and investor confidence with their historical averages for the global economy and for each country separately.\n\nWhile the overall growth index for emerging markets has improved from the lows of late 2015 and there are signs of an end to recessions in Russia and Brazil, the level of growth remains far below historical averages. Sluggishness also continues to haunt advanced economies, which have settled into a pattern of positive but weak growth in recent years.\n\nThe same picture of a global economy failing to meet the expectations of citizens is likely to emerge from the IMF’s updated forecasts on Tuesday in its World Economic Outlook. Christine Lagarde, the fund’s managing director, warned last week of a “weak and fragile” economy that was encouraging “ economic malpractice” in the form of restricting trade and reducing openness, although she did not directly name either Mr Trump or the Brexit vote.\n\nThe IMF is likely to say the world economy is growing at a 3 per cent growth rate, similar to its average over the past 40 years. However, with faster growing emerging markets now accounting for more than half the global economy, so significantly higher global growth rates are needed for improvements in living standards to match historic averages in individual countries.\n\nProfessor Eswar Prasad, an economist at Brookings, said most of the world could be described as having “weak investment, stagnant productivity and tepid private sector confidence”.\n\nWith little prospect of a spontaneous recovery or strong new stimulus, he said “a strong adverse feedback loop has set in with low growth, fragile business and consumer confidence, low interest rates, financial system stresses, trade tensions, and political instability feeding into and reinforcing each other”.\n\nSignals for growth in the US have been mixed, leading to uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will feel able to nudge interest rates higher by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the European economy remains sluggish with high unemployment and inflation remaining too far below the 2 per cent target. Although China’s economy has stabilised this year, its growth remains dependent on extremely rapid growth in lending.\n\nProf Prasad urged policymakers outside central banks to help improve the outlook with more aggressive fiscal stimulus, deregulation and greater openness to trade. “The policy vacuum outside central banks has dented confidence, depressed domestic demand, hurt world trade and remains a drag on global economic activity.”",
  "latent_15256": "MIAMI — Three decades ago, the notion of a book fair in this city seemed wildly implausible.\n\nViewed as a town that had squandered its natural advantages, Miami was reeling and recovering in the early 1980s. The Mariel boatlift from Cuba had churned up its streets, and the 1980 riots were a recent memory. The Art Deco revival was years away, and the television series “Miami Vice,” a paean to South Beach style, was yet to make its mark. “Paradise Lost?” Time magazine had asked on its cover in 1981.\n\nSo in 1984, when Eduardo J. Padrón, the president of Miami Dade College, asked Mitchell Kaplan, owner of the fledgling Books & Books shop in Coral Gables, to help him start a book fair in Miami’s downtown area, the preferred ZIP code for prostitutes and vagrants, quixotic was a polite term for their vision.\n\nBook fairs were scarce around the country. Only two major ones existed; one sold books, and the other held readings. Dr. Padrón and Mr. Kaplan proposed doing both and set their sights on at least one big name. They lured James Baldwin to the first one.\n\n“Downtown was de miedo,” Dr. Padrón said in a recent interview, meaning a scary place. “But we had close to 25,000 people show up, and that gave us real impetus.” The next year Allen Ginsberg and Jerzy Kosinski arrived, followed by Joseph Heller and Maya Angelou in 1986.",
  "latent_15414": "Bigfoot\n\nThe Church takes no official stance on this, but some members believe that the legendary Sasquatch or Bigfoot is Cain. The main source that usually is used to back this theory is the reminiscence of Abraham Smoot of a story from one of the Church's first apostles, David W. Patten. Patten claimed that in 1835 he encountered Cain walking along the side of the road. He wrote: \"He walked along beside me for about two miles. His head was about even with my shoulders as I sat in my saddle. He wore no clothing, but was covered with hair. His skin was very dark.\"\n\nWe can see how someone could get Bigfoot from that description. The Smoot/Patten story was also quoted in Spencer W. Kimball's book, The Miracle of Forgiveness. In the 1980's, there was a Bigfoot sighting in South Weber, Utah and many members used this story to explain how and why these sightings occurred.\n\nExtract from Miracle of Forgiveness by the Prophet Spencer W. Kimball\n\nOn the sad character Cain, an interesting story comes to us from Lycurgus A. Wilson's book on the life of David W. Patten. From the book I quote an extract from a letter by Abraham O. Smoot giving his recollection of David Patten's account of meeting \"a very remarkable person who had represented himself as being Cain. 'As I was riding along the road on my mule I suddenly noticed a very strange personage walking beside me… His head was about even with my shoulders as I sat in my saddle. He wore no clothing, but was covered with hair. His skin was very dark. I asked him where he dwelt and he replied that he had no home, that he was a wanderer in the earth and traveled to and fro. He said he was a very miserable creature, that he had earnestly sought death during his sojourn upon the earth, but that he could not die, and his mission was to destroy the souls of men. About the time he expressed himself thus, I rebuked him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by virtue of the holy priesthood, and commanded him to go hence, and he immediately departed out of my sight…\"\n\n(Miracle of Forgiveness, Spencer W.

  "latent_15597": "Could Bears make history by jumping for a safety prospect?\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Jabrill Peppers’ T-shirt said “LB” on the front.\n\nIt lied.\n\n“What do I look like?” he said Saturday at the NFL Scouting Combine. “I’m a safety. I’m a safety. Yes, I’m a safety.”\n\nIt’s usually a bad time of year to admit as much. Since the Browns selected Eric Turner second overall in 1991, only two safeties have been drafted in the top five — the Redskins’ Sean Taylor and the Chiefs’ Eric Berry, who both went fifth. In the same 25-year span, only four others were drafted in the top 10.\n\nMichigan's Jabrill Peppers runs a drill at the NFL Scouting Combine on Sunday. (AP)\n\nHistory, then, says the Bears won’t draft a safety third overall. But you could make a compelling argument otherwise. After all, they’re the team that tied the all-time NFL record for futility with only 11 takeaways last year. In a game in which offenses become more spread out by the year, making the safety spot an essential cog might not sound so ridiculous.\n\n“You have tremendous athletes out there on islands and inside in the slots,” Peppers said. “I definitely think a good safety can be valuable.”\n\nLSU safety Jamal Adams — who, along with Ohio State’s Malik Hooker, could be drafted historically high — asserted that he definitely deserved to be picked in the top five.\n\n“I think the game is starting to change scheme-wise, passing,” Adams, considered the top safety prospect, told reporters at the combine Sunday. “We’re starting to have tight ends that can run now. . . . The game is changing. . . . You need safeties that can do everything in the back end, can cover, can tackle.”\n\nIn need of one safety, if not two — depending on your view of Adrian Amos — the Bears could begin to rebuild the position when free agency starts Thursday. The Cardinals’ Tony Jefferson is considered the top one available, followed by the Jaguars’ Johnathan Cyprien and the Cowboys’ Barry Church.\n\nAdams was a first-team All-American last year and didn’t commit a penalty. Hooker had seven interceptions in his only full season as a starter but has played only two college seasons and two in high school.\n\nHooker had labrum and sports-hernia surgeries on his left hip Jan. 16 and is not working out at the combine, but he said his medical checks were going well. He should be ready for rookie minicamp.\n\nAnd then there’s Peppers, who ran a 4.46 40-yard dash Sunday after being forced to work with linebackers because Michigan listed him at that position last season. After some lobbying, he’ll be allowed to do field work with the defensive backs Monday, too.\n\nNFL Network analyst Mike Mayock called Hooker a better center fielder but Adams a better hitter.\n\nHe said Peppers could be a versatile defensive piece in a league that’s as focused as ever on matchups. He doesn’t figure to be the first safety taken, however.\n\nPeppers said he played linebacker during his redshirt sophomore season only because he was told it’d help the team.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of tape at safety,” he said, “but I’m a pretty damn good safety.”\n\nBEST OF THE BEST\n\nJamal Adams, LSU\n\nAdams had private meetings with 12 teams scheduled for Sunday night — and, he said, with good reason.\n\n“I feel like I’m the best guy in the draft,” he told reporters.\n\nMalik Hooker, Ohio State\n\nHooker told reporters Sunday that he understood why teams questioned him about the fact he’s played so little football in his life.\n\n“They don’t want to put millions of dollars and their trust into somebody who doesn’t really understand the game of football,” he said.\n\nJabrill Peppers, Michigan\n\nPeppers is so dynamic that a few teams this week asked him about playing running back or slot receiver. Regardless, he’ll get the ball in his hands as a returner, probably starting on Day 1.\n\n“They don’t have to assume,” he said. “I will.”",
  "latent_15642": "NOAA admitted Wednesday global warming is playing an “insignificant role” in the warm temperatures enveloping the East Coast this December.\n\nWhen asked by National Public Radio if global warming was playing a role in the warm temperatures, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center Mike Halpert responded:\n\nIf it is, it’s probably fairly insignificant at this point. If it were to play a role, it would be more likely if, somehow, climate change is impacting either the Arctic oscillation or El Nino, and we’re not really aware that it is at this point. If you think about, maybe – the high temperature over the weekend was 70, so maybe without climate change, it would’ve been 69. I think it’s a fairly insignificant role, if any role at all.\n\nHalpert says the unseasonably warm weather is due to an “arctic oscillation,” which traps cold air in the Artic. An unusually strong El Nino, a climate event which causes ocean temperatures to rise, is also responsible.\n\nEither one of these patterns would increase temperatures on its own, but together, they make for a record setting warm winter. The December heat wave broke longest-standing temperature records, some of which were 142 years old.\n\nThere is a zero percent chance of snow this Christmas all along the East Coast.\n\nEnvironmentalists on Twitter promptly blamed the warm December temperatures on global warming, as shown below.\n\nRT yet another article abt how insanely warm NYC weather has been. as usual, \"climate change\" cannot be mentioned… https://t.co/bDY4jUdpxZ — Climate retweet (@ClimateRetweet) December 14, 2015\n\nEven Slate, a left-wing website, admitted “[g]lobal warming wasn’t primarily to blame/thank for this weekend’s ridiculously warm weather.”\n\nFollow Andrew on Twitter\n\nSend tips to andrew@ dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "latent_15925": "CEBU CITY — Retired police general Vicente Loot has admitted being a “kumpadre” of a Cebu-based businessman that goes by the name of Peter Lim and who was investigated by the House committee on dangerous drugs in the early 2000s for alleged involvement in illegal drugs.\n\nKumpadre or kumpare is a term used to refer to friends who stand as godfathers or sponsors in the baptism or wedding rites of their friends’ direct kin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Duterte alleged in a public speech last week that a Cebu-based businessman named Peter Lim has been among the three drug lords in the country controlling illegal drug trade in the country.\n\nAccording to Loot himself, the Peter Lim he knows is the godfather of his eldest son and owner of the vehicles that Loot and other police officers had borrowed during operations in the 1980s.\n\n“Yes, he (Lim) is a friend and my kumpare. But that’s it. Nothing special,” Loot told the Philippine Daily Inquirer over the phone over the weekend.\n\nHe said he had no knowledge of Lim’s alleged involvement in the drug trafficking. “I’ve no idea, and I’m not the right person to say whether or not he’s into the business of illegal drugs,” the retired general said.\n\nHe said he hasn’t seen Lim since 2000s although they kept in touch with each other through the phone.\n\nLoot, now Daanbantayan mayor, was among the five police generals who were named coddlers of suspected drug lords by President Rodrigo Duterte last Tuesday.\n\nThe President named one Peter Lim as among the three big-time drug lords in the country that he would like to put out of business in the same speech.\n\nAside from operating in the Visayas, no other specific description was given by the President, prompting a Peter Lim based in Cebu City to issue a statement through his spokesperson, denying he was the same person alluded to by the President. (This Peter Lim and his brother, Wellington, were the ones investigated by the House of Representatives committee on dangerous drugs in early 2000s. According to Peter Lim’s lawyer, his client was cleared by the House committee. Former Cebu representative Antonio Cuenco, who headed the House committee on dangerous drugs it was the National Bureau of Investigation that cleared the two, saying there was not enough evidence to file a case in court.)\n\nAside from Loot, also named drug coddlers by the President were retired Deputy Director General Marcelo Garbo Jr., Director Joel Pagdilao, and Chief Superintendents Bernardo Diaz and Edgardo Tinio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Duterte alleged that Garbo, who also served as police director for Central Visayas based in Cebu City, was the coddler of Peter Lim, alias Jaguar; Wu Tuan, alias Peter Co; and Herbert Colangco alias Ampang.\n\nCo and Colangco are high profile inmates now behind bars at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City while Lim was reportedly outside the country.\n\nCo is reportedly the leader of the Bilibid 19, a group of drug convicts living a luxurious lifestyle inside the national penitentiary, while the Lim Duterte mentioned is supposed to be behind the illegal drugs trade in the Visayas.\n\nDioscoro Fuentes Jr., spokesperson of Lim, said Lim and his brother Wellington were linked to illegal drugs trade in 2001 in Cebu City but were eventually cleared by the House of Representatives’ committee on dangerous drugs that conducted an investigation.\n\nLoot recalled that he was a young police officer when a fellow policeman introduced him to Lim.\n\nHe said police officers, particularly in the Criminal Investigation Service (now known as the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group), used to borrow vehicles from Lim whenever they needed them during police operations.\n\nLim owns Hilton Heavy Equipment and Tiger Motor Sales in Mandaue City, Cebu.\n\nWhen he had his first son in 1990, Loot said Lim was one of the baby’s godfathers during baptism.\n\nAlthough they have been kumpadres, Loot said he and Lim were not that close to each other.\n\n“I should say we’re only at the ‘acquaintance’ level. Apart from borrowing vehicles from him, I haven’t asked any favor from Mr. Lim. He’s but an ordinary friend of mine,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Loot said he went to Camp Crame in Manila last Thursday to talk to Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa and clear his name over allegations that he was a “protector” of illegal drug groups.\n\nBut Loot said Dela Rosa was was not around to meet him since the PNP chief was “out of town.”\n\nLoot said he was instructed by Interior Secretary Ismael “Mike” Sueno to wait for the investigation that would be conducted against the five police generals.\n\n“I already submitted myself voluntarily to the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to resolve issues on jurisdiction,” he said.\n\nSince he already retired from the police service, Loot said DILG had no jurisidiction over him.\n\nTo prove that he was willing to be investigated, he said he decided not to question the jurisdiction of the DILG.\n\n“I’ll just wait for whatever charges they present against me, and I’ll answer all the accusations,” Loot said.

  "latent_16009": "The Texas border city of Eagle Pass and the surrounding county are on high alert after 132 inmates escaped Monday through a tunnel dug inside a prison near Piedras Negras, a Mexican city that borders the United States.\n\n“We are very concerned and we have tight security with our border patrol as well as state agencies,” says Maverick County, Texas, sheriff Tomas Herrera. “It would be easy to cross the border area where water is only knee high. We have 80 miles of river. In some places you can swim or walk across.”\n\n“Our officers are patrolling the downtown district, which is right next to the Rio Grande,” says Eagle Pass Police Chief Juan Antonio Castaneda. “We have been very attentive.”\n\nThe massive break, which represents almost a fifth of the prison’s population, is one of the largest escapes in Mexico’s history. The Mexican government has dispatched a 70-member special-forces unit as well as Mexican troops to assist local police in the search. The state of Coahuila, where the prison is located, has offered a $15,000 reward for any information leading to the apprehension of an escapee.\n\nOn his Twitter account Tuesday, President Felipe Calderón called the jailbreak “deplorable.”\n\nThe inmates escaped through a secret, 4-foot-wide by 23-foot-long tunnel they had dug from inside the prison’s carpentry workshop to the prison yard. Once outside, they were able to overpower guards and somehow cut through a chain-link fence into a vacant lot, before disappearing into the rugged terrain that surrounds the 730-inmate facility, which is located about 12 miles from Piedras Negras.\n\nIn the U.S., the Texas Department of Public Safety has enlisted state troopers to patrol the border communities, and the U.S. Border Patrol has air boats patrolling the Rio Grande River. “They have choppers looking for them,” Sheriff Herrera says. “We are doing our part by keeping them from coming across.”\n\nEighty-six of the escapees were serving federal sentences or were awaiting trial for federal offences. “You have drug smugglers, rapists, a little of everything,” Herrera says. So far, three female inmates have been caught. They were discovered hiding in a prison visiting area.\n\nThe prison’s director and two other employees are being questioned about their possible involvement in the daring daylight escape. “We will probably hear the warden got 3 million,” says Castaneda, the Eagle Pass police chief. “Whoever was supervising the inmates was probably looking the other way; 132 is a big, large group of people to escape. They had to have help. It was an organized plan. It wasn’t something that came up overnight. It probably took a couple of months to dig the tunnel. It is pretty scary.”\n\nCastaneda believes that corrupt officials may have helped smuggle the digging equipment into the prison. “You would need air hammers,” he says. “It is not easy to dig through there. It is not sandy. It is rocky and the ground is real hard. It is not something you can dig with a spoon. They had to have some pretty good hardware to work on that terrain. They probably had to bring in some good tools, shovels and picks to break through the rock. They were probably taking the bribes for a long time.”\n\nIf Castaneda is correct in his assumption, it wouldn’t be the first prison break in Mexican history that involved the help of prison guards. In December 2010, 153 inmates escaped from a prison in Nuevo Laredo with the assistance of 41 guards.\n\nCartels have also been known to aid in the escape of prisoners. In February, nine prison guards in the northern city of Monterrey admitted they helped 30 members of the Los Zetas drug cartel escape. During the jail break, the Los Zetas killed 44 rival cartel inmates.\n\nCastenada says he believes the Los Zetas or Sinaloa cartels, which have long fought for turf in the area, are behind the latest prison break. “It is a struggle between the cartels to take over the ports and now there is a struggle for who is going to take over Piedras Negras. They are releasing some of their cohorts so they can help them control Piedras Negras,” he says.\n\n“I don’t think at this point that any of the main players here are big heavyweights,” Castenada says of the escaped inmates. “I think they are probably foot soldiers.”\n\nHe doesn’t hold out much hope that many of them will be caught. “There is too much money and a lot of hands reaching out for a share of the money,” he says. “The level of corruption runs all the way up, so it is hard to assume they will capture anyone.”\n\nBut Sheriff Herrera vows, “We will keep on patrolling the area until we hear they got them all—though he acknowledges, “I think it will be pretty damn hard.”",

  "latent_16049": "ANN ARBOR—Binge-watching is a great way for young adults to catch up on multiple episodes of their favorite television series like “The Walking Dead” or “Game of Thrones,” but it comes at a price.\n\nNew research by the University of Michigan and the Leuven School for Mass Communication Research in Belgium found that higher binge-viewing frequency leads to poorer sleep quality, more fatigue and increased insomnia, while regular TV viewing does not.\n\n“Our study signals that binge viewing is prevalent in young adults and that is may be harmful to their sleep,” said co-author Jan Van den Bulck, U-M professor of communication studies.\n\nBinge viewing, in which people watch an excessive amount of the same TV program in one sitting, has been on the rise as more American households use streaming services and digital video recorders.\n\nResearchers surveyed 423 adults between the ages of 18 to 25 in February 2016. They were asked about sleep quality, fatigue and insomnia, as well as the frequency of binge watching programs on a TV, laptop or desktop computer for the last month.\n\nMost of the sample (81 percent) reported that they had binge-watched. Of that group, nearly 40 percent did it once during the month preceding the study, while 28 percent said they did it a few times. About 7 percent had binge-viewed almost every day during the preceding month. Men binge-watched less frequently than women, but the viewing session nearly doubled that of women.\n\nRespondents indicated they slept, on average, seven hours and 37 minutes. Those who binge-viewed reported more fatigue and sleep quality compared to those who didn’t binge-watch.\n\nLiese Exelmans, a researcher at the Leuven School for Mass Communication Research and the study’s lead author, said people might sleep an appropriate amount of time (seven to nine hours for adults), but the quality is not always good.\n\n“These students have flexible daytime schedules,” she said. “Chances are they are compensating for lost sleep by sleeping in.”\n\nThe study showed that increased cognitive arousal prior to sleep (i.e., being mentally alert) is the mechanism explaining the effects of binge viewing on sleep quality.\n\n“Bingeable TV shows have plots that keep the viewer tied to the screen,” Exelmans said. “We think they become intensely involved with the content, and may keep thinking about it when they want to go to sleep.”\n\nA racing heart, or one that beats irregularly, and being mentally alert can create arousal (or pre-sleep arousal) when a person tries to fall asleep. This can lead to poor sleep quality after binge-viewing.\n\n“This prolongs sleep onset or, in other words, requires a longer period to ‘cool down’ before going to sleep, thus affecting sleep overall,” Exelmans said.\n\nThe researchers note that binge-watching frequently happens unintentionally. People get absorbed into their shows, watch “just one more episode” and fail to go to bed in a timely manner.\n\n“They might not intend on watching a lot, but they end up doing so anyway,” Exelmans said.\n\nSleep insufficiency has been connected to physical and mental health consequences, including reduced memory function and learning ability, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Basically, sleep is the fuel your body needs to keep functioning properly,” Exelmans said. “Based on that research, it’s very important to document the risk factors for poor sleep. Our research suggests that binge viewing could be one of this risk factors.”\n\nThe findings appear in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\n\nMore information:",
  "latent_16135": "Several people involved with the study said the heat drawn by the early disclosure of the document might well have the opposite of its intended effect.\n\n(Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this month, someone involved in the government's latest report on climate change provided the New York Times with a copy of the version submitted to the Trump administration for final approval. The main intent of the leak, according to several people tracking the report, was to complicate any attempt to suppress the study or water down its findings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nPublication of the document inflamed an already-fraught debate about climate change. Administration officials and Republican lawmakers accused the leaker and journalists of manufacturing a dispute. They said the report, which was required by law, was moving through a normal process of White House review.\n\nThe report was submitted in late June and the Trump administration has broad authority to review its findings. Any one of a number of government agencies can block its release, which is ultimately subject to presidential review.\n\nSome of the scientists involved in preparing the document expressed concern that it might never see the light of day. Katharine Hayhoe, a lead author of the report and director of Texas Tech University's Climate Science Center, said the motivation of its 50-plus authors—a mix of government and academic researchers—was to convey to the public and government officials the scope of a building crisis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\n\"As a climate scientist, I feel communicating this science is a moral responsibility,\" she said, noting that the contributors from academia were working without pay and taking away time from their teaching and scholarships. \"We are the physicians of the planet,\" she added. \"Climate change poses risks to people and our economy.\"\n\nSeveral people involved with the study said the heat drawn by the early disclosure of the document might well have the opposite of its intended effect. They said there are signs that the Trump administration would subject the draft climate report to a \"red team\" vetting process in which a group of scientists would be invited to vigorously question its premises.\n\nGovernment officials in intelligence and national security have long used the \"red team\" approach to stress test policy and intelligence conclusions about issues like Russian military strength. Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has called publicly for a \"red team\" review of the government's position on climate science.\n\nSobering Science\n\nIn many ways, the 669-page \"Climate Science Special Report\" is utterly unremarkable. It is a review of existing science that concludes human activities are largely responsible for the warming of the planet. Worsening climatic and coastal impacts are almost inevitable unless the world's industrial nations significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nIts contents came as no surprise to foes or supporters of polices aimed at cutting climate-warming emissions. Earlier drafts, with the same basic conclusions as those in the submitted document, had been publicly posted and in wide review since January.\n\nWhat makes the report significant now is the challenge it poses to a White House that has been moving aggressively to reverse the Obama administration's policies and rules on climate change. So far, the Trump administration has begun withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement, cut relevant environmental agency budgets, and removed from some government websites language describing the risks of unabated global warming.\n\nThe science report, due out in final form late in the year, is actually just one component of a much bigger, and congressionally mandated, document, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, scheduled for publication in late 2018.\n\nA 1990 law has required such assessments every four years by an office—the U.S. Global Change Research Program—created in 1989 by Republican President George H.W. Bush to coordinate research on climate change and other global environmental issues across more than a dozen government agencies.\n\nThere have been tussles over these assessments from the start. In the final years of the Clinton administration, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which advocates for limited regulation and is heavily supported by industry groups, filed a legal challenge to aspects of the climate assessment process. The George W. Bush administration was accused by whistleblowers of blocking federal agencies from citing the 2000 report, which had been prepared under the Clinton administration.\n\nThat climate assessment projected temperatures in the U.S. would rise \"more rapidly in the next one hundred years than in the last 10,000 years\" and described \"widespread water concerns,\" but said agriculture could likely adapt while coastal regions faced rising danger with rising seas.\n\nAn \"interim\" version of the second climate assessment was published by the Bush administration in May of 2008, but only after pressure from a critical Government Accountability Office report requested by Senators John McCain and John Kerry, and a successful lawsuit filed by environmental groups to force action.\n\nIt's notable that the three full assessments produced so far—in 2000, 2009, and 2014—were all published under Democratic administrations. More than a few analysts and experts involved in this arena suspect the next assessment will not appear before a Democrat wins the presidency.\n\nDespite the requirements of the 1990 law, the White House has substantial power to derail such assessments, said Nicky Sundt, who managed communications for the global change program office through most of the two terms of George W. Bush. The law, for instance, doesn't specify the scope or nature of the periodic assessments, said Sundt, who is now a senior fellow for climate at the Government Accountability Project, which in 2005 released documents showing that a political appointee had edited a different government climate report to soften its findings.\n\nThe climate science report at the center of the current dispute is being managed by a subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council, a body established in 1993 by President Bill Clinton through an executive order to coordinate science policy.\n\nThat body, in theory, is chaired by the president or a designated proxy, Sundt said. The subcommittee managing the report, she said, operates by consensus, with anyone from a host of agencies able to block approval. \"That opens up the possibility of all sorts of delays and changes,\" she said.\n\nAnd the president has the final say on what goes forward.\n\nAnother issue at the moment, she said, is simply transparency, describing the administration's actions so far on this report as \"troubled and opaque.\"\n\nTrump administration officials declined to comment on the climate science report as long as it is in draft form.\n\nIn an interview last week with a morning talk show on WBAP radio in Dallas-Fort Worth, Pruitt criticized efforts to publicize the draft findings and described next steps.\n\n\"This is a report that's issued every four years—it's just an assessment,\" he said. \"We're going to review it like all the other 12 agencies and evaluate the merits and demerits and methodology and efficacy of the report,\" he said, adding, \"Science should not be politicized. Science is not something that should be just thrown about to try to dictate policy in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nIn the interview, Pruitt appeared to offer conflicting signals on the climate issue. He hailed \"what we've achieved in our country in reducing our CO2 footprint.\" Then, seconds later, he questioned the science that has identified greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels as the prime driver of global warming.\n\nRed Team, Blue Team\n\nTrump administration officials focused on climate remain in close touch with groups challenging global warming science and determined to undo climate polices adopted by President Barack Obama. According to both the Washington Examiner and the news section of the journal Nature, the administration has been weighing lists of skeptical climate scientists provided by the Heartland Institute, an industry-backed group that has for years run conferences aiming to cast doubt on climate change research.\n\nIn a blog post in late June, Patrick J. Michaels, a climate scientist at the Cato Institute, a think tank that advocates for reducing government regulation, argued that the government's climate assessments were driven by a mix of politics and self-interest.\n\nHe pointed to the website of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which described the Third National Assessment as \"a key deliverable in President Obama's Climate Action Plan.'\" He added this quip: \"No politics there, just science (sarc).\" Then he asserted that hundreds of government officials and academic researchers make a living from the perennial reviews and research budgets on climate change. \"It has always been in their interest to portray global warming as alarming, and therefore in need of even more federal research dollars,\" Michaels wrote.\n\nHis post laid out several options for Trump, including replicating the Bush-era delays. He added, \"If there is going to be a 2018 version, it had better be at least a 'red team/blue team report.'\"\n\nThe national assessment process has other influential critics, including Steven E. Koonin, who for two years was undersecretary for science in the Department of Energy in Obama's second term. Koonin now directs the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University and has periodically criticized what he sees as oversimplifications of climate findings.\n\nAn op-ed article by Koonin in the Wall Street Journal in April was the inspiration for the plan by EPA's Pruitt, first reported in late June by ClimateWire, to develop an adversarial \"red team—blue team\" exercise to probe climate change conclusions.\n\nIn a phone interview last week, Koonin said government reports like the national climate assessments could benefit from this kind of scrutiny, no matter who is in office, to separate spin from substance.\n\nHe said issues can arise as authors choose which papers to include or exclude, and even in phrasing, especially in the summaries most people pay attention to. \"You can look at the same data and say 'we have low confidence hurricanes are increasing' or you can say 'we have high confidence hurricanes are not increasing,'\" he said. \"I would like to have that discussion.\"\n\nThis proposal has been widely pilloried by scientists, including John P. Holdren, who was science adviser to Obama through his two terms. In a recent Boston Globe op-ed, Holdren compared the \"red team\" notion to a \"kangaroo court.\"\n\nKoonin said he was not calling for a reassessment of scientific findings that were published by reputable scientific journals. \"I don't think this is the kind of review that should be applied to the original scientific literature,\" he said. \"We have peer review for that. It's not perfect tool, but it works.\"\n\nHe said he's spoken about participating in such an exercise with Pruitt and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry (who has endorsed the idea).\n\nAsked about the potential for politicization, he said: \"I would not become engaged in this myself unless I could do so with integrity, thoroughness, and transparency. But if I can do that and it aligns with the administration's plans, that's fine.\"\n\nCan Climate Science Survive the Political Climate?\n\nPrediction is inadvisable. But there still is a chance the report could survive relatively unscathed, according to interviews with a range of people involved with the process, or closely tracking it.\n\nFor one thing, while the report reaches conclusions at odds with the views of Pruitt and others in the administration, it also contains long sections on the scientifically established uncertainties that surround critical questions. Given the longstanding and bipartisan Washington tradition of highlighting findings that suit some agenda, there's plenty for everyone.\n\nHere's a look at the clear and murky.\n\nDrafted and reviewed by dozens of scientists within and outside government and endorsed earlier this year by the independent National Academy of Sciences, the report details findings drawn from a host of studies that are as close to certainties as science can produce.\n\nOne example is a section on human-driven trends in extreme heat and rainfall. It includes these points: \"The frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases (high confidence). Extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world (high confidence).\"\n\nMany findings directly contradict assertions of top administration officials. Here's what the draft says about evidence for a human role in recent warming: \"[I]t is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation. ... Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era.\"\n\nIn an appearance in March on CNBC, Pruitt emphatically disagreed with that assertion. \"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don't know that yet. ... We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.\"\n\nThe report also lays out in detail sources of uncertainty around some of the most critical questions for the intended audience: institutions and individuals in the U.S., from the local to national scale, charged with protecting coasts, cities, croplands, and other areas at risk from rising seas and disrupted weather patterns.\n\nAfter noting three different sources of uncertainty about the pace of warming in the 21st century, the report says that changes in precipitation—often the critical interface between climate and human welfare—are even harder to predict: \"Due to the greater level of complexity associated with modeling precipitation, uncertainty tends to dominate in precipitation projections throughout the entire century, affecting both the magnitude and sometimes (depending on location) the sign of the projected change in precipitation.\"\n\nIn a section on how the frequency of hurricanes and cyclones is likely to change, the report cites what's been called a \"hurricane drought\"—a remarkable gap, \"unprecedented in the historical records dating back to the mid-19th century\"—in the U.S. being hit by storms category 3 or higher.\n\n\"In this case the assessment reaches conclusions inconvenient for political advocates on both sides—but that is how science works,\" said Roger A. Pielke, Jr., a political science professor at the University of Colorado–Boulder, who's been writing on the evolution of the global change research office since its early days and has frequently been called on by Republicans in Congress to testify about climate policy.\n\nHe said concerns about possible suppression were \"misplaced,\" noting the science report is being produced under procedures laid out in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which includes transparency provisions that make it difficult to disrupt.\n\n\"As we've seen, the report couldn't be suppressed even if they wanted to,\" Pielke said. \"It has been public, it is public, it will continue to be public. There are plenty of things to be concerned about—this report not seeing the light of day or somehow being reclassified is not one of those things.\"\n\nThe best defense of the climate report's integrity going forward may simply be how it reflects the scientific process itself, said David Hawkins, who directs the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council and worked at the EPA during the Carter administration.\n\n\"Thank goodness we have science-based institutions and dedicated professionals who work there,\" he said. \"Absent a dark ages, science is relentless. Trump may be able to sit on a report that the government is required to issue but he can't issue a report with alternate science—at least not one signed by credentialed scientists.\"\n\nFor her part, the report author Katharine Hayhoe has been busy on Twitter trying to cut through the noise:\n\nThis post originally appeared on ProPublica as \"Trump Has Broad Power to Block Climate Change Report\" and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.",

  "latent_16246": "Recently, I overheard a (rather curmudgeonly) acquaintance complaining, \"These days, no one cares about who you are inside or what you do anymore: you can behave as hatefully as you want, as long as you wear the right shirt.\" At the time, I rolled my eyes, and he backed down from such an extreme example; but when I returned home and was fretting about wedding things again, his remarks came back to me.\n\nIn fact, his remark cut the Gordian knot of a wedding dilemma I'd been suffering recently.\n\nAt this point, let me emphasize that I totally respect goths, steampunks, rockabillies, and all others with great, creative, high-maintenance aesthetics: this post is just about how I, personally, dealt with the fact that I found some elements of the cultural narrative around weddings more difficult to escape than others.\n\nYou see, it is true that Anglophone media — especially publications aimed at women — often do assign women value based solely on the clothes we wear. Take the Mail Online (which reportedly has more female readers than any other newspaper): roughly 75% of its sidebar last week consisted of stories where women's value was judged solely based on the clothes they were wearing.\n\nAdmittedly, these judgements are often implicitly influenced by other factors — Kristen Stewart's appearance is \"disheveled\" when she is misbehaving and \"sexy\" when she's just released another blockbuster film — even if the actual content of her appearance has not been vastly altered. Nevertheless, it is significant that these judgements are only expressed in terms of comments on clothes. We can't admit that Anne Hathaway is an incredible actress and singer, we can only talk about her clothes.\n\nPerhaps this focus on clothes stems from a reluctance to seem too judgmental about any significant life choices, or to celebrate particular talents at the tacit expense of those who do not have them. These are not necessarily negative impulses; however, there is a danger that by focusing solely on clothes, clothes are elevated to the sole measure of a woman's worth. If your clothes are the only things on which you can be openly judged, then women feel extreme pressure to get their clothes \"right,\" because clothes have become the sole locus where value is openly placed and decided. You and your value are defined by what you wear.\n\nConsidering this gave me a wee epiphany about wedding planning.\n\nI began to wonder if other wedding decisions were coming easily because I did not feel like I was being judged for those things to the same extent that I felt like I was being judged for my choice of clothes.\n\nRecently, I had been fretting a little too much about my choice of dress, my choice of headpiece, my choice of everything appearance-related. My dress is not quite a sheath, but a bit more flowy: would that mean that I would look too frivolous? Will my friends think I am too ditzy? It's one-shouldered: is that too weird? Am I too weird? Will my fiancé wish he'd married the type of girl who'd wear a strapless dress?\n\nBy contrast, all the important decisions I had to make about the ceremony, or about how to furnish the house we're moving to in a few weeks — all that came easily. I began to wonder if those things were coming easily because I did not feel like I was being judged for any of those things to the same extent that I felt like I was being judged for my choice of clothes.\n\nPerhaps this problem is unique to me: I can be extremely internally snarky about other people's clothes (so my own insecurities are richly deserved payback). Nevertheless, it is also fascinating to me how well my internal anxieties match up to the Mail Online's sidebar of shame. Perhaps social elites have conditioned my snarky impulses. Even though I try not to wear makeup and generally shun the mainstream media, I can't escape the billboards, and the articles people link. It's curious (and makes me think about medieval monks and their perceptions of social roles, etc, but that's another story).\n\nIn order to remember not to fret when silly worries about appearance and value weasel their way back into my thoughts, I've got my patient fiancé's most excellent responses to remind me of what's really important. Some men just don't seem to feel the same pressures or to put the same emphasis on appearance. Therefore, my fiancé has been able to bring some excellent perspective… for instance, when I make an offhanded comment about the possibility that my dress might conspire to \"make me look fat,\" he replied: \"How can a dress make you fat? You don't eat it.\"\n\nI might judge my own value too much by my clothes, but it's nice to know that someone else is more concerned with what I do and who I am instead. Therefore, I'm going to try to stop worrying about cultural narratives about \"The Dress\" or \"the most photographed day of your life.\" I'll try to remember instead that I am not what I wear.\n\nAre you having fashion-related insecurities and freakout moments?

It’s just a matter of realigning your portfolios towards what possibly would be Trump-friendly companies,” she said.\n\nAlicer said companies unlikely to be affected by a Trump win are those engaged in infrastructure and consumption, especially with a strong dollar boosting the peso value of remittances of overseas Filipinos.\n\nProperty companies who have minimal exposure to business process outsourcing companies or those who have diversified into tourism while hosting BPOs would also be able to weather Trump’s protectionist policies., she said.",

  "latent_16353": "Two years ago, the Internet acknowledged that Claire Danes gives good cry face with a Tumblr tribute, teary super cut (above), and celebratory meme. Initially, and understandably, the actress reacted defensively to the news that two decades’ worth of her on-screen sobs had been taken out of context for Internet users’ enjoyment.\n\nLast year, the Emmy winner told Elle magazine that she thought her “cry face” had been “objectified,” continuing, “It’s just the way feelings register on my face. It's not calculated; it's not an aggressive gesture. It's been isolated from the rest of my work, like it's a tacked on thing. It's not.”\n\nIn a new Harper’s Bazaar profile, the Homeland star says she is still surprised the expression is of particular intrigue to anyone. But she proceeds to own those Internet-celebrated facial contortions, as “ugly” as they may seem, without any apologies.\n\n“I have my [husband, Hugh Dancy], who thinks I’m pretty enough in our life together, so I don’t need to be seducing the audience that way.” Then she goes on: “I think it’s also just my style, what I like in creative work, what I’ve always been attracted to, even as a little girl. I danced as a kid, that’s how I arrived at acting, and I took a class with a woman called Ellen Robbins. It was modern dance, so already a little raw. And I always had an appreciation for the macabre. We would do these improvisations and I remember one time, I was maybe 11 or 12, I was into grotesque movement, and I decided to do a dance where I was just doing a diagonal across stage, doing these weird movements and I landed and I just spat on the floor, like totally pretentious performance art. But it was great. I liked the ugly even as a kid, and I think that has stayed with me now.”\n\nGiven that Danes’s Homeland character has recently lost her lover on the successful Showtime drama, and is seen leaving her newborn for the Middle East in the fourth-season trailer, it seems safe to expect that Danes will be spilling even more tears on-screen this season.",

  "latent_16476": "Five, ten, maybe twenty years from now, when some curious newb cues up Netflix's Lady Dynamite—and, based on the first four episodes alone, people will be watching this smart, happily trippy series for a long while—they'll be seeing a lot of sitcom anomalies: It treats mental illness with delicacy, precision, and an utter lack of lesson-ladling seriousness; it jams together a whole mess of 21st-century comedy styles without having them collapse upon impact; and it's the first binge-era series in which a character turns the phrase \"cradle the balls and work the shaft\" into a catchy, easy-to-repeat sing-along (I'm just guessing on the last point, as I still haven't seen Bosch).\n\nCreated by *South Park *alum Pam Brady and *Arrested Development *majordomo Mitch Hurwitz, *Lady Dynamite *stars stand-up and actress Maria Bamford as … stand-up and actress Maria Bamford, who, in her small-screen incarnation, has just returned to Hollywood after a stint in a mental-health facility in Duluth (in real life, Bamford has discussed her own struggles with mental illness, as well as her stay in a psychiatric ward). As *Lady Dynamite *begins, Maria's on the mend but still fragile, and daydreaming of a fantasy-land hair-care commercial in which she's the fearless, empowered center of attention. \"Ain't no man gonna tell me *I *ain't a woman,\" she says to the camera, after giving it a glib, blinding wink.\n\nOnce Maria snaps out of her reverie, though, she's back to her new reality, one in which she's on meds, out of work, and in the office of her kind but feckless manager (played with delightful fussiness by A Serious Man's Fred Melamed), to whom she breaks the news that, after her breakdown, she needs to take it easy, career-wise. \"I'm gonna be less ambitious,\" she tells him, \"or maybe not ambitious.\" She needs to slow down, she says, and make amends for past mistakes. Maybe she can even learn a few things.\n\nSaeed Adyani/Netflix\n\nThe problem is that showbiz doesn't reward the half-ambitious—nor does it offer much in the way of easy, fuzzy-embrace redemption. So while *Lady Dynamite *sends Maria off on a search for connection and understanding—a search that finds her setting up a community bench for her neighbors on her front lawn, dating a bisexual meth-addict, and joining a support group for white people who worry they may be racist—she's often undermined by both her own screw-ups, and by an industry that constantly wants to sell her out and shut her up. Throughout Lady Dynamite, we jump back and forth between Maria's pre- and post-treatment showbiz career, and the Hollywood it depicts is a beautiful but insufferably shrill hellhole—a city pockmarked by cynical opportunists and calculating frenemies, all slaves to an industry that churns out hours' worth of racist, misogynist network sitcoms (or big-chain commercials) that make everyone rich while shoplifting their souls.\n\nBut it would be impossible for Maria—or Lady Dynamite—to survive in any other city. In Duluth, we watch as Maria tries to fit in among her parents (Mary Kay Place and Ed Begley Jr.), her fellow patients, her cubicle-manacled coworkers, and her cruelly condescending childhood best friend (MadTV's Mo Collins); such flashbacks find her rudderless, unable to perform onstage without wilting. Back in Hollywood, she may still be adrift, but at least she's no less crazy than her peers, which includes Saturday Night Live's Ana Gasteyer as a cravenly phony agent (she's the one who belts out that impromptu balls/shaft ditty, for reasons too long and happily silly to divulge here) as well as *Playing House *star (and new-comedy economy mainstay) Lennon Parham as Maria's lazy, underminey assistant. In Lady Dynamite's version of Hollywood, everyone's a little blind to their own batshitness, and happily so.\n\nSaeed Adyani/Netflix\n\nThat instability spills over to the show itself, which Brady and Hurwitz approach with a sort of tumble-dryer loosey-gooseyness, mixing together as many postmodern comedic styles as possible: There's the hyperlinked jokes and daffy wordplay of Arrested Development; the brusque bursts of low-budget mayhem that can be found on Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!; the medium-bending savvy and slipperiness of early Spike Jonze; and the blurring between off- and on-screen realities that anchor *Louie *and Master of None. There are also a few perfectly calibrated (and, again, very L.A.-centric) cameos, including *12 Years a Slave *writer John Ridley; a great, game-for-anything Mira Sorvino; and Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath, playing a gun-loving, dickish version of himself, all the while looking discomfitingly like he just walked out of 1998 (apparently, McGrath don't McCrackth).\n\nIf that all sounds like a mess, it's not—in large part because of Bamford, who holds it all together, even when Maria can't. The actress' face is wonderfully responsive: Eyebrows that jump in awkward shock or too-obvious delight; a smile that turns from beatific to beaten-down in just seconds. But anyone who's seen her stand-up specials or occasional TV turns (including her loopy Target ads) already knows this. The real surprise in *Dynamite *is how convincingly she plays Maria at her weakest moments, when her illness has literally and figuratively dragged her to the ground—moments Bamford plays without the mawkishness or manic-panic over-emoting that might have negated the banal truths of mental illness that *Dynamite *wants to explore. It's hard to think of a current comedy performer more ambitious, or maybe as *not *un-ambitious, as Bamford is here—or a show more fitting of its explosive title.",
  "latent_16693": "About two weeks ago, Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign published a tweet asking a rather simple question: “Did Marco Kill Obamacare?” The senator’s staff then answered it: “You bet he did.”\n\nNow, I like to think I follow the news pretty closely, and if a Republican senator had actually killed the Affordable Care Act, I suspect I would have noticed. So, what in the world is Team Rubio talking about? The New York Times had this report today:\n\nA little-noticed health care provision that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida slipped into a giant spending law last year has tangled up the Obama administration, sent tremors through health insurance markets and rattled confidence in the durability of President Obama’s signature health law.\n\nAt issue is a part of the ACA known as “risk corridors.” As MSNBC’s Aliyah Frumin explained a while back, the argument goes like this: “Under Obamacare, insurance companies must sell policies to everyone equally, regardless of pre-existing conditions, so there is a chance that some insurers could wind up with a larger-than-expected number of unhealthy customers. The risk corridor provision provides protections from that possibility until 2016. The cost is covered by other insurance companies, which pay into the risk corridor fund when they set their own premiums much higher than was needed to cover their expenses.”\n\nThe point, obviously, is to help with the transition period as the law is implemented and takes root system-wide. Once insurers get a better sense how to set prices accurately, the risk subsides and the need for risk corridors lessens.\n\nIronically, Republicans helped come up with the idea for risk corridors in the first place, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the temporary provision of the law would save American taxpayers about $8 billion over the course of three years.\n\nBut Rubio launched a crusade against the policy anyway, because, well, no one’s really sure why. The Florida senator seems to work from the assumption that Obama is bad, which means Obamacare is bad, which means any attempt to undermine the health care system is good.\n\nAnd, to be sure, if Rubio intended to do real harm by gutting the risk corridor program, he succeeded – his effort has had a detrimental effect on the system.\n\nBut to see this as proof of Rubio “killing Obamacare” is a stretch, even for a Republican presidential candidate. Nicholas Bagley recently published a great piece on this, which is tough to excerpt, but which concluded, “Marco Rubio hasn’t killed Obamacare and he hasn’t saved taxpayers any money. All he’s done is throw a wrench in the works.”\n\nThe unnerving part of this is that Rubio introduced a degree of chaos into the system just for the sake of doing so. His gambit doesn’t actually help anyone, and it certainly doesn’t improve anyone’s health security, but that’s not why the senator did it. Rather, this was about taking steps to undermine the nation’s health care system just so Rubio could brag to far-right voters about his destructive prowess.",

  "latent_17118": "When Doomfist was announced, everyone was scrambling to see who voiced him. Was it Terry Crews like the community had been clamoring for? To the chagrin of many, it was not Crews. Instead, Blizzard went with the very talented Sahr Ngaujah. The community was, of course, disappointed that their choice for the role was not cast. Fret not friends, Blizzard made the best choice for the game you love.\n\nHere is the thing: we all wanted Terry Crews. You can talk to almost anyone who is vaguely familiar with Overwatch and they will have heard something about a campaign for Crews to be Doomfist. However, it is important to remember what Crews is up to on a regular basis. He is a series regular on the TV show Brooklyn Nine-Nine, having been credited in all 90 episodes. He appears in movies frequently, and according to his IMDB page he is currently working on four unreleased projects. This does not include his recently announced role in Crackdown 3.\n\nCrews is a busy man to be sure, constantly doing new things and jumping between projects. A quick glance at Ngaujah’s IMDB will show you that he is also fairly busy, having done several projects already since his work as Doomfist. However, while Ngaujah is a Tony award nominated actor, he does not bring with him the kind of baggage that Crews does. We, as an audience can make a quick assumption that Ngaujah will be available to record when Blizzard calls, at least, more available than Crews.\n\nThink back to all the wonderful videos that the Overwatch voice cast put on together and think about how much you would miss them if one of the actors was simply too busy.\n\nYou know, like this one.\n\nMany of the very talented actors who work on Overwatch are recognizable. You have probably heard or even seen them before. Ironically, Ngaujah may be one of the most famous actors in the Overwatch cast. That being said, he is currently not the level of famous as Terry Crews. Crews is a household name, someone who you could bring up to a friend, describe him and they would know who you were talking about. It is doubtless that Ngaujah has many, many fans, but he could walk the streets without people shouting for his autograph. There is a difference here that seems semantic but is so key.\n\nPart of the reason you love Overwatch — part of the reason I love Overwatch — is how alive the game feels. I don’t just mean in an atmospheric way, but in the culture that surrounds it. The voice actors, the developers and even this very website. The events that Blizzard puts on for the community, for holidays or what have you, are crucial to keeping that feeling. Even if you don’t care when you open a box and get a voice line, plenty of others do. In order to make Doomfist feel real, to make him fit in with the rest of the colorful cast, his actor needs to be available when Blizzard calls.\n\nWe all love Terry Crews and we can all hope that he shows up in the Overwatch lore as a one off character sooner or later (maybe as a previous Doomfist?). But we don’t have Crews, we have Ngaujah. If you have played Doomfist or listed to his lines or watched any of his videos you know the deal: Sahr Ngaujah is perfect casting for Doomfist. All of his work is excellent in the game so far. The best part? We haven’t heard the last of him.\n\nYou can absolutely be sad about Crews if you want, but try your hardest not to forget that Blizzard took care of us in spite of ourselves.",

  "latent_17261": "Physician arrogance happens daily and I have, unfortunately, been on the receiving end of such treatment from doctors on too many occasions through the years. I am happy to report that I have established my current dream team of courteous and caring doctors who no longer talk at or talk down to me. But this has not always been the case. And it is not the case for many others.\n\nAs I routinely visit the online Sjogren’s Forum, I see daily posts from people describing the horrible, rude and dismissive treatment they receive from their physicians. Their symptoms are often minimized, ignored or left untreated. I have to say after reading about other patient’s negative doctor experiences for so many months and experiencing this treatment myself, it surely appears that there is an “arrogance” epidemic among physicians. What’s worse is that this rude and undeserved patient treatment can serve to shut a patient down from further seeking treatment for their condition(s).\n\nSjogren’s Syndrome is a very difficult autoimmune disease to diagnose. It can take many years to identify Sjogren’s Syndrome in patients. The symptoms behave like a disappearing act. One day a patient presents with joint pain; swollen glands and neuropathy, while the next day their symptoms are completely different.\n\nImagine taking your car in to fix a noise that you hear at different times when you are driving and you have had it for many weeks. When you arrive at the auto repair shop with your car, the car does not make the noise. (we can all relate to this) Does the repairman not believe you as a result? Does he speak in a condescending voice and tell you that you probably didn’t hear a noise and it was probably in your head? Does he offer advice by telling you just to go home rest and try to reduce some of the stress in your life? No. Because the auto repair shop is a “for profit” business, in the exact same way that a physician’s practice is.\n\nNow granted, all people know how many years a doctor has attended school. We know that they have paid big bucks and made sacrifices to obtain skill sets that enable them to be called doctor and “expert” by the medical and non-medical community at large. But for a very large number of physicians, it seems that they have also earned a degree in arrogance. It seems also, that somewhere along their medical school journey they forgot the reason that they went into medicine. I am sure that some doctors just wanted a cushy salary. But I would assume that most doctors chose the field of medicine to help people. I mean, they have to take the Hippocratic Oath that says that they will do no harm to people. In my opinion, that should include the behavior of chiding the patient in a condescending tone; making the patient feel invalidated and not believed.\n\nMaking a choice to spend many years and dollars to attend medical school, does not give any physician the right to treat people with rude and sub-standard patient care. A person who is a patient, does not equal ” less than”. Regardless of one’s career choice and self-inflated and perceived status, people are people and should be treated with respect. I mean after all, they are the same people who pay your physician salaries.\n\nIf a patient is labeled with depression, perhaps their doctors have been contributing factors to the diagnosis. Unfortunately, I do not think that the rude behavior, once established, is likely to change. But we, as the patient recipients of such mediocre professionalism, can and should speak loudly with our feet.\n\nPatients should never be put in a position that makes them second-guess their symptomology, pain and obvious illness. It is important, especially for those of us who live with chronic illness, to learn and to master our own medical advocacy. There are many compassionate doctors who do care & provide wonderful care to their patients. But it is up to us to be proactive in finding those rare gems.\n\nBe strong and choose your doctors carefully!\n\nSjoDry\n\nAdvertisements",

Part of me just wanted my recovery to continue indefinitely; I didn’t just want to get well, I wanted to get better.\n\nI learned early on, growing up with two older brothers, that it’s a good idea to make big friends. And as a street-smart (and theatrically inclined) string bean of a grade-schooler, making nice with the heavies was a no-brainer. This trend continued through my life, though the bullies had less and less to do with it. There’s just an appealing swagger to the very large. You can see it: The ease and assurance that comes from knowing you will not be messed with. (Not to put too fine a point on this, but gay men don’t grow up with that, we have to get there somehow.)\n\nHearing me whine about my post-traumatic plateau, a faction of my bigger friends – some powerlifter and highland gamer types – pointed me toward Total Performance Sports (or “TPS”), a sprawling 40,000-square-foot gym in an Everett warehouse that specializes in intensive strength training – from strongman competitions to Olympic lifting to boxing to powerlifting to classes with titles like “Not Cross Fit.”\n\nTPS owner C.J. Murphy started lifting weights when he was 13, after some trouble he got into resulted in the yanking of all his afterschool sports. He’s 44 now, and it’s hard to imagine anyone taking anything away from him. Dude is big. Goatee is long. Murph’s desk chair groans when he swivels to see who has entered his office. (Note: Sitting with your back to the door = swagger.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a quick consultation, in which Murph pinches various particularly fatty sites on my body with calipers, I answered a few questions about my crappy diet, a plan was printed out, and I was on my way. Over eight weeks, I’d be overhauling my diet completely, lifting weights four nights a week, and sleeping like a dead champ. I’d be testing my strength (and my new arm) with Director of Strength and Conditioning Steve DiLello twice weekly at Awesome Camp (upper body on Tuesdays, lower body on Thursdays) and training by myself on the off nights.\n\nThe idea wasn’t to get “jacked” or “ripped” or “freaky huge” or any of the other descriptors plastered across the giant tubs of protein I had to buy; my goal was an abstraction: “awesomeness.” I would determine its meaning as I went. I was assured that my body would change drastically – fat would drop, muscle would emerge – and instructed not to buy any new clothes for the time being.\n\nThe biggest changes, however, would happen where no one could see them. After years of denial, I discovered my inner meathead, and we’ve since become super tight bros. In the parlance of a certain highly judgmental ad, “I lift things up and put zem down.”\n\nWEEK 1\n\nFor 10 days, I’ve eaten nothing but chicken, lettuce, coconut milk, eggs, whey isolate, water, air, and bitter, bitter envy. Every day at work seems to have some cakeworthy occasion at its center, and my insides howl at the icing and injustice all over everything. It’s a temporary carbless prep phase for my diet, and I can’t complain: I’ve already lost 10 lbs. just by bunnying out.\n\nThe gym is vast, hot, and loud. The clang of iron cuts through a dense din of Motörhead, AC/DC, and (my old friends from surgery) Guns N’ Roses. A line of girls lean against a wall catching their breath, awaiting the return of a classmate pushing a Prowler — a heavy training sled that can be loaded with weights — down a long strip of Astroturf. One dude is doing heavy squats at the Monolift, the bar straining into an arc across his back as he drops down low. A few young men take turns wailing on a tractor tire with a sledgehammer in the corner; another guy is benching a weight I can’t immediately calculate, coils of thick chains hung from each end rattling as they rise from the floor. It occurs to me that I may be in trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt becomes clear that this is the opposite of every gym I’ve ever belonged to: No one is languishing on an elliptical reading US Weekly. No one is zoning out to the Kardashians. No one is texting on a treadmill. No one is pretending to workout.\n\nWell, except me – I’m the new guy (most of my campmates are on their second or third cycle of camp), and Steve has me working on my form with an unweighted bar. Awesome Camp is based around three primary lifts – the bench press, the deadlift, and the squat – and it seems I’m doing all of them wrong. After learning how to properly employ my shoulders, back, butt, feet, eyes, breath, and brain at all three stations, I’m ready to move on . . . to hauling a 240 lb. training sled down the turf four times, that is.\n\nWEEK 2\n\nCooking, it seems, will be the fifth weekly workout. I spent all day Sunday in the kitchen: grilling chicken breasts, hard-boiling eggs, prepping rice, mashing sweet potatoes, fixing salads, and pre-mixing various powders for the week of protein shakes I’ll be downing. My sleep at night has deepened, interrupted only by wild charlie horses in regions of my legs I never knew were capable of cramping.\n\nCamp is going well, my form improving tweak by tweak; but the real challenge has been policing and pacing my diet. Murph’s plan for me is based on a book by one John Kiefer titled “Carb Backloading” — and it uses the natural timing of the body (and its response to resistance training) to determine when and how you consume the different components of your diet. The specifics differ based on a person’s goals, but for me it amounts to long carb-less days and bingey carb-orgies at night. At work, I stick faithfully to salad and boiled egg whites, but in the evenings after workouts, I gorge on rice, potatoes, cookies, and ice cream. Out of courtesy for my husband’s own diet (and a touch of my own carb-shame), I sometimes do this in the privacy of the pantry.\n\nWEEK 3\n\nI notice our ranks have shrunk slightly. The only other rookie has vanished, and the camp proceeds indifferently; clearly this lapse in retention has happened before.\n\nStill among us is Bill, 36, two camps in and affectionately referred to as Moose (though I’m not certain a moose could pull a 28,000-pound truck across the parking lot like Bill has); brothers Zaafir and Ihsaan (24 and 26, respectively) the former coming back from a blown rotator cuff, the latter having upped his squat by 130 pounds over the course of four camps; and Stephen, 34, who, at 175 pounds can pop up 250 pounds on the bench like a toaster.\n\nFor a long time, I understood the gym as a stony, solitary endeavor. Supplement ads in muscle magazines love to paint the picture of the lifter as some sort of tortured warrior, confined to the garage and trapped in a pathetic flesh suit that is always insufficient. This marketing taps right into many men’s desire for bigness at all costs (a drive both Murph and Steve believe is rooted in a primitive impulse of survivalism), but it also completely obscures the real motivation behind many a misguided gym membership: being seen/noticed/watched by others.\n\nIn a group setting like Awesome Camp, you get a bit of everything: a shared ethos of progress, a spirit of competition, a system of encouragment, a sense of deliberateness and responsibility that solo workouts often lack, and, of course, the “ME VERSUS THE IRON” dude-psychology so deftly tickled by those ads. And when it comes time, as it does at the end of every session, to drag the hell-sled, it’s nice to know that our suffering is equally distributed.\n\nWEEK 4\n\nIt’s “deload” week, which means Steve is getting us “out from under the bar” and into the parking lot, where our training will take a turn for the savage. A 650 lb. tractor tire is rolled out of a shed and tipped over for our flipping enjoyment. This requires crunching up into a tiny ball and situating yourself between its treads, holding on tight and driving upward into the tire, which can then be propped up with the knee, transferred to the hands and pushed over. It’s brutal. After a few reps of this, the skin at the crux of my arms where the tire drags past is on fire. These, I learn, are called “tire bites.”\n\nAfter tire flips, we do a medley — hauling kegs one way up the race course, lugging weighted bars hanging from each arm back in the other direction (a “farmer’s walk”), and pulling a weighted sled toward us with a thick length of rope to finish.\n\nTwo days later, I’m on vacation in P-Town. It’s Bear Week — a celebration of a different, more Rubenesque brand of male bigness — and as I stand on the deck of the Boatslip, staring listlessly across the bay in a direction I imagine is toward Everett, I feel a pang of guilt for missing camp. All this fried food, the planter’s punch, the cheese fries — it all feels so wrong. Among my brethren I feel displaced, at odds with the vacation vibe. Meatheadedness is another closet altogether, and I’m coming out.\n\nWhen I take off my shirt to get some sun, my husband lets out a horrified gasp.\n\n“Good God, what happened to you?”\n\nI look down and observe a sickly purple and yellow bruise spread across my abdomen like a thunderhead. Tire bites. Awesome Camp is with me even when I’m not there.\n\nWEEK 5\n\nA subway full of sneezing children seems to have overpowered my body’s burgeoning awesomeness, and I get sick smack in the middle of the week. Despite this setback, there’s no doubt I’m stronger than I was a few weeks ago — even stupid tasks like standing up from tying a shoe, or dragging the trash out to the sidewalk seem easier. Light work feels like light work.\n\nMy T-shirts all fit differently, in part because I’ve taken to ripping the sleeves off. Now they hug my shoulders and chest instead of stretching over my once generous gut. When I detect what appears to be the first signs of an ab in the mirror, it feels like spotting some long extinct bird. I’m afraid it will scurry away if it catches me looking. As a get-better gesture, my neighbor drops off a DVD of the world’s intro to Schwarzenegger, “Pumping Iron.” Word appears to be spreading: I’m becoming “that guy.”\n\nWEEK 6\n\nThings are ramping up quickly. Our reps (those are “repetitions”) are coming down, and the weight is going up. I’ve developed a callus on the back of my neck where the squat bar has found its regular home. When we deadlift this week, Steve attaches 40 pounds of chains to the bar — they call this “accomodating resistance,” when the weight of bar increases the further off the ground it goes. This strategy forces us to power through the movement, building drive and power.\n\nMy off-night workouts, too, have become more intense, more personal. On a Friday night, I’m at the gym until 10 p.m., busting out sets of glute-ham raises, pushing 250 pounds on the Prowler back and forth, and doing one-legged squats that make me look like a slightly butch flamingo. The idea that people are out enjoying themselves and relaxing after a long work week doesn’t even occur to me.\n\nWEEK 7\n\nOur second deload week finds us back out in the parking lot. I apply the lessons I learned about giant tires and they seem to tumble more readily, or perhaps I’m just getting better at it. Inside, we pull a weighted metal “log” from the floor, roll it up the torso by shooting the hips forward, and hoist it over our heads. I imagine this being Paul Bunyan’s workout. Instead of our regualrly scheduled deadlifts, Steve drags a harness over to the turf, and shoves it at me. “You first,” he says. The harness is attached by a strap to a 500 lb. sled.\n\nUsing a thick rope laid on the floor to “climb” forward, we are to drag this cargo as fast as we can. I handily lose each time trial to my campmates — especially Bill, who seems as though he could very well go through life dragging this sled without noticing. After three runs, I’m toast. My legs tremble as I make the three floor descent to the lot. I vow revenge on gravity for making things so difficult.\n\nWEEK 8\n\nIt’s Test Week. We will spend our sessions going for the much ballyhooed “one rep max,” which is just what it sounds like: the most weight we can move in one lift. At stake for the winner (i.e., he who made the biggest leaps in weight from Week 1), is a T-shirt. Steve lays it on the floor in front of the squat rack to keep our eyes on the prize.\n\nOn Tuesday, I work up to a bench of 250 pounds (a 45-pound jump from my first night) and thrill at the flurry of fist bumps that follow. On Thursday (for which I prepared by eating an entire pizza the night before), I squat a cool 275 (up 50 from my start), and I pull a 375-pound deadlift — which seems to shock even Nikita, who teaches the Olympic lifting course a few platforms down from us. (“A very good dead,” he says in the locker room later, his Russian accent somehow making it mean more.)\n\nAfter some quick calculations, Steve nods his approval and hucks the shirt in my direction. “Nice work, Mike,” he says. Emblazoned across its front: “I Just Awesomed All Over the Place.” The sleeves have already been ripped off; this thing was meant for me.\n\nI think back to myself last summer — a broken heap on the couch, unable to lift a bottle of milk — and it’s a satisfying feeling. The road to awesome hasn’t been easy, but it’s been nothing if not simple; the trick is that “awesomeness” keeps retreating the closer you get, and the pursuit of it is the achievement of it. Whether or not I can get there remains to be seen. Ask me in eight more weeks.\n\nMichael Andor Brodeur is assistant arts editor at the Globe.

  "latent_17335": "Review article\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The psychostimulant properties of caffeine are reviewed and compared with those of prototypical psychostimulants able to cause substance use disorders (SUD). Caffeine produces psychomotor-activating, reinforcing, and arousing effects, which depend on its ability to disinhibit the brake that endogenous adenosine imposes on the ascending dopamine and arousal systems.\n\nOBJECTIVES: A model that considers the striatal adenosine A2A-dopamine D2 receptor heteromer as a key modulator of dopamine-dependent striatal functions (reward-oriented behavior and learning of stimulus-reward and reward-response associations) is introduced, which should explain most of the psychomotor and reinforcing effects of caffeine.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: The model can explain the caffeine-induced rotational behavior in rats with unilateral striatal dopamine denervation and the ability of caffeine to reverse the adipsic-aphagic syndrome in dopamine-deficient rodents. The model can also explain the weaker reinforcing effects and low abuse liability of caffeine, compared with prototypical psychostimulants. Finally, the model can explain the actual major societal dangers of caffeine: the ability of caffeine to potentiate the addictive and toxic effects of drugs of abuse, with the particularly alarming associations of caffeine (as adulterant) with cocaine, amphetamine derivatives, synthetic cathinones, and energy drinks with alcohol, and the higher sensitivity of children and adolescents to the psychostimulant effects of caffeine and its potential to increase vulnerability to SUD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The striatal A2A-D2 receptor heteromer constitutes an unequivocal main pharmacological target of caffeine and provides the main mechanisms by which caffeine potentiates the acute and long-term effects of prototypical psychostimulants.",

translating to the loss of one of their current 30 seats.\n\nBut it would be Ukip that would see the most stunning rise, with a three point rise since May in the constituency vote to 13% and a two-point rise to 16% on the regional list - which would translate into eight seats from its current zero.\n\nThat would come mainly at the expense of the Lib Dems, who are predicted to lose four of their five AMs, with only Brecon and Radnorshire AM and leader Kirsty Williams surviving the massacre.\n\nWhile the Tories and Plaid Cymru have both seen marginal rises in both the constituency and regional list votes, both are projected to lose seats in 2016 on the basis of the poll.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of polls which suggest Ukip is on the verge of a major breakthrough in the National Assembly, which has a proportional representation voting system that makes it easier for less-established parties to win seats.\n\nProf Scully said: “These projections indicate the possibility, on the results implied by the current poll, of UKIP becoming a significant force within the National Assembly, and largely doing so at the expense of the Liberal Democrats.”\n\nLabour saw a 2% slip in its Westminster vote to 41% - its lowest poll level since 2010 - while the Tories saw a 3% spike to 25%, its highest Welsh rating since the last election.\n\nUkip also saw a 1% rise to 14%, Plaid remained static at 11% and Lib Dems saw a two-point slide to 5% - it’s lowest rating in two years.\n\nIf translated into seats, Labour would see a boost of two Westminster seats in next year’s election to a total of 28, while the Lib Dems would lose two of their three and the others would remain unchanged with Tories on eight, Plaid Cymru with three and Ukip with none.\n\nProf Scully said: “Overall, this is a good poll for the Conservatives and UKIP, a solid one for Plaid Cymru, and yet more bad news for the Liberal Democrats.\n\n“As for Wales’ long-dominant party: this poll confirms that Labour’s position in Wales has declined significantly over the last year, but that they still remain well in the lead.\n\n“While Labour look more vulnerable than they did throughout 2011-13, the other parties must still look very enviously at their ratings.”\n\nA Welsh Labour spokesman said: “The 2015 General Election presents a clear choice for people in Wales, between a Tory-led Government giving tax breaks to millionaires, or a Labour Government committed to tackling the cost of living crisis.\n\n\"Welsh Labour, through schemes like Jobs Growth Wales, has made great strides in improving our economy, but we need a Labour Government in Westminster to make sure the recovery is secure and works for families across Wales.”\n\nA Welsh Conservative spokesman said: “This poll shows Welsh Conservative support is growing amid recognition that our long term economic plan for jobs and growth is delivering for people in Wales.\n\n“The only two occasions in the past 60 years when Labour has polled as poorly as this ahead of a General Election in Wales - were under the disastrous leaderships of Michael Foot and Gordon Brown.\n\n“Under Ed Miliband and Carwyn Jones, Labour lacks the answers to many of the problems facing the country and can only offer more borrowing, higher taxes and more debt.”\n\nA Plaid spokeswoman said: “It is encouraging to see strong support for Plaid Cymru following a recent poll showing the highest level of support for Plaid Cymru since 2009.\n\n“The growing disillusionment in Wales of the same old politics from the Westminster establishment parties and a growing desire for a new Welsh way, is contributing to more and more people turning to Plaid Cymru for an alternative.”\n\nA Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said: “The Welsh Liberal Democrats have ensured every school in Wales now receives over £900 for each of our poorest pupils to make our society fairer; while in Westminster, we are fixing our economy and ensuring that the lowest paid workers in Wales don’t pay a single penny of Income Tax.\n\n\"We will continue to campaign on our proud record of delivery for the people of Wales”.",

  "latent_17407": "It was just another weekday morning. I was on my rise and grind with coffee in hand while shaking off the cobwebs, when this gem was dropped directly in front of me:\n\nMerry May Day! April xBABIP values using Hard Hit% and Speed Score: https://t.co/dCEH9zAGF1 — Jeff Zimmerman (@jeffwzimmerman) May 1, 2014\n\nMerry May Day indeed, I clicked Jeff Zimmerman's link and found myself staring at several hundred xBABIP numbers. That was cool and all, but only being somewhat familiar with xBABIP, I decided to dig into the stat and it's principles more deeply than before. While Zimmerman didn't divulge his exact methodology, presumably because he's working with non-public data, he did confirm that he was utilizing batted ball outcomes (hard hit percentage) and batter speed (speed scores) to come to his findings.\n\nBefore we get to those findings, however, I think it's important to have a brief conversation about BABIP in general. BABIP, or batting average on balls in play, refers to the rate at which batted balls become hits (excluding home runs). Baseball Prospectus calculates this as:\n\nFor context, we've all heard that about 30% of batted balls become hits, therefore we expect to see batters with a BABIP at or around .300. When we see a player who's posting a .380 BABIP, we declare him lucky and say that regression will wreak havoc on the rest of his season. When we see a player with a .240 BABIP, we declare him unlucky and expect brighter days to be on the horizon. For a lot of us, this is the extent of our knowledge around BABIP; we use it as a barometer and adjust expectations accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps some of us have been far too literal when reading BABIP disclaimers in the past. We passively accept a .300 BABIP as the benchmark and expect results to fluctuate in accordance with the principles of regression. More importantly, the casual passerby will often treat BABIP as something a batter has little or no control over, but that's not the case. Yes, batting average on balls in play is a volatile and difficult stat to project and it doesn't stabilize for several seasons (2.5 seasons for hitters, 8 seasons for pitchers), but that doesn't mean we have to helplessly accept a .300 BABIP as the standard for all hitters. We often equate BABIP to luck, but there's a saying around sports, and life in general, that one often makes his or her own luck. BABIP falls in this category. A gross adjustment to a batter's approach (trading grounders for flies, or vice versa) or major mechanical changes (changes in stance or swing) can tweak a player's BABIP, as can the defense he's hitting into (such as the shift) and other factors. Luck is part of the equation, but it's just one part.\n\nAs we've learned, each hitter has an individual BABIP, but because these can fluctuate so wildly from season to season, it can be hard to really pin it down until we have several seasons of data to work with. Miguel Cabrera is arguably the greatest hitter in the game and has a .346 BABIP over 10 qualified seasons. We'd hardly say he's been lucky as he makes consistent hard contact. Kurt Suzuki, on the other hand, does not make a lot of hard contact and has a .269 career BABIP. If you've seen him play, it doesn't necessarily seem like he's been unlucky, he's just not very good at hitting baseballs (at least not when compared to Miguel Cabrera, which might be an unfair comparison). You get the idea, the ability of the batter, especially when it comes to making consistently hard contact, has something to do with his BABIP.\n\nEnter Billy Hamilton. If you've seen the young speedster play this season, you know he's not making a lot of hard contact. He's not the lacing lasers into the gaps for Cincinnati, but he makes up for the lack of hard contact by having the greatest foot speed in the game. His .322 BABIP over his first 40 major league games is largely a reflection of his ability to beat out infield hits. Ichiro was famous for this in Seattle as have been others over the years. We know that just as hitting the ball hard manipulates a player's BABIP, so does his speed.\n\nHere's where Zimmerman's data comes back into play. He calculated this xBABIP data by using hard hit percentages and speed scores, taking quality contact and batter speed into account to calculate what a player's BABIP should be based upon these factors. If a mad scientist created a baseball monster by blending Miguel Cabrera's bat with Billy Hamilton's speed, we could calculate what that monster's BABIP would be. We don't have to rely on hypothetical monsters, however. We have 194 qualified hitters we can look at instead. Please note, this is Zimmerman's original data that he shared. I simply filtered it for qualified hitters and added the \"Differential\" category.\n\nRather than discuss 194 qualified hitters and their current BABIP and xBABIP numbers, I'd rather focus on that last column, titled \"Differential.\" Here I simply found the difference between the players' current BABIP and calculated xBABIP (xBABIP - BABIP). Let's identify the top players who are underperforming their xBABIP at the moment based on how often they've hit the ball hard and/or how well they run. In other words, based on Zimmerman's work, these are the tough luck guys so far in 2014.\n\nBased on how often these guys have hit the ball hard and/or fast they've run, we'd fully expect to see more balls in play go for hits. Asdrubal Cabrera and Carlos Gonzalez stand out here as they've hit the ball exceedingly hard in 2014 and run well, yet both have sub-.270 BABIPs so far. If I'm trying to identify guys who are about to break out, this is somewhere to look.\n\nConversely, let's see who's overachieved so far this season based on these factors.\n\nNo surprise here, winter castaway Emilio Bonafacio leads the charge. It's not that he's been bad by any means, it's just that he hasn't been this good. Luck has aided the early season results of this list as their BABIPs aren't supported by their hard hit and/or speed rates, so we'd fully expect them to dip sharply.\n\nWhile we can see some over and underachievers on this young season, the larger takeaway is that BABIP isn't set at .300 for each individual player. There are underlying attributes that drive it accordingly, only one of which is luck. As Zimmerman has shown us, hitting the ball hard and running fast certainly helps. xBABIP aids us in adjusting the rate we should expect balls in play to become hits on a player by player basis, which is a much smarter approach than applying a basic expectation on the entire league. Hopefully this advancement will become part of the larger baseball lexicon. If it does, expect analysis to become even more refined for specific players and player types.\n\n. . .\n\nJeff Wiser is an editor and featured writer at Beyond the Box Score and co-author of Inside the 'Zona, an analytical look at the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Estonia—much like Ukraine, a country with a sizable ethnic Russian population—had an intelligence agent allegedly abducted by Russia, raising fears of a potential invasion.\n\nCanadian military ships.

Kenney's claims were eventually debunked as hyperbole by NATO itself.\n\nAt the same time as a sudden Arctic military deployment for the Russian military, CAF soldiers are in the High Arctic for operation Norex and Nunalivut using \"live-fire exercises and patrols in isolated areas\" to \"highlight the Canadian Army's ability to assert Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic,\" according to a DND statement.\n\nProtecting our \"sovereignty\" in the Far North is a direct nod to Russia, given Canada's own battle for its Arctic borders with the former world superpower—a serious development amid actual fears about what Russia will do next.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenney's bold words, largely imitating the stance his boss took a year earlier, might have more to do with voters than geopolitical gamesmanship.

  "latent_17848": "Physicists at UC Santa Barbara have taken an important step to the ultimate construction of a quantum computer -- the entanglement of three qubits. The discovery is published in the current issue of the journal Nature.\n\nThe research involves the entanglement of three quantum bits of information, or qubits. Before now, entanglement research in the solid state has only been developed with two qubits. The UCSB finding comes from a collaboration of the research groups of physicists Andrew Cleland and John Martinis. Graduate student Matthew Neeley is the first author on the Nature paper. Meanwhile, a research group at Yale reported the same result.\n\n\"These entangled states are interesting in their own right, but they are also very important from the perspective of the larger, long-term goal of creating a quantum computer with many qubits,\" said Neeley.\n\nThe Cleland-Martinis group is studying superconducting quantum circuits and their potential uses in quantum computing. Quantum circuits are fabricated on microchips using techniques similar to those used in making conventional computers. When cooled to very low temperatures -- just a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero -- they become superconducting and exhibit quantum effects. Essentially behaving like artificial atoms, they can be manipulated and measured using electrical signals. Unlike atoms, however, these circuits can be designed to have only the properties that the scientists desire for various experiments -- providing a tool for exploring many of the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe simplest type of quantum system is one with just two possible states, known as a quantum bits by analogy with the classical bits that are the fundamental elements of conventional computers. UCSB's team uses quantum circuits of a type known as phase qubits, designed to behave as two-levels quantum systems. In this most recent work, the team fabricated and operated a device with three coupled phase qubits, using them to produce entangled quantum states.\n\n\"Entanglement is one of the strangest and most counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics,\" said Neeley. \"It is a property of certain kinds of quantum states in which different parts of the system are strongly correlated with each other. This is often discussed in the context of bipartite systems with just two components. However, when one considers tripartite or larger quantum systems, the physics of entanglement becomes even richer and more interesting.\"\n\nIn this work, the team produced entangled states of three qubits. Neeley explained that unlike the two-qubit case, three qubits can be entangled in two fundamentally different ways, exemplified by a state known as GHZ, and another state known as W. The GHZ state is highly entangled but fragile, and measuring just one of the qubits collapses the other two into an unentangled state.\n\n\"The W state is in a certain sense less entangled, but nevertheless more robustly so -- two thirds of the time, measuring one qubit will still leave the other two in an entangled state,\" Neeley said. \"We produced both of these states with our phase qubits, and measured their fidelity compared to the theoretical ideal states. Experimentally, the fidelity is never perfect, but we showed that it is high enough to prove that the three qubits are entangled.\"\n\n\"Entanglement is a resource that gives quantum computers an advantage over classical computers, and so producing multipartite entanglement is an important step for any system with which we might hope to construct a quantum computer,\" said Neeley.\n\nThe same result was published simultaneously, based on similar research from the group of Rob Schoelkopf, a physics professor at Yale. Both results are the first work showing three coupled superconducting qubits. This is a significant step toward scaling to increasingly larger numbers of qubits.",

  "latent_18132": "Secrets of the Parthenon\n\nPBS Airdate: January 29, 2008\n\nNARRATOR: It is the Golden Age of Greece, a unique window of time that gives birth to Western ideals of beauty, science, art and a radical new form of government: democracy.\n\nTo immortalize those ideals, the Greeks build what will become the very symbol of Western Civilization, the Parthenon.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT (University of Oregon) : It was the physical embodiment of their values, their beliefs, of their ideology. It remains for us a powerful statement of what human beings are capable of.\n\nNARRATOR: But today, solving the secrets of how the ancients designed and engineered the Parthenon has taken on a new urgency. For, after 2,500 years of being ravaged by man and nature, the building is in danger of collapse.\n\nHidden behind its columns, a rescue mission is under way. The team must take apart, repair and reassemble tens of thousands of its pieces. And although the Parthenon appears to be geometrically straight and made from interchangeable parts, subtle curves make each piece unique, varying by fractions of a millimeter.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI (Acropolis Restoration Project) : The quality of the engineering work and the precision is unmatched, even from us today.\n\nNARRATOR: The restoration team has taken over 30 years and spent well over $100 million restoring what the ancient Athenians built in just eight or nine years.\n\nIt is clear today's technology can only take the team so far. To rescue the Parthenon, these modern architects, stonemasons and archaeologists must unlock the engineering secrets of the ancient Greeks.\n\nEven in its present form, a stark marble ruin, the Parthenon is revered as an icon of Western civilization. Its shapely muscular columns, crowned with majestic capitals, are the very symbol of the classical world. Its height and width define perfect proportions. Its original sculptures have been looted and lusted after for their beauty.\n\nAnd if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Parthenon reigns as the most copied building in the world, from the French Parliament, to the U.S. Supreme Court, to banks, museums and countless buildings that aspire to convey wealth, culture and power.\n\nBARBARA BARLETTA (University of Florida) : The Parthenon remains an enduring symbol. It was built to glorify Athens, but it's taken on a much greater meaning. Despite the destructions of time and man, it still represents the highest level of human creativity.\n\nNARRATOR: But as magnificent as the Parthenon is today, it is a shadow of its former self. Twenty-five-hundred years ago, the Parthenon was built as the crowning achievement of classical Greece. It towered on the Acropolis, at the center of a complex of temples and altars, vividly painted and adorned with statues of mortal and immortal greats.\n\nThe most prominent sculpture stood inside, a 40-foot-high gold and ivory statue of Athena Parthenos, the patron goddess of Athens.\n\nBut that was then. Where Athena once stood, today stands a crane. Not a trace of her statue remains. Now her holy precinct is a construction site, for much of her temple lies in tens of thousands of pieces, some scattered around the Acropolis, some around the world and some lost forever.\n\nWhat does remain standing is in danger of collapse. Now, a rescue mission, the Acropolis Restoration Project, is trying to save it. The team, guided by the meticulous investigations of Manolis Korres, has set the bar high, salvaging whatever ancient marble blocks remain, in order to create the most faithful restoration. The cost to date is easily over $100 million.\n\nCHARALAMBOS BOURAS (President, Acropolis Restoration Project) : We keep as much as possible of the original material, and we do not damage the ancient material. The theory is that we preserve all the original pieces and we add only a few marble in order to fit them to the general construction.\n\nNARRATOR: This capital, once atop a column, typifies the struggle they face. It is in six pieces, with many fragments still missing.\n\nFirst, master marble masons need to puzzle together what pieces they can find, then meticulously recreate what is missing. The block itself weighs 10 tons. It will need to be hoisted to the top of a column consisting of 11 drums, of which many are also fragmented. Together, the drums and capital may have to support up to 100 tons of surviving marble beams and sculpture.\n\nBut before they can hoist the capital into place, the team must solve a more perplexing problem. On which of the Parthenon's 46 columns does the capital belong? For, although the Parthenon may appear to be one giant building kit with interchangeable parts, it's not. The building celebrated as a symbol of beauty and perfect proportions hides an ancient secret.\n\nCathy Paraschi and Lena Lambrinou, architects on the restoration team, investigate.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU (Acropolis Restoration Project) : You think that all the blocks are square in this building, but in fact, if you check it with a set square, you can see that we don't have a right angle here.\n\nNARRATOR: And when Paraschi places her book on one end of the stylobate, the Parthenon's foundation, it can't be seen from the other end.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: This is because there is a curve in the middle of the lines of the stylobate, about six and three-fourths centimeters high.\n\nNARRATOR: Korres and his team have investigated every angle on the Parthenon. And although the building looks straight, they've discovered there's barely a straight line on it.\n\nThese curves are no accident. They start with the foundation, or stylobate. Each of the 46 columns has a gently curving profile and leans inward. Even the architraves, marble beams that span the columns, as well as the architectural elements above them, are curved.\n\nThis means that each of the over 70,000 pieces of the Parthenon is unique and fits in only one place. And the difficulty of fitting the pieces back together is compounded by the Parthenon's history.\n\nSince it was built, in the fifth century B.C.E., it has been shot at, exploded, set on fire, rocked by earthquakes, converted to a church then a mosque, and in the 19th century, looted for its magnificent sculptures.\n\nTo make matters worse, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Parthenon was subjected to catastrophic restorations.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: More recent damage was done in the 1900s by the restoration team putting in these iron clamps. They rusted and expanded, cracking and destroying the marble.\n\nNARRATOR: In addition, the early restorers put column drums and whole blocks back in the wrong place. Before the restoration team could even start, they had to correct these mistakes by taking apart, block by block, much of the Parthenon.\n\nParaschi took on the Herculean task of working out the original positions of 700 scattered blocks from the long inner walls of the temple.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: Although the blocks seem to be the same, each block is different. Each one has individual and perceivable information, the cuttings, the height. We're talking about differences of a tenth of a millimeter here.\n\nNARRATOR: That's about the thickness of a hair.\n\nThe team turned to modern technology to assist them. Each stone, like everywhere on the Acropolis, was I.D.'d and entered into the computer system.\n\nEVI PETROPOULOU (Acropolis Restoration Project) : As soon as a fragment of marble is found, it takes a number and it is entered in the database. So far we have 5,500 architectural members of the Parthenon.\n\nNARRATOR: All with detailed descriptions of height, width, slope, corrosion, cracking, stain marks, even graffiti. By mapping these variables, Paraschi and the team hoped to reconstruct the two inner walls.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS (Acropolis Restoration Project) : We found about 52 criteria we could give, maximum, to one block of the wall. If you measure all the constructive elements, you have about 52 criteria. So we thought, let's try to put it on a computer program, to press the button, to see if we have a result.\n\nNARRATOR: But the puzzle proved too complex.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS: Mathematically it was working, but we didn't have any result.\n\nNARRATOR: In the end, to put her wall back together, Paraschi had to draw each stone onto a card, and with the help of detailed measurements, shuffle them around.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: So the final decision was made by eye.\n\nNARRATOR: It took five years to identify the position of around 500 of the pieces. It's been over 30 years since the restoration began.\n\nThe Parthenon is a 20,000 ton, 70,000 piece, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. And worse, it's a puzzle that doesn't include instructions. No one has found anything resembling architectural plans.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS: Where are they written, these things? Where are they writing? We have so many papers, we have computers; we have everything. How they are doing it? How they communicate and were going so quickly, in eight years? I cannot understand. I cannot imagine.\n\nNARRATOR: How did the ancient Athenians build the Parthenon with such precision in less than nine years? And why with these subtle curves and few right angles? How can the modern restorers faithfully repair and reassemble these pieces before air pollution and even earthquakes inflict further damage?\n\nTo save this masterpiece of Western civilization for the future, Korres and his team of architects, engineers and marble masons will have to unlock the secrets of the past.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: The Parthenon was the greatest monument in the greatest sanctuary in the greatest city of classical Greece. It was the central repository of the Athenians' lofty conception of themselves and the physical—marble—embodiment of their values, their beliefs, their myths, their ideologies. It was as much a temple to Athens and the Athenians as it is to their patron goddess, Athena Parthenos.\n\nNARRATOR: But just 30 years before it was built, Athens lay in ruins, a victim of Emperor Xerxes, leader of Greece's traditional enemy, Persia. The Athenians rally the rest of the Greek city-states and, with a series of heroic military victories, drive out the Persian invaders.\n\nWith the foreign threat neutralized and nearly 200 cities across the Aegean paying into a mutual defense fund, Athens grows wealthy. It's now 450 B.C.E., and a former general emerges as leader, Pericles.\n\nHe spearheads an ambitious campaign to rebuild Athens and ushers in the Golden Age of Greece, a unique window of time that establishes Western ideals of beauty, science, art and a radical new form of government: \"demos\" meaning \"people,\" and \"cratos,\" \"power\"— people power, or democracy.\n\nBARBARA BARLETTA: This is the area of Athens, just beyond the Acropolis, where male citizens came to vote. We think that during the fifth century, the assembly would have comprised about 30,000, perhaps up to 40,000 male citizens.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: Mid-fifth-century Athens was a golden age because of the constellation of powerful intellects who gathered there.\n\nNARRATOR: Socrates studies philosophy here. Hippocrates, considered the founder of modern medicine according to later traditions, visited Athens. Herodotus, father of history, and Thucydides write detailed accounts of this time.\n\nBARBARA BARLETTA: Theater, especially, flourished. This is the time of Sophocles and Euripides performing their wonderful plays to the public in these theaters, including this particular one, the theater of Dionysus, on the south slope of the Acropolis.\n\nNARRATOR: But while all of Athens flourishes, the Acropolis still lay in ruins from the Persian invasion. Then, in 449 B.C.E., Pericles proposes to rebuild the temples destroyed by the Persians. He opens the question to debate.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: Every monument, every element of the Periclean building program had to be voted upon so that these monuments would, in fact, be monuments of the democracy and not of one man, such as Pericles himself.\n\nNARRATOR: In a powerful statement of their self-confidence, the people of Athens vote to rebuild the Acropolis, and at its center, a building to embody their ideals, the Parthenon. The Parthenon would be the largest building in the world constructed entirely of marble; and in tracing the path of that marble, lies the first clue as to how it was built.\n\nBefore the Parthenon, marble had been imported from quarries on islands in the Aegean Sea. On one of those islands, Naxos, archaeologists discover a small temple.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: On the beautiful island of Naxos, we see this temple which is one of the early archaic Greek temples, made of stone.\n\nNARRATOR: The temple of Demeter was constructed about 100 years before the Parthenon. It, too, was built with few right angles or straight lines.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: We can indicate already the curvature of the base of the temple, also the widening of the lower part of the columns.\n\nNARRATOR: Why are these builders deliberately constructing their temples with curves and few right angles? Professor Margaret Livingstone, a Harvard neurobiologist, believes the ancient Greeks might have been aware of optical illusions.\n\nMARGARET LIVINGSTONE (Harvard Medical School) : The function of the visual system is not to transmit an image to the brain; there's nobody up there to look at an image. It's to transmit information about the world up to the brain.\n\nNARRATOR: Our brain translates visual information, like converging lines to help us assess distance and relative size. But sometimes, something's lost in translation. Here the converging lines are telling us that the line on the right is taller than the line on the left. The result? An optical illusion.\n\nMARGARET LIVINGSTONE: This is another classical illusion. If you have two straight lines, if you add converging lines, these two lines seem to bow in the middle. So if the floor of the Parthenon has converging cues as to depth and perspective, you could have an illusory sag in the floor of the Parthenon.\n\nNARRATOR: Perhaps to compensate for the illusory sag, the builders left extra marble in the middle. The ancient Greeks realized that to construct a building that appears perfect, they would have to come up with a design that tricks the eye. What they invent is a system of optical refinements.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: Their concern was the visual perfection of the building.\n\nNARRATOR: This small stone temple, on Naxos, provides evidence of the Greeks' keen observation over hundreds of years.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: Here we can see the first optical refinements already experimented by the people building the temple. Here lies, literally, the D.N.A. of the Parthenon.\n\nNARRATOR: But even with the wealth of Periclean Athens, it was too expensive to bring so much marble from the islands to the mainland. Fortunately, the Athenians discover a rich source of marble, 11 miles from the Acropolis.\n\nThe Pentelicon quarry became one of the largest and deepest marble quarries in the world and is the source for the restoration today. In minutes, diamond-tipped saws cut through the same stone used by the ancients.\n\nNikos Toganidis, the architect in charge of day-to-day operations on the Parthenon restoration, is searching for a flawless 12-ton block.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS: Today we are going to check a marble that George found here in the quarry. It's going to be an architrave. It's the last large marble that we need for the restoration of the north side.\n\nNARRATOR: The restoration team has waited months for just the right block to make the new architrave, the marble support beam above the columns. It costs over a million dollars and will have to support up to 20 tons.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS: Let's measure it. Let's see if we have the length of the marble that we need.\n\nNARRATOR: It seems perfect except for a hidden vein, which could compromise its structural integrity.\n\nNIKOS TOGANIDIS: If there is the problem, then the sound is quite different. It sounds as a bell. So we are going to buy.\n\nJurgo, bravo.\n\nNARRATOR: At the time of Pericles, teams of quarrymen extracted an estimated 100,000 tons of marble from Pentelicon. The cost of extracting and transporting it, inscribed in part on this stone placard from 434 B.C.E., was over 400 silver talents, the equivalent of more than 400 of their fully-equipped warships.\n\nBARBARA BARLETTA: Expenses for the construction of the Parthenon were recorded on stone annually. The stone was actually set up on the Acropolis. This is because Athens had a democratic system of government so that they required that the expenditure of public monies be made public.\n\nNARRATOR: The rest of the construction budget was spent on carving that marble. In that sense, the workplace today, as in ancient times, is less a construction site and more a sculptor's studio.\n\nMARIA IOANNIDOU (Acropolis Restoration Project) : We have, in some cases, to form a new drum from one hundred different pieces. That is a very, very difficult work.\n\nNARRATOR: Here the restorers recovered a part of an original capital, but were missing the pieces to fit around it. They had to carve them by hand from the newly quarried Pentelic marble.\n\nThey start by making a plaster cast of a missing piece. Then they use this ancient mason's device, called a pantograph, to record the three-dimensional shape of the cast, and transfer it, point by point, to the new marble.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: It's a very traditional technique. Even the Romans were using the same device to copy their sculptures in antiquity.\n\nNARRATOR: Once a new piece is completed, they can join it with an old. But will their new piece fit?\n\nIt doesn't. It's just millimeters off.\n\nThe moderns will borrow a technique used by the ancients for fitting together two new blocks. They coat the inside surface with red clay.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: In the points that it doesn't fit, it leaves white marks where the clay goes to white. They have to carve it a little bit more and test it again until they have no new marks when they are closing the two pieces.\n\nNARRATOR: The operation is repeated dozens of times until the new marble exactly matches the ancient broken surface. But even when they succeed, there's still the challenge of fitting the restored pieces precisely back into place. After months of painstaking work, drum number 14192 doesn't quite make it.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: As you see here, we have a small ancient fragment. We built around it with the new addition. Now we're going to move it and take it down to the workshop.\n\nNARRATOR: Just a few millimeters of excess new white marble has to be cut from the base, at ever so slight an angle, to match the precision of the original blocks.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: These differences of one or two millimeters is just a miracle. You can't believe that you have so small differences.\n\nNARRATOR: And here lies the Parthenon's central mystery: how did the ancients sculpt it with such precision and speed?\n\nMANOLIS KORRES (Acropolis Restoration Project) : We were examining a drum over there on which there were some lines.\n\nNARRATOR: Etched into the marble itself, Manolis Korres finds a clue.\n\nMANOLIS KORRES: Have you ever seen this?\n\nWORKER: No. This is the first time.\n\nNARRATOR: Korres made an extensive study of the relationship between toolmarks and the kind of tool and force necessary to produce them. From these marks, he reconstructed a type of chisel lost since antiquity.\n\nMANOLIS KORRES: You see how it goes?\n\nNARRATOR: The marks led Korres to identify a range of tools that reflect centuries of expertise in metallurgy, enabling the Greeks to produce sharper and more durable tools than we have today.\n\nMANOLIS KORRES: The different artisans is obvious.\n\nNARRATOR: And from minute differences in the chisel marks, Korres can even identify the distinctive workmanship of about 200 different stonemasons.\n\nThey were recruited from throughout the Greek islands and would have had many different systems of measurement. Without a common standard, coordinating this workforce would have been a logistical nightmare.\n\nHow did they do it? One answer lies on the island of Salamis, not far from Athens. Here, discovered on a church wall, was a stone carving. Today, it is in the Piraeus Museum.\n\nArchitect Mark Wilson Jones believes the enigmatic Salamis Stone, depicting an arm, hands and feet, may be a conversion table for the different measuring systems, Doric, Ionic and Common.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES (University of Bath) : This is a tracing I've done that shows the stone, and you can immediately see how the main measures work. We have this foot rule here. That's 327 millimeters, more or less, the Doric foot. And here you have a foot imprint that's roughly a 307-millimeter-long foot, which we tend to call the Common foot. And there are, in fact other feet. For example, this dimension here is one Ionic foot. So there is a, kind of, whole network of different interrelated measurements here.\n\nNARRATOR: The Salamis Stone represents all the competing ancient Greek measurements: the Doric foot, the Ionic foot, and, for the first time, the Common foot—virtually the same measurement we use today.\n\nWilson Jones finds evidence of all three measuring systems in the height of the Parthenon.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: That distance is, at one and the same time, 45 Doric feet, that's the ruler on the relief; it's also 48 Common feet, which is the foot imprint; and it's 50 Ionic feet, all at the same time. And these are quite exact correspondences.\n\nNARRATOR: So the Salamis Stone may have provided a simple way for ancient workers from different places to calibrate their rulers and cross-reference different units of measurement.\n\nBut the Salamis Stone may also be a clue to how the ancient Greeks were using the human body to create what we now regard as ideal proportions.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: What's extraordinary about this, is that at the same time as being a practical device, it's also a kind of model of theory, architectural theory, that a perfect, ideal human body, designed by nature, is a kind of paradigm for how architects should design temples.\n\nNARRATOR: Among the first to record that Greek temples were based on the ideal human body was the Roman architect, Marcus Vitruvius. He studied the proportions of temples like the Parthenon, in the first century B.C.E., 400 years after it was built.\n\nMANOLIS KORRES: Vitruvius's work gives us the overall frame which is necessary to understand the system of proportions of the Parthenon.\n\nNARRATOR: According to Vitruvius, Greek architects believed in an objective basis of beauty that mirrors the proportions of an ideal human body. They observed, among many examples, that the span from finger tip to finger tip is a fixed ratio to total height, and height is a fixed ratio to the distance between the navel and the foot.\n\nTwo thousand years after the Parthenon, another artist was also searching for an objective basis of beauty.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: This is a very famous image. It's drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, in the Renaissance, and it's based on Vitruvius's description of the ideal the human body. And he encapsulates this idea of its theoretical importance. And what's really interesting for us is that when we superimpose the Salamis relief on this drawing, we see that there's a remarkable correspondence. There are differences, but it's the same principle. You have the same interest in the anthropomorphic principle of getting a kind of sacred fundamental justification for these measures.\n\nNARRATOR: Da Vinci's ideal Renaissance man famously stands in a circle surrounded by a square. Da Vinci named this image \"Vitruvian Man\" after the Roman architect.\n\nThe ratio of the radius of the circle to a side of the square is 1 to 1.6. That ratio is sometimes attributed to the Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, who lived 100 years before the building of the Parthenon. In the Victorian age, it became known as the \"golden ratio.\" It was a mathematical formula for beauty. For centuries many scholars believed the golden ratio gave the Parthenon its tremendous power and perfect proportions. Most notably, the ratio of height to width on its facades is a golden ratio.\n\nToday the golden ratio's use in the Parthenon has been largely discredited, but Manolis Korres and most scholars believe another ratio does in fact appear in much of the building.\n\nMANOLIS KORRES: The width, for instance is 30 meters and 80 centimeters; the length is 69 meters and 51 centimeters, the ratio being 4:9.\n\nNARRATOR: The 4:9 ratio is also found between the width of the columns and the distance between their centers, and the height of the facade to its width.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: The Parthenon, like a statue, exemplifies a certain symmetria , a certain harmony of part to part and of part to the whole. There's no question that the harmony of the building, which is clearly one of its most visible characteristics is dependent upon a certain mathematical system of proportions.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: For the Greeks, there was nothing better than a design based on the coming together of measures, of proportions and harmonies and shapes. It's rather like an orchestrated piece of music in which the harmonies of the various instruments are, sort of, fused together in a wonderful, glorious, orchestrated symphony.\n\nNARRATOR: With something like the Salamis Stone's use of the human body as units of measure, and the idealized human form to define perfect proportions, the Parthenon literally embodies the words of the Greek philosopher Protagoras, who lived in Athens during the construction of the Parthenon, \"Man is the measure of all things.\"\n\nBut proportions and principles do not a perfect Parthenon make. Cathy Paraschi has been commuting to work on the Acropolis for 10 years. In all her time on the Parthenon restoration team, she's still amazed at one particular achievement of the ancients, their precision.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: We have a joint on the step of the Parthenon which has been so thin, it's, like, 1/20th of a millimeter, thinner than a hair. Further up, you cannot detect the joint at all. And finally, probably due to an earthquake, a crack starts from one block and continues to the other. And the two behave as one.\n\nNARRATOR: This is the level of precision that the restorers need to match today.\n\nTheir reconstructed column drum, number 14192, was taken down because its base didn't fit. To achieve the required precision, they use metal smoothing plates, a technique based on ancient stone plates found on the Acropolis.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: It's a very traditional way to level a marble surface. We are putting sand in these holes, and they just move it on the top of the stone. They can make very small differences between the surfaces.\n\nNARRATOR: Manolis Korres believes the ancient stone sanding plates could grind to 1/20th of a millimeter. But to stack and precisely align the drums presents an additional challenge.\n\nAgain, the modern restorers uncover an ancient technique, when they separate these two column drums for the first time in 2,500 years.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: The ancients aligned the drums very simply but again ingeniously. They had this block of wood that they cut in half. The lower part was inserted at the center of the lower drum, flush and perfectly fitted. And the upper part is centered in the upper drum coming down. So when the upper drum is placed, it centers onto this pin. The surface was perfectly connected, and it was so airtight that when we opened the drum we found this—and it's 2,500 years old—intact.\n\nNARRATOR: The cedar is so well preserved that restorers could still smell the wood put there by Pericles' stonemasons. Today, the modern restorers use the same method but with titanium.\n\nBut even though the restoration team has solved many details of the ancients' engineering secrets, they are still at a loss to answer the larger question. How did the Athenians build the Parthenon, with all its subtle curves, without an architectural plan?\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: There's a simple problem. To get a plan of this size on a reasonably small dimension that you can grapple with—something like this, which would be around 1 to 50 or so—that would be nowhere near precise enough to deal with all the subtle curvature and the minute adjustments that are also essential for this kind of project.\n\nNARRATOR: One of the subtlest of these curves can be found on the Parthenon's columns.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: If we pull a string, we can see that from the middle of the column and up, we can see a curve, a very slight curve.\n\nNARRATOR: The curve is gentle, starting a little less than halfway up and tapering again near the top. It's an optical refinement called \"entasis.\"\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: Entasis means tension. It gives life to the column visually. It resembles an athlete trying to lift the weight, even the deep breadth of the swelling of its chest. It is no longer dead stone. It has life in it. It has pulse.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: These deviations from the straight, from the perfectly vertical, from the perfectly horizontal are analogous to the curvatures and the swellings and the irregularities of the human body. And in that sense the Parthenon strikes me as being a sculptural as well as an architectural achievement.\n\nNARRATOR: The entasis curve on the side of the column is so subtle and so slight, restorers can only draw it by computer. For the ancients to have drawn it at full scale, they would have had to set their compass at an impossible radius of nearly a mile. How they constructed the curved columns was one of the last great riddles left by the ancient Greek temple builders.\n\nThe answer literally \"came to light\" at Didyma, 200 miles from Athens, in what is, today, Turkey. Here, a team of German archaeologists was exploring the ruin of the Temple of Apollo.\n\nBuilt at the time of Alexander the Great, 150 years after the Parthenon, it was the biggest Greek temple ever conceived: 120 columns, each one more than twice the height of the Parthenon's.\n\nThe German team noted an optical refinement, a curvature, on the base of the temple, similar to that of the Parthenon. They suspected there might be more.\n\nTraversing the tunnel to the temple's sacred inner sanctum, open to the air, Lothar Haselberger waited for his eyes to adjust.\n\nLOTHAR HASELBERGER (University of Pennsylvania) : Coming out of the darkness of the tunnel, into that white marble hall, is a blinding experience. What then, to my surprise, came up, were regularly incised horizontal lines. And I found them interesting enough to at least keep them in mind in order to return at a time when everything was under better light conditions. So I was left wondering.\n\nNARRATOR: At the mercy of the sun, Haselberger would have to wait for just the right time of day for the light to reveal more of the mysterious lines.\n\nLOTHAR HASELBERGER: There's a golden time each day when the sunlight comes just about parallel to the surface.\n\nNARRATOR: It was worth the wait.\n\nLOTHAR HASELBERGER: Coming back again, under better light conditions, it was a kind of revelation, because I realized this is a full-sized vertical section of a column, the very one at the front of the temple.\n\nNARRATOR: At just the right place in the temple of the sun god Apollo, at just the right time of day, he discovered what might be the answer to the riddle: an almost invisible, scaled-down version of the subtle entasis curve of the columns.\n\nThis template represents a squashed column. Because it is impossible to draw the curve of the column in full size, the Greeks scaled down the height of the column by a factor of 16.\n\nNow they had a curve that could be drawn with a large compass-like instrument. But the genius behind the template is that the width was not scaled down, so each horizontal line is still the radius of a full-scale column. Now all a stonemason need do, is set his compass to any line of the template to get the diameter of any corresponding point on the column.\n\nThis simple scale drawing was a key reference for the stonemasons at Didyma, as they carved one column drum after another.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: Greek stonemasons were so experienced in creating optical refinements like entasis, that they may have been given relatively little guidance.\n\nNARRATOR: The inscribed template survived at Didyma because the temple was destroyed by an earthquake and remained unfinished. But at the Parthenon, such lines probably disappeared when the walls were polished at the time of completion.\n\nLOTHAR HASELBERGER: The Parthenon was finished, the marble surfaces smoothed and polished, and with it went what we assumed were the construction lines of the temple.\n\nNARRATOR: The modern restorers believe the ancient builders must have had similar kind of template to produce the subtle curvature on, not only the columns, but most of the Parthenon's marble blocks.\n\nMARK WILSON JONES: The key problems are these amazing refinements, the curvatures, the inclination and so on. But once you've got them established, once you know, with these blueprints, exactly where you're going, then you proceed down the length of the building and across the front by repetition. So once they get going, they can get going at considerable speed.\n\nNARRATOR: With the discovery of the Didyma plans, the restorers have new insight into the last great secret of how the ancients built the Parthenon.\n\nBut now they face the ultimate test, as they place the drum they've so painstakingly reconstructed back on its column. With all its curves and angles, will this new column drum fit?\n\nIt does.\n\nLENA LAMBRINOU: We're very happy.\n\nNARRATOR: The restorers now need only apply a finish sanding to the most distinctive feature of the columns, the fluting. The crowning achievement will come with the placement of this 12-ton capital on top of the column shaft.\n\nFor Korres and the modern restorers, this finished marble is more than just another piece of the jigsaw puzzle. They feel they have successfully entered the minds of the ancient builders and discovered how Pericles and his architects were able to design and engineer the ideals of beauty and perfection into this monumental building.\n\nUsing the same marble and similar techniques and tools, the Acropolis Restoration team has reconstructed a part of the Parthenon, perhaps as perfectly as the original builders.\n\nCATHY PARASCHI: In the next 10 years, the worksite will be empty and we will be able to admire the perfect proportions of the Parthenon again.\n\nNARRATOR: The Parthenon was completed in 432 B.C.E. As the ultimate expression of Athenian ideals, the temple is adorned with mythological battles of victory: justice over injustice, civilization defeating barbarity, order prevailing over chaos. And, perhaps for the first time on a Greek temple, the Athenians, mere mortals, depict themselves alongside the gods.\n\nJEFFREY M. HURWIT: And so, if the human beings, the Athenians on the Parthenon frieze, are elevated near the rank of gods, the gods are represented in a way that makes them human. And the difference between gods and mortals, between Athenians and the Olympians is not one so much of kind, as of degree. This is an extremely humanistic way of representing themselves.\n\nNARRATOR: But the temple and society that built it would not last. Just one year later, Pericles goes to the citizens of Athens for funds to equip an army against the threat of Sparta. To pay for it, he suggests they could, if necessary, strip the gold from the great statue of Athena. Soon after, Pericles and a third of the city die from the plague. Athens is crushed by the Spartans, who turn the Parthenon into an army barracks.\n\nFor the next two millennia, the Parthenon would be abused by Romans, Barbarians, Christians, Muslims, Turks, with the final insult coming in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Europeans rediscover Classical Greece, and, out of reverence, plunder much of its remaining sculptures, the most famous of which, the Elgin Marbles, are in the British Museum to this day.\n\nWhen the Acropolis Restoration Project began, over 30 years ago, Manolis Korres and his colleagues could have chosen to restore the Parthenon to its original state, adorned with sculpture and friezes painted in vivid colors. Instead, they chose to preserve what has survived these 2,500 years, a majestic ruin, a witness to what we needlessly destroyed and the beauty and perfection that we can create.\n\nOn NOVA's Secrets of the Parthenon Web site, see how the temple was used over time, and examine the question of whether an ancient ruin should be restored at all.

  "latent_18217": "Today in Tedium: Computers often seem like they’re above the supply chain. Putting aside hot devices like the latest iPhone and the different variants of the Microsoft Surface, it’s generally easy to get a computer of some kind that will allow you to do all sorts of interesting things. They’re mostly built for the long haul, too—designed to last for a few years and ultimately responsible for nearly infinite amounts of production when it comes to digital content, code, and imagery. We don’t think about the ways in which resourcing impacts the way these machines are sold, how much they cost, and how it impacts production. But they are very much affected by these factors—and in at least one case, the shortage was the digital equivalent of long lines at gas stations. Today, we talk about RAM chip droughts throughout history, the causes, and their impacts over the years. — Ernie @ Tedium\n\nThe course correction that made RAM really expensive in the summer of 1988 The Chicago Tribune compared “The Great DRAM Shortage of 1988” to the oil shortages of the 1970s. And honestly, the comparison was pretty close to the mark. It was a story filled with trade conflicts and manufacturing challenges, but was ultimately defined by a complete misunderstanding of the computer market by chip producers, which ended up underestimating the demand for certain kinds of RAM. The issue was basically this: After the computer industry slumped in 1985, prices for RAM chips fell to extreme lows. According to an analysis by retired computer science professor John C. McCallum, a 256-kilobit DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip being sold in BYTE magazine could be had for just $2.95 in September of 1985—a sharp decline from the $8.95 the same-capacity chip sold for in January of that year. Higher-capacity chips remained expensive: A two-megabit chip, for example, was $599 in September 1985, making the cost-per-megabyte for larger-capacity RAM $300, per McCallum’s analysis. But even at the high end, the prices kept dropping: The cost-per-megabyte fell to as low as $133 in October of 1987. What drove the severe drop in price? To put it simply, an industry slowdown, mixed with extreme overproduction, caught the industry off-guard. “About 1985, the personal computer market was tremendously overextended,” Texas Instruments spokesman Stan Victor told the Tribune. “There were a lot of manufacturers, all fighting for the same 10-percent share of the market. Then, demand for computers started slowing, and the computer manufacturers found themselves with a tremendous inventory. So they stopped buying chips. For about six months there was no demand. People started selling chips for whatever price they could get.” To offer a comparison to the modern day, you know how gas has been really cheap for the last year or so? Well, that cost decrease has been pretty rough for the oil industry, leading to massive bankruptcies and job decreases. The steep drop in chip prices, to a commodity level, had a similar effect in the U.S., with numerous RAM manufacturers closing their doors in response to the downturn. Manufacturers were looking for a target of their scorn. That target, as it turned out, was Japan. In June of 1985, the Semiconductor Industry Association filed for regulatory relief with the U.S. Trade Representative, arguing that Japan was unfairly penalizing the U.S. chip industry by favoring local computer chips over American ones. The plea had its intended effect. In 1986, the U.S. Commerce Department accused the Japanese chip industry of flooding the American market with RAM chips at a level below market rates, with the goal of pushing American companies out of the market. Not long after, the Reagan Administration put economic sanctions on the country, effectively doubling the price of electronic products manufactured in Japan and sold in the U.S. It was the first time the U.S. had retaliated against Japan on trade issues since World War II, according to the New York Times. By late 1987, the sanctions ended after the administration decided that the market was no longer being flooded with costly chips. It was a huge win for the U.S. semiconductor industry, and one that the Harvard Business Review highlighted as a successful example of how an industry can swiftly and successfully influence the U.S. government. “This series of measures is unprecedented for its swiftness, severity, and agreement with industry recommendations,” David B. Yoffie wrote in May of 1988. The impact of the flood of RAM in the U.S. computer industry—which cost chip makers as much as $5 billion, according to the Tribune—is that it made chip manufacturers very timid about making too much RAM. Manufacturers shifted away from making 256-kilobit DRAM chips, converting their factories to 1-megabit chips. It turned out to be a huge miscalculation, and fixing that error was not going to be easy.\n\n“I think when the year ends, supply will be 10 percent to 15 percent less than what real market demand is.” — Peter T. Main, the marketing vice president of Nintendo, discussing with the Los Angeles Times how chip shortages were negatively affecting the video game market in 1988. The market was negatively affected not only by a sharp decrease in DRAM—which was affecting the industry as a whole at the time—but by a decline in SRAM (static random access memory) chips, which Nintendo used most notably for its save-state cartridges. (Japanese memory manufacturers had moved away from producing SRAM, because DRAM was more lucrative.) The company delayed the American release of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link as a direct result of the SRAM shortage, and its competitor Sega also delayed the release of some games.\n\n(BYTE Magazine ad) Why was RAM so expensive in the late ’80s? Blame a really terrible miscalculation that was hard to fix By July of 1988, the increasing RAM prices, which had slowly crept up in the early parts of the year, surged. A megabyte of RAM, according to John C. McCallum’s price analysis, had surged in price from $199 to $505 in a single month, and the cost of a 256k DRAM chip had surged from $2.95 at the beginning of 1988 to $12.45—a price level maintained for nearly a year. Eventually, 1-megabit chips took over the market, but the price issues were causing many RAM-buyers to hold out before purchasing any more chips. The RAM prices were clearly affecting sellers—many of whom were hiding their prices in ads for the magazines of the day, such as BYTE and Computer Shopper. In a July 1988 ad, Advanced Computer Products (which hid its prices for every kind of DRAM behind a request that customers call the company) leveled with its audience. “Don’t feel like the Lone Ranger … we are also suffering from loss of memory,” the company wrote in the full-page ad, which listed prices for literally every other kind of computer part besides memory. “ACP sells more Memory Upgrade IC's than other mail order suppliers ... But! ... the present shortage is driving us up a wall! We can't get them at the right price, but we are getting them. PLEASE BEAR WITH US ... as the market price comes down our price will come down.” Why did it take so long to fix this problem? To put it simply, correcting course from a miscalculation in the amount of RAM needed is a tough problem to get past. The production process for one-megabit chips, notes the Chicago Tribune, was much more difficult than that for the 256-kilobit chips. Chip-fabrication took four months, start to finish. And complicating things even further, RAM manufacturers converted their 256k factories to 1-meg facilities, rather than producing the chips in two separate facilities. That meant when the finally problem showed itself, it was already too late to fix. “This cannibalism of 256k capacity would not have mattered, but then they found that, in practice, the converted capacity was largely standing idle, because the new one-megabit chips were so difficult to make,” Lamont Wood wrote at the time. It took until mid-1989 for the problem to work itself out. John C. McCallum’s month-by-month analysis showed that the $505-per-megabyte chip prices for three-megabit chips remained stagnant until June of 1989, at which point the chips fell by nearly $500 in a single month. Soon, higher-capacity chips came onto the market, and within two years, four-megabit chips could be had for less than $200—a massive decrease that came just in time for the internet revolution to take hold. With few hiccups, the cost-per-megabyte of DRAM has been falling ever since.",

While he is happy that VR and AR are whetting the public's appetite for new forms of computing, Abovitz believes Magic Leap is in another category altogether.\n\nI think what we're doing is a new class of computing; you can think of it as spatial and ambient, where it is contextually aware, you can be hands-free, you're not holding up a phone looking through a video display; it's a totally different kind of experience...We're trying to build a computer and really force that computer to act like people act, and understand your world without having to tell it all the time, so we're pushing a really different, interesting direction. — Rony Abovita, founder and CEO, Magic Leap\n\nAbovitz expects the device to appeal to creators, sharing that many of those approaching the company for early access include artists, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as companies, startups, and developers.\n\n\"I think embracing a wider creative community is really what we're all about. I think we're building a computer completely for creativity and creative expression, which is less than what you'd think about for a computer that just did spreadsheets. It's a whole different model and the idea that if you're a creator and you sink your teeth into what we're building, a lot of ideas that you have that you might, you want to express in film or music or some other medium, it seems to be a really wonderful medium for that creative of expression,\" said Abovitz.\n\nWhile Magic Leap is reported to be seeking another round of funding, Abovitz dismissed the process as no big deal.\n\n\"It's an on-going process, almost like breathing,\" said Abovitz. \"You want to constantly talk to investors to know you've got more dry powder for that expansion if things are going well.\"\n\nAbovitz shared that Magic Leap would launch in the US first, but that it does plan to expand to other countries at a measured pace.\n\n\"We're looking at our first time out as learning how to swim. You want to swim no faster than you should be,\" said Abovitz. \"We're like the kid going into the pool with the floaties, learning how to swim carefully, but as soon as we're feeling confident with developers and creators and consumers and all the engines are working well, we're just going to go faster and faster to the deep end.\"",

An estimated 2.44 million people are in need of protection and some form of humanitarian assistance. this includes internally displaced persons (IDps), the non- displaced conflict-affected population, refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants. the crisis is predominantly urban centered with most of the fighting taking place in major cities such as Benghazi, tripoli, misrata, Sirte, Sabha and Derna.\n\nHealth and protection needs of the affected population stand out in terms of scope, scale and severity. this is the result of major shortages of essential medicines and a debilitated primary healthcare system, which have led to an increase in serious illnesses and disease. the conflict has restricted access to basic services, led to forced displacement and impacted people’s safety and security.\n\nthe displaced are the most vulnerable due to limited coping capacity and loss of assets, particularly displaced women, children, the elderly and those with low economic means. refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants are also considered some of the most vulnerable, due to their exposed risk to discrimination and exploitation based on their status. the most severe needs in terms of geographic areas are those of affected people in the east and south of the country.\n\nthe Libya Humanitarian needs Overview (HnO) is based on a number of needs assessments conducted in 2015, including the un inter-agency multi-Sector needs Assessment (mSnA), sector needs and gap analysis based on information from on- going humanitarian operations in Libya and available secondary sources. In areas where conflict and insecurity impeded access to affected people, there are some significant gaps in information in terms of the scale and scope of humanitarian needs. there are also information gaps for some of the sectors, especially where national information collection and reporting systems are weak, such as for protection. Despite these challenges, the HnO broadly summarizes the priority humanitarian needs of all those affected across Libya.",
  "latent_18258": "In a move that has angered environmentalists and wildlife enthusiasts, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) proposed on March 3, 2016, to strip the iconic Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) grizzly bear of its protected status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), recommending that state-based conservation plans be used to manage the population instead.\n\nThose management plans could also open the door for grizzly hunting — a practice that’s been outlawed in the lower 48 states since 1975 when the species was first listed to the ESA — and a practice wildlife organizations say they won’t stand for.\n\nUrsus arctos horribilis, as the great bear is scientifically know, is currently listed as threatened by the USFWS, and occupies less than two percent of its historic home-range. The legendary predator had been poached to near extinction by the mid-twentieth century, and was one of the first species in America to receive protection under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. A few years later, the grizzly would also become one of the first to be listed to the ESA after it became law in 1973.\n\nNumbers had dipped as low as 136 in the Yellowstone-Teton region back in 1975. Today, that same population harbors somewhere in the neighborhood of 715 animals — an improvement USFWS is calling a “historic success” — and a point the Service is using to justify delisting the Yellowstone grizzly. But not everyone agrees with that assessment. Environmental groups point out the species occupies a dismally low portion of its once expansive range, and say the creature should remain safely protected under the ESA.\n\n“Like history repeating itself, the Service is once again attempting to evade its duty to protect imperiled wildlife on behalf of all Americans,” said Kelly Nokes, carnivore campaign lead for environmental group WildEarth Guardians. “The Service should be devoting public resources toward achieving grizzly bears’ recovery across their range, not cherry-picking one population to prematurely declare success while undermining restoration everywhere else,” Nokes continued.\n\nWildEarth Guardians also says delisting the bear before any solid state conservation plans are in place to protect it would be a knee-jerk reaction, stating in a press release, “the proposed stripping of protections [are] based on mere promises of future actions.”\n\nBut not everyone is mad about the proposed delisting. Hunters, ranchers, multi-party conservation groups and government agencies are cheering the idea, saying that ESA protections are supposed to be used only to salvage a species and help its numbers to recover, whereafter the states should take over.\n\nThe Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, a group containing the Forest Service (USFS), Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (USNPS), the state wildlife agencies of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Washington, as well as the British Columbia Wildlife Branch, the Alberta Wildlife Branch, and Parks Canada wrote this in a statement:\n\nThe Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC) is encouraged by the announcement by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service that it is beginning the final step in the process to delist the Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear population. According to IGBC Chair and Director of the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife James Unsworth, “It has only been through decades of committed scientific management by IGBC member agencies that the Yellowstone grizzly population has met and exceeded all biological goals set forth in the recovery plan. The goal of the Endangered Species Act is to bring populations back to the point that the states can resume control. In the case of the Yellowstone grizzly we have met that goal.\n\nBut environmental groups fired back, saying the bear would surely come under assault from multiple angles should current protections be removed. “It’s simply too soon to remove protections for grizzly bears,” asserted Andrea Santarsiere, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re prepared to make sure the Service follows the science and the law to ensure these wonderful animals can truly recover,” Santarsiere continued. “We’re disappointed that the Obama administration is taking such a narrow view of grizzly bear recovery.”\n\nOn the other hand, USFWS says the number of animals in the region has remained roughly the same over the past decade, indicating a “stable” population and pronouncing, “the Yellowstone ecosystem is at or near its carrying capacity for the bears.”\n\nEven if that is the case, some grizzly bear biologists also fear the Yellowstone population could run into a problem with lack of genetic diversity, and say the bear should remain protected — at least until the Yellowstone population can be adjoined to other still unconnected sub-populations. Environmental groups hold little faith in state-run conservation efforts, and say linking populations will be difficult without current ESA protections.\n\nBut USFWS Director Dan Ashe claims recovery can continue just fine with the states taking over. “Even with this proposed delisting, the service remains committed to the conservation of the Yellowstone grizzly bear, and will stay engaged to ensure that this incredible species remains recovered,” he said.\n\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service Has Tried and Failed to Delist the Grizzly Before\n\nUSFWS tried to remove protections for the grizzly a decade ago, but a federal judge shot them down following legal challenges. Now the Service is trying again, and these efforts will surely not go uncontested either.\n\nWhat’s interesting in this story though, is that USFWS is not proposing merely to maintain what it calls a “stable” population — the agency is actually suggesting to reduce the number of bears for the region to 500 — a would-be drop of over 200.\n\n“The bears will be treated as a game species after federal protections are removed, opening them up to extremely controversial sport hunting seasons in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho,” wrote WildEarth Guardians in its press release.\n\nThe possibility that conservative western states, like Idaho and Montana, would deploy hunting as part of their “conservation” strategies, must be taken very seriously. For example, Idaho’s highly controversial “wolf-killing derbies” should be examined as part of a historical track record when addressing predator conservation plans in these places. Experts tell EnviroNews Wyoming it seems likely Idaho, Montana and Wyoming could deploy similar hunts on grizzlies if the new rule takes hold.\n\nPublic Comment Period to Commence on Delisting of Yellowstone Grizzly\n\nUSFWS says it will now hold a 60-day public comment period on the draft conservation strategy, and the supplemental 1993 Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan (Yellowstone population), where it intends to review opinions from agencies, scientists, and the public at large. Nokes told EnviroNews Wyoming it is “highly likely” WildEarth Guardians and others will “seek to have the comment period extended.”\n\nUSFWS has not released the drafts on the Federal Register as of yet, but once it does, citizens and experts alike will be able to make their voices heard. Members of the public may check back at this link for the drafts: http://www.regulations.gov/\n\nA Bear of a Battle to Come\n\nWildEarth Guardians and Center for Biological Diversity, have achieved victorious rulings in court over the federal government on hundreds of imperiled wildlife species. In fact, the two organizations alone, have forced USFWS to move forward on protections for some 800 species. To say the groups strongly oppose USFWS’ March 3 announcement would be an understatement.\n\n“Though grizzlies occupy less than two-percent of their historic range in the lower-48 states, the Service decided to place political interests ahead of its duty to recover the species as a whole,” said WildEarth Guardians.\n\nCenter for Biological diversity already filed a petition with USFWS in June of 2014, requesting the Service revise and beef up its recovery plan for Ursus arctos — a request the Center says has fallen on deaf ears. The non-profit organization maintains there are still multiple areas in the bear’s historic range that are suitable for it to thrive — and it wants to see the animals reintroduced there.\n\nThe Center says the Selway-Bitterroot, Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, southern Rockies of Colorado and Grand Canyon area in Arizona are prime targets. Others say Utah’s Uintah Mountains and additional areas in both Utah and Idaho could harbor the bear as well.\n\nWildEarth Guardians indicated to EnviroNews Wyoming that multi-group legal action is highly probable should USFWS choose to move ahead with the proposed delisting. Endangered species battles of this nature have a historic track record of dragging out for years-on-end in court before settlements or final rulings are achieved.\n\nThe Mighty Grizzly, Too Much for American Society\n\nNative American cultures revered, respected and even feared the mighty grizzly bear for its obvious physical power, but also for its spiritual qualities, whereas European colonists sought to wipe the creature from the face of the earth completely. That’s not to say every person of European decent or white skin color desired genocide for the iconic predator, but the same can’t be said for American society altogether, as grizzlies were hunted to complete extinction over most of their home-range.\n\nNative Americans, as a whole, didn’t set out to obliterate the grizzly — but European pioneers did. This is not a racial point — simply a historical fact.\n\nSadly, the livestock-based existence of “civilized” society, just didn’t jive with the lumbering lifestyle of America’s most powerful predator — in a world in which it was the boss and had no human telling it where it could and couldn’t roam — in a world in which it wasn’t confined to zoos or the boundaries of parks and wildlife preserves.\n\nAmerica’s Most Powerful Predator Reduced to Rubble\n\nThere are six recognized distinct population segments of grizzly: The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), North Cascades sub-population, Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (Glacier National Park area), the Selway-Bitterroot Ecosystem of Idaho and Montana, the Cabinet-Yaak sub-population, and the Selkirk sub-population.\n\nTo be clear, USFWS’ proposed rule is only targeted at the GYE population, but environmental groups say this smells of a sneaky backdoor way to delist the entire grizzly bear species piece-by-piece — a move they say is not only shady, but also unlawful.\n\nNoteworthy on this point is the fact that in the case Humane Society of the United States v. Jewell, the D.C. District Court ruled that the Service cannot remove a distinct population segment from the ESA for the purpose of delisting a species as a whole in piecemeal fashion.\n\n“Yellowstone grizzly bears are an isolated population that is experiencing high levels of conflicts with people and is likely declining in the wake of the loss of whitebark pine, a critically important food source,” said Sylvia Fallon, a senior scientist at Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC).\n\nNo matter which way the pie is sliced, two-four percent of its historic range, doesn’t sound like much of a recovery at all to many wildlife lovers.\n\nThe Future of the Great Grizzly\n\nToday, the grizzly remains in few places, with a grand total of around 1,500 specimens in the lower 48 states — down from 50,000. All but about 100 or so of those bears exist in Montana and Wyoming with about half of those belonging to the aforementioned Yellowstone-Teton population. Around 100 bears reside between eastern and northern Idaho with another 20 bears taking refuge in Washington’s Cascade Mountains. Sightings have been reported in both Utah and Colorado, though no official confirmation has been made in any of these cases.\n\nSeveral legal attempts to reintroduce grizzlies into historic territories have been shot down in court over the years, leaving many to wonder if or when the lumbering giant will ever return to former strongholds of its once immense home.\n\nCenter for Biological Diversity, a group that boasts a 93% success rate in endangered species court battles, failed with a petition to introduce the grizzly to California recently, leaving people to wonder if a grizzly bear will ever step foot in the Golden State again.\n\nIn December of 2014, the Center also introduced a petition to reintroduce grizzlies into the Idaho-Montana adjoining Selway-Bitterroot — a proposal the organization said could have tremendous ecological benefit by connecting into the Yellowstone population. The region had been designated as a target for reintroduction by USFWS in 1993, but the idea was stifled during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nReal estate, agriculture and energy production are gobbling up the West at a baffling pace. With myriad threats facing the grizzly bear, how will the species not only survive, but thrive, in a once vast wilderness, now fast disappearing?\n\nPUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD UNDERWAY ON DELISTING OF YELLOWSTONE GRIZZLY\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: This section was amended by the EnviroNews Wyoming Editor on March 20, 2016, to reflect the opening of the public comment period.\n\nUSFWS is now holding a 60-day public comment period on the draft conservation strategy, and the supplemental 1993 Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan (Yellowstone population), where it intends to review opinions from agencies, scientists, and the public at large.

In 1933, she co-founded the Catholic Worker Movement and newspaper in New York City and began taking in the homeless and hungry. Today there are more than 208 Catholic Worker communities across the United States and more than two dozen internationally to assist those in need.\n\nDay was also an ardent pacifist and was arrested multiples times in her life at protests against war and nuclear weapons. Today, the group still protests \"injustice, war, racism, and violence of all forms,\" according to its website.\n\nLance Richey, the author of House of Hospitality, a book about Day, told The National Review earlier this year that Day's emphasis on hospitality was deeply linked to her Christianity.\n\n\"She was so concerned with hospitality because it constitutes the essence of the Christian life: direct, personal sacrifice in order to perform the corporal and spiritual works of mercy for the stranger,\" Richey said. \"It is also why she was so adamant that we cannot shift to the government these works of mercy and still call ourselves Christians who have met our obligations.\"\n\nThe church has also taken steps towards making Day, who died in 1980, a saint, and has already named her a \"servant of God.\" Day, who was staying next door to a homeless woman in one of the movement's houses when she died, reportedly said during her life that she didn't want to be \"dismissed so easily\" by being named a saint.\n\nIn considering canonizing Day, the church is also considering the fact that she had an abortion before she converted to Catholicism. But in 2012, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said that after her conversion, Day represented \"everything right about the dignity of the human person and the sanctity of human life.”\n\nBecause Day didn't want the organization to be too closely linked to the federal government, the group today still refuses to register with the IRS as a tax-exempt charity, denying itself access to government grants and other sources of funding. Instead the group depends on the selflessness of donors.",

Dependent on you specifics needs, both build tools may be interesting for you. Ant is just a framework, or a build-DSL which cannot be used out of the box. You have to create your build-script from existing Ant-tasks. The Ant tasks do not presrcibe any conventions or configuration - the definition of project layout is your responsibility. You have full control of whatever you are doing - what can become a problem in bigger projects.\n\nMaven can be understood as \"Ant With Convention Over Configuration\". In fact if you rely on conventions like the \"Standard Directory Layout\", you can start without any fraction or configuration with maven. You will only need a good internet connection for the first build :-).\n\nAs with every Convention Over Configuration framework, you will have to understand the conventions to be able to work efficiently. In case the conventions do not work in your case, you will have to overwrite them - and the complexity of this task is really hard to estimate.\n\nThe real strength of maven is the dependency management. You only have to declare the dependencies - maven will download them, setup the classpath for you, and even deploy the dependencies with your application if required. Maven manages not only the direct dependencies for you - but even the dependencies of the dependecies (transitive dependencies). This is the real strength of maven. Ant doesn't have such capabilities out-of-the-box (except ivy) and it will take a considerable amount of work to emulate Maven's dependency management with Ant.\n\nI use maven and ant in my projects, the choice is dependent on the specific needs. Maven is great if:\n\nYou are working with many \"creative\" developers. It will be hard to establish a defined project structure etc. without tool support. The developers are religious about their IDE - and are using IntelliJ, Netbeans and Eclipse at the same time.\n\nYou are building a product-like application. You will have to manage different versions and branches with their dependencies. You project consists of several teams which work on dependent modules. This modules have to be composed to the application regularly.\n\nYou plan to use checkstyle, pmd, generate a project website etc. Its easy with maven.\n\nOn the other hand I would choose ant for:\n\n\"Situational Software\" which has to be developed quickly (few weeks / months). Projects with external dependencies which are working with \"cutting edge\" libraries. There is no need for finer grained dependency management. Netbeans Project :-). They come already with ant-script which even works perfectly with hudson. Just check everything into svn, and let hudson check it out...\n\nLegacy projects which do not fit the maven conventions very well. Violating maven conventions may become a hassle.

While fishing on the reefs has also caused parrotfish to plummet.\n\nBoth of these creatures graze on reefs, and without them, algal species take over.\n\nDr Lundin said: \"We saw that reefs with no grazers ended up getting smothered by algae. And after a period of time they see a significant or even complete collapse of the reef area.\"\n\nHe said that if no action was taken, the outlook for Caribbean corals would be bleak.\n\nImage copyright Frank Baensch Image caption The report authors say that over-fishing is driving the decline of the Caribbean's reefs\n\n\"If we do nothing, I'm afraid the most likely scenario is that we will continue the slippery slope to slime,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll lose a tremendous amount of coral cover and we'll end up with algal reefs with a much lower diversity of species.\"\n\nHowever, the report concluded that there was evidence that damaged reefs could be revived if they were protected.\n\nDr Lundin said: \"We have been able to document a number of cases where we've seen recovery of degraded reefs, so that is very positive - it means we shouldn't give up hope.\"\n\nImage copyright Bouchon Image caption Warming waters are leading to coral bleaching events in some parts of the world\n\nThe Caribbean is not the only area that has seen losses to coral reefs.

  "latent_18694": "Android application developers frequently complain about the poor performance emulator that is included in the platform’s SDK. The animated transitions and other graphically-intensive characteristics of the user interface introduced in Android 3 and 4 have only exacerbated the problem.\n\nDevelopers can breathe a little easier now, because Google’s efforts to improve the emulator are finally paying off. An entry that was published today on the official Android Developer blog highlights several major changes that will make the emulator much more pleasant to use.\n\nThe new system image bundled with the emulator can use the host computer’s GPU to perform hardware-accelerated rendering. As you can see in a demo video that Google published, this will make the animations much smoother. The user experience in the emulator will now be much closer to that of running Android on actual hardware.\n\nAnother recent improvement is optional support for running x86 images that natively access the host computer’s CPU. This can help improve the performance for processor-intensive applications because it avoids the overhead of having to interpret ARM CPU instructions.\n\nUsing a virtualized x86 instance of Android for faster performance during testing is a trick that application developers have been using for a long time with third-party system builds. The availability of x86 Android in the standard emulator interface through the SDK management tool will make this capability more easily accessible to application developers.\n\nThe x86 image and support for hardware-accelerated rendering will largely address the long-standing complaints about Android emulator performance. As Google works to attract more developers to the platform, these kinds of improvements to the developer experience are going to help.",

It would also distribute Thai and local products to the domestic market and sell Malaysian products to Thailand.\n\n\"We are studying it now. I can see that these activities will turn northern Kedah into a fast-paced growth area in sectors that are different from those in southern Kedah,'' Mr Mahathir said.

Which club academies have produced the most World Cup winners, though?\n\nOn Monday, Cristiano Ronaldo added another feather to his cap by winning the inaugural The Best FIFA Men’s Player award in Zurich, and the social media went crazy over the 31-year-old once again. However, almost no recognition has come the way of CF Andorinha – a Portuguese fifth division club based in Santo Antonio on the small island of Madeira. It was at Andorinha, where the Real Madrid star’s father used to work as a kit man, where Ronaldo had stepped into the world of football at the age of seven. No recognition for Ronaldo’s success has been given to Nacional or Sporting CP, where Ronaldo was groomed to be one of the best in the world. There are no significant awards in football for clubs and academies who identify talents and hone them. There is no recognition for the scout who must have sat through hundreds to tedious matches in order to spot that one moment of brilliance. We hardly even know the youth coaches who sweat it out on the training ground along with hundreds of children every year to find that one talent which he thinks can make it big.\n\nThen after a few years, the big club swoops in prizes those talents away. The national team’s fortunes are tied to these academies. Barcelona’s dominance translated to Spain’s success, similarly Bayern Munich’s rise has contributed to Germany’s success at the 2014 World Cup. This is not a recent trend as well.

Now a second division club in Argentina, five of the players in that World Cup-winning side were groomed by Argentinos Juniors – Diego Maradona, Sergio Batista, Claudio Borghi, Daniel Passarella, and Pedro Pasculli.\n\nMaradona was playing for Napoli by the time the 1986 World Cup had arrived, but he was part of the youth team of that famous Argentinos Juniors side which went on to win the 1985 Copa Libertadores. Sergio Batista and Claudio Borghi were part of the team which defeated America de Cali in the final. However, perhaps the greatest contribution of a single academy to a national team’s success belongs to La Masia. The famed Barcelona academy contributed nine players to the 2010 World Cup-winning team of Spain. As Barcelona dominated Europe under Pep Guardiola, Spain adopted the same style of football with the same set of players. Bayern Munich nearly repeated that feat by contributing five players to the 2014 World Cup-winning German side. However, there were four key players in that German side who had originated from Schalke’s academy – Mesut Ozil, Manuel Neuer, Julian Draxler, and Benedikt Howedes.\n\nPremier League Understandably, there are no Premier League clubs in the top-10 contributors of World Winners in the last 30 years. England has continued to struggle in international tournaments, and Premier League clubs are becoming more and more dependent on foreign stars. With money flowing in from all corners, the need to develop British talents has taken a back seat as they continue to raid clubs and academies for talents all across Europe. It is, of course, easier to buy talents, than to develop them. Manchester United have ‘produced’ two World Cup winners in the last 30 years, technically – Ron-Robert Zieler and Gerard Pique.\n\nManchester United have ‘produced’ two World Cup winners in the last 30 years, technically – Ron-Robert Zieler and Gerard Pique. Zieler had spent three seasons at the Old Trafford without making any senior-team appearance, while Gerard Pique had spent most of his youth career at Barcelona and makes it to this list only because he was too young to sign a professional contract with United when he joined them in 2004. Similarly, Arsenal lured Cesc Fabregas away from Barcelona’s academy when he was too young to sign a professional contract and so technically, he comes under their youth team product. However, it must be added that Arsenal played a much bigger part in developing Fabregas, than United did in developing Pique.\n\n© Getty Images Everton are the only other PL club who can boast of a World Cup winner in this time period. Shkodran Mustafi was initially assigned to their academy team when he was signed from Hamburger SV. The now Arsenal defender failed to grab a place for himself in the first team before joining Sampdoria. Unless, there is a drastic change in the transfer policies of the PL clubs, who are now more and more focussed on luring away young talents from Spain, France, and Germany to their own academies, things are unlikely to improve for the English national team.",
  "latent_19376": "Anti-LGBT Pastor Warns of 'Sodomite' Semen in Starbucks Lattes\n\nThe homophobic minister who decried Starbucks patrons as 'upscale sodomites' who spread Ebola now says the chain is using the semen of 'sodomites' to flavor its coffee.\n\nThe latest (brew-haha?) for coffee giant Starbucks relates to queers, bodily fluids, an anti-LGBT minister, and a faulty satire detector.\n\nJames David Manning has escalated his homophobic remarks to double venti levels with his contention that Starbucks uses “the semen of sodomites” as flavoring in its coffee.\n\nThe story starts with Manning’s assertion last week that Starbucks is “ground zero for spreading Ebola and other diseases” due to the “generally upscale sodomites” who frequent the coffee shops and “exchange a lot of body fluids.”\n\nSince the video of Manning’s “upscale sodomites” remarks hit the Web, two things apparently set him off even more. One is that LGBT rights advocates protested outside Manning’s ATLAH World Missionary Church in New York. The other is that he evidently read a satirical post about Starbucks using semen in its drinks and mistook it for a real news story.\n\n“Now this is the absolute truth,” he said in a video posted Wednesday. “There was a big article about an investigation into Starbucks using male semen and putting it into the blends of coffee that they sell. … My question is, where are they getting all this semen from? … My suspicions is that they’re getting their semen from sodomites … my suspicion is that semen … it has millions and millions of little zygotes in it, and it flavors up the coffee and it makes you thinks you’re having a good time drinking that cup of latte with the semen in it.”\n\nManning swears he isn’t making the story up and refers to reading a report in a publication called the Inquisitor. The only high-ranked Google result for “inquisitor Starbucks semen” is an Inquisitr item that explains that the rumors are not true — and it points to a satirical Huzlers.com post as the source of the claim. Here’s an excerpt from that story, published October 18:\n\n“‘We can not believe this’ says FDA inspector Jamison Fields, ‘this is disturbing, if i wanted to consume semen I would just do gay pornography, who would’ve known i was consuming semen through Starbucks.’ … It is also speculated that the seasonal Pumpkin Spice Latte, which is only sold at Starbucks in the autumn, is not only loaded with semen, but cockroaches as well.” The Huzlers story also quotes a supposed Starbucks customer who doesn’t mind the semen because it makes the coffee taste so good and says, “I might just try semen alone to see if it’s that good.”\n\nHuzlers has also run a satirical story — published March 3 of this year—with the contention that Starbucks was using breast milk in its beverages. Manning must have missed that one. Hopefully he’ll tune in if anyone runs a story contending that the company is using blood in the baked goods.\n\nManning has in the past accused President Barack Obama of “[releasing] homo demons on the black man” and asserted that gay athletes are pedophiles.\n\nHere's the latest video from Manning:",
  "latent_19445": "Top officials in the Democratic National Committee are worried about a sudden drop in voter registrations in Colorado, concerned that President Donald Trump’s new election commission is encouraging Democrats across the country to remove themselves from the electoral grid for fear of revealing personal information to the GOP leadership.\n\nLed by DNC Chairman Tom Perez, they’ve begun an effort — in conjunction with the Colorado Democratic Party — to persuade other members of the party’s rank-and-file to stay registered.\n\n“If you unregister, you are giving a victory to proponents of voter suppression,” Perez said in an interview with McClatchy.\n\nDenying the GOP a victory on this issue, he said, is the party’s new rallying cry.\n\n“That’s our message,” Perez said. “And we’re out there delivering that message in every way possible.”\n\nMore than 3,000 Colorado voters have unregistered since Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity requested personal data on voters in late June, according to the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. The commission, created to investigate alleged voter fraud in states across the country, drew bipartisan backlash this month with its request, with officials in both parties declining to provide the information out of concern for voters’ privacy.\n\nThe Colorado voters who withdrew their registration represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the state’s total number of registered voters, said officials with the Colorado secretary of state’s office. And Democratic officials say they haven’t seen widespread examples of voters revoking their registration in other states.\n\nBut to Perez, the case in Colorado is an example of the Trump-created commission trying to make it more difficult to vote. He and other Democrats have accused the group of laying the groundwork for Republican-led efforts that would make voting more difficult. (Trump has said, without evidence, that three to five million men and women voted illegally in the last election. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million.)\n\n“The commission has nothing to do with election integrity and everything to do with voter suppression,” Perez said.\n\nThe chairman said the DNC is working closely with the Colorado Democratic Party to spread the word to voters not to unregister. It’s part of a broader effort from the DNC to offer more support to state parties: The committee last week announced a new initiative to funnel more money to them as well as hiring additional staff to offer support.\n\n“What we’re seeing in Colorado, we hope that doesn’t spread elsewhere,” said one DNC official. “That’s why we’re working on educating voters across the country about this. We’re not trying to incite panic, but the DNC itself is monitoring this situation and is concerned by what we’re seeing.”\n\nKris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas and vice chairman of Trump’s commission, dismissed concerns about voters withdrawing their registration.\n\n“It could be a number of things,” he said, according to Breitbart. “It could be, actually, people who are not qualified to vote, perhaps someone who is a felon and is disqualified that way, or someone who is not a U.S. citizen saying, ‘I’m withdrawing my voter registration because I am not able to vote.’ It could be a political stunt – people who are trying to discredit the Commission and withdrawing temporarily because they are politically active but planning to get back on the voter rolls before the election next November.”",
  "latent_19558": "When someone — whether laypeople, like Jill Soloway or the writers at Buzzfeed, or academics, like bell hooks — describes the United States as a “patriarchy,” it is unclear to me what they intend to mean. Maybe this sounds irreverent, but women serve in every level of government — executive, judicial and legislative, at this point only never occupying (and losing only by a close margin) the upper echelons of the presidency. Just this week in Georgia, a woman won a House seat in an election where her opponent was a well-financed white male. If we look at influential powers beyond government, women own some of the largest hundred-billion dollar corporations in the west. Women are the majority of teachers, arguably one of the most influential concentrations of quasi-political power in a democratic republic. As a voting bloc they’ve had much sway in all elections since suffrage.\n\nSo, to understand what someone means when they insist that the States is still a patriarchy, it might be appropriate to ask: Would the United States still be a patriarchy if Hillary Clinton had won the election?\n\nIt’s a yes or no question. There are two possible responses.\n\nIf the answer is “No, the United States would have no longer been a patriarchy,” then we’ve clarified something — we’ve singled out a condition under which the States would cease to be a patriarchy (namely, φ: electing a woman to the highest position of executive power). Someone answering “No” stipulates that there is a certain achievable goal under which patriarchy would cease. Now, why did Clinton lose the election? Not, as some people would like to believe, because of pervasive American sexism — rather, because of a variety of complicated reasons that can in no way be reduced to misogyny. Donald Trump did not win simply because Clinton was a woman. That was not a decisive factor. However, now that the individual has clarified under what condition (φ) the state of patriarchy could be dissolved, and we know that this (sufficient) condition could be achieved at any given election cycle — that men only occupying the presidency for the last few terms has been a purely contingent state of affairs — then we know that the term “patriarchy” only trivially applies to the United States. We know that, essentially, use of the term “patriarchy” is only appropriate because a male currently sits in the Oval Office. It might follow from this answer that were Clinton in office, America would even be a matriarchy. Now, by designating φ as nullifying the term “patriarchy,” the person has demonstrated that the term, applied now, can hardly condemn at all (as it only specifies one stage in a democratic process), and all the baggage it carries loses much of its weight. A woman could occupy the presidency at any time. If she does, then the patriarchy will be dissolved. Thus, the patriarchy could be dissolved at any time, the U.S. is not innately a patriarchy, and the term carries only taxonomic weight. (Not to say it may not carry particular emotional weight, but it does not carry damning weight.)\n\nHowever, the person is unlikely to answer this way. Few agreed that racism ended when President Obama took office, and of course it didn’t. The two are not the same, but let’s examine what happens when they choose the other response.\n\nThe other possible answer is “Yes, the United States would still be a patriarchy if Clinton had won.” If this is the case, then we know, first of all, that a woman occupying the most powerful position in the world would still not be enough to end patriarchy. Certain consequences follow from this. There would seem to be less incentive for believers in a patriarchy to work to elect female politicians, or female board members, or encourage female participation in science or engineering — women in power, just in and of itself, is not enough. Presumably, it has to be the right kind of woman power; the people that answer this way don’t think of Clinton as feminist or progressive enough; her engagement with politics is no better than another conservative man’s political engagement. What these people want is large-scale cultural and political change. Patriarchy is not about women holding power, it is about the “mental, social, spiritual, economic and political organization/structuring of society produced by… sex-based political relations… reinforced by different institutions… to achieve consensus on the lesser value of women” (A. Facio, “What is Patriarchy?”). Or more simply, it is a “social system that values masculinity over femininity” (M. Watanabe, Feminist Fridays).\n\nI rarely encounter succinct definitions of patriarchy (much less in terms through which progress can be made), yet it is still nonchalantly applied in certain political circles. Often, when parts of the definition do make sense, they’re false. Modern-day societies — at least capitalist ones — are not “organized” in any way intelligible by Facio’s definition; political relations are rarely, in the Western world, defined by sex or gender. One element that seems central to a definition is the over-valuing of “masculine” qualities over “feminine.” Glossing over the problem of defining these (even discussing them seems to be submitting to gender stereotypes), the value a society places on certain qualities is only the aggregate values of its individual members. Different people have different preferences. The idea that a society might completely equalize its values — why would we ever expect that to be possible or desirable? — seems to suggest superimposing someone’s idea of a perfect value set onto all others. Regardless, it’s unclear why, from some estimation of sexism in a culture, we need the introduction of a political term, using “-archy.” There must be more to it to make that term appropriate. It’s still unclear.\n\nThe problem of answering the question with “Yes” is that we still lack a condition, e.g. φ, by which we can dissolve the patriarchy. Under what circumstances will that word no longer apply? Otherwise, it is meaningless. Many of the proposed explanations evoke “institutions” — things never explicitly defined, and when critically examined, are revealed to be either nonexistent or too heterogeneous to dub patriarchal. If these institutions in America are supposed to be, say, the legal system or the education system, and these institutions are supposed to give America its organizational status, then in fact America is a matriarchy, due to the distribution of power present in these systems. If income-bracket is supposed to be an institution, then there might be a case to be made; men, on average, earn more (because they are in higher-paying positions), but this is probably not because they are men, or because our civilization favors them so, but rather certain contingent factors (such as career choice). This, again, would show America to not be innately patriarchal, “institutionally,” but temporarily, accidentally.\n\nSexism exists, to a much higher degree toward women than toward men. Does this mean we have to call America a patriarchy? No. The term “patriarchy” could do with some clarification, and not just from the ivory tower — with the same methods of analysis that we use to identify a system as a republic, dictatorship, or whatever — or be put to rest. The term is so abstract as to defy any analytic understanding, and its only coherent definition — a society or government run by males — either does not fit the United States or fits it only trivially.",

  "latent_19660": "When British Prime Minister Theresa May recently called a ‘snap’ general election, informed opinion was that she was looking to strengthen Britain’s hand in the approaching Brexit negotiations with the EU. For the benefit of non-UK website visitors, a British Prime Minister has the power to call a general election at any time within the statutory 5 years’ limit of a government’s life. Assuming that a Prime minister and his/her majority Party in the House of Commons remain unified and survive any and all ‘votes of confidence’, a PM and governing Party can rule for 5 years from the date of taking office.\n\nThe PM’s solely-possessed power to call an election at any time is a formidable one, for it enables a PM to pick a time when prospects look good for re-election. It also enables a PM to threaten dissident members of the ruling Party when things are going badly for the Party. They will not want to face their constituents and risk losing the seat during a time of the Party’s unpopularity.\n\nIn this instance, May has called an early election, for she could continue to govern for several years before her 5 years is up. At the moment, her Conservative Party has 330 seats out of a total of 650 seats, an overall majority of 10. Other Parties in the House of Commons are the Labour Party opposition with 229 seats, the Scottish Nationalists with 54, the Liberal Democrats with a paltry 9 seats, the Welsh Nationalists with 3 seats and from Northern Ireland (Ulster) 11 Unionists and 7 Sinn Fein (Irish Nationalists).\n\nOnly the Conservative, Labour and LibDems fight a general election nationally, since the Scottish Nationalists only contest Scottish seats, the Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalists) only contest Wales’ 40 seats and the two Ulster parties only contest Ulster seats. Ulster’s Unionists are closely tied to the Conservative Party, so May’s working majority is nearer 30.\n\nOther significant Parties that will contest some seats are the Greens, the UKIP and the BNP. The only truly nationalist parties are Sinn Fein (for a united Ireland), and the BNP (British National Party), which is restricted in its campaigns by violent official and Red semi-official persecution. The Scots Nats and Plaid Cymru are really Socialist Parties rival to Labour. The LibDem Party is the Party of extreme Globalism and revolutionary sexual morality.\n\nGiven that the Labour Party (the official opposition) is relatively small in Parliament and torn apart by internal strife, it can be seen that, on the surface, May had no need to risk calling an election. Part of the explanation is the Brexit vote which took place last year, only one year after the General Election of 2015 which gave David Cameron and his Conservative Party an overall 10 seat majority. Cameron – a Globalist, social modernist and EU believer – called the Brexit vote, calculating that the voters would reject separation from Europe.\n\nTo his credit, he treated the Brexit vote as a vote of ‘no confidence’ and resigned the Party leadership and Office of Prime Minister. May was elected replacement Party leader and Prime Minister by a majority of the Conservative MP’s. Under the UK’s constitution, no General Election was necessary to replace one PM with another.\n\nThe Conservative Party is not a Nationalist Party, but like America’s Republican Party, it has a Nationalist leaning, especially among its rank-and-file. Like the Republican Party, its higher ranks look to Big Business for finance.\n\nTheresa May was not at all Nationalist-leaning, but a Party professional, so her resolute pursuit of Brexit is surprising. But Party professionals rarely have too much principle and many nurse great ambitions. We suggest that May is a skillful opportunist who saw her opportunity in the Brexit vote and Cameron’s misjudgment. She may see herself as the new Margaret Thatcher, donning some Nationalist clothing, and enjoying a long period as Prime Minister.\n\nWith the Labour Party in disarray (led by the UK’s version of Bernie Sanders); the other Parties greatly divided among each other; and the opinion polls looking good for the Conservative Party, May has an opportunity to decisively win a General Election as Party leader and Prime Minister, and remain in Office for the next 4 plus years.\n\nWhilst a decisive victory at the polls might strengthen her hand a little in the Brexit negotiations, I cannot see it having much impact on the EU leadership. It will however greatly strengthen her hand in Parliament and in the Conservative Party. This is her calculation based on ambition, and the Nationalist stance she will adopt is based solely on opportunism. Nevertheless, opportunism may be pushing her in the direction of Britain’s best interests.\n\nThe opposition parties are scrambling to gear up for an election that has caught them off guard. May and her Party are likely to win with a bigger Parliamentary majority and all publicly committed to Brexit.\n\nUKIP, a disorganized Party lacking an agenda beyond exit from the EU, is unlikely to gain traction, but who knows once the campaign gets into full swing? The BNP -the only true Nationalist Party and possessing a small but battle-hardened hard core membership – is led by a good man but one lacking charisma and communication skills. Its only way forward is by fighting local council seats at another time. It has no money and is beset by laws that criminalize speech on race, immigration and traditional morals.\n\nTrump and May will find some common ground in the year ahead, but the Broad Right in the USA should not mistake either the Conservative Party or UKIP for Parties of the Right.",
  "latent_19681": "The Nazi spies arrived on the shores of Britain under the cover of night, by parachute, by rowing boat and by rubber dinghy. In their suitcases each carried a morse code transmitter, a map of the UK, a handgun and some invisible ink. Their mission: to pave the way for an invasion.\n\nBut the spies chosen for the mission had neither convincing fluency in English nor basic knowledge of British customs. One spy was arrested after trying to order a pint of cider at 10am, unaware that during wartime landlords weren't allowed to serve alcohol before lunchtime. Another pair were stopped while cycling through Scotland on the wrong side of the road: once the police discovered German sausages and Nivea hand cream in their luggage, their cover was blown.\n\nOf the 12 spies who landed in Britain as part of Operation Lena in September 1940, most were arrested without having come closing to fulfilling their mission, and \"because of their own stupidity\", as British official records put it. Why Germany sent such inept agents on one of the most important missions of the second world war has remained an enduring mystery.\n\nA book published in Germany this summer comes up with a new explanation. In Operation Sealion: Resistance inside the Secret Service, the historian Monika Siedentopf argues that the botched spying mission was not the result of German incompetence, but a deliberate act of sabotage by a cadre of intelligence officials opposed to Hitler's plans.\n\nSiedentopf first became interested in the story of Operation Sealion – the German plan to invade Britain – while researching a book on the role of female spies during the war. For many other missions, German spies had been meticulously well-prepared, she noticed, so why not in 1940?\n\nHer research led her to a circle of people around Herbert Wichmann, the officer in charge of the Hamburg intelligence unit, one of Nazi Germany's biggest secret service posts.\n\nWichmann had close ties not only to Wilhelm Canaris, the spy chief once dubbed the \"Hamlet of conservative resistance\" by Hugh Trevor-Roper, but also to the Stauffenberg group which planned to assassinate Hitler in July 1944.\n\nAt the end of the war, Wichmann was given a key role in rebuilding Hamburg's shipping industry, upon express orders of the British. MI5 described him and his circle as \"good Germans, but bad Nazis\".\n\nAfter six years of research in the National Archives and using Wichmann's own writing, Siedentopf deduced that the spy chief had deliberately sent agents on Operation Lena who had neither particularly good knowledge of the country nor the language.\n\nInstead, his preference appears to have been for individuals with low levels of intelligence but resounding enthusiasm for National Socialism, many of them petty criminals and members of far-right organisations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.\n\nWichmann's motives, Siedentopf told the Guardian, were mixed. He feared not only that Operation Sealion was badly planned and would come at a considerable human and material cost to Germany, but also that an attack on England would escalate the conflict into a proper world war – but preventing that was an objective that even its most inept spies could achieve.",
  "latent_19723": "When Scientific American heard from chemist Ray Baughman a year ago, he and his international team of nanotechnologists had taken artificial-muscle technology to the next level. Their innovation relied on spinning lengths of carbon nanotubes into buff yarns whose twisting and untwisting mimicked natural muscles found in an elephant's trunk or a squid's tentacles.\n\nNow the researchers are reporting a new artificial muscle–building technique that makes their carbon nanotube yarns several times faster and more powerful. These qualities could help deliver on the technology's promise of developing compact, lightweight actuators for robots, exoskeletons and other mechanical devices, although several challenges remain.\n\nThe latest breakthrough comes from infusing the carbon nanotube yarns with paraffin wax that expands when heated, enabling the artificial muscles to lift more than 100,000 times their own weight and generate 85 times more mechanical power during contraction than mammalian skeletal muscles of comparable size, according to the researchers, whose latest work is published in the November 16 issue of Science.\n\nThe previous-generation artificial muscles were electrochemical and functioned like a supercapacitor. When a charge was injected into the carbon nanotube yarn, ions from a liquid electrolyte diffused into the yarn, causing it to expand in volume and contract in length, says Baughman, director of the University of Texas at Dallas's Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute. Unfortunately, using an electrolyte limited the temperature range in which the muscle could function. At colder temperatures the electrolyte would solidify, slowing down the muscle; if too hot, the electrolyte would degrade. It also needed a container, which added weight to the artificial-muscle system.\n\nThe wax eliminates the need for an electrolyte, making the artificial muscle lighter, stronger and more responsive. When heat or a light pulse is applied to a wax-impregnated yarn about 200 microns in diameter (roughly twice that of a human hair), the wax melts and expands. In about 25 milliseconds this expansion creates pressure causing the yarn's individual nanotube threads to twist and the yarn's length to contract. Any weightlifter will tell you that the success of any muscle—artificial or natural—depends in part on the degree of this contraction. Depending on the force exerted, the Baughman team's muscle strands could contract by up to 10 percent.\n\nMuscles are also judged by the weight they can lift relative to their size. \"Our muscles can lift about 200 times the weight of a similar-size natural muscle,\" Baughman says, adding that the wax-infused artificial muscles can also generate 30 times the maximum power of their electrolyte-powered predecessors.\n\nThe researchers' latest artificial muscles move the technology closer to commercialized products such as environmental sensors, aerospace materials and even textiles that take can take advantage of nanoscale actuators, University of Cincinnati mechanical engineering professor Mark Schulz, wrote in a related Science Perspectives article. This new artificial muscle outperforms existing ones, allowing possible applications such as linear and rotary motors; it also might replace biological muscle tissue if biocompatibility can be established, he adds.\n\nHowever, Schulz points out—and Baughman is quick to acknowledge—that even this new crop of artificial muscles faces many challenges before they can be a practical alternative to mini–electric motors in many of the products we buy. Despite their improvements, the latest artificial muscles are for the most part inefficient and limited in the combinations of force, motion and speed they can generate, according to Schulz.\n\nIndeed, these new artificial muscles operate at about 1 percent efficiency, a number Baughman and his colleagues want to increase at least 10-fold. An option for improving efficiency is to use a chemical fuel rather than electricity to power the muscles. \"One way to compensate for a lack of efficiency is to use fuel like methanol instead of a battery,\" he says. \"You could store more than 20 percent more energy in a fuel like methanol than you can in a battery.\"\n\nAnother challenge is that the artificial muscles must be heated and cooled to contract and release, respectively. Short lengths of yarn can cool on their own in a matter of seconds, but longer pieces would need to be actively cooled using water or air, otherwise the muscle would not relax. \"Or you'd need [to use a] material that doesn't require thermal actuation,\" Baughman says. \"If you keep making the [carbon nanotube] yarn longer and longer, your cooling rate increases.\"\n\nThis issue of scale poses perhaps the greatest challenge. A one-millimeter length of artificial muscle can lift about 50 grams, according to Baughman. That means lifting several tons would require a greater length of carbon nanotube yarn than is practical. \"We'd like our artificial muscles to be used in exoskeletons that help workers or soldiers lift objects weighing tons,\" he says. But the researchers are still working out ways to pack enough yarn to perform such tasks into the length of an exoskeletal limb.\n\nCarbon nanotube artificial muscles are more likely to first appear in products requiring only short lengths. Baughman envisions artificial muscles used in a catheter for minimally invasive surgery, \"where you want to have lots of functionality on the end of the catheter to do surgical manipulations.\" Another application with flex appeal—\"smart\" fabrics that can automatically react to their environments, becoming more or less porous when they detect heat or harmful chemicals in the air.",
  "latent_19825": "I think Ryan Pace can cancel the Teryl Austin interview.\n\nHe might as well, because when Harry Potter took over as the Bears’ new general manager Friday, he talked of urgency to find the best possible coach, and the best possible coach became available Monday when the Broncos dumped John Fox.\n\nNot only is Fox the top candidate, but nobody is second.\n\nAnd the timing is too perfect for the Bears when you consider Fox’s relationship with Bears consultant Ernie Accorsi, who ran the Giants when Fox was defensive coordinator.\n\nAnd then there’s Fox’s relationship with Saints coach Sean Payton, Pace’s New Orleans BFF.\n\nAnd then, best of all, there’s Fox’s reported interest in coming to the Bears.\n\nIt’s simple: The Bears could do worse than Fox. In fact, they just did.\n\nHiring Fox means the Bears would be buying off the top shelf. If they can act un-Bears-like by firing a coach after just two seasons, then they can act extremely un-Bears-like by paying to get the best coach available with NFL experience.\n\nFox seems to fit Pace’s requirements of charisma, confidence and leadership. The head coach ought to be the strongest personality in the building. Fox brings the kind of credibility that would immediately earn him that.\n\nFox went 46-18 in Denver and won four AFC West titles, one of them with Tim Tebow. Think about that. Tim Tebow.\n\nFox has been to two Super Bowls. Yes, he lost both of them, but he’s been there, and the only way to win multiple championships the way the Bears are talking is to get to multiple Super Bowls.\n\nFox has coached teams into the playoffs in seven of his 13 seasons. The Bears have been to the playoffs seven times in the last 25 seasons.\n\nFox has won eight playoff games in the last 12 seasons. The Bears have won six playoff games since Super Bowl XX.\n\nThe Bears franchise is a bigger embarrassment than you thought. Fox is better than you might’ve realized.\n\nFox’s former Broncos staff includes head-coaching candidates Adam Gase and Jack Del Rio, so he knows coaching talent the way his record reflects his ability to figure out playing talent.\n\nBut here's the most important thing about Fox: He wouldn’t be a hire about Jay Cutler.\n\nFox has no ties to Cutler. Fox would have no reason to enable the overpaid quarterback. That’s huge because the Bears’ next coach can’t be about Cutler.\n\nI hope Pace knows that. I hope he isn’t feeling pressure from George McCaskey and Ted Phillips to get something out of their $54 million guaranteed. If that’s the case, Pace never should’ve taken the job.\n\nThe decision on Cutler should stem solely from Pace and his new coach deciding they can win with Cutler or they can’t. (Hint: They can’t because nobody can).\n\nThe decision can’t be forced by money or ownership. Fox has the distance and gravitas to make that clear.\n\nOne thing I almost forgot: Fox would bring the Bears a quality defensive mind, and man, could the Bears’ woeful defense ever use a quality defensive mind.\n\nYou could point out what the Seahawks did to Fox’s defense in last year’s Super Bowl. I can’t argue that, other than to offer that at least he got his team there.\n\nMaybe the other candidates the Bears have interviewed could win a conference title, maybe not. Fox already has done it twice.\n\nAfter hiring coaches who’ve never held the position before, the Bears need to choose a coach who won’t be overwhelmed by the demands of the job.\n\nFox knows the drill and still wants to coach. He would be a big get, even at 59. This could be the football version of Joe Maddon falling into the Cubs’ laps.\n\nThere’s something to be said for balance in the GM-coach relationship. Young executive. Experienced head coach. Learning from each other. Helping each other achieve the same goal. Quick, someone tell Bears GM Harry Potter that his Dumbledore is right there for the hiring.",
  "latent_20000": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling Scholastic, 759 pp., $34.99 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix a film directed by David Yates, based on the book by J.K. Rowling\n\n1.\n\nIn international folklore, one of the best-known tales is of a poor, hungry child who wishes that the family’s pot of porridge were always full. The wish is granted—and often more than granted. No matter how much is scooped from the pot, porridge continues to boil up, slopping over the stove, then onto the floor, filling the cottage, running out the door, and eventually almost drowning the whole village.\n\nWith this tale in mind, imagine a dark, wet winter day in Edinburgh. A young single mother, living on welfare, is sitting in a café because there is no heat in her rented apartment. Whenever her baby falls asleep for a while in its stroller, she tries to write a children’s story that she first thought of more than two years ago. Suddenly a fairy appears and offers her three wishes. She asks modestly that she may be able to finish her book, that it may be published, and that children all over the world may like it.\n\nAs with the uncontrollable pot of porridge, J.K. Rowling gets more than her wish. The story is finished, the publisher found, and the tales of Harry Potter begin to cover the earth, both as books (they have now been translated into over sixty languages) and as films. There are games, toys, costumes, guidebooks, Web sites, and a multitude of imitative versions of the novels that bear the same relation to the originals as wet cardboard sludge does to tasty porridge. In China alone, according to The New York Times, there are already a dozen false Harry Potter books in print, in one of which six Chinese teenage wizards travel to Hogwarts to rescue Harry and his friends from the forces of evil.\n\nMeanwhile, J.K. Rowling has become the richest and most famous children’s writer in the world. Already in 1999 more than two thousand fans lined up outside a bookshop to meet her and have their copies of The Prisoner of Azkaban signed. At this occasion, according to Publishers Weekly, the crowd became so ugly that “the store’s general manager was bitten and punched.” Soon Rowling could not leave the house without being pointed out and besieged by fans. By 2001, in an interview on the BBC, she complained that people had started searching her trash. “It’s horrible,” she said. “It feels like such an invasion, and I’m not a politician, I’m not an entertainer; I never expected that level of interest in my life.”\n\nThat Harry Potter has received far more attention than Rowling ever wanted is strongly suggested by the attitude of her hero toward his own fame. Again and again he expresses the wish that he were an ordinary boy. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, for instance, he says, “He was sick of it, sick of being the person who was stared at and talked about…",

  "latent_20202": "Jim Rogash/Getty Images\n\nSince this is July 4th week, let’s talk about a little Shock and Awe, also known as Rob Gronkowski and Jimmy Graham. These two players are completely changing the tight end position. They have also taken over most tight end conversations. Never before have we seen two tight ends outscore all but two wide receivers in a single season.\n\nGronkowski was absolutely a beast in the red-zone and outscored all tight ends, including Graham, but many statisticians are now calling for him to regress back to the mean. But for some reason the same is not being said about Graham. It will be interesting to see which of these guys can lead the charge in 2012, if it is even one of these two.\n\nThere is a ton of talent at tight end, and a position that was once an afterthought in fantasy football is now a strength. As teams go to the air more, these huge tight ends can change a game. Defenses will struggle to stop them. They are too tall for most defensive backs and too fast for most linebackers.\n\nAs always in this league, once a team finds success doing something different, other teams will follow. With the success the Patriots have had using two tight ends, we will see more teams trying to imitate that success, and because of that, tight ends will continue to grow in importance for fantasy owners.\n\nThe quarterback, running back and wide receiver rankings have already been released, so let’s jump into the tight end rankings. Please comment below with any thoughts on this list.\n\n1. Rob Gronkowski (NE)\n\nGronkowski put up 10 touchdowns in 2010 as a rookie on only 42 receptions and most analysts swore that he could not repeat those numbers heading into his second season, especially with Aaron Hernandez in the mix. We know now that he did not repeat those numbers; he far exceeded them.\n\nFor his second season he blew the top off those numbers. He caught 90 passes for 1,327 yards and 17 touchdowns. Both the yardage and touchdowns were NFL records for tight ends.\n\nLet’s break it down even further. Gronk had nine games with more than 20 fantasy points (using PPR scoring with no bonuses), 10 games with at least 75 receiving yards and seven games with multiple touchdowns. To compare, Calvin Johnson only had nine games with more than 75 yards and five games with multiple touchdowns. Even with 25 fewer targets than Graham, Gronk eclipsed him in both yards and touchdowns and only had nine less receptions.\n\nEven if his 2011 numbers come down slightly in 2012, there is still only one tight end that will fight him for this top spot. That’s the man many consider to be No. 1-B instead of No. 2, Jimmy Graham.\n\n2. Jimmy Graham (NO)\n\nThe truly amazing thing about Jimmy Graham is that he has only played three years of football, one year of college and now two in the NFL, but is already considered one of the best to play the game at the position. We have to wonder what he will do once he gets a few more years under his belt.\n\nLast year Graham caught 99 passes, only three shy of Tony Gonzalez’s record of 102 in 2004, for 1,310 yards and 11 touchdowns. Graham had seven games of more than 20 points, 10 games with at least 75 yards receiving, but only two games with multiple scores. He was easily the most targeted tight end in the league and looks like a good shot to hold that title again in 2012.\n\nCalvin Johnson and Wes Welker were the only two wide receivers with more fantasy points than both Graham and Gronkowski. By grabbing one of these tight ends at the end of the first or beginning of the second, you are getting a top-5 wide receiver at tight end.\n\nTo see a really good comparison between Gronkowski and Graham read this article by Bucky Brooks of NFL.com.\n\n3. Brent Celek (PHI)\n\nCelek got off to an awful start in 2011. After the first five games he had only nine receptions, 73 yards and no touchdowns. In three of those games he only had one reception. That changed over the next 11 games. He went from averaging just 4.2 targets per game to 6.6 in the last 11.\n\nHe finished the season with 62 receptions, only one less than team leader Jeremy Maclin, 811 yards and five touchdowns. Over that last 11-game string he was the fifth-ranked tight end, and in eight of those games he had double-digit points. He also scored three touchdowns in the last three games.\n\nThis offensive line definitely took steps to improve last year, one of the reasons Celek was freed up more as the season progressed, but even with the loss of Jason Peters this offseason, this line should be very strong in 2012. If Celek isn’t tasked with blocking, it will free him up to once again be a big part of this offense.\n\n4. Antonio Gates (SD)\n\nGates ended 2011 with the fewest touchdowns he’s had since his rookie season. Injuries have become his biggest concern. He missed three games in 2011 and six games in 2010 as he battled a nagging foot injury. Even with the missed time and fighting the injuries through several other games, Gates still managed to average 57 receptions, 780 yards and 8.5 touchdowns in those two years, including 10 touchdowns in just 10 games in 2010.\n\nChargers head coach Norv Turner had this to say about Gates in May; “Gates looks great — he's back. Physically, he's back to where we want him to be. I think, like anybody, going through this offseason program helps you get better. (It's) the combination of conditioning, the combination of getting better in the areas you can improve, and being out there with your teammates.”\n\nNot unusual to hear that kind of praise in May or June, but can he hold it together for an entire season is the question in fantasy owners minds. With the depth at the position, is it worth the risk to pull the trigger on Gates in fantasy drafts?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nGates finished 2010 as the third-ranked TE even though he only played in 10 games. In 2011, with the elite emergence of Rob Gronkowski and Jimmy Graham, Gates was still the seventh-ranked tight end in 13 games. If he can stay healthy for 2012 we could be looking at the type of numbers he had in 2009: 79 receptions, 1,157 yards and eight touchdowns. Those numbers would’ve made him the third highest scoring tight end in 2011. Gates could easily lead the Chargers in receptions now that Vincent Jackson has moved to Tampa Bay.\n\n5. Jason Witten (DAL)\n\nEven though it feels like Witten has been playing forever, he is only 30 years old and still in his prime, but he is coming off his worst statistical season since 2006. He caught 79 passes for 942 yards and five touchdowns in 2011, but those numbers were still good enough to rank fifth in PPR scoring.\n\nThe scary part for Witten is the way his targets dropped during the second half of the season. In the first eight games he was seeing 8.9 targets a game; in the final eight he was only getting 5.8. In five of his first eight games he had at least nine targets, including three double-digit games. The highest total he had in the second half of the season was eight targets in Week 17 against the Giants.\n\nA lot of that drop off can probably be blamed on the emergence of Laurent Robinson. Robinson had 50 targets over those last eight games after having only 28 in the first eight. Fortunately for Witten, Robinson is now in Jacksonville, which should allow Witten to pick up a good many of those targets.\n\n6. Aaron Hernandez (NE)\n\nThe middle of any tight end rankings will be all over the map this year. After Gronkowski and Graham, there are at least eight other tight ends who could go anywhere from three to five in 2012. Hernandez finished third in 2011, even while missing two games. What is more amazing is that he does it with Gronkowski on the same team.\n\nThe Patriots have thrown 42 touchdowns to their tight ends in the last two seasons and the next highest team is the Saints with 22. There is no doubt that both Gronkowski and Hernandez will continue to be big playmakers on this offense, but the addition of Lloyd might take a little off the top for Hernandez.\n\nLloyd’s penchant for big plays may just take some of the middle of the field plays out of Hernandez’s hands. But even if that does happen, there is no way Hernandez disappears from Brady’s scope. Hernandez averaged over eight targets a game in 2011. Even if he loses 2 targets a game and ends up with 96 targets on the year, it will still be more targets than Vernon Davis had in 2011.\n\n7. Tony Gonzalez (ATL)\n\nEvery year it is the same thing with Gonzalez; waiting for him to fall off a cliff because of his age. Last year was no different. He was drafted with an ADP of pick 117 in 2011, or the 12th tight end drafted. He finished as the fourth-ranked tight end in PPR leagues and was fifth in points per game for all tight ends. He was not a big part of the offense in Weeks 15 and 17 because the team jumped out to enormous leads and they wanted him fresh for the playoffs or his numbers would’ve been even better.\n\nFast forward to 2012 drafts and already the same thing is happening with Gonzalez. Once again he is being drafted on average in the middle of the 10th round, as the 12th tight end drafted. Sometimes fantasy owners can be their own worst enemy as they fall in love with all the new “toys” and forget about the players that do it year in and year out.\n\nSure, he is 36 this season and the talk out of Atlanta is how the offense will become a more vertical threat under new coordinator Dirk Koetter, but Gonzalez can’t be ruled out just because of the emergence of Julio Jones. If anything, Jones may help free up more open space for Gonzalez. Gonzalez has only missed two games in his entire 15-year career and is a physical beast.\n\nDon’t count him out just yet.\n\n8. Vernon Davis (SF)\n\nDavis is an amazing talent, especially if you ask him. He recently told WUSA-TV \"I will be the best tight end to ever play this game. I have a vision.\" Hard to put down a player when he thinks of himself that way, as it is somewhat expected, especially from a player who is in fact very good at his position. But Davis has a couple of things working against him.\n\nSan Francisco is a run-heavy offense and one of only four teams that ran more often than they passed in 2011. In fact, only two teams, Denver and Houston, ran more than San Francisco. This will continue to be a thorn in Davis’ side, no matter how good he is. The other thing working against him is that his quarterback, Alex Smith, is still a work in progress.\n\nSmith only threw 17 touchdowns in 2011, but now has a few new tools to play with. They brought over Super Bowl XLVI hero Mario Manningham and future Hall of Famer Randy Moss, and all the talk out of OTAs was about how good Moss looked. From that same article, they are glowing about Kyle Williams as well.\n\nNo matter which new wide receiver, or receivers, steps up, it will just be more mouths to feed for an offense that threw for the second-least passing attempts in the league in 2011. Look for Davis to finish in the top 10, but don’t be surprised if the new tools push him slightly down this list.\n\n9. Jermichael Finley (GB)\n\nFinley’s name has been synonymous with potential since he entered the league; unfortunately, he has yet to live up to that potential. Finley is coming off his best season as a pro with 55 receptions, 767 yards and eight touchdowns, but his catch rate was way down. Depending on which stat site you read, he dropped 12 or 13 balls in 2011.\n\nIn 2009, he also caught 55 balls, but he did that with only 71 targets. To get his 55 receptions in 2011 he needed 92 targets. In fact, 13 tight ends had more receptions than Finley in 2011. He blames his season on a few things: Lack of an offseason, a lack of chemistry with his QB, thinking about his 2010 knee injury, a lack of focus, a flat tire, he got arrested, his tux didn’t come back from the cleaners, an old friend came in from out of town, he ran out of gas… you get the picture.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Green Bay in the offseason, but it is written so that Green Bay can get out of it in 2013 if Finley once again fails to live up to his potential or loses focus. He is good enough to warrant a top-10 ranking just because of this offense, but if he does finally decide to focus, he could jump up this list.\n\n10. Brandon Pettigrew (DET)\n\nIn 2011, Graham and Gronkowski were the only tight ends that had more receptions than Pettigrew. To go a step further, only four receivers, Wes Welker, Roddy White, Calvin Johnson and Percy Harvin, caught more passes than Pettigrew did. Unfortunately, Pettigrew had the lowest average yards per catch of any tight end with more than 30 receptions. He finished the season with 83 receptions, 777 yards and five touchdowns, and he was the sixth-ranked tight end.\n\nThe Lions' offense was very good through the air in 2011. Stafford finally stayed healthy for all 16 games and threw for over 5,000 yards, but the running game did not fare as well. They finished 29th in average rushing yards per game. Most of that is attributed to the many injuries they sustained to the running backs. Because of this, Pettigrew’s routes became a little shorter to act as a pseudo-running game.\n\nComing into 2012, the running backs appear to be healthy, although we really won’t know until the preseason. But if they are healthy and this unit can rebound, then that should free up Pettigrew to get a little further down the field. Of course, the problem for him this year might be the play of wide receivers Titus Young and rookie Ryan Broyles.\n\n11. Greg Olsen (CAR)\n\nOlsen shared tight end duties with Jeremy Shockey last year. The duo produced 82 receptions, 995 yards and nine touchdowns, but now Shockey is gone. Even though he had to share duties, Olsen was still second on the team in receptions, third in yards and had four touchdowns in the first seven games.\n\nBut as the offensive line lost players to injury early in the season, Olsen was called on more to block. He averaged 7.2 targets per game in the first 10 games, but only 2.8 over the final six. It’s hard to do any damage with those few opportunities.\n\nIn this offense, with offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski, Olsen has a chance to become a focal point. As the team continues to struggle to find a No. 2 WR, Olsen has the chance to be a target monster for Newton, especially over the middle of the field.\n\n12. Fred Davis (WAS)\n\nDavis is making the news recently as a crack attorney, but all that really does is emphasize the issues relating to Davis. He has the ongoing court battle listed above, but he was also suspended in 2011 for four games for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, and if he fails one more test, he will be suspended for an entire season.\n\nThe team slapped the franchise tag on him for 2012, which he’s already signed, but Rich Tandler, a Redskins’ Beat Writer for CSNWashington.com, thinks it is extremely unlikely that they sign him to a long-term deal before the July 16th deadline. He will have to prove he can stay out of trouble before they will give him a long-term deal.\n\nBecause of this, Davis knows he has to prove himself, but he will also have to deal with a rookie quarterback and two new pass-catchers, Pierre Garcon and Josh Morgan. Davis has the talent to finish near the top of this list if everything comes together, but 12th is as high as he should go now.\n\nPlease comment below if there are any disagreements or questions. Discussions are the name of the game at this time of year, and the more these players are discussed and evaluated, the more draft day domination will become a consistent thing.\n\nPlease follow Jim Day on Twitter @Fantasytaz and visit his website Fantasytaz.com.

  "latent_20269": "“This falls into that category of it’s never too late to do the right thing,” said Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, who co-sponsored legislation that allowed Lieutenant Cushing to receive the medal so long after the war. “Many military historians for years scratched their heads wondering how he was overlooked for the Medal of Honor at the time. Coming around full circle 150 years after the fact is the right thing to do.”\n\nNearly half of the previous 3,490 recipients of the Medal of Honor fought in the Civil War, but none waited as long as Lieutenant Cushing. The approval of the medal by the first black president adds a certain historical coda to the saga, underscoring how much has changed in this country since Lieutenant Cushing gave his life in a war that ended slavery in the United States.\n\nThe long delay owes to a variety of factors that speak to how Washington works, or does not. At the time of Lieutenant Cushing’s death, the medal was not awarded posthumously, so he was ineligible. Once the rules changed and his cause was taken up, it lingered for years in the bureaucratic and legislative trenches of the capital, where some worried that honoring him would open the floodgates to other requests. Mr. Kind said some Southern colleagues were also less than enthusiastic.\n\n“There was some resistance to awarding a Union soldier the congressional medal at Gettysburg even 150 years after the fact,” Mr. Kind said. “They didn’t want us refighting the Civil War all over again. It’s still sensitive. But we were finally able to bridge that gulf and get it done.”\n\nThe nation’s leadership has lately been revisiting veterans of other conflicts who were not decorated. This past spring, Mr. Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to 24 veterans from World War II, Korea and Vietnam who had been overlooked, most because of their racial or ethnic backgrounds. The White House announced Tuesday that Mr. Obama would likewise honor two more Vietnam veterans on Sept. 15.",

With the inability to add any walk-on players until the first class day on Aug. 30, which is the Wednesday before the Terrapins come to Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, Herman has to form a scout team out of the 105 players he’s got available to him right now.\n\n“You’re going to see a lot of scholarship guys on that scout team,” Herman said. “That’s a pretty big indication where you stand as of now.”\n\nAs key Longhorns get back on the practice field from injury, the result could be that some capable reserves will have to spend the first week of the season running Maryland’s offense and defense.\n\nPositions like running back, where Texas should have a full complement of players now that Chris Warren III, Tristian Houston and Kirk Johnson are healthy (there’s still no specific timetable on when Kyle Porter will return from his shoulder injury), will be a spot where someone worthy of getting carries in a game for the Longhorns has to mimic Maryland’s talented backfield tandem of Lorenzo Harrison and Ty Johnson. The same goes for wide receiver, where the Longhorns appear to be as deep as 10 wideouts who could be in a position to take meaningful snaps against the Terrapins.\n\nThe secondary could also feature some scholarship scout team members with Brandon Jones (neck), John Bonney (knee), Josh Thompson (lower leg strain) and Davante Davis (dehydration) all having returned to the practice field on Monday. The offensive line, linebacker and tight end are position groups for the Longhorns where players are still fighting it out for playing time, making this week a critical one for players on the two-deep bubble.\n\nShould a player find themselves on the scout team after this week, Herman said Monday, it’s not the end of the world.\n\n“It’s certainly no reason to give up,” Herman said. “We’ve had guys go from scout team to starters in a couple of weeks and perform well.”\n\nWant free VIP access to Horns247?

  "latent_20557": "Donald Trump and John Kelly. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump on Friday replaced White House chief of staff Reince Priebus with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\n\"I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff,\" Trump wrote in the first of two tweets just before 5 p.m. ET. \"He is a Great American and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration.\"\n\nIn a third tweet, Trump thanked Priebus \"for his service and dedication to his country.\"\n\n\"We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!\" Trump said.\n\nCNN reported that Priebus offered Trump his resignation on Thursday.\n\nPriebus released the following statement on Friday:\n\n\"It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this President and our country. I want to thank the President for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the President's agenda and policies. I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success.\"\n\nTrump told reporters more about the move as he returned from Long Island after giving a speech there Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Reince is a good man,\" Trump told pool reporters after he got off Air Force One. \"John Kelly will do a fantastic job. General Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. He's a great, great American.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Kelly \"one of the true stars of the administration\" who \"has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by 70%.\"\n\n\"He is respected by everyone, especially the people at the Department of Homeland Security,\" she said. \"The entire administration loves him, and no one is comparable. He will begin on Monday morning and a Cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in Monday morning.\"\n\nSanders said Trump thanked Priebus for his service.\n\n\"They accomplished a lot together,\" she continued. \"He was loyal in his dedication to the president. The president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the Trump team.\"\n\nSanders told reporters that conversations about the shakeup started between Trump and Priebus about two weeks ago.\n\nThe episode marked the end of a weeklong saga involving Priebus and new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Priebus had worked hard to block Scaramucci's appointment, but Trump decided to hire him anyway. Sanders denied that Priebus' resignation had to do with Scaramucci.\n\nImmediately after Scaramucci's hiring, White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced he was resigning. Spicer was Priebus' closest White House ally based on both of their past work for the Republican National Committee. (Spicer was the chief strategist and communications director, while Priebus was the chairman.)\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that Priebus was pushed out as Trump became convinced he was not strong enough for the role. Trump had discussed bringing in \"a general\" to lead his administration, according to The Times, and selected Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general whose work leading the Department of Homeland Security has pleased the president.\n\nBut Kelly's appointment leaves a gap at the Department of Homeland Security, and his successor will have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPriebus joined Trump on his trip to Long Island, where he gave a speech focused on his administration's efforts to fight the MS-13 street gang. Also on the flight was also Scaramucci, who had savaged Priebus in a New Yorker interview published less than a day earlier.\n\nIn that interview, Scaramucci called Priebus a \"f------ paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac\" and said the chief of staff would be resigning soon.\n\nScaramucci became incensed at Priebus on Wednesday after a Politico report detailed Scaramucci's financial disclosures, which was publicly available from Scaramucci's stint at the Export-Import Bank. Scaramucci, who did not know that at the time, said in a now-deleted tweet that the report was illegally leaked and that he would contact the FBI and the Justice Department. He also tagged Priebus and wrote \"#swamp.\"\n\nScaramucci called The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza that day because he was angered by one of the reporter's tweets, which cited a \"senior White House official\" who said Scaramucci was having dinner at the White House with the president, first lady Melania Trump, former Fox News executive Bill Shine, and Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn Thursday night, The Washington Post reported that Scaramucci and his allies were compiling a diagram of news outlets to which they believed Priebus leaked information, citing a White House official. They planned to present their findings to Trump on Friday, the official told The Post.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan — a fellow Wisconsinite and close ally — released a statement on Priebus' departure shortly after it was announced.\n\n\"Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country,\" Ryan said. \"Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who revitalized the Republican National Committee and became White House chief of staff. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.\"\n\nRyan congratulated Kelly and said he looked forward to working with him.",

  "latent_20622": "Hackers posted names, e-mail addresses, message histories, and partially protected login credentials for more than 158,000 forum users of Boxee.tv, the Web-based television service that was acquired by Samsung last year, researchers said.\n\nThe breach occurred no later than last week, when a full copy of the purloined forum data became widely available, Scott A. McIntyre, a security researcher in Australia, told Ars. On Tuesday, officials from password management service LastPass began warning customers with e-mail addresses included in an 800 megabyte file that's still circulating online. The file contains personal data associated with 158,128 user accounts, about 172,000 e-mail addresses, and the cryptographically scrambled passwords that corresponded to those Boxee accounts, LastPass said. The dump also included a wealth of other details, such as user birth dates, IP addresses, site activity, full message histories, and password changes. All user messages sent through the service were included as part of the leak.\n\nAs Ars has explained before, even when passwords in hacked databases have been cryptographically hashed, most remain highly susceptible to cracking attacks that can reveal the plain-text characters required to access the account . The damage can be especially severe when people use the same or similar passwords to protect accounts on multiple sites, an extremely common practice.\n\n\"Please update the password for your boxee.tv account immediately,\" stated an e-mail LastPass sent to customers. \"The LastPass Security Challenge, located in the Tools menu of the LastPass addon, will help find any other accounts using the same password as the leaked account.\"\n\nThe compromised data appears to cover only user data associated with Boxee.tv forums, not service accounts, McIntyre said. Boxee has issued no statement on the breech, and Ars has so far been unable to confirm with the company precisely which accounts are compromised. Have I been Pwned?, a reputable and secure service operated by Australian researcher Troy Hunt, has incorporated the dumped Boxee user data into its growing database. People who want to know if their personal data has been exposed online should check with this service. Ars readers who can provide clarification about precisely what Boxee accounts are and are not included in the dump are invited to do so in the comments section.\n\nMcIntyre said he acquired a copy of the enormous MySQL database last week and found entries known to belong to some of his company's clients in it. In addition to being further confirmed by Hunt and LastPass, the breach has also been documented here by the Risk Based Security blog. Curiously, the blog post included a screen shot claiming one of the compromised users was Brian Krebs, an investigative reporter covering security, hacking, and Internet crime. According to both McIntyre and a query on Have I Been Pwned?, Krebs' name and e-mail address aren't included in the leaked MySQL file. Still, the screenshot is evidence of a security breach affecting the Boxee.tv forums.",

  "latent_20733": "SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CanniMed Therapeutics Inc. (“CanniMed” or the “Company”) (TSX: CMED) today announced that, in response to the unsolicited, opportunistic offer by Aurora Cannabis Inc. acknowledged in our press release issued on November 24, 2017 (the “Hostile Bid”), the Board of Directors of CanniMed (the “Board”) has adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to ensure that all shareholders are fairly treated, well informed and not subject to coercive bids.\n\nThe Plan prevents Aurora from acquiring any CanniMed shares other than those tendered to its Hostile Bid or from entering into any lock-up agreements in respect of its Hostile Bid other than those it has already entered into and filed on SEDAR (the “Current Lock-up Agreements”) in order to (i) encourage fair treatment of the shareholders of the Company in connection with any other potential acquisition transaction of the Company, (ii) ensure that CMED shareholders have the opportunity to vote on the previously announced acquisition of Newstrike Resources Ltd. (“Newstrike”) by the Company, and (iii) ensure that shareholders are not coerced into tendering to the Hostile Bid.\n\nThe Plan is not intended to deter the Hostile Bid or any other bid, and as described below, the Hostile Bid is deemed to be a “Permitted Bid” under the Plan, and the Current Lock-up Agreements are deemed to be Permitted Lock-up Agreements under the Plan, even though they would not otherwise meet the typical requirements of being a Permitted Lock-up Agreement.\n\nWe remind shareholders to take no action with respect to the Hostile Bid until such time as the Board can make a recommendation.\n\nAs previously disclosed, CanniMed has formed a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to consider the Hostile Bid. The Special Committee is reviewing the Hostile Bid, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, and will respond in due course. The Special Committee unanimously recommended to the Board that it approve the Plan.\n\nThe Company is very concerned that by secretly obtaining lock-up agreements from four of CanniMed’s shareholders, Aurora may be depriving shareholders of their ability to vote in respect of the Newstrike deal or may coerce them to accept the Hostile Bid. By adopting the Plan, the Company hopes to ensure that shareholders are afforded the opportunity to make an informed decision when deciding how to vote for the Newstrike deal and whether to tender to the Hostile Bid, among other things.\n\nPermitted Bid and Permitted Lock-up Agreement\n\nA Permitted Bid under the Plan is a take-over bid that, among other things: is made to all Shareholders; is made in compliance with applicable securities laws, including the requirement that it remain open for acceptance by shareholders for a minimum of 105 days; is supported by a majority of shareholders other than the bidder (and its affiliates, associates and joint actors), and in the event that the minimum tender condition is satisfied, the offeror must publicly announce such fact and keep the bid open for at least a further 10 business days and must allow shares to be deposited or withdrawn at any time until the offeror takes and up and pays for shares under the bid.\n\nA Permitted Lock-up Agreement under the Plan is a lock-up agreement that, among other things, is approved by the Board. The Current Lock-up Agreements are deemed to be Permitted Lock-up Agreements provided that after the date hereof they are not amended or modified without the approval of the Board and provided further that no additional shares are made subject to such agreements.\n\nShare Purchase Rights\n\nIn connection with the adoption of the Plan, the Board authorized the issuance of one Share Purchase Right (a \"Right\") in respect of each outstanding common share of CanniMed as of the close of business on November 28, 2017 (and each common share issued thereafter, subject to the limitations set out in the Plan). Under the terms of the Plan, the Rights will become exercisable on the 10th trading day following the earliest of (the earliest of such time, the \"Separation Time\"): (i) the date that a person or the Company announced that a person became an Acquiring Person (as defined below), (ii) the date that a person commences or announces an intention to commence a take-over bid (other than a Permitted Bid), and (iii) the date that a Competing Bid (as defined in the Plan) or a Permitted Bid cease to qualify as such. The Separation Time is being deferred in respect of the Hostile Bid.\n\nA person becomes an Acquiring Person when it, together with its affiliates, associates and joint actors, acquires beneficial ownership of 20 per cent or more of the outstanding common shares of CanniMed, subject to the ability of the Board to waive the application of the Plan. Aurora is not considered an Acquiring Person as it is a Grandfathered Person under the Plan. Should Aurora purchase any CanniMed shares, enter into any new lock-up agreements or if the Current Lock-up Agreements cease to be Permitted Lock-up Agreements, Aurora will become an Acquiring Person and the Separation Time will occur.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of 20 per cent or more of the outstanding common shares of CanniMed by any person, each Right held by a person other than the acquiring person (and its affiliates, associates and joint actors) would, upon exercise, entitle the holder to purchase common shares of CanniMed at a substantial discount to their then prevailing market price.\n\nThe Plan is subject to the jurisdiction of the Toronto Stock Exchange and will terminate on the earlier of: (i) the date that is six months after the Plan's effective date (with extensions in the event of litigation), and (ii) the date that Rights are redeemed under the Plan.\n\nA more detailed summary of the Plan will be set out in CanniMed’s Material Change Report which will be filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and will be available at www.sedar.com. A full copy of the Plan will also be available at www.sedar.com.\n\nAdvisors\n\nKingsdale Advisors is acting as strategic shareholder and communications advisor. AltaCorp Capital Inc. is acting as financial advisor to the Board and Borden Ladner Gervais LLP is acting as legal advisor to the Board. Cormark Securities Inc. is acting as financial advisor to the Special Committee and Stikeman Elliott LLP is acting as legal advisor to the Special Committee.\n\nAbout CanniMed Therapeutics Inc.\n\nCanniMed is a Canadian-based, international plant biopharmaceutical company and a leader in the Canadian medical cannabis industry, with 16 years of pharmaceutical cannabis cultivation experience, state-of-the-art, GMP-compliant production process and world class research and development platforms with a wide range of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products.

  "latent_21376": "Last week NASA held a workshop in Houston to begin the long process of selecting a landing site for a future human mission to Mars. Ellen Ochoa, director of the Johnson Space Center, and John Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. opened the meeting, and from their remarks it was clear they believe the agency has both the technical ability and the motivation to take on such an ambitious project.\n\nEven though the launch is still about 20 years off, with the first Mars expedition planned for around 2035, the workshop represents a first official step. One of its objectives was to identify what robotic missions need to be sent, and what data need to be acquired, in order for the agency to choose a landing spot. A second goal was to identify what resources would be present at the proposed landing sites and how to obtain them.\n\nNASA officials showed preliminary mission scenarios, while emphasizing that human exploration of Mars is not planned as a single mission, but a series of three to five expeditions, each with a crew of four to six, lasting about 500 Martian days each. All would land in the same exploration zone, or EZ. The plan includes the construction of a surface field station to be located in the center of the exploration.\n\nThe crews will live off the land to the largest extent possible, and pressurized rovers would allow them to venture as far as 100 kilometers, or more than 60 miles, from their base for periods up to 14 Martian days. The astronauts will have to learn how to live and work on Mars for extended periods, and will be as independent logistically as possible.\n\nThe most important resource for the astronauts will be water, which can be used not only for life support, but also for radiation shielding, plant irrigation, and manufacturing of rocket propelland for the return trip to Earth.\n\nThe landing site within the exploration zone will have safety and operability restrictions. It should be located within 50 degrees north or south latitude of the equator to avoid extreme cold and maximize lighting. It also should be free of large boulders and steep slopes, and not prone to large dust storms.\n\nNearly 50 suggestions for possible exploration zones were presented at the meeting, and future workshops will be needed to whittle down the list. Some of the more remarkable locations were inside Valles Marineris, in Hebrus Valles (my own presentation), where the astronauts could make use of caves, and in Apollinaris sulci, which includes yardangs (keel-shaped crests or ridges of rock, formed by the action of the wind, usually parallel to the prevailing wind direction). Other suggestions included previous robotic landing sites such as Gale Crater or the Viking 1 landing site in Chryse Planitia.\n\nAll of the talks from the workshop are now online, and in this clip you can see a NASA animation of how the Mars surface station might look. The video will be updated based on results from the workshop.",
  "latent_21512": "llvmparse user manual\n\nTitle llvmparse Description LLVM assembly parsing standalone utilities Author Nikolaos Kavvadias 2012-2013 Copyright Nikolaos Kavvadias Contact nikos@nkavvadias.com Website http://www.nkavvadias.com Release Date 25 February 2013 Version 1.0.0 Rev. history v1.0.0 25-02-2013 First commercial release.\n\n1. Introduction llvmparse is a set of standalone parsers for the popular LLVM textual assembly format. This format is used as a human-readable representation of the LLVM IR (intermediate representation) which is used by the LLVM compiler (http://www.llvm.org). This version of llvmparse includes two standalone parsers: a flex/bison-based parser (compiled) and a TXL-based parser (interpreted) that are compatible with LLVM 3.1 and 3.2. TXL is a functional programming language that is commonly used for source-to-source transformation tasks (http://www.txl.ca). llvmparse will always be kept up-to-date with the latest official LLVM release.\n\n2. File listing The llvmparse distribution includes the files listed in the following table. There is a single release for llvmparse containing all source code, Windows (MinGW) binaries as well as Linux static binaries. /llvmparse Top-level directory build.sh clean-all.sh env-lin.sh env-win.sh test-all.sh Automated build script. Clean the generated debris files in /tests. Script for setting up the environment on Linux. Script for setting up the environment on Windows. Exercise all test cases found in /tests. /bin/lin Linux executable directory llvmparse.exe Static executable of the flex/bison-based parser for Linux platforms. /bin/win Windows executable directory llvmparse.exe Static executable of the flex/bison-based parser for Windows platforms. /doc Documentation directory AUTHORS LICENSE LLVMOSL.TXT README README.html README.pdf VERSION List of authors. End-user license agreement. The LLVM source code open-source license. This file. HTML version of README. PDF version of README. Current version of mprfgen. /src Source code directory Makefile llvm.Grm llvm.l llvm.y llvmparse.Txl llvmparse.c Makefile for building the flex/bison-based parser. TXL grammar for the LLVM assembly format. Flex/lex scanner for the LLVM assembly format. Bison/yacc grammar for the LLVM assembly format. Driver TXL program for the TXL-based parser. Driver C program for the flex/bison-based parser. /tests Directory for testing llvmparse *.c *.ll ANSI/ISO C source for a test case. LLVM textual assembly files generated by clang-3.2 (not included).\n\n3. llvmparse setup For using llvmparse, this distribution comes with ready-made native executables for Windows and Linux, which can be found in the corresponding /bin/exedir directory, where exedir is lin for Linux or win for Windows. In order to build llvmparse from source on your platform, just run the build.sh bash script from the command prompt. Cygwin or MinGW are suggested as POSIX emulation environments on Windows. First, change to the appropriate directory, for instance: cd /home/user/llvmparse/ assuming llvmparse was installed inside /home/user . A few environmental variables should be set and for this purpose the env-*.sh scripts can be used. For instance, a Windows installation requires the following: $ ./env-win.sh The llvmparse distribution can be built from sources by using: $ ./build.sh\n\n4. llvmparse usage The llvmparse parsers can be invoked as shown in the test-all.sh script. However, for exercising a single test case, this can be accomplished using the flex/bison-based parser as follows: $ cd $LLVMPARSE_PATH $ ./bin/llvmparse.exe fibo.ll >& fibo.txt which parses the test program fibo.ll with llvmparse.exe and stores the parsed program to fibo.txt . For using the TXL-based parser, it is suggested that the txl interpreter is visible. Usually txl is installed in the /usr/local/bin path in Linux and Cygwin/Windows systems. For MinGW/Windows systems, it is suggested that the Windows port of TXL is used. For instance, TXL 10.6 can be installed to /c/Txl106/ . The env-*.sh scripts can be used to set the appropriate value for the TXL_PATH environment variable. An example invocation of the TXL-based parser is as follows: $ $TXL_PATH/bin/txl -q -raw -o $fibo.txt $LLVMPARSE_PATH/src/llvmparse.Txl fibo.ll\n\n5. Running the test suite The test suite that accompanies llvmparse can be found in the /test subdirectory. It consists of C source code and the generated LLVM textual assembly files, which use the .ll suffix.

  "latent_21639": "Fedora 27 Atomic Host became available at the same time as Fedora 27, and we’ve included a bunch of changes and features to make it an even better platform for your container cloud. Highlights of this version include multi-architecture support, containerized Kubernetes, Workstation, a single OverlayFS volume by default, and new OSTree layering capabilities.\n\nMulti-Architecture Support\n\nThanks to tremendous efforts across the Fedora project, Fedora 27 Atomic Host is available for 64-bit ARM and Power8 processor architectures as well as 64-bit Intel (i.e. AArch64, ppc64le and x86_64). Not only are we distributing ISOs and cloud images for all three architectures, we will also be providing two-week OSTree updates for them as well.\n\nOur project has seen strong demand for multiple architectures for a while, particularly from people working on Internet of Things (IoT) projects, who want Atomic Host’s update and rollback capabilities. We’re happy to be able to finally satisfy these users. Sinny Kumari, who worked on the multi-arch support, explains more about it.\n\nContainerized Kubernetes\n\nAs planned, the Kubernetes binaries have been removed from the base image for Atomic Host. This change both shrinks the base image size, and allows users to install the container orchestration platform and version of their choice, whether it’s Kubernetes, OpenShift, or something else.\n\nUsers will now need to install Kubernetes using package layering, or, preferably, as system containers. To support this, the Fedora Layered Image Build System (FLIBS) repository now includes supported system container images for Kubernetes, etcd, and flannel. If you’re upgrading from Fedora 26 Atomic Host, Jason Brooks explains how to upgrade Kubernetes.\n\nAtomic Workstation Updates\n\nFor over a year, Fedora contributors have been experimenting with an RPM-OStree build of Fedora Workstation, with all of their applications running in containers or Flatpaks. This spin is informally known as “Atomic Workstation.” We are now expanding that experiment, by offering regular automated updates to the Atomic Workstation image and OStree refs, starting with Fedora 27. While not yet ready for most users, Atomic Workstation offers benefits, such as rollback, to developers who want to test the latest builds of Fedora.\n\nOne Big OverlayFS2 Volume\n\nHaving tested OverlayFS2 through the Fedora 26 cycle, we are now committing to it. New Atomic Host systems will now get a single filesystem volume by default, which will share binaries, system containers, and OCI/docker containers using OverlayFS2. This change will make installation simpler for new users, as well as being appropriate for small public cloud instances. It’s also consistent with the defaults on other Fedora Editions. Users who need to partition container images and storage onto separate volumes can still do so, using kickstart options and container-storage-setup configuration.\n\nMore OSTree Package Layering\n\nIn the biweekly Atomic Host updates, we’ve tested out some additional capabilities for RPM-OSTree that give administrators more flexibility in how to add software to hosts. First, remove and replace overrides allow system owners to experiment with changes to the software mix on their host image, including replacing existing binaries with different versions. Second, LiveFS layering eliminates the need to reboot when the only RPM-OSTree change a user makes is adding software.\n\nUpgrading and Support Policy\n\nWith the release of Fedora 27 Atomic Host, updates to the Fedora 26 Atomic Host will be strictly on a best-effort basis. As such, we strongly encourage users to upgrade to the new release soon. Upgrade instructions are on the Project Atomic blog.\n\nThe Fedora team is proud of the new release, and hopes that you will find it more powerful and easier to use. Download it and try it out soon.",

  "latent_21702": "This week another massive beaching of walruses in the Alaskan Arctic. I did video on this a few years ago that is still relevant. The science denial media would like images of suffering animals to just go away, and for you to stop thinking about it all the time, dammit.\n\nMedia Matters:\n\nThe Daily Caller tried to “debunk” the “myth” that a recent mass walrus beaching is connected to global warming, even though scientists say the walruses have crowded onshore because they cannot find a resting place on Arctic sea ice, which has declined significantly as the Earth warms.\n\nAn October 1 Daily Caller article titled “Myth Debunked: Arctic Walrus Beachings Are Nothing New” promoted zoologist Susan Crockford’s claims that a recent massive beaching of around 35,000 walruses on a single Alaskan shore has nothing to do with climate change. To support her claim, Crockford cherry-picked two instances of walrus beachings from the 1970s.\n\nHowever, Biologist Anatoly Kochnev of Russia’s Pacific Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography told NBC News that extended beachings of this size only began occurring in the late 1990s, adding: “The reason is global warming.” Vox.com’s Brad Plumer further reported that this “appears to be the largest ever observed in northern Alaska, though NOAA is still trying to verify the exact numbers.” The current beaching is so vast that the Federal Aviation Authority is re-routing flights in order to avoid setting off a stampede.\n\nIn six of the past eight years, all of the floating sea ice in the Chukchi Sea (the region of the Arctic near the current haul-out) that walruses need to rest in between swims has completely melted away by mid-September, according to Chadwick Jay, head of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Pacific walrus program.\n\nIn the Daily Caller article, Crockford even noted that mass walrus beachings occurred in 2009, 2011 and 2014, but dismissed them simply because they “did not coincide with the lowest levels of Arctic summer sea ice” in 2007 and 2012.\n\nHowever, every one of these years had much less Arctic sea ice than the historical average, contributing to the extended beachings.",

  "latent_21859": "Colorado residents who buy their health insurance themselves will pay 20 percent more on average next year, and, for the first time, residents in 14 counties will have the choice of only one carrier offering plans in their area via the state health insurance exchange.\n\nThe increases are the largest in Colorado since the 2014 launch of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In some parts of rural Colorado, premium increases will top 40 percent, according to figures approved Tuesday by the Colorado Division of Insurance. However, tax credits for low-income residents will help blunt the impact of some of those increases, with consumers who currently receive the credits in line to see an average decrease of 11 percent in their premiums.\n\nThe finalized numbers confirm the worries that began in June when the steep increases were first proposed. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, blamed the increases on President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, which led to the creation of the exchanges.\n\n“The people of Colorado can’t afford Obamacare,” Gardner said. “Obamacare can’t keep its promises.”\n\nMarguerite Salazar, Colorado’s insurance commissioner, said the increases are the result of rising health care costs overall. The increases for people who buy their plans on the state’s Obamacare exchange and those who buy insurance off of it will be roughly the same.\n\n““Health care costs are increasing across the country, and those costs push up premiums,” Salazar said in a statement.\n\nBut Colorado’s increases in 2017 could be worse than those nationally. An analysis done this summer by the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at potential rate increases in 16 major cities, including Denver, and projected that the average increase of plans in the most popular tier of the Obamacare exchanges would be 9 percent in those cities.\n\nThe figures released Tuesday are only for individual health care plans that people buy independently. About 450,000 Coloradans — or 7.7 percent of the state — fall into the category.\n\nAt least 51 percent of Coloradans receive health care coverage through their employers. The numbers released Tuesday don’t predict price changes in plans for large employers, which are harder to track. Premiums for small-company plans in the state will increase by about 2 percent, according to the Division of Insurance.\n\n“The small group market seems to be stable, with more carriers participating and modest price increases,” the Colorado Health Institute stated in an analysis published online Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut, the institute concluded, the large increases in the individual market reflect the continued upheaval in that corner of the health insurance industry. Two insurers — UnitedHealthcare and Humana Insurance —- won’t offer plans on the state’s Connect for Health Colorado insurance exchange in 2017. Another, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, won’t offer preferred provider organization — or PPO — plans. And yet another, Rocky Mountain Health Plans, has shrunk its individual-plan business to just Mesa County.\n\nThe changes mean that 92,000 people — roughly one of every five consumers in Colorado’s individual market — will be shopping for a new plan when the open enrollment period begins Nov. 1.\n\nThe upheaval strikes particularly hard in rural Colorado. In 14 counties — all in western Colorado — residents will have only a single insurance carrier to choose from on the exchange, although that carrier might offer multiple plans. In 16 counties in southern and eastern Colorado, premium increases overall will average more than 40 percent, according to the Division of Insurance’s figures.\n\nThe Division of Insurance is charged with reviewing requests for premium increases filed by insurance companies. The division cannot dictate to the companies what the prices should be but can reject the proposed rates if they are too high or too low.\n\nA health care advocacy group, the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, criticized the process.\n\n“Because of the lack of transparency in some insurer’s filings,” Adam Fox, the initiative’s director of strategic engagement, said in a statement, “it’s hard to say how or if these significant rate increases have been justified.”",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nIn 2010, people cheered when Congress gave shareholders the right to vote on the pay of corporate CEOs. Too bad those nonbinding votes haven’t embarrassed the greed out of the chief executives. In fact, CEO pay crept up another 5 percent last year, once again far outstripping wage gains for middle-class workers.\n\nWhile some CEOs, such as GE’s Jeffrey Immelt, took a modest pay cut in 2011, many continued drawing outsized checks. Here we list 10 of the most egregiously overcompensated executives. They’re selected not just on the size of their pay packages, but how much more they were paid than their peers at similar companies, as well as the disparity between their personal fortunes and those of their employer. Collectively, they highlight the cozy relationships between today’s corporate boards and their chief executives. “You don’t suggest [corporate compensation] consultants who are Dobermans,” Warren Buffet, a critic of excessive CEO salaries, quipped in this YouTube clip. “You get cocker spaniels and make sure that their tails are wagging.”\n\nT imothy D. Cook, Apple\n\nCompensation: $378 million\n\nCorporate profits (2010-11): +85%\n\nStock gain/loss (2010-11): +34%\n\nBy far the nation’s highest paid CEO, Tim Cook earned more last year than the next four best-compensated CEOs combined. He raked in 378 million times the salary of his predecessor, Steve Jobs, whose 2010 pay was just $1. Apple could pay Jobs so little because it had given him stock options early in his tenure that exploded in value with the launch of its iPhones and tablets. The company clearly wants to replicate that approach with Cook, whose pay was mostly a one-time grant of $377 million in Apple shares. But even when averaged over their 10-year vesting period, those shares at current prices give Cook an annual take of $38 million, which is more than all but nine CEOs earned last year. “If Apple continues its growth at even more modest levels than it has in the past,” corporate governance consultant Paul Hodgson told Bloomberg, “then the award is going to far exceed anything we’ve ever seen.”\n\nDavid Simon, Simon Property Group\n\nCompensation: $137.2 million\n\nCorporate profits: +67%\n\nStock gain/loss: +33%\n\nSimon and Cook are the only two CEOs of publicly traded companies who occupy the exclusive nine-figure niche, but other than getting big lump payments in stock, they have little in common. Simon’s real estate investment trust earned just 4 percent of what Apple brought in last year, and it had smaller percentage gains in profits and stock price. Shareholders showed their displeasure at Simon Property Group’s annual meeting in May, voting nearly 3 to 1 to reject Simon’s pay deal. While the company responded that it would “take their views into consideration,” it did not pledge to renegotiate Simon’s pay.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav, Discovery Communications\n\nCompensation: $52.4 million\n\nCorporate profits: +80%\n\nStock gain/loss: -2%\n\nShares in the media conglomerate that owns Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel slid last year over fears of ad revenue declines and concerns that the internet and Netflix are decimating cable profits. Even so, Discovery gave Zaslav a 23 percent raise, making him second only to Leslie Moonves of CBS (a much larger company) as the nation’s highest-paid media executive. In May, Discovery Communications’ stock slipped again when the company booked losses on OWN, its joint venture with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nMichael S. Jeffries, Abercrombie & Fitch\n\nCompensation: $46.6 million\n\nCorporate profits: -16%\n\nStock gain/loss: -7%\n\nJeffries’ pay more than doubled last year even as Abercrombie shares took a tumble, dragged down by the preppy retailer’s poor performance in Japan, Canada, and Europe. He raked in more than four times as much as the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, a similarly sized retailer that logged a respectable 16 percent return on investment. Jeffries’ company has resorted to antics such accusing Jersey Shore star Michael “The Situation” Sorrentino of damaging the brand by donning Abercrombie shirts on television. A day after the company offered Sorrentino “substantial payment” not to wear its clothes, its stock plunged 9 percent.\n\nRupert Murdoch, News Corporation\n\nCompensation: $29.3 million\n\nCorporate profits: +18%\n\nStock gain/loss: +49%\n\nNews Corporation shares rose dramatically last year, but public confidence in the company that owns British tabloids, Fox News, and the Wall Street Journal plummeted. Starting last July, a series of investigations revealed that News Corp.’s tabloid, News of the World, had engaged in hacking private cellphones on a much wider scale than previously disclosed—and with the knowledge of senior News Corp. executives. The inquiries led to the shuttering of the tabloid, the resignation of Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton, and the arrest of three former high-level News of the World employees. Yet amid this imbroglio, News Corp. boosted Murdoch’s salary by 75 percent. In May, a British parliamentary committee released a report concluding that Murdoch had “exhibited willful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications” and was “not a fit person to exercise stewardship of a major company.”\n\nIan M. Cumming, Leucadia National\n\nCompensation: $29.3 million\n\nCorporate profits: -99%\n\nStock gain/loss: -21%\n\nA diversified holding company with interests ranging from mining to vacation rentals, Leucadia National is often described as a “mini Berkshire Hathaway.” But unlike Warren Buffet, a vocal critic of excessive CEO salaries, Cumming took a whopping 555 percent pay raise last year (mostly in stock options), even as shareholders lost their shirts. Cumming acts as both CEO and longtime chairman of the board—an easy formula for chumming it up with board members who serve on Leucadia’s compensation committee. Granting stock to execs is “not based on any specific formula,” notes the company’s proxy statement, “but rather on a subjective assessment of the executive’s level and performance.”\n\nGregory W. Cappelli, Apollo Group\n\nCompensation: $25.1 million\n\nCorporate profits: NA\n\nStock gain/loss: +10%\n\nCappelli’s pay shot up more than 1,400 percent last year, and it’s far from clear what he did to deserve $23.5 million in stock and stock options; shares in Apollo, which owns the for-profit University of Phoenix, were up just 10 percent last year, and Cappelli isn’t even the company’s sole CEO. (He splits the title with Charles B. Edelstein, who received an even bigger options grant in 2008.) Stock options are supposed to give CEOs an incentive to promote long-term growth, but that clearly hasn’t worked at Apollo. Since January 2008, it has underperformed the S&P 500 and most other education companies. In 2012, its stock is down 40 percent.\n\nLloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs\n\nCompensation: $16.2 million\n\nCorporate profits: -67%\n\nStock performance: -45%\n\nIf Goldman Sachs really is a vampire squid that bleeds the rest of the economy, then perhaps we should thank Blankfein for bleeding Goldman Sachs. In 2011, net income fell 67 percent at America’s most-despised investment bank and it announced plans to eliminate 1,000 employees—though it separately said it would hire 1,000 new ones overseas. In the midst of all this cost cutting, Blankfein took a 15 percent pay raise.\n\nJohn T. Chambers, Cisco Systems\n\nCompensation: $12.9 million\n\nCorporate profits: -16%\n\nStock performance: -30%\n\nChambers earned $6 million less last year than he did in 2010 (when he also made our most-overpaid list), but his $12.6 million take is no bargain for employees or shareholders. Beset by weak demand and stiff competition, Cisco lost 30 percent of its market value in 2011 even as it announced plans to cut 6,500 workers—the largest layoff in company history. Chambers isn’t exactly feeling their pain. Though Cisco’s shares have never recovered from their peak in 2007—when Chambers earned $11 million—his average annual salary has been 32 percent higher since then.\n\nRobert L. Antin, VCA Antech\n\nCompensation: $12.1 million\n\nCorporate profits: -13%\n\nStock performance: -15%\n\nNever heard of VCA Antech? You’re not alone. This provider of “pet healthcare services” had just $1.5 billion in sales last year—a drop in the bucket compared to, say, the profitable drugstore chain CVS, which nonetheless paid its CEO $100,000 less than Antin earned. Profits fell 13 percent at VCA Antech last year, but that didn’t dissuade the company’s board from giving Antin—who holds the triple title of chairman, president, and CEO—a 536 percent raise that included $10 million in stock and a $928,000 cash bonus. His package was opposed by a leading corporate governance consultancy and by his own shareholders—58 percent rejected it in a nonbinding “say on pay” vote.",

If there are disciplinary problems, the court system can just bump up the sentence to its full length.\n\nThe result: Turner's six-month sentence will very likely be a three-month sentence.\n\nWatch: 9 facts about violence against women everyone should know",
  "latent_22293": "To thoroughly enjoy the glory that is season seven of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay, please welcome Alison Leiby, who will be here every week to take us through the season.\n\nWelcome to the seventh season of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. I've always loved this show, but I felt like Screaming At Morons would make a much better title. I guess that could really be any show, though. For the premiere, Chef Gordon Ramsay takes us back to the most talked about restaurant owners in the show's history: Amy and Samy Bouzaglo of Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale, AZ. You might remember them as the delusional maniacs who yelled at patrons, served frozen pasta, and ultimately had been on the crazy train for far too many stops, even by reality TV standards.\n\nThis is a special episode of Kitchen Nightmares, which we know because the show opens with Gordon Ramsay in a crisp suit walking around an empty restaurant that is lit to feel like the set of a Real Housewives reunion show with Ramsay as our gruff Andy Cohen. He explains that tonight we'll see bonus footage from his visit to Amy's, learn about the media firestorm, and watch an exclusive interview with Amy and Samy now.\n\nThroughout the episode there are interviews from the staff at BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Reddit. It's a real who's who of websites you go to for cat videos (which is not wholly irrelevant here considering Amy thinks her cats are her sons). When the producers were putting together this all-star roster of interviewees, what was the research plan? Did they just look at any twenty-something office-worker's pre-lunch Google history?\n\nTo get everyone up to speed, there's a quick recap of what happened on Ramsay's fateful visit to Amy's last April. This is basically a montage of Amy, Samy, and Ramsay having it out. There was more screaming going on here than at last call at a bachelorette party when no one can find Lindsay. Amy continually stands by the delusion that her food is good, and Samy claims, \"The customer is not always right.\" But being out of touch wasn't even their biggest problem. It was their ability to take criticism.\n\nAfter our brief revisit to last year, we're back to Ramsay in host mode. Hard to say if this is a reality show interlude or a very polished PSA about staying out of the sun, but either way, I'm paying attention. We turn now to the ensuing internet firestorm (I know I'm using this word again, but keep in mind that I'm using it about 1/25th as much as the show did, so relax). I wish that BuzzFeed had been in its current form back when this shitshow happened so I could take a \"What Poorly Prepared Food Item From Amy's Baking Company Are You?\" quiz.\n\nTo combat the terrible press following the show, Amy and Samy did what any normal adults would do and took to posting aggressive, caps-lock style Facebook statuses. They called people losers and morons and idiots and slammed everyone who tries to say anything remotely negative about them. And then, a month later they took down all of the posts and claimed that they were hacked, which is just the modern equivalent of when your mom finds a joint in your pocket while doing your laundry and you're like, \"I was just holding that for a friend.\"\n\nNow to one of the bonus scenes they didn't get to show the first time around. Ramsay is in the kitchen with Amy while she's cooking and he's asking her questions about her staff, specifically why she doesn't have any male cooks working in her kitchen. She claims that with such a small kitchen, she's always bumping into people, and if there were men around that could get uncomfortable. Then Samy comes in to weigh in on the subject and more or less tells us that women belong in the kitchen, so that's that.\n\nIn all of the scenes when Ramsay is talking to Amy in the kitchen, she moves around with a mix of manic and calm that only the craziest of serial killers possess. She is firing off delusional opinions and defenses without even breaking eye contact or taking a breath, all the while shoving food into a giant oven or chopping something up with a knife. I could see her just as easily dicing up a person and shoving them down a garbage chute with the same smoothness and precision, all while continuing a heated discussion of her business or her cats.\n\nAfter these bizarre trips down memory lane, Ramsay reminds us that Amy and Samy ASKED for his help. They requested his service. And he proves this by showing their submission tape. It was, in a word, perfect.\n\nIt opens with Amy saying, \"This is where the magic happens,\" and ends with some confused screaming. Most of the video is Amy talking to the camera in the dining room while business is still being conducted behind her in the restaurant. Also, she's wearing what I assume is all of the blush that Revlon has ever made, which, along with the rest of her makeup and what seems to be discount-priced plastic surgery, it feels like you're being talked to by a really arrogant blow-up doll.\n\nHer major issues are that Samy should not be in the front of house because he gets too nervous, and that they receive a lot of haters and trolls on the internet who bully them. Halfway through her explanation of why they need Ramsay to visit, we see Samy helping a customer at the cash register. And by helping I mean yelling at.\n\nAs Amy is summing up the problems of the restaurant, she's talking quickly, then turning around frantically, then losing it and yells, \"I have so many things going on back here I can't remember the questions you're asking!\" The video ends with Amy and Samy kissing each other, her joking that, \"He's crazy!\" and her meowing. Then the footage just ends and you're like, \"Wait a minute, what did I just watch?\"\n\nThe bonus footage they pepper throughout the episode mostly just drives home the point that these maniacs cannot handle criticism. Amy is constantly saying some version of, \"My food is good!\" which I'm sure is also something that she screams into a pillow every night before taking a handful of horse tranquilizers and slipping on a sleep mask.\n\nFinally, Kitchen Nightmares reporter Ana Garcia goes back to Amy's to talk to the owners and see what is happening there now (I had no idea they had their own reporters on staff, mostly because I don't assume there's a lot of breaking news in the \"fixing a restaurant\" reality show world, but apparently there is).\n\nAccording to restaurant staff, the day after the show aired Amy and Samy fired everyone, and then the next day they called them up again to do shifts. I've seen this before. I've been broken up with and then the next week gotten a \"u up?\" text. This is a move perfected by finance bros. Amy claims that if they could clone her three times and Samy three times they would have the perfect restaurant. When she said \"perfect\" I just thought, \"Oh, you're saying the word 'terrifying' wrong.\"\n\nWhen Ana Garcia arrives at Amy's, Samy is inside already yelling at someone even though there are no customers or staff in sight. When Ana asks if they have a few minutes to catch up, Amy yells, \"No!\" but Samy decides they can sit down and talk. Please note that any time I use the words \"talk\" or \"says\" or \"asks\" that what I really mean is \"screams.\" Samy off the bat demands money from Gordon Ramsay claiming they were set up, though halfway through the rant says that he wants to pay back the money Ramsay gave them. It's highly confusing.\n\nMeanwhile Amy is standing across the room talking on a cordless phone but then holding up a smartphone to what seems to be videoing what is going on. There are cameras on her taping her taping her husband talking to someone. If it weren't in Arizona I'd say it was some modern performance art trying to comment on the relationship between entertainment and self-reflection. But no, it's not that, it's just some crazy lady who makes undercooked pizza.\n\nAt last Amy and Samy sit down with Ana for a real catch up. They are both in black t-shirts and black pants, and with the decor of the dining room they seem more like assistants at a hair salon than restaurant owners. They tell Ana that the restaurant today has become a tourist destination more than anything else, or as Amy calls it, \"Disney World for the crazies.\" It's hard to follow anything she says though since she talks faster than a sorority girl after her first bathroom bump of cocaine.\n\nShe says that people come just to see if the food is as terrible or the people are as crazy as they were on the show, and that everyone discovers that the food is actually really good. Then she continues that many patrons are out to get them, and that one customer showed up, put a rubber cockroach on a plate, and then left without buying a cake. It's unclear if he bought anything else, though she seemed more upset about him not buying the cake than staging an infestation story.\n\nThe interview, and the show, closes with a long rant from Amy about how they are a model for other businesses and they need to stand up for themselves especially against the haters and the trolls and the eunuchs (her word, not mine). In a final long-winded rant she says, \"I would love to be a lady and control my language and not have Tourette's Syndrome but, I can't.\" By the end I'm sure she would have cried if her caked-on eyeliner and Botox hadn't already closed her tear ducts forever.\n\nThere's no word on what happened to Amy and Samy following this interview. I can only assume that they spent yet another day screaming at patrons, serving ill-prepared grocery store quality food, and then went home and climbed in their bed together, both yelling, \"Our food is good!\" as they drifted off to sleep.\n\n· All Kitchen Nightmares Coverage on Eater [-E-]\n\n· All Gordon Ramsay Coverage on Eater [-E-]\n\n· All Amy's Baking Company Coverage on Eater [-E-]\n\n· All TV Recaps on Eater [-E-]",

In some way it is an unfulfillable desire because it is boundless, yet it is possible to think it in “materialist” terms.\n\nCommunism as a Continuing Constituent Process | Toni Negri\n\nThe problem is understanding which behaviors, levels of organization, and capacities of expression the new proletariat has. Because, when we say “there is no solution except revolution,” we say something that is at this point banal. The problem is not knowing if it is necessary, but rather knowing how it is necessary and how it is possible.",

  "latent_22541": "Over the past month, the Saudi press has featured a number of highly unusual articles harshly critical of the antisemitic discourse in Arab and Muslim society, and calling to avoid its generalizations regarding the Jews. The articles argued that Koranic passages against the Jews only applied to specific groups during specific time periods, and should not be applied to Jews in general. They added that blind hatred of Jews everywhere has prevented Arabs and Muslims from learning the lessons of Jewish experience and advancement.\n\nIt should be mentioned that these articles came against the backdrop of a heated debate in Saudi Arabia over the issue of normalizing relations with Israel, which erupted after a July 2016 visit to Israel by a Saudi delegation headed by Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Anwar Eshki, chairman of the Middle East Center for Strategic and Legal Studies in Jeddah, and the publication of photos of the delegation with Israeli politicians. While Eshki claimed that he represented only himself and that \"official Saudi elements did not know of the meeting in advance, as it was of a personal nature\" and was the result of an invitation by the Palestinian Authority, he stressed that \"the kingdom does not prevent anyone from holding such visits.\" He also did not rule out indirect Israeli-Saudi intelligence cooperation as part of efforts to combat terrorism.[1]\n\nThe visit, which was seen as a Saudi step towards normalizing relations with Israel, sparked harsh criticism inside and outside the kingdom. Several hashtags attacking the visit were launched on social networks, including \"Saudis Against Normalization.\"[2] Likely as a response to the criticism, the Saudi Foreign Ministry distanced itself from Eshki, arguing that \"people like Anwar Eshki do not represent us, have no ties to any governmental elements, and do not reflect the positions of the Saudi government.\"[3]\n\nHowever, despite this statement, and despite the Saudi regime's denial that the visit heralded normalization with Israel, the publication of Saudi articles attacking antisemitic discourse specifically at this time is no coincidence, and is likely meant to lay the groundwork for public acceptance in the country of normalized relations with Israel.\n\nThe following are excerpts from articles in the Saudi press attacking antisemitic discourse:\n\nAnwar Eshki (center with striped tie) with Israeli Knesset members (Image: Haaretz.com, July 23, 2016)\n\nSaudi Columnist Al-Qahtani: The Koranic Depiction Of Jews Does Not Apply To All Jews\n\nSaudi columnist Siham Al-Qahtani rejected antisemitic generalizations regarding the nature of the Jews. She argued that Koranic descriptions of Jews - as killers of prophets, infidels, warmongers, and usurers - apply to a particular group that lived during a specific time period, and that the traditional view that blames disasters throughout history on Jewish plots stems from the helplessness of Arabs, who searched for scapegoats on whom to blame their own failures. Al-Qahtani added that she does believe in the existence of \"a Jewish plot against Arabs,\" but stressed that such a plot could not have been realized without Arab ignorance. She wrote: \"The [collective] memory of Arab culture continues to preserve the stereotypical image of Jews to this day. Some see this stereotype as the product of Koranic texts, [which depict the Jews] as killers of prophets, infidels, warmongers, and usurers. [However,] it is improper to blame the Koran for the creation of Jewish stereotypes. When the Koran depicts a certain people, it does so in accordance with [this people's] behavior and thought during a specific time period. This description is valid in the context of [those particular] circumstances and [that particular] behavior, and does not refer to a unique and permanent trait. Proof of this is [the fact] that, among the Jews [mentioned in the Koran], just as there are murderers and warmongers there are also prophets and righteous men. [Further proof is] the fact that Islam at the time permitted marriage between a Muslim man and a Jewish woman. If the 'Jewish race' possessed some unique and permanent flaw, then Islam would have banned such marriages in order to preserve the integrity and propriety of the Muslim man.\n\n\"As for [the question of] how circumstantial events became stereotypes, it is the result of the subjective assessment of ancient [Koranic] commentators who - whether intentionally or unintentionally - transformed those circumstances into unique and permanent traits, and thus established the stereotyped [perception of] the Jew in Arab memory. The influence of [these] early creators of religious philosophy was compounded by history, geography, and politics.\n\n\"In the [collective] memory of Arab cultural heritage, Jewish history is associated with a 'plot.' Behind every disaster in Arab history - from the days of 'the Saqifah Event'[4] to the assassination of [Third Caliph] 'Uthman bin 'Affan, to the fall of Islamic caliphates, to the occupation of Palestine - there are hidden Jewish hands! In this way, Arab fundamentalism regarding Arab-Jewish relations taught us to link [Jews to plots].\n\n\"In Arab memory this formula has become a defensive trick, used [by the Arabs] to absolve themselves of blame, paint themselves as victims, and avoid accountability and punishment. I do not reject [out of hand] the notion of 'a Jewish plot against the Arabs,' because I believe that such a plot does exist, but such plots could not have been realized without the ignorance of Arabs, their improper attitude, and the division in their ranks. The chief enemy of Arabs is Arabs [themselves].\"[5]\n\nSaudi Columnist Yasser Hijazi: We Must Abandon Hatred Of And Hostility Towards Jews\n\nColumnist Yasser Hijazi penned two articles calling to abandon hatred of and hostility towards Jews in Arab cultural and institutional discourse, which paints the Jew as a satanic figure. He even called on Arabs to take an active role in the fight against \"Judophobia\": \"Since my childhood, I - like other Arab children - was raised on hatred of and hostility towards Jews. The justification for this did not merely come down to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the claim that 'they occupied our land,' but rather that 'Jews are enemies of Arabs and of mankind; they possess all evil human traits, [and] they were created to be depraved, evil, lying, treacherous, deceiving, and to do anything that can harm humans in general, and Arab Muslims in particular'... Who is responsible for this generalization?... To what extent did this generalization rob the Arab mind of its ability to see things in a realistic perspective that does not blame [an entire] people for the sins of individuals or for historical episodes?...\n\n\"In school, on TV, in places where men and women congregate, and in Friday sermons, Jews were cursed and they and their descendants were maligned. Their religious description, according to human commentaries and interpretations, is 'those who have evoked [Allah's] anger.'[6] We never considered this generalization or realized the seriousness of holding an entire people responsible for the sins of all mankind. If we give it some serious thought, we discover that this perception means that the ultimate salvation for one people comes at the expense of another [who serves as] a scapegoat. This is because sins are pinned on the Jews, who are the scapegoats for all humanity. [The Jews] are equated to Satan in Arab Muslim culture, because Satan is a metaphysical figure, which requires a corporeal representation by something or someone. Thus, in the Arab and Islamic perspective, the Jew is the natural representation of this supernatural being [Satan].\n\n\"Religious education has been persistent in its racism and hatred, particularly towards Judaism and Jews. Unfortunately, national education was not free of religious and ethnic racism either. [Thus, it argued that] the holy [Jewish] book is fake; their religion is fake; their scholars and rabbis are corrupt and preach evil and plots; their rich are usurers; their poor are treacherous spies; and their scientists are murderers who invent and create all manner of methods of extermination. [Strangely,] no one has exposed this Jewish plot apart from the Muslim Arabs, who are gripped by these fears... Did this hatred have a reason prior to the occupation of Palestine? Do these distortions stem from the strong victor oppressing the weak loser? Was it the hatred of Arab Muslims towards religious and ethnic minorities that fostered these [distortions]?\n\n\"According to the Arab-Islamic view... the Jews will remain in hell forever, while the other nations have a chance to be pardoned by Allah. How can this kind of education be seen as proper civilized education within the framework of the perceptions and terminology of the contemporary world? How can it be seen as civilized education, when the source of authority for its standards regarding [different] sciences, histories, and cultures is the interpretation of ancient religious texts?...\n\n\"We can certainly find Israelis and Jews, as well as Jewish institutions, who stand for Palestinian rights and against Israel... but on the other hand, we cannot find an Arab who absolves the Jews - who are a people... like any other people - of all the inhumanly negative titles that have been applied to them, and no people on earth can be accused of what the Jews are accused of. Who [among us] demands to end Judophobia...? Who openly demands to treat the Jews like all other people, some of whom are good and some bad? Is there any Arab Islamic institution that defends Jews - with all their various sects and ethnic backgrounds - and works to end incitement against them and their marginalization due to their image as human embodiments of Satan?\n\n\"Who will begin to accept the humane notion of absolving people and their institutions of responsibility for a religious-historic struggle? Who will begin to recognize the errors [that have been made] regarding the rights of the other? Who will eliminate marginalization, racism, and selfishness from earthly considerations?... The world will never accept or tolerate the marginalization of people. We must eradicate the remnants of racism and religious ethnic struggles embedded in our cultural, religious, and institutional discourse. This will be a step on the path towards coexistence with the world, and will close a massive loophole that is exploited by Western extremism [against us]. Our only response to this [extremism] should be to distance ourselves from [this discourse] and instead export an official pluralistic civilized discourse; one that accepts the world, both in its interpretation of texts and its actions on the ground.\"[7]\n\nHijazi In Another Article: Changing Antisemitic Discourse Is A Step Towards Coexistence\n\nIn another article, Hijazi wrote that eliminating the antisemitic discourse was a step towards drying up the sources of terrorism as well as Western arguments against Islam: \"Just as we oppose the discourse of [Donald] Trump and Western and European racists like him, when they attribute terrorism to all Arab Muslims due to the actions of a minority of our people, thus we cannot attribute despicable traits to all members of [other] religions merely due to the existence of hostility and a struggle with some of them, or even with most of them, who deserve to face judgment before international criminal courts, such as the prime minister of Israel and his defense minister. Netanyahu does not represent Judaism... any more than [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi represents Islam...\n\n\"What do our curricula, satellite channels, and mosque pulpits say about the other/the Jew in general...? Do we even distinguish between a Jew and an Israeli?...\n\n\"We cannot struggle against a world that levels accusations against us, or change it, but we can change ourselves or at least begin to distance ourselves from these views that associate all followers of a [certain] religion with every [negative trait] that harms [their image] and their honor and humanity. The meaning [of this] is not normalization, softening [positions], or relinquishing negotiations to establish a Palestinian state within internationally-recognized borders... The two religions cannot resolve the conflict on the ground... The conflict is not between Islam and Judaism - even if our Israeli enemy seeks to present it as such - but rather between the [rightful] owners of the land and of the rights and occupiers and war criminals...\n\n\"Are we, or is any official Arab institution, able to abandon this generalizing discourse that besmirches the other...? [This should] start with eliminating any remnant of racism from any existing law, and from curricula, mosque sermons and pulpits, and [TV] channels... in order to eventually create a different discourse based on the principles of international relations and human rights... which will lead to a creative and professional discourse that speaks of the other/the Jew in a way that is devoid of racism; a way that respects his humanity and right to live without becoming a symbol of betrayal, evil, and deception.\n\n\"This is a step on the way to the coexistence we desire; a step [on the way] to drying out the sources of terrorism, if we so desire; a step on [the way] to restraining the European right and people like Trump, who feed their own racism with the racism spread by (popular) Arab and Islamic discourse under a religious guise, which the world no longer accepts or does not need to accept. The world will respect your culture if [this culture] is not hostile towards it.\"[8]\n\nSaudi Writer Ibrahim Al-Matroudi: We Should Benefit From The Jews' Experience And Successes\n\nOn July 21, 2016, in his column in the Al-Riyadh daily, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Matroudi called for overcoming the hostility towards the Jews and for benefiting from their experience and successes, even though they are enemies. He argued that, although it has been \"isolated and distanced from life,\" the Jewish nation has \"remained alive and alert, and has continued to build its future, and its sons have reached the top of the pyramid in science, philosophy, and economics.\" He wrote:\n\n\"...Hatred blinds and unbalances the individual. When he searches his memory, he finds only flaws and defects in his rival... Those who hate harvest bitter fruits, in the form of loss of the ability to learn from their rivals and to remember their virtues, and thus they lose man's most precious [asset] - [his] wisdom and [ability to] adapt to modern times, because anyone who does not benefit from his enemy in this world will ultimately be forced to leave it, to wallow on its margins, and to gaze nostalgically at the ruins of the past.\n\n\"The others whose experience I want to talk about, and whose modern history I want to look at, are the Jews... [Examining] our culture today, we find in it only curses and invective towards the Jews, reiteration of condemnation, and lists of bad things. I have never seen anyone talk about their experience in the new era, and their success in extricating themselves from a situation where the peoples harassed and persecuted them. I have never read about a Muslim urging us to change [our view of] the chronicles of this nation in the modern era and to get to know the methods that it has employed in order to escape its isolation, until it became, in the eyes of many of us, the nation that is leading the world through its institutions and forcing its will on it.\n\n\"Imagine that some of your people, once under your control, have, a few decades later, become world leaders. What would you think about that? Would you say, 'they are demons, they are devils' - or would you look at their way of life and examine their customs in order to learn how they got to where they are and became leaders, when they once lived as dhimmis, and [now they have] turned the nations of the world into their dhimmis, as many of us say?\n\n\"The warning by some American founding fathers about the Jews and letting them in to the U.S.[9] did not stop them from building their fame there. We envied them for this, and we interpreted it without amazement - which made us forget the efforts that they put into [it]. Due to this poor attitude, we did not think of learning from them, looking and investigating the reasons [they achieved this]. We linguists settled for amazement at their revival of their nearly extinct Hebrew language. We are astounded at how they created the [modern Hebrew] language, and, even more, at how they acquired a status that made the world act according to [their] will, not according to ours.\n\n\"This is a nation that nearly went extinct because its language went extinct, but nevertheless [managed to] preserve its heritage, values, and ideals. There is a connection between the extinction of a language and extinction of a nation. Later it was revived, arousing a distant hope in the hearts of its people. Don't we need to learn something and look closely at [this nation's] modern history?\"\n\nThe Jews Are More Astonishing Than The Japanese\n\nCriticizing the Arabs who had gone as far as Japan to learn from that country's experience and capability for advancement - instead of looking at the Jews who are closer both geographically and culturally - Al-Matroudi continued: \"The Jews in the modern era - not to mention in the past - have known harassment by all the countries of the world, that placed them in their own special neighborhoods [i.e. ghettoes]. The peoples strove to expel them, and to look for a permanent place for them to settle. This is a nation that was isolated and distanced from life, but that has remained alive and alert, and has continued to build its future, and its sons have reached the top of the pyramid in science, philosophy, and economics...\n\n\"If this is so, then why have the sons of this nation - even if they are our enemies - not been the subject of research [to investigate how they] extricated themselves from the dark tunnel where the world wanted them to remain? Why have we been preoccupied with the Japanese, while the Jews are closer to us? Their situation [was] like ours is now. It is more appropriate for us to look at their new history [than at the history of the Japanese], because they are our enemies, past and present...\n\n\"[The focus on the Japanese revival] has distanced us from the wonder of this Jewish nation, whose presence in the religious and cultural discourse frightens us. This is the nation that was considered our terrible enemy in the past and in the present, and therefore it is this [nation] that can arouse us from our slumber, for rivalry with what is near to you is top priority because its impact is greater. Can we open our eyes and see their path in this era?\n\n\"Can we be neutral and forget the enmity, so that we can benefit from the roadmap of the Jews, whose beginning was unfortunate but which ultimately turned [the Jews] into a nation that preoccupies us and frightens us all the time? One of the principles of wisdom is to be interested in the source of danger, and consider it important, so as to understand how this source of danger is created and how it became a disturbing nightmare. It will be possible to do this [with regard to the Jews] only if we show openness to the success of this nation, which, although a scattered minority, participated in shaping global public opinion until it became a model of capability to undermine every decision that does not strengthen its existence or its influence...\n\n\"The Jewish nation is more amazing and astonishing than the Japanese. It attained its fame by proper efforts, planning, and administration. The world today does not believe, as many of us like to, in the rule of religion, or in religion, but believes in its interests and in participating in shaping life. This is the logic of life that rules today, and the closer one clings to it, the more one's influence grows. The Jews' adherence to this logic made them succeed in building this fame that shocks us and arouses the envy of many of us. The world today does not give you anything unless you either pay for it or invest effort [to achieve it].\n\n\"The situation of the Jewish nation shames us more than [that of] any other nation. We ignore the fact that it lives well and advances, and that it participates in shaping global culture. Among ourselves, we talk about it, preoccupied with warning about its deeds, and about the evil and venom that it sows in global thought. And this is the habit of cowards, and their way of dealing with those who disagree with them everywhere...\n\n\"How have the Jews - when the world schemes against them - succeeded in extricating themselves from isolation and transforming themselves into a nation that [both] shames us the most and impacts us the most? How has this nation achieved what we cannot achieve, despite the great difference between us and them in everything - in numbers, in geographic area, and in national resources...[?]\"\n\nUnlike Arabs, Jews Understand The Logic And Spirit Of The Times\n\n\"The Jews are a competitive people, and life is a competition. The difference between us and them is not that the world loves their religion and hates ours, but rather [lies in] their understanding of the logic and spirit of the times versus our ignorance regarding the logic and spirit of the times - for we were led by a team of preachers who look at everything that occurs in the world through a religious prism and think of how to plot against it... Many preachers cannot comprehend that competition erupts between nations, not between religions.\n\n\"Our current situation will persist until a generation arises that acts like the other nations and benefits from the experience of others, rather than shies away from it; a generation where religion and faith do not prevent you from mingling with others and believing in them, and thinking positively about their ideas, visions, and theories; a generation that competes with other nations in their chief industry - the industry of life. Then many preachers will see other nations changing their view of us and will regret... the time they spent brainwashing people into thinking that those nations had a problem with our religion - a religion that is said to be the religion of human nature, mind, and logic...\"[10]\n\nEndnotes:",
  "latent_22654": "There are spoilers in this review.\n\nTLJ was the single biggest motion picture letdown of my life. Disney should have released this parody on April 1st. There are over 82,000 signatures on a change.org petition to remove TLJ from Star Wars\n\nThere are spoilers in this review.\n\nTLJ was the single biggest motion picture letdown of my life. Disney should have released this parody on April 1st. There are over 82,000 signatures on a change.org petition to remove TLJ from Star Wars canon as of 1/6/18. Disney won't do that, but that there is a petition at all conveys that something is wrong here. And something is. Aside from being a bad movie, TLJ refutes the values of Star Wars. Disney pretends complaints show how sophisticated TLJ is. Those dumb fans, they don't 'get it'. But last I checked, thin characterization, using characters simply as vehicles for action, inconsistency within a trilogy, and thinking ships need fuel in space to keep moving, were not signs of sophistication. The discrepancy with pro reviews may be explained by the fact that pros' publications receive Disney advertising dollars. I give TLJ a 1 for the actors. They are not to blame. But the writing is ruinous to the entire franchise.\n\nFirst, too much CGI, visually messy scenes. The movie had no idea what to do with Finn. The casino planet scene was filler. And how is it possible, after destroying Starkiller Base, that massive weapon, that the First Order seconds later has all but vanquished the Resistance? There's no gap between VII and VIII. (There was a gap of 3 years between ANH and The Empire Strikes Back.) So why is the First Order in such top form after such a huge defeat at the hands of the Resistance (now inexplicably called the Rebellion). It's like the Resistance's accomplishments of the last movie accomplished nothing at all. By the way, I'm not a bot. And I'm also not alt right or a Trump supporter. I'm white, married to a brown woman of African descent (she was not born in the USA and her first language is not English). We have a young daughter who loves BB8, R2D2, Rey, and light sabers. But that's based on TFA. We wouldn't allow her to watch TLJ any more than we'd let her watch Sesame Street themed porn.\n\nThe biggest problems with TLJ were Luke's characterization, the lack of characterization of Rey, and the anti-Star Wars theme which rendered this not Star Wars, but Mirror Universe Star Wars, or Bizarro Star Wars.\n\nRegarding Rey, if you think her TFA \"vision\" had meaning, or there was any rhyme or reason to Maz Kanata saying to Rey, \"Now it calls out to you\" (referring to Darth Vader's and Luke's light saber) you will be disappointed. IT IS ALL DROPPED. The identity of Rey's parents might have helped explain why she's so great at everything, but this was squandered. This is not a sequel, it is not act 2, it has almost nothing to do with TFA. Ep 2 continued Ep 1; 5 continued 4; but Ep 8 spits on Ep 7. The idea that Rey could beat Luke (trained by two Jedi masters) in a fight is ludicrous to the Nth degree, especially when you consider how much training Luke (not to mention Anakin) required. Luke lost his hand to Vader because, while he trained under Yoda, he left too early. He paid a price. Rey pays no price. She's perfect without education beyond a two minute meditation session. A protagonist so strong is not credible, and is boring because nothing can threaten her, thus no suspense. Johnson knows this; it's why the last act shifts and all but abandons Rey; there is no peril for Rey now that she's superwoman. He's left JJ with nothing for Ep. IX. As for Luke, this was anti-Luke. Luke was aware Vader had killed millions, yet in Return of the Jedi, refused to kill him. So Luke's instinct to kill Ben in TLJ wasn't in keeping with Luke's character. And would Luke abandon his cause, and his SISTER, for decades, to hide out? No. But if so, why did he leave a clue to his whereabouts for people to follow? He was searching for the first jedi temple why? No reason at all. Rian Johnson wasn't consistent with the original films or Force Awakens. TLJ is hermetically sealed off from and doesn't fit with the saga. It takes place in a separate universe. The statements throughout TLJ that heroism and sacrifice are not positive values, that there is no difference between good and bad, are anti-Star Wars. They also deny TFA, not to mention the intense sacrifices of Rogue One that made everyone's lives in TLJ possible. Bottom line. TLJ is creepy and nihilistic.\n\nBeing pro-women is great. But Poe sexist, when Mon Mothma led the Rebels for 4 movies and then Leia led them, is absurd. Making every man bumbling, evil, or arrogant is hard to miss. You don't have to tear men down in order to build women up. That is just what feminists are always publicly claiming they are NOT about. Finally, the dialogue has no personality. In TFA when Finn helps Rey on the Falcon just before Han shows up - has more personality than in all of TLJ. I just bought Thrawn book 1 for an alternative post-Episode VI saga that makes sense. Disney has the legal right to make canon but that's an empty right when there is no spirit behind it. I'll decide what I consider canon.\n\n…",

  "latent_22915": "Hello. I badgered John Bacon for an advance copy of his new book BRANDON'S LASTING LESSONS , and John said to me \"that is not the title of the book,\" and I said back to him \"yes it is,\" to which he said \"no it is not,\" and so forth and so on.\n\nSeveral hours later he agreed to provide me one if I would, just once, say that the book's title is in fact \"Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football .\" The previous sentence has discharged that obligation.\n\nAnyway, I tore through BRANDON'S LASTING LESSONS in a couple days. Bacon asked me what he should cut, and I said nothing, and then he said seriously, and I told him to restore various things that had already been cut. I am extremely unhelpful.\n\nI asked Bacon if we could run an excerpt. He said yes, but we had to wait for the people who pay money to have their window of exclusivity. I said well what else can we run, then, and we settled on a Gimmicky Top Five list of book revelations. This is that list. Bacon's got the text between the dashes.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n1. Dave Brandon was highly controversial as an AD candidate.\n\nMichigan had the luxury of choosing among three candidates who were experienced, successful Division I athletic directors with deep ties to Michigan. But President Coleman asked the committee to interview a fourth, less conventional candidate: Dave Brandon.\n\nBecause Coleman made it clear she wanted Brandon to be the next AD, one Regent asked why she didn’t just appoint him, but she insisted on having a search committee. The committee had trouble deciding who the most qualified candidate was, but not the least: Dave Brandon. More than one member of the search committee told more than one Regent that Brandon was the least impressive candidate on the list. Despite pushing back several times, the committee members finally acquiesced to Coleman’s wishes and picked Dave Brandon.\n\n2. The 2011 pursuit of Jim Harbaugh was half-hearted at best.\n\nAmong insiders, it’s debated even now if Brandon really wanted Harbaugh to become Michigan’s next head coach in 2011. “I do believe Dave wanted Harbaugh,” one member of Brandon’s leadership team told me, “but he wanted Jim on his terms.”\n\nBrandon waited six weeks after the Ohio State game to fire Rich Rodriguez, even though it would have benefitted almost everyone to make the decision sooner; he rarely contacted Harbaugh, and declined to visit Harbaugh in person—sending not Michigan’s highly paid search consultant Jed Hughes, either, but Hughes’s subordinate, a young man named Philip Murphy.\n\nAfter Harbaugh signed with the 49ers, his friend Todd Anson asked Harbaugh if he really had been interested in the Michigan job. Harbaugh paused, then replied, “ I just wasn’t feelin’ the love.”\n\nHackett and others would take the opposite approach in 2014, to bring Michigan’s prodigal son home.\n\n3. Will Hagerup and various other student athletes will vouch for Brandon forever.\n\nEndzone starts following punter Will Hagerup from his official visit, when he decided minutes before driving back to Wisconsin to go back to Schembechler Hall and commit to Michigan. “I wanted to be there so badly, that I knew I was never going to leave.” He proved it by refusing to transfer even after three violations of the team’s drug test, which entailed working a brutal summer job in a steel mill to help pay for a semester of school himself. He straightened himself out, and persuaded Brandon to give him a fourth chance.\n\nAt the 2014 Bust, he told the audience, “I want to thank Dave Brandon, a guy who has my lifelong respect and allegiance. He stuck his neck out for me multiple times and believed in me.”\n\nA majority of the football players and other student athletes supported Brandon, too, right to the end, not to mention top coaches like Red Berenson, Carol Hutchins and Bev Plocki.\n\n4. The student government leadership drove circles around Hunter Lochmann.\n\nOne day after they won the election in 2013, student government leaders Michael Proppe and Bobby Dishell started taking on the department’s General Admission seating policy for students. They put their education in statistics and public policy to good use, while pulling endless all-nighters, to prove empirically that General Admission was not only deeply unpopular, it didn’t achieve Brandon’s stated goals of getting students to the games, and on time. In fact, their surveys and analysis were more thorough and incisive than anyone else’s – including the department’s – and they handled themselves with more professional aplomb than most of the department officials in this story.\n\n“Look, I don’t know how to say this without sounding like a jerk,” Proppe told me, “but Hunter [Lochmann] and his group were not as sophisticated as we were about analyzing data. When I looked at this data for ten minutes on an Excel spreadsheet, I could figure out what the data really meant.”\n\nDuring two dramatic public meetings, the idealistic duo convinced the faculty and Regents their conclusions had far more merit than the department’s, which cost Brandon crucial support.\n\n5. Brandon sowed the seeds of his own destruction from day one.\n\nOver his four-year tenure, Brandon removed the safeguards protecting Michigan from a public relations disaster, one by one—usually by letting experience staffers go, from equipment managers to sports information directors—until Michigan was finally exposed during the 2014 Minnesota game. ENDZONE explains what really happened before, during and after the hit on Shane Morris – including a marathon meeting that stretched from 8 a.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Tuesday. The outcome created a national embarrassment – one that was far more a PR problem than a medical one.\n\nAbout twelve hours into the meeting, they called in former sports information director Dave Ablauf to the room. “I will not forget his answer,” one person in the meeting told me. “ ‘At this point, it doesn’t matter. You guys put a coach out there at noon, and you told him to keep telling them you were going to have a statement from Michigan officials as soon as he was done. That was seven hours ago.\n\n“’We’re going to get roasted on this. But given all that, you might as well tell the truth. Not that it will help much.’”\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nBacon says that \"[BRANDON'S LASTING LESSONS ] tells the story of how the University of Michigan’s fundamental values were tested during the Brandon Era, and how the students, lettermen, alumni and campus leaders started a grass-roots effort to restore them – and succeeded, against long odds.\" That's true. After 300 pages of facepalm the last bits of the book are actually quite inspiring, as the Michigan community comes together and vows not to screw it up this time.\n\nBONUS: Bacon has events coming up:\n\nAugust 29th, Chicago, 12 PM: Bacon talks Endzone and takes questions at the Diag Bar & Grill. Following Bacon's appearance a panel of lettermen will do a Q&A.\n\nSeptember 1st, Ann Arbor, 7 PM: Bacon has as presentation and Q&A at Rackham auditorium on Michigan's campus.\n\nHe's also got a half-dozen dates set up through the fall around the midwest. Someone's let him into a cathedral for one of them.\n\nI'll be at the Rackham one as a spectator. Say hi.\n\n[EDIT: The lettermen panel is taking place on August 27th at Rockit Bar in Chicago. The book event at the Diag Bar & Grill is set for August 29th.]",
  "latent_23012": "Welcome to another edition of the Stache’s Throwback Thursday posts where we take a look back in Mets history for something interesting to post on a Thursday.\n\nToday we once again go back to a year that as is gets further away it looks a heck of a lot better, 2008.\n\nThis time we go back to that year not for a story that happened on the field but a story that took place off the field and to be exact, on an airplane.\n\nFormer New York Post Mets beat writer Bart Hubbuch, now the lead NFL writer for the Post, tells us about how former Mets shortstop Jose Reyes and SNY broadcaster and Mets legend Keith Hernandez got into it on a flight during the 2008 season.\n\nJose Reyes and Keith Hernandez had to be separated on the Mets’ charter plane Sunday night after a tense confrontation over Hernandez’s critical comments about the All-Star shortstop. A team source described the situation aboard the plane as “very heated.” One player told The Post that he thought Reyes and the popular former Met – now an analyst for the club’s SNY TV network – were close to exchanging punches until others stepped in. Reyes said yesterday he was angry at Hernandez after numerous friends and relatives told him Hernandez accused the Mets of “babying” Reyes during the broadcast of Sunday’s 3-1 win over the Yankees at Shea Stadium. “He got his point [across] and I got mine,” Reyes, when asked to describe the confrontation, told The Post before he drove in three runs in the Mets’ 11-1 victory over the Cardinals last night. “I’m not too happy with the way he’s been talking.” According to one account, strongly denied by both Reyes and Hernandez, what set Reyes off during the flight was when Hernandez allegedly responded to Reyes’ concerns by saying: “I was just doing my job – you should do yours.” Hernandez’s “babying” comment was in response to Reyes throwing his glove to the ground moments after committing a throwing error in the seventh inning Sunday. Reyes said he threw his glove out of anger at himself and not in an effort to show up first baseman Carlos Delgado, who appeared to have a chance to catch the throw. “Well, he’s got to get over that,” Hernandez said at the time, according to one transcript of the broadcast. “Enough babying going on now. He’s a grown man. He’s been around a long enough time. Take off the kid gloves.”\n\nThey would go to deny that there was a “confrontation” and that is more of a conversation but Reyes was still mad about the situation after it all went down.\n\nReyes, however, made it clear to The Post that there is still simmering anger on his part toward the opinionated Hernandez. “I don’t know why in that situation he’s talking like that,” Reyes told The Post. “Like I said, I just [made] an error and I feel bad. I threw my glove down, but I [felt] bad because you’re not supposed to be giving extra outs to the other team.”\n\nIt seems as if the situation resolved itself over time as there was no other reports of confrontations that I could find between Reyes and Hernandez during Reyes remaining years with the Mets.\n\nReyes left the Mets as a free agent after the 2011 season to sign with the Miami Marlins before being traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in 2012 where he is currently playing.\n\nHernandez is still with SNY six years later and, in this writers opinion, has not exactly been shy about taking veiled shots at Reyes, especially since Reyes left the team.\n\nOf course in more recent times we have seen that Hernandez’s negative criticism of the hitting philosophy of now former Mets hitting coach Dave Hudgens upset Hudgens enough to mention it in interviews after being fired.\n\nEven in 2002, Keith was a lightning rod for criticism when Mike Piazza said that Hernandez, after saying the 2002 Mets quit on Bobby Valentine was “a clueless voice from the grave” and was “just trying to make a name for himself at our expense.”\n\nKeith Hernandez has never had a problem speaking his mind on just about anything at all. Of course in 2008 it got him into a reported altercation with Reyes.\n\nThen again based upon the fact Keith hasn’t changed much at all since that time means that basically no matter what he will continue to speak his mind and potentially upset Mets players and coaches for years and years to come.",
  "latent_23178": "Dumpster Diving Culture\n\nAnti-Consumerism Week Highlights Dumpster Diving\n\nFor those seeking to learn more about dumpster diving, a practical workshop is being held on Feb. 19 as part of Concordia’s Anti-Consumerism week. Photo Hélène Bauer\n\nDubbed a “popular hobby for the frugal,” dumpster diving can be an alternative to typical grocery shopping or coping with rising food prices.\n\n“It’s an activity, but it’s towards survival,” explained Loïc Freeman-Lavoie, a dumpster diver and member of the Concordia Food Coalition. “It can be fun, but one of the things we’re pressing is that this is not some ‘cool thing.’”\n\nCanadians waste $31 billion-worth of food annually, as of 2014, according to “Canada’s Annual Food Waste — $27 Billion Revisited,” a study done by Value Chain Management International Inc. This finding, is not only surprising, but is also a $4 billion increase from 2010.\n\nThis wasteful reality is blamed in part on the unrealistic consumer demands for aesthetically appealing food of high quality. It’s estimated that between 20 and 40 per cent of produce in North America doesn’t even make it to grocery store stands for not looking “nice enough.”\n\nMeanwhile, dumpster divers everywhere are breaking the myths around disposed food.\n\nFor Freeman-Lavoie, a seasoned scavenger, dumpster diving is a means to feed oneself.\n\n“A lot of this food is people’s way of existence,” he said. “It’s dangerous and harmful to call it a sport or a hobby, because it underestimates and undervalues [how] greatly important it is.”\n\nThat said, those seeking to rebel against societal consumerism may have the wrong idea about the political statement that comes along with dumpster diving.\n\n“A lot of people have this idea that dumpster diving is this radical activity,” Freeman-Lavoie said. “They often associate that with ‘fuck the man, I’m not buying food, I’m going to take it from the garbage instead!’ But by doing that, we’re dependant on this culture of abundance in waste through consumption.”\n\n“They often associate that with ‘fuck the man, I’m not buying food, I’m going to take it from the garbage instead!’” — Loïc Freeman-Lavoie, member of the Concordia Food Coalition.\n\nUltimately, dumpster diving is not radical: in this context, it still fits in with consumerist constructs of needing the waste to be present in order for the activity to manifest itself. It can be radical though, in the sense that by mitigating waste, dumpster diving serves to actively shift the attitudes and acceptance of recuperating things and diverting them away from waste, Freeman-Lavoie explained.\n\nNonetheless, thrifting for food can have advantages that run deeper than the basic notion of saving on your grocery bill—becoming sensitive to what is being wasted, having a more diverse diet and developing self-beliefs towards dealing with what’s available are among the many pros of the recycled food movement.\n\nOne of the biggest cons, Freeman-Lavoie said jokingly, is the absurd availability of bread and pastries—he claims to have developed quite the addiction to readily available treats.\n\nSome of the best tools for successful diving excursions include using intuition, good communication skills and memorizing the city’s garbage schedule. From there, aspiring divers can plan their trips accordingly.\n\nFreeman-Lavoie says that it can’t hurt to walk into a store and talk to a merchant—you may be able to strike up an arrangement, or even just find out why all of those seemingly delicious containers of hummus were thrown out.\n\nAnother Montrealer and dumpster diver, Emma Anders, spoke to the same note, mentioning times where building rapport with storeowners can have a great outcome.\n\n“Sometimes they’re super nice—they see you rustling through their dumpster and they will give you extra food,” she said.\n\nWhile it’s technically legal to go through garbage sitting in public domain, divers still have to be cautious. If caught digging through trash, some may perceive it as making a mess.\n\n“We need to keep a good relation between store owners and people that dive. If you make a mess, which some people do, it’s the merchants that have to clean it up,” Freeman-Lavoie said.\n\nBoth Freeman-Lavoie and Anders emphasized the importance of not leaving a behind a chaotic trail of garbage for other people to deal with. If a merchant fails to clean up garbage left behind by divers, they risk getting fined for it.\n\nOn another note, the results of a diver’s efforts are most definitely affected by the season and weather. Freeman-Lavoie says that the cold season can numb a diver’s senses, making it more difficult to decipher which food products or produce items are still good.\n\n“The summer is better for access to your senses, but in a lot of ways winter can be a preserver,” he said, adding that he’s less reluctant to pick up a container of yogurt due to the natural freezer that is Montreal in the winter.\n\nDumpster diving can also go beyond finding food products. Outside of electronic stores, Pharmaprix and even the streets can be home to many trashed treasures. For many city kids, childhood wasn’t complete without finding curbside keepers with one’s parents.\n\nBoth Freeman-Lavoie, and fellow diver Leh Deuling fondly recalled finding furniture.\n\n“I have memories with my mom of being at the dump and finding all these glass jars and being like ‘oh my god, score!’” Deuling said.\n\nFor those seeking to learn more about dumpster diving, Freeman-Lavoie and others will be facilitating a practical workshop on Feb. 19 as part of Concordia’s Anti-Consumerism week. The politics behind the phenomenon, the system of waste that exists, security and laws as well as the dos and don’ts of the activity are among the many topics attendees can look forward to.\n\nThe workshop’s discussion element will begin at 4 p.m. in the Hall Building, before participants will have the chance to put their newfound knowledge to work at Jean-Talon Market later in the evening at 7:45 p.m.\n\n“There’s a known dumpster culture there, so it’s a low-conflict area as well,” said Freeman-Lavoie, adding that dumpstering is low conflict in general, and that both workers and divers are accustomed to seeing each other.\n\n“There’s no rules, there’s no limits,” Anders said. “Anybody can do it.”\n\nBy commenting on this page you agree to the terms of our Comments Policy.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
  "latent_23219": "After winning their third consecutive series on Thursday with a decisive victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs (6-3) welcome the division rival Pittsburgh Pirates (3-6) into town.\n\nThe Cubbies sit a half game behind the Cincinnati Reds in the National League Central, while the Bucs sit tied for fourth place (so, technically, also tied in last place) with the St. Louis Cardinals, which is especially surprising because these two teams were the two expected to give the Cubs the most competition.\n\nThus, this series provides the Cubs with a valuable opportunity early on to push the Pirates further behind them (the Cubs could, at best, have a six game lead over Pittsburgh by Monday), making it significantly harder for any comeback later in 2017.\n\nCubs Preview\n\nThe Cubs have taken two of three in all three series this year (continuing at that rate for the entire season translates into a 108-54 year-end record, if you were curious), with all three coming down to a third game rubber match. After their brief three-game winning streak was cut short by the Dodgers on Wednesday, the Cubbies potentially began a new one by topping the National League West favorites, 4-0. Starting pitcher Brett Anderson went five strong innings, and Carl Edwards, Koji Uehara, and Wade Davis finished the combined shutout.\n\nThe Cubs’ pitching staff was absolutely dominant against the dynamic Dodgers lineup, allowing merely four runs in the three game set, and only two were earned. The best part? Every pitcher in the bullpen appeared in this series, and they collectively pitched ten innings with zero earned runs allowed. Seeing as how this pen was far and away the largest question mark entering this season, nothing could be more encouraging. Expect this mastery to continue, as the Pirates offense has been struggling, to say the least; entering play on Thursday, the Bucs ranked 28th in the MLB in runs scored, and their highest single game run total to this point is six.\n\nThe starters have also all looked great out of the gate, with the exception of Kyle Hendricks, who will open this weekend series. Hendricks went six innings against the Brewers in his first 2017 start, but gave up four earned runs on five hits and a walk. Not a bad stat line by any means, but also not the stat line we have become used to seeing from Kyle by any means. Facing an anemic Pirates offense could be what’s necessary to re-position Hendricks back into his newly found ace status.\n\nOffensively, the majority of the lineup regressed during their three game stretch against Los Angeles. After exploding while facing the Brewers, the Cubs managed only seven runs against the Dodgers. Kyle Schwarber, Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Addison Russell, Javier Baez, and Ben Zobrist are all batting under .250, and, despite some first-of-the-season homers from Rizzo and Russell on Thursday, only five Cubs have homered to this point. On the flip side, Albert Almora, Jr. (who showed some absolutely stellar defense on Thursday – seriously, this guy is really really good in center) is still hitting an even .500 and has an OPS of 1.155. Jason Heyward has remained solid through a pitching-dominated series, and is still (can you believe it?) hitting .290.\n\nPirates Preview\n\nThe Cubs have been consistently good and the Pirates have been anything but. They’ve been swept in two of their three series this year (against the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds) and have obtained all three of their wins from the worst team in the National League, the Atlanta Braves.\n\nDavid Freese is the only starter hitting above .300 for the struggling Pirates offense, but the majority are still contributing. Former all-star Andrew McCutchen, who had an underwhelming 2016 season, is hitting a mere .250, but other everyday starters, namely Gregory Polanco, Starling Marte, and Josh Harrison, are all hitting .259 or above.\n\nThe Pirates’ pitching hasn’t been much better than their hitting. Entering Thursday’s games, they owned the MLB’s 25th best ERA, at 4.84. Three of their four starters have sub-3.00 ERAs, but two, Gerrit Cole and Tyler Glasnow, have struggled. The majority of the blame lies in their bullpen, which has managed to rack up a 5.68 ERA through their first nine games. Opponents are hitting almost .300 off of the group as well. Both of the aforementioned struggling starters will be forced to oppose the powerful Cubs offense, but when the young Jameson Taillon, who sports a 1.38 ERA, steps on the mound for Sunday’s game, Pittsburgh’s bullpen may be put in an important spot.\n\nGame Times, Where to Watch/Listen\n\nFriday, April 14 1:20 PM CST / TV – WGN / Radio – AM 670 The Score\n\nSaturday, April 15 1:20 PM CST / TV – CSN-Chicago / Radio – AM 670 The Score\n\nSunday, April 16 1:20 PM CST / TV – WGN / Radio – AM 670 The Score\n\nPitching Probables\n\nFriday\n\nRHP Kyle Hendricks (1-0, 6.00 ERA) vs. RHP Gerrit Cole (0-1, 6.55 ERA)\n\nSaturday\n\nRHP Jake Arrieta (2-0, 2.08 ERA) vs. RHP Tyler Glasnow (0-1, 27.00 ERA)\n\nSunday\n\nLHP Jon Lester (0-0, 1.64 ERA) vs. RHP Jameson Taillon (0-0, 1.38 ERA)\n\nMy Series Prediction\n\nHendricks and Cole both return to ace form in the series opener, and nobody scores until Kris Bryant hits his first homer of the year in the bottom of the ninth for the win.

  "latent_23283": "CINCINNATI -- Paul Ryan had almost finished his Tuesday morning campaign rally when howls came from the back the makeshift forum at the Byer Steel factory in the outskirts of town.\n\nBarry Silver, 60, a politically active, somewhat portly Jewish man, had been waiting to ask a question. And when it looked like the Republican vice presidential candidate was about to exit -- past the steel beams indoors and the towering piles of colorful metallic garbage outside, onto the waiting bus -- the people surrounding Silver begged Ryan to take one more.\n\n\"Okay, go ahead,\" Ryan capitulated, glancing quickly to his staffers nearby, checking to see how crunched his schedule was. \"They are going to kill for being late.\"\n\nSilver proceeded to detail his apocalyptical nightmare. \"My main worry is Iran getting the bomb,\" he explained. \"We won't be here if Iran gets the bomb, Israel won't be there if Iran gets the bomb.\" What, he asked, would Mitt Romney do about it?\n\nRyan's answer was boilerplate. And since he was rushed for time, it lasted just over a minute. But, as political give-and-takes go, it did the trick.\n\n\"I thought he gave a pretty great answer,\" Silver told The Huffington Post at the next Romney campaign stop. \"I was happy he took the question because I think that's a political issue both candidates are ignoring.\"\n\nSilver, a Cincinnatian, is precisely the type of voter that Romney and Ryan need to reach. Until two weeks ago, he was set to vote for President Barack Obama. In fact, he had been volunteering for the Obama campaign, making phone calls. But when the riots in Libya and Cairo happened, Silver took down his lawn sign. Bearded, wearing a plain white shirt and a yarmulke, he called the president's response to those riots \"pitiful.\" With 42 days left until the election, Silver explained that he was in the midst of a political reassessment.\n\nRyan didn't seal the deal. But he nudged Silver toward Romney. In the process, he showed that direct voter contact still has a role in a 2012 campaign dominated by massive spending and glitzy television ads. And he raised the question: Why isn't Romney doing this type of retail politicking as well?\n\nHours after he spent an extra minute alleviating Silver's concerns, Ryan stood behind Romney on a makeshift podium at an airport tarmac 15 minutes outside of Dayton. Gone was the dusty floor, the steel factory backdrop, and the stage surrounded by an audience.\n\nIn its place was an airport runaway with two private Romney campaign planes and a high-end bus for the campaign's across-Ohio tour. Romney spoke before a decent-sized crowd, which stood and applauded throughout his roughly 30-minute speech. There was no question-and-answer session. It was a standard stump speech, with a little extra emphasis on cracking down on China (\"We cannot compete with people who don't play fair. I won't let that go on. I will stop it in its tracks.\") and one notable gaffe (with Romney admitting that Obama hadn't raised taxes in his first term).\n\nIf Romney was at all startled by a Washington Post poll from the morning, which showed him trailing the president by eight percentage points in the state, neither he nor his advisers showed it. After the event, there were no impromptu stops at a local bakery or at a small business that might face a major tax hike in Obama's second term. Romney hasn't done one of those since Sept. 10.\n\nThe candidate did interviews with a few TV anchors, departed Dayton International Airport at 5:41 p.m., drove an hour and 25 minutes to Columbus, went into his hotel and called it a day.\n\nAides to the former governor insisted the day went according to plan. Reporters following the candidate can only witness a fraction of the imprint that campaign has on the state when it spends three days crisscrossing its terrain, the aides said.\n\n\"When we get a chance to commit to a local market like this, we can tailor that message,\" explained Kevin Madden, a top Romney adviser. \"We will have more events as we go through Election Day. And we have done a number of those events throughout this campaign. And there will be other opportunities for that.\"\n\nBut in private, others on staff conceded that Romney has become too removed from the act of campaigning. The expenses of the election have become overwhelming (owed, in large part, to Obama's ability to tap into grassroots donors), forcing Romney to split his time between raising money and addressing voters.\n\n\"He is doing retail politics,\" stressed former Sen. Mike DeWine, who, after endorsing Rick Santorum in the Republican primary, has served as a Romney surrogate in Ohio. DeWine added that the persuasion of undecided voters would come when the two candidates hold their debates.\n\n\"The other guy [Obama] has been in their living room for four years,\" DeWine said. \"Romney has to convince them to be comfortable with him being in their living room for four years.\"\n\nAnd so, for Ryan, the task has become two-fold. Instead of just serving the traditional function of a vice presidential candidate -- that of an attack dog -- he's been asked to essentially make his running mate more accessible. It wasn't a coincidence that Ryan and Romney were on stage together for a first time in almost a month and that aides said more joint appearances were in the works. Ryan performs the precise task that Romney needs: getting voters excited again.\n\nSherry Kenworthy of Englewood said Ryan draws younger voters to the GOP ticket, in part because \"around here he is really well-known.\" He went to college at Ohio's Miami University. Plus, she added, \"he's cute.\"\n\nLess superficially, Kathleen Ford, who travelled to the Cincinnati event from her home in northern Kentucky, said Ryan had helped alleviate questions she had about Romney's religion.\n\n\"Part of the issue with Romney is he is Mormon. And a lot of people don't know about the Mormon Church,\" Ford told The Huffington Post. \"I just know too little about it. What I knew about it was that they could have more than one wife. It is a stereotype that's unfair. Clearly he has one wife.\n\n\"But Mormons are not so much involved in the true fight that the Catholic Church is going through right now,\" Ford added. \"We pray every Sunday that the government does not strip us of our liberties. Our pastor has called what is happening tyranny.\"\n\nRyan shared that sense of creeping tyranny, she explained.\n\nOthers at both rallies echoed similar points. Ryan, they said, was giving the campaign the type of wholesome, personal touch that Romney lacks. While Romney has the business credentials for the job, Ryan knows how to actually turn that into legislation. \"Paul Ryan understands the nuts and the bolts of the budget,\" said Steve Bengal of Cincinnati.\n\nBut there was a side effect to all the glad-handing, question-answering and retail politicking that Ryanb was doing. For some folks -- a very small minority -- the vice presidential candidate had as much if not more appeal than the top of the ticket.",
  "latent_23449": "Building a sustainable, open-source platform for language learning\n\nr12n Profile: Marc Bogonovich of Openwords\n\nDerek Lackaff Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jan 26, 2017\n\nUpdate: This story has been republished by Global Voices, and translated into বাংলা, Español, Português, and русский.\n\nLearning a language is a challenging endeavor. Digital technologies have been developed over the last several decades to aid the process, ranging from (probably) familiar platforms like Rosetta Stone to immersive virtual environments. In recent years, the web and mobile app Duolingo has risen to prominence by developing a novel learning model that focuses on maximizing user engagement. While Duolingo is free to use, it is not “open” in the sense that it can broadly invite users to collaborate and contribute. Duolingo learning features come and go, as the company determines what works best for the majority of users and supports financial growth. Duolingo has an “Incubator” program that allows volunteers to develop new courses. However, the Incubator program is relatively opaque, and the learning content that is developed belongs solely to Duolingo. I asked Duolingo founder Luis van Ahn about course development plans for endangered or indigenous languages, and he replied: “We’ll be working on 4–5 smaller languages this year, but there are over 6,000 languages in the world, so we won’t have the resources to make a big dent any time soon.”\n\nOpenwords is currently running an IndieGogo crowdfunding campaign to support course development — please consider contributing!\n\nSocial entrepreneur Marc Bogonovich, however, sees massive opportunity for language-learning technology that is open — open-source software, open educational resources, and even open business models. Bogonovich argues, “there are many emerging applications, often with very nice interfaces, but they are often unavailable to instructors or university instructors, or they expect to retain more control over the curricula (in design or intellectual property) than is acceptable or reasonable. We really want to empower instructors with excellent problem [design] interfaces for their students.” To this end, Bogonovich founded Openwords with the intention of producing a free and open-source language learning platform.\n\nOpenwords is several things: it is a open-source language-learning app with robust lesson and course development features. It is a social enterprise, or a for-profit business that legally pursues a social mission — not shareholder value — as its highest priority. Finally, if things go according to Bogonovich’s plan, Openwords will be a community of language learners and teachers. Where does Openwords fit in a technical and commercial language-learning landscape that already contains players like Duolingo and Memrise, and even open-source projects like Anki?\n\nOpenwords: Open content and open business\n\nBogonovich has structured Openwords to be open in multiple senses of the term. The software under development is open-source, as is the supporting infrastructure such as a problem markup language and file formats. He notes, “We’re designing the platform to have an open curriculum, meaning teachers and universities have the tools to create and modify the curricula directly. You won’t ask us for permission to build curricula — the tools we are building will just allow that.”\n\nThe user-generated content, such as problems, lessons, and curricula, is also intended to be open and adaptable by other users. Communities of language teachers will be able to share full semesters of content, for example, and individual teachers will be able to adapt and build on others’ lessons to make them better suited for specific learning contexts. Such open educational resources (OER) represent a massive opportunity for language communities with limited resources.\n\n“Open source isn’t just the future, it was also the past. In the past, technological, philosophical, artistic, and theological progress were advanced through the sharing of information. The progress of society depends on sharing information. My goal is to have Openwords be a participant in this historical process.”\n\nBogonovich is interested in open technology which empowers people who are outside of Openwords’ formal organizational boundaries. He believes that this openness will encourage the teachers and universities who partner with Openwords to have a deeper stake in its success.\n\nOpen business models\n\nOpenwords is also a startup, but a startup founded with clearly-defined open principles. Bogonovich realized from the start that he did not want to found a traditional business, where the bottom line was ultimately just the bottom line. “We are a social enterprise, meaning we have legally protected social and educational goals in addition to financial goals. Openwords is not legally obligated to maximize profit, allowing our organization to better align with the goals of educational institutions. We can maximize revenue (which is different than profit) to maximize our impact. Therefore, we are implementing business models that will sustain and grow open source technology.” An early partner in the Open Business Model Canvas group organized by Creative Commons, Bogonovich has been actively exploring ways to structure Openwords to maximize its social value and mission. The company is currently pursuing B Corp certification, which offers strong legal protections of Openwords’ social mission.\n\n“I believe that business institutions needs to evolve. They can’t just be about profit maximization. The predominance of such institutions will not create a sustainable future, and will not create a desirable future.”\n\nOpenwords’ current revenue model is based on providing student tracking and metrics to educational institutional customers, and negotiations are underway with several universities. Bogonivich anticipates finalizing the first such agreements this year. “The path from zero to one client is a qualitative, exploratory, and experimental experience. One to ten clients is hopefully more quantitative. We can continue to engage in more experimentation, but once we’ve accumulated experiences and technologies we begin to generate revenue and scale.”\n\nBringing language learning to the open-source ecosystem\n\nOpenwords is like many open technology projects, in that it leverages a range of previously-developed technologies. These include open source programming languages and development platforms. Bogonovich notes that technology standards are particularly important. “Standards like Unicode with their aim of representing most written languages makes something like Openwords possible. I think of Openwords as becoming a higher level element of educational technology infrastructure.”\n\nOpenwords app screens.\n\nOpenwords’ language learning interface should be familiar to users of platforms such as Duolingo or Memrise. A range of problem types are available, including fill-in-the-blank, sentence translation, and listening comprehension.\n\nOpenwords Lesson Builder GUI.\n\nWhere Openwords gets particularly exciting, however, is in the opportunities it provides to teachers. To design problems and lessons, teachers can use a graphic user interface (GUI) (it uses drop-down menus at the moment, but a drag-and-drop interface is planned), or they can write problems in a text editor using a markup language. I’m not sure if this name is official yet, but I like “Openwords Markup Language” or OWML.\n\nOpenwords Markup Language: the code on the right represents the problem on the left. Beautifully simple.\n\nOWML is under active development, with the latest focus on how to represent problems containing audio. The general idea, however, is great: keep the educational content in a simple, open, text-based format that can be easily shared, modified, and manipulated.\n\nOpenwords and language revitalization\n\nOpenwords has strong potential for use in language communities with limited educational resources. The simple fact that the project is open-source, and that its content is not proprietary, should inspire confidence that effort put into the platform will not be squandered. Teachers who create lessons will never be locked out of their lessons due to a change in an interface or business model.\n\nThe Openwords problem formulation (image courtesy Marc Bogonovich)\n\n“OER and the open orientation I see as what is needed to reach various languages, even perhaps more than resources — there are a large number of under-resourced languages.” Bogonovich suggests that the openness provided by Openwords will allow smaller language communities to usefully allocate and invest time into language course development. As evidence, he points to the large number of Wikipedias that have been collaboratively and openly developed in different languages over the years.\n\nBogonovich suggested that Openwords would be happy to work with members of such language communities. “We’ll work with with groups that perceive the value of OER. And I fully expect that means many different kinds of people and groups. We spent some time discussing why our platform would be valuable for indigenous communities.”\n\nThe future of open language learning\n\nIn the longer term, Bogonovich envisions Openwords contributing to specific language learning agendas, as well as developing open analytics to provide a broader scientific understanding of the learning process. “After we develop a larger university client base we will begin even deeper technology development, and we will diversify the kinds of learning modules (types of individual problems),” he notes. “We will also explore in much more depth learning patterns, essentially which patterns or problems lead to learning in what segments of learners.”\n\n“If you’re an educator and a scientist, you believe in learning because it is an aspect of quality of life. And you also understand that broad learning, particularly in music, arts, languages, and humanities, is actually critical to creativity and real innovation — how or why is not always clear, but this is true. I just disagree that someone’s strange version of ‘necessity’ should drive learning priorities. Curiosity should drive learning.”\n\nHe further explains, “Because Openwords is a social enterprise, and an open enterprise, what we learn is going to be public domain. Openwords can become a vessel for open science on foreign language learning. We know that other language learning apps do science internally. We’re going to make this public. We hope to leverage our community of users (with proper permissions and anonymity) for researchers who want to study big data and language learning.”\n\nOpenwords is currently running an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to support lesson development. If you think this is a worthy project, please consider making a contribution (of any size) and joining the Openwords community. If you are supporting a specific language, include a hashtag (like #lakota or #cherokee or #japanese) with your donation.\n\nFurther info:\n\nOpenwords Site | Facebook | Twitter | Github\n\nBogonovich, M.

  "latent_23526": "Today’s guest post/contest comes from Adam Harstad, a co-writer of mine at Footballguys.com. You can follow Adam on twitter at @AdamHarstad.\n\nRegular readers of Football Perspective are well acquainted with the sneaky-greatness of DeAndre Hopkins, who led the NFL in percentage of his team’s receiving yards in 2014 despite not even leading his own team in targets. And, indeed, by “percentage of team receiving yards”, Hopkins is having another terrific season; his 37.0% share is slightly above the league-leading 35.0% he posted last year, (though it trails the 38.6% share he carried through his team’s first 14 games in 2014).\n\nBut Hopkins is having an even better season by a far less esoteric statistic: receiving first downs. As best as I have been able to determine, the all-time record for receiving first downs in a season is 92, set by Marvin Harrison in 2002 and tied by Calvin Johnson in 2012. Through eight games this year, Hopkins has converted for a new set of downs a remarkable 54 times, putting him on pace for 108, a ridiculous 17.4% more than the previous NFL record. (For context, if a quarterback wanted to break Peyton Manning’s single-season passing yardage record by 17.4%, he would need to throw for 6430 yards.)\n\nHow has Hopkins been doing it? The easy answer would be that he’s been racking up huge numbers against prevent defenses. And, indeed, Hopkins has been racking up impressive statistics when his team trails big; Hopkins is on pace for 596 yards earned while his team is trailing by 14 or more points, which would make him just the seventh receiver since 1994 to top even 400 such yards.\n\nThe problem with the easy answer is that, playing for a bad team like Houston, Hopkins has had fewer opportunities to accrue stats when his team wasn’t down big. Hopkins’ 298 yards while trailing by 14+ points represents 34.3% of his overall total of 870 yards. Houston’s 136 pass attempts while trailing by 14+ points, on the other hand, represents 37.6% of their season-long total. Their 963 passing yards represent 41.0% of their season-long total. Indeed, on a per-pass basis, Hopkins has been proportionally less productive when his team is down big.\n\nWhile Hopkins has been slightly less productive on a per-pass basis, one could theorize that garbage time skewed the pass:run ratio enough that the extra volume would more than offset. And that’s true to some extent. But over the whole offense, 32.5% of Houston’s plays have come while trailing by 14+ points, which is again right in line with Hopkins’ yardage share while down big.\n\nSo Hopkins isn’t feasting on garbage-time defenses so much as he’s playing on a terrible team where he spends a disproportionate amount of his time on the field while the team is down big. It’s not that he’s a garbage-time hero, it’s that he has fewer non-garbage-time opportunities to produce statistics.\n\nSo if he’s not padding his receiving totals against uncaring competition, how is Hopkins on pace to demolish the first down record by such a prodigious margin? The old-fashioned way; he’s setting league-best marks in both volume and efficiency. Many know about Hopkins’ targets; his current pace would put him at 224 for a full season, which would also be a likely league record, (albeit not by 17%).\n\nBut Hopkins has also been insanely efficient at converting his targets and receptions into first downs. Since 2002, there have been 171 receivers who have received at least 135 targets. Hopkins’ 0.486 first-down rate would stand as the 9th-best mark in that group. Over that same span, there have been 185 receivers with at least 80 receptions; Hopkins’ 0.818 first-down rate would stand as the 5th-best total in that group. (Going back to 1992 only adds one more name above Hopkins.)\n\nThis is just raw conversion percentage, too, and makes no adjustment for the quality of the team or the difficulty of the conversion. Given that the Texans currently rank 32nd in the NFL in rushing yards per carry and 29th in the NFL in completion percentage, we would expect many of Hopkins’ targets to come on later downs in obvious passing situations. And, indeed, that’s exactly what we see; 70 of Hopkins 112 targets have come with 10+ yards to go for a new set of downs. Of the 32 receivers with at least 30 such targets, Hopkins’ .471 conversion rate ranks second only to John Brown’s .531. On 3rd or 4th down with 10+ yards to go, Hopkins again paces the league with 7 conversions on 12 targets; second place is a 4-way tie of players with 4 conversions each.\n\nPerhaps most amazingly, despite routinely facing long-yardage opportunities and converting at a tremendous rate, Hopkins averages just 13.2 yards per reception. Among all receivers converting at least 75% of their receptions for a first down, the average yards per reception is 15.3. Overall, the profile is of a player who is routinely getting just enough to move the chains; if someone could be said to have a nose for the first-down marker, Hopkins might be it.\n\nHow impressive is Hopkins’ combination of volume and efficiency? One way to measure it would be “marginal first downs over average”. So far in 2015, receivers have drawn 4963 targets. They have caught 3011 of those passes for 1868 first downs. Across all NFL receivers, the average is 0.376 first downs per target and 0.620 first downs per reception.\n\nThe number of marginal first downs a receiver added, then, would be his rate above (or below) that league average, times his total number of targets or receptions. Here is a chart of how many marginal first downs each receiver has been responsible for through the first half of the season. The table lists all 168 wide receivers who have caught a pass so far this season, although by default, the table lists just the top 20. Note that the table is fully searchable and sortable, and you can change the number of receivers displayed by using the dropdown box on the left.\n\nFirst downs isn’t as well-known of a stat as receptions or yards, but they are arguably more important to offensive success. And no matter how you look at them, DeAndre Hopkins is having a season for the ages.",
  "latent_23700": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight Democratic senators and congressmen have asked Attorney General Eric Holder to answer questions about a Reuters report that the National Security Agency supplies the Drug Enforcement Administration with intelligence information used to make non-terrorism cases against American citizens.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder speaks on stage during the annual meeting of the American Bar Association in San Francisco, California August 12, 2013. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field, including those from the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and Homeland Security, with instructions to never disclose the original source, even in court. In most cases, the NSA tips involve drugs, money laundering and organized crime, not terrorism.\n\nFive Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship, joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns. The matter will be discussed during classified briefings scheduled for September, Republican and Democratic aides said.\n\n“These allegations raise serious concerns that gaps in the policy and law are allowing overreach by the federal government’s intelligence gathering apparatus,” wrote the senators - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\n\nHolder, an appointee of U.S. President Barack Obama, is the country’s top lawman as head of the Justice Department. The Justice Department is reviewing the congressional inquiry, a spokesman for Holder said on Monday.\n\nThe Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA’s Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.\n\nThe documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin - to “recreate” the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information, raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial.\n\n‘PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION’\n\nThe internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as “parallel construction.” For example, agents said in interviews, they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight, instead of a tip passed from the NSA. An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators.\n\nJustice Department officials have said they are reviewing the matter. DEA officials have said the practice is legal and has been in near-daily use since the 1990s. The purpose is to protect sources and methods, not to withhold evidence, they said.\n\nThe three congressmen - John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York and Bobby Scott of Virginia - wrote to Holder on August 9, shortly after the original Reuters report.\n\n“If this report is accurate, then it describes an unacceptable breakdown in the barrier between foreign intelligence surveillance and criminal process,” the congressmen wrote.\n\nOn the CBS program Face the Nation on August 18, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, a Republican, said the use of NSA intelligence to make non-terrorism cases should be scrutinized. “I think we need to have a very careful examination of this. I think that the trust of the American people in their government is what’s at stake here,” he said.",

They say an Englishman’s home is his castle but I acted on instinct.’\n\nThe CCTV footage from the entrance to the house in Kettering, Northamptonshire – which also shows the thugs breaking in before the couple arrive – led to one being identified and handed a lengthy jail term. Another has been jailed after he was arrested for a separate offence and DNA was matched to a balaclava Mr Adamson snatched off him in the fight.\n\nThe gang got away with £400 cash and the briefcase Mr Adamson had been carrying.\n\nMr Adamson, who has three children, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, told of the moment he arrived home.\n\nHe said: ‘The next thing we know the chap comes out with the iron bar. Sparks were flying off it when he hit the wall, he was really trying to whack me.

This year a DNA check linked David Jarvie, 53, to a balaclava at Mr Adamson’s home.\n\nJarvie, also of Kettering, admitted aggravated burglary and actual bodily harm and was jailed for five-and-a-half years on August 28.\n\nJarvie’s defence barrister William Fanshaw, told the court that even his client was amazed at Mr Adamson’s courage: ‘He says himself that the victim was a very brave man to stand up to a whole group of men, some of whom were armed.’\n\nMrs Adamson, who raced to get help during the raid, said: ‘I didn’t find out until I watched the CCTV what Andy had done.

She gave no details.\n\n“We haven’t been able to verify or check” the veracity of those allegations, Coomaraswamy added.\n\nEarlier this month the International Criminal Court in The Hague convicted Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo of using child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

  "latent_23869": "Michel Euler/AP Photo\n\nPARIS - The cartoons try hard to offend. One glance at them and you can see they do. Images of the Prophet Mohammed are forbidden in Islam, but in the French satirical weekly newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\" he is not only shown, he is depicted in lewd and deliberately provocative sexual positions.\n\nThe French government, fearing that these incendiary sketches will ignite yet more violence in the Arab world, has announced that it will close more than 20 embassies as well as consulates and French schools, and it has put French citizens in Arab countries on alert.\n\nIt's easy to understand the sensitivity after what happened last week when an amateur video mocking Mohammed that was made in California surfaced on YouTube. Muslims around the world were inflamed, attacking U.S. embassies and leaving more than two dozen people dead. It is still not clear what if any role the film had in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead.\n\nWhat is clear is that Charlie Hebdo is intentionally wading into sensitivities that can easily spin out of control. France has more than 3 million Muslims and a French Muslim group issued a statement expressing \"deep concern\" about the caricatures and warning that \"in a very tense context, it risks exacerbating tensions and provoking reactions.\"\n\nThe 16-page weekly magazine has been hard to find in Paris. A news vendor near the Arc de Triomphe opened his morning deliveries and within seconds all of the copies he had in stock were snapped up.\n\nFrance's Foreign Minister said this morning he believes in free speech, but he worries that the cartoons are \"adding oil to fire.\" He said the appropriate place to challenge the cartoons is in the French courts.\n\nMuslims here note that on Tuesday the French courts sided with the Duchess of Cambridge in banning further distribution of photos of her sunbathing topless while on a private vacation. They say if those images are illegal, then the offensive cartoons should be, too.\n\nBut the editor of \"Charlie Hebdo\" is unrepentant, saying the images will \"shock those who will want to be shocked.\"\n\n\"Freedom of the press, is that a provocation?\" he said.\n\nThe newspaper has courted controversy before. Last November it called one issue \"Sharia Hebdo\" and claimed the Prophet Mohammed was its guest editor. The newspaper's offices were firebombed the day of publication.\n\nToday French riot police are stationed in front of the offices of Charlie Hebdo.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMay 24, 2016, 12:34 PM GMT / Updated May 24, 2016, 12:39 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nFirst Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.\n\nThe most important number in the new NBC/WSJ poll\n\nThere are plenty of storylines and new numbers from our latest national NBC/WSJ poll, but here’s maybe the most important number of all: 51% -- as in President Obama’s approval rating, which is his highest mark in the poll since his second inauguration. Why is it important? Because it means that Obama will be an asset to Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail unlike he was in the 2014 midterms, when his approval rating was in the low 40s. And consider his approval rating among these key parts of the Democratic base and swing groups:\n\nOf course, an incumbent president with a 50%-plus job-approval rating isn’t a guarantee for a party keeping the White House -- see 2000. But it’s certainly better than what Republicans experienced in 2008, when George W. Bush’s rating was 27% in our April 2008 NBC/WSJ poll. Our current poll found only 39% saying they would consider voting for Obama if he could run for a third term, but it’s higher than the 34% who said this about Bill Clinton in Sept. 2000. And 78% of African Americans, 72% of Democrats, 62% of Latinos, and 50% of those ages 18-34 said they would consider voting for Obama again if they could.\n\nDonald Trump, conspiracy-theorist-in-chief?\n\nLast night, the Washington Post wrote how Donald Trump described the 1993 suicide of White House aide Vince Foster as “very fishy.” From the Post: “When asked in an interview last week about the Foster case, Trump dealt with it as he has with many edgy topics — raising doubts about the official version of events even as he says he does not plan to talk about it on the campaign trail. He called theories of possible foul play ‘very serious’ and the circumstances of Foster’s death ‘very fishy.’” This isn’t the first time that Trump has dabbled in conspiracy theories. There’s the 2011 “birther” crusade against President Obama; there’s the allegation that Ted Cruz’s father was with Lee Harvey Oswald; and there’s Trump flirting with the idea that the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia might have been murdered. As MSNBC's Benjy Sarlin wrote earlier this month, “[Trump], whether by choice or by nature, appears fundamentally unable to distinguish between credible sources and chain e-mails. Equally significant, though, is that he uses these falsehoods to elevate fringe conspiracy theories and anecdotes that politicians are normally careful to keep far away from mainstream politics. He’s spread discredited claims linking vaccines to autism, for example — a debunked theory that medical officials say has harmed efforts to wipe out preventable diseases.”\n\nClinton camp highlights Trump’s past comment rooting for housing market to collapse\n\nThe Clinton campaign is out with a new media blitz, including a web video, to criticize Trump’s comment in 2006 that seemed to be rooting for the housing market to collapse so he could make money. “I sort of hope that happens, because then people like me would go in and buy. If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you could make a lot of money.” The Washington Post: “About a dozen surrogates and local elected officials in Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado, Nevada and elsewhere will host calls, events and release statements focused on Trump’s response to the housing crisis that precipitated the economic recession. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), will be engaged in the efforts and Ryan will host a conference call with reporters at noon Tuesday to hammer home the message. ‘You don't make America great by rooting for its economy to fail,’ Ryan said in a statement.”\n\nTrump vs. Clinton on the issues\n\nWhy is the Clinton camp focused on that 2006 comment? One reason is that -- at least right now -- Trump has the advantage on the economy and Wall Street, according to our latest NBC/WSJ poll.\n\n61% have reservations or are uncomfortable with Trump being first American president without previous experience in government or the military\n\nHere are a final set of numbers from our NBC/WSJ poll: Six-in-10 American voters say they’re unsure about Trump’s lack of government or military experience, including 42% who say they are VERY uncomfortable with it. “To put that number in context: A lower total percentage of voters - 51 percent - expressed concern about Bernie Sanders potentially becoming the first self-described Democratic socialist to lead the country. Those who expressed concern about Trump's lack of military or government experience included 68 percent of women, 60 percent of independents, 78 percent of undecided voters and about a third of Republican primary voters,” one of us writes.\n\nSanders: Of course the Democratic convention will be “messy”\n\nIn an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker, Bernie Sanders attempted to clarify what he meant by saying that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia would be \"messy.\" Sanders told Welker, “Well, of course, it will be. That’s what democracy is about. But if you use the word ‘messy,’ it means that people will be engaged in vigorous debate. We don’t have that often in the U.S. But I think that’s what a convention is about. I happen to believe that we should have a national health-care system offering health care to all people. Secretary Clinton disagrees. I hope there will be a vigorous debate.”\n\nOur question: Hasn’t there already been a debate over Sanders’ and Clinton’s policies, and isn’t Clinton ahead in the vote totals? Here’s the current delegate math in the Democratic race:\n\nIn pledged delegates, Clinton currently holds a lead of 274 delegates\n\nClinton 1,771 (54%)\n\nSanders 1,497 (46%)\n\nClinton must win 32% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates\n\nSanders must win 68% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates\n\nIn overall delegates (pledged + super), Clinton holds an overall lead of 762 delegates\n\nClinton must win 9% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number\n\nSanders must win 91% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number\n\nTerry McAuliffe under investigation\n\nFinally, NBC’s Pete Williams reports: “Federal officials say the FBI has been looking at whether Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia accepted political contributions that were forbidden by federal law. McAuliffe is a close friend of the Clintons and a former chairman of the Democratic Party and co-chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. But officials say that's not a focus of the investigation. McAuliffe is a one-time board member of the charitable foundation set up by former president Bill Clinton, and records show 120 donors contributed to both the foundation and McAuliffe's campaign. Federal officials say investigators are looking at those overlaps -- and are especially interested in contributions from Wang Wenliang, a Chinese politician. Contributions by foreign nationals are barred, but a spokesperson for Wang says he has permanent US resident status and that his contributions were legal. An expert on campaign law says the FBI may be looking at whether the money Wang gave came from a Chinese-based company he runs, which would be illegal.”\n\nOn the trail\n\nHillary Clinton campaigns throughout California… So does Bernie Sanders… Donald Trump holds a rally in Albuquerque, NM at 9:00 pm ET… And Bill Clinton also is in New Mexico.

  "latent_24504": "Brandon Kintzler is a free agent. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nA year ago, securing a closer was at the top of the Nationals’ offseason checklist. They tried. They offered a contract to Mark Melancon and, when Melancon rejected the deal, offered one to Kenley Jansen. He also declined Washington’s overture, leaving the Nationals scrambling with unproven in-house options. Blake Treinen was ultimately given the job. A three-and-a-half-month disaster ensued and a midseason bullpen overhaul was required to stabilize the relief corps. It included trading Treinen.\n\n[The true, complete story of how the Nationals fixed baseball’s worst bullpen in two trades]\n\nWashington doesn’t face that pressure this time around. The Nationals have Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson, mid-July acquisitions from the Athletics, to populate the back end of their bullpen in 2018. They are proven, dependable and relatively cheap — Madson is on the books for $7.66 million and Doolittle for $4.38 million. The rest of the bullpen, however, is in flux.\n\nFour of the Nationals’ 12 free agents this offseason are relievers. They are all at least 33 years old. Three — Brandon Kintzler, Matt Albers and Oliver Perez — were on their playoff roster. The other — Joe Blanton — was on the Opening Day roster. Most, if not all, probably won’t return. Bullpen turnover is commonplace.\n\n“The bullpen is something that we’re going to really keep our eye on,” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said in an interview on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday. “And do our due diligence on and see if we can bolster that beyond what it is already.”\n\nDoolittle, Madson, Enny Romero and Sammy Solis are the four relievers from Washington’s postseason bullpen under contract for next season. Austin Adams and Matt Grace finished the regular season with the club. Shawn Kelley, Koda Glover and Trevor Gott, all of whom finished the season on the disabled list, are also in the picture, as is Wander Suero. The 26-year-old right-hander hasn’t reached the majors, but compiled a 1.70 ERA in 42 1/3 innings for Class AAA Syracuse in 2017. The Nationals added him to their 40-man roster last week.\n\n[Ranking the top 50 MLB free agents by 2018 projections]\n\nKintzler is the most notable of Washington’s free agents. The right-hander ascended from independent leaguer to all-star closer for the Twins this season before Minnesota flipped him to Washington minutes before the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline. Kintzler was assigned the seventh inning in front of Madson and allowed one run in 11 appearances in that frame. He struggled when dropped into other situations.\n\nEvery year, MLB Trade Rumors compiles a list of baseball’s 50 top free agents predicting where they will land. Kintzler is the only one the website projects will sign with the Nationals. The prediction includes a two-year, $14 million contract. Re-signing Kintzler, who made $2.925 million in 2017, would provide the Nationals some continuity at the back end, which they haven’t enjoyed for much of their history. But Kintzler could find more money elsewhere, especially if a club deems him worthy of closing or pitching the eighth inning. Kintzler, however, doesn’t fit the profile of a typical late-inning reliever. He doesn’t miss many bats and relies on soft contact. Perhaps that will prevent clubs from pricing the 33-year-old out of the Nationals’ range.\n\nPerez likely won’t be back because Washington has its fair share of cheaper left-handed options and Blanton will be 37 coming off a down year. Which leaves Albers. Former manager Dusty Baker repeatedly called Albers, who posted a 1.62 ERA after signing a minor league deal last offseason, “the find of the year.” He’ll garner a major league contract this time, perhaps a multiyear deal, though he’ll be 35 next season. His prospects could depend on Kintzler; maybe the Nationals will turn to him if Kintzler moves on.\n\n[Archive: Matt Albers may not look the part, but he’s ‘the find of the year’ for Nationals]\n\nOther free agents include Juan Nicasio, Pat Neshek, Addison Reed and Bryan Shaw. The Nationals could even try to acquire a closer and have Doolittle and Maddon set up, building on a strength at a time when bullpens are more important than ever. But there isn’t much of a selection in free agency. Wade Davis and Greg Holland headline a shallow free agent closer class, and both were given qualifying offers. If they reject them, they will come attached with draft compensation, though the penalties aren’t as severe as in the previous collective bargaining agreement. A closer would probably arrive via trade.\n\nWashington has options, internally and externally, to fill out its relief corps. And, as they proved in 2017, the answers can arrive in a variety of ways. There is no science to bullpen construction. Relievers are volatile. One year, they’ll post a 2.64 ERA and strike out 12.4 batters per nine innings, the next they will surrender home runs at a historic clip and compile a 7.27 ERA (see: Kelley, Shawn). The Nationals may unearth another “find of the year” on a minor league deal or add big-name pieces to their bullpen in July as they have done each of past three seasons. The goal is to have it all in place by next October.\n\nMore on the Nationals:\n\nWho might the Nationals target in free agency?\n\nMax Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg named NL Cy Young Award finalists\n\nBob Henley will return as Nationals’ third base coach\n\nKevin Long, once viewed as a managerial candidate, will be the Nats’ hitting coach\n\nMike Rizzo ‘optimistic’ Daniel Murphy will be ready for Opening Day",

In Texas, the disease has been transmitted locally at least five times so far.\n\nThe warning comes as the 85th Biennial State Legislative Session will soon begin, and state lawmakers have already filed plenty of bills focused on further restricting access to abortions in the Lone Star State.\n\nSo far, Texas Republicans have filed some real winners, but the one that is most troubling in a state where people are locally contracting Zika may be House Bill 87, filed by state Rep. Matt Schaefer. Right now, a woman can get an abortion after the 20-week period if the pregnancy isn't viable, the mother's health is at risk or there are severe abnormalities in the fetus. However, if HB 87 passes that would change and women would only be able to get abortions after 20 weeks if their lives are at risk. All abortions based on fetal abnormalities would be banned in Texas.",
  "latent_24836": "Judging by the party conventions, you’d wonder why this election is even close.\n\nIn Tampa, despite some unexpectedly amateurish stagecraft, Republicans put on a credible display of unity and resolve. No one could come away doubting that the party very much wants to defeat President Obama in November.\n\nBut I think it’s fair to conclude the GOP’s emphasis is on “Defeat Barack Obama,” rather than on “Elect Mitt Romney.” And many of the party’s rising stars, judging by their convention speeches, seem to believe it’s likely that Romney will lose.\n\nComing to Charlotte, I expected to see a party on the defensive. Instead, Democrats orchestrated a convention that felt strikingly focused and spirited. Speakers relentlessly emphasized the “Reelect Obama” side of the equation, relegating “Defeat Romney” to second billing. The oratory was superior, the visuals were more telegenic and there were no Clint Eastwood moments.\n\nYou can’t conclude that, just because the Democrats’ three-day infomercial was better than what the GOP put on, Obama is going to win. But even if the conventions aren’t remotely as important as they once were, they’re not meaningless. They do say something, and this year the message for Democrats is decidedly hopeful.\n\nAs I said, the GOP did a respectable job. The most obvious missed opportunities came on the final night — not just the Eastwood incident but also the failure to ensure that some of the tributes to Romney’s character from people whose lives he touched aired on the broadcast networks. But none of this amounts to a major disaster.\n\nThematically, however, there was a meandering quality to the Tampa convention. In large part, this was due to the decision by some of the marquee speakers to spend more time talking about themselves and their accomplishments than about Romney.\n\nI’m talking about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida — both, not coincidentally, seen as potential presidential candidates in 2016, should Romney lose. It was hard to imagine why they — and several other speakers — would give such priority to their own political prospects if they really believed Romney would be occupying the White House for the next eight years.\n\nIn Charlotte, by contrast, there has been practically no freelancing. Every speech has centered on one of two clear themes: why voting for Obama and the Democrats is right, and why voting for Romney and the Republicans is wrong. Self-indulgence and self-promotion have not been allowed.\n\nEven one of the most famously uncontrollable speakers of our time, former president Bill Clinton, stayed relentlessly on message throughout a masterful 50-minute speech. Republicans who suspected (or hoped) there might be a glimmer of daylight between Clinton and Obama must have been disappointed.\n\nClinton’s powerful argument for Obama’s reelection was constructed like a lawyer’s brief. He systematically countered the Romney campaign’s main lines of attack — Medicare, welfare, didn’t-build-that — and offered a wonderfully succinct distillation of how Democrats see the difference between the two parties: “We believe that ‘We’re all in this together’ is a far better philosophy than ‘You’re on your own.’ ”\n\nClinton’s embrace of Obama — political during the speech, physical when Obama walked onstage at the end — was complete and unreserved. Might the former president, totally by coincidence, have also begun to lay the ground for a presidential run by Hillary Clinton in 2016? If so, I think he just wrapped up Obama’s support.\n\nAll right, Clinton is a unique political asset whom Republicans couldn’t be expected to match. But frankly, in terms of speechifying, any one night in Charlotte was better than the whole week in Tampa. The Democrats’ first evening featured a barnburner from Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a stem-winder from San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and a rafter-raiser from first lady Michelle Obama — plus a couple of also-ran speeches that would have been considered rhetorical highlights at the GOP convention.\n\nAnd for all the talk of an “enthusiasm gap” favoring Republicans, the energy levels inside the two arenas tell a different story. It’s not that the Tampa hall lacked enthusiasm; it’s that the Charlotte hall seemed absolutely on fire. Maybe it was desperation among Democrats who realize that Obama could possibly lose. Maybe it was the acoustics. Whatever the reason, I don’t know anyone who didn’t notice the difference.\n\nConventions don’t win or lose elections, but they can help or hurt.

Click \"Updates\" above to see the latest.\n\nThe goal of this set is to blend two creative arts together for an enriching, entertaining and educational experience.\n\nFans of LEGO brick-building will be introduced to the art of magic as they embark on a journey into the colourful world of conjuring & prestidigitation in the \"History of Magic Museum\".\n\nThe \"History of Magic Museum\" is a historically accurate magic-themed three-storey building that highlights some of the greatest illusions and magicians in the history of magic.\n\nIt is highly detailed with numerous LEGO replicas of authentic magic & illusion props used by illusionists from the past to present day.\n\nThere are more than half a dozen play features and removable brick-built illusion displays.\n\nSIZE\n\nThe size of the build (16 x 16 stud footprint) was deliberately made smaller than a full modular-sized building but was designed to visually fit with other official modular buildings as well as the smaller creator series buildings such as the Corner Deli and Bike Shop & Cafe.\n\nIt works as a corner building or a \"set-in' building, in-between two other modular buildings.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nFront & Back Exterior\n\nA set of glass windows adorn the front of the building on the ground floor. Deep red velvet curtains revealing magic props and a traditional magician's attire with top hat on a mannequin can be seen through the windows.\n\nA large 3D “rabbit from a top hat” sign is mounted above the ground floor front windows.\n\nA lamppost in the form of a magic wand is set on the corner of the building property.\n\nThe second floor has multiple glass windows so that exhibits can be seen from the outside.\n\nThe third floor has a different design for visual variety and to maximise space.\n\nThe back of the building has a recessed back door with an electronic keypad lock, a jail-bar style window and some greenery on the back wall.\n\nThe roof has a skylight, aircon compressor and a drain for rain water that can run down a set of pipes mounted on the back of the building.\n\nGround Floor Interior: Chamber of Close-up & Stage Magic\n\nThe ground floor features many authentic and historically accurate display pieces and artefacts in the genre of close-up and stage magic. The displays on this floor include:\n\nThe close-up magic wall that features a portrait of \"The Professor\" Dai Vernon and various close-up magic props such as cards, silver coins, a set of copper cups & balls and his \"Master Fellowship\" award from the Academy of Magical Arts (1968).\n\nA modern version of J.N. Hofzinser's Dancing cane (next to back door).\n\nA Botania flower production and a Square Circle production box invented by Louis Histed. (front display window).\n\nA mannequin donning a classic magician’s top hat, white gloves and tail coat attire from the vaudeville \"Golden age of Magic\" (1880s to the 1930s).\n\nA collection of artefacts related to the infamous “Bullet Catch” illusion including a musket used by Scottish magician John Henry Anderson in 1840, a copy of the letter from Houdini’s mentor, Harry Keller, dated 1918, who wrote to him to dissuade him from performing the bullet catch and a 1918 newspaper article on the death of American magician William Ellsworth Robinson (AKA Chung Ling Soo) due to the bullet catch act going wrong.\n\nTwo sets of book cases containing copies of the most important texts in magic including David Devant's \"Secrets of My Magic\", S.W. Erdnase’s \"Expert at the Card Table\" and Harlan Tarbell’s “Tarbell Course in Magic”.\n\nOne of the bookcases can swing open 90 degrees to reveal a ladder that leads to the 2nd level. The other bookcase can be completely removed to reveal a hidden display case for a 1st Edition of “The Discoverie of Witchcraft” (1584) written by English magician, Reginald Scot; considered the first magic book in history.\n\n2nd Floor Interior: Tribute to Houdini\n\nThe second floor is a tribute to arguably the most famous and influential magician and escape artist in history, Harry Houdini. The floor showcases a variety of historical props and restraints used by Houdini in his illustrious career.\n\nA recreation of the Scotland Yard jail cell that Houdini escaped from in 1904 and a map showing its location.\n\nA straight jacket used by Houdini during his career.\n\nHoudini’s version of John Neville Maskelyne’s “Substitution Trunk” Illusion (1894).\n\nThe “Water Torture Cell” that debuted in 1912.\n\nA ticket and playbill from Houdini’s first European tour in 1900.\n\nA pair of handcuffs used in Houdini’s crate escape from New York's East River on July 7, 1912 as well as a photo of the East River location where the escape took place.\n\n3rd Floor Interior: Hall of Illusions\n\nThis floor is dedicated to the genre of large-scale illusions in magic. It features 3 removable classic illusions including:\n\nRobert Harbin’s “Zig Zag Girl” Illusion (Mid-1960s).\n\nP. T. Selbit’s original “Sawing Through a Woman” (1920) on a platform.\n\nFrank Hewes’ “Sword Suspension” Illusion (1899).\n\nMINIFIGURES\n\nThere is a total of 5 minifigures inclusive of 1 curator/ magician, 2 museum visitors and 2 faceless mannequins for the illusion displays.",

  "latent_24898": "Motorola Mobility has sued Apple over various wireless patent violations by six of its products including the iPhone 4S, reports Retuers. The suit was filed in a Florida court and exercises patents related to antenna technology and more.\n\nThe case was filed in a Florida court on Wednesday and Motorola says that it involves six of Apple’s products including the iPhone 4S. Motorola claims that Apple has infringed on patents related to wireless antenna technology, software, data filtering and messaging.\n\nApple’s arguments that Motorola had done the same to several Apple design patents were denied by the U.S. International Trade Commission just last week.\n\nWhile no mention was made of Google in the lawsuit, you can be sure that this has everything to do with the Android maker’s desire to protect its stake in the mobile market by gaining patent leverage. If Google were to win a patent case, via its soon-to-be-subsidiary Motorola Mobility, it would help to insulate it against further claims brought by Apple against it or any of the companies that make Android devices.\n\nAnd, as Jordan Golson of Macrumors points out, Google had to sign off on the lawsuit for it to be filed.\n\nThe merger agreement between Google and Motorola Mobility requires the company to get Google’s permission before asserting “any Intellectual Property Right in any new Action”. As a result, this lawsuit is the closest Apple and Google have come to direct litigation.\n\nThere is always the possibility that Google has bolstered Motorola’s complaints against Apple with its own trove of patents. This is something that it has done in Apple’s case against HTC.\n\nIn August of last year, Motorola was sued by Apple in Europe over the design of its Xoom tablet, in a case that is still ongoing.\n\nMotorola has also filed suit against Apple in the US, claiming infringement against 18 patents in the District Courts, as well as with the International Trade Commission.

  "latent_24911": "OTTAWA—Canada’s military says it needs to upgrade its defences against cyberattacks, documents released by the Department of National Defence read. The documents, released by the department earlier this month, detail a significant and long-term project to give military brass better “situational awareness” of cyber space, guard against attacks, and “respond” to “advanced threats.”\n\nCanadian special forces man an observation bunker on Feb. 20, 2017 in northern Iraq. The federal defence department wants to upgrade the military's ability to ward off cyber attacks which are increasingly becoming part of modern warfare. ( Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\nThe push for stronger online defences comes as Canada and NATO allies are adapting military doctrine to address the growing role of cyber operations in modern warfare. “The . . . Canadian Armed Forces has invested heavily in technologies that have radically increased the speed and precision of modern military operations. Underpinning most of these incredible leaps in capability has been a reliance on an increasingly complex cyberspace,” the documents read. “To deliver on its core responsibilities to defend Canada . . . (The Forces must have the) capabilities and flexibility required to successfully address both conventional and asymmetric threats, including cyberattacks.”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nCyberattacks can range from the mundane – temporarily shutting down a website or spreading false information online, for instance – to serious, sophisticated attacks against real-world targets. There are two separate but related initiatives laid out in the documents: a Cyber Security Awareness project and an upgraded Defensive Cyber Operations unit. The former aims to give military commanders better awareness of the Forces’ online security, while the latter would create an in-house team to monitor DND’s networks around the clock to detect and respond to cyberattacks and “maintain commanders’ freedom of manoeuvre in cyberspace.” The cost of the new initiatives were not included in the documents, although DND estimated last year the Defensive Cyber Operations component could cost between $50 million and $99 million alone. The projects are in their early stages — the department is looking for feedback from private suppliers, with an eye to awarding a contract in 2021.\n\nAccording to DND spokesperson Jessica Lamirande, the upgrades are expected to provide more information about cyberattacks against the department faster. “(The projects) will move the organization from its current manual response posture, to a proactive posture in which the commander of the cyber defensive mission can anticipate and make rapid decisions, informed by intelligence and the near real time analysis of network activity,” the statement said.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAt the Halifax International Security Forum in November, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said cyber warfare is a constant consideration for the alliance. “There is no military operation today without a cyber element,” he said. “We see that cyber is an area where there are constant attacks from states but also non-state actors.” A report that same month from Reuters indicated that some NATO countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, are “drawing up principles” to guide their militaries in launching cyberattacks. Typically, the Canadian government prefers to talk about cyber defence. But while the DND projects detailed in the documents refer only to defensive operations, the department admitted in March they’re studying cyber weapons. And legislation currently before parliament would authorize the Communications Security Establishment, Canada’s electronic spy agency, to launch cyberattacks.",
  "latent_25009": "Back in July a company called Life’s Entropy opened up. I loved the science-y themes and the products were truly unique for the realm of indie makeup. Contouring sticks, a serum to lighten your foundation, lip products similar to OCC Lip Tars…I knew I needed to pick some up! I placed an order on July 21st for two lip theory samples, an eyeshadow sample, and a sample of their Proton contour stick. I just received them today (August 5th). Other than swatching, I haven’t tried anything out, but everything feels lovely.\n\nAnyways! On to the point! Today I am focusing on the lip theories I purchased in Crystal Violet and Transformation. This is not an official review as I’ve had them a day, but here we go!\n\nThese are what the sample sizes look like!\n\nCrystal Violet Lip Theory\n\nTransformation Lip Theory\n\nThese Lip Theories apply exactly like an OCC Lip Tar, although I found the application to be smoother and less messy. They go on opaque and you don’t need to use much product. It takes a while for them to completely dry down, but when they do, they last a while. I ate and drank while wearing them, and all together they lasted about four hours before they faded. Although I DID experience fading, the color faded evenly, which was a massive win for me! OCC Lip Tars fade unevenly and fall into the cracks of my lips. These don’t! I think I am going to love these!\n\nEach Lip Theory sample is $1.50, and a full size is $8. You get plenty of product to try out in the sample, and I highly recommend that if you are looking to branch out into brighter lip shades!\n\nI have nothing negative to say about these as of yet! The packaging is sturdy (even for samples) and the size is generous. The staying power is there (considering the conditions I put them through).",
  "latent_25070": "Social desperation has led to an increase in the number of suicides while life expectancy has dropped and infant mortality has risen significantly.\n\nSo what does the troika have in mind for Greece after the elections? First of all, if Greece against all odds should actually be forced to leave the euro zone this would certainly be accompanied by a massive devaluation of a new drachma which in turn would lead to a further loss of purchasing power and have a dramatic effect on the poorest sections of society. Also, a devalued drachma would attract foreign investors who would be able to engage in a new round of currency speculation and could then use their profits to buy up even more small and medium sized Greek businesses at rock bottom prices. Moreover, a devaluation of the drachma would prolong repaying government debt and lead to an extension of debt servicing over more than a generation.\n\nBut what if Greece were allowed to stay a member of the euro zone? Could this go along with an easing of austerity measures? Quite the contrary: In order to repay government debt which in relation to GDP is presently 27 % higher than when austerity started in 2010, the new rulers in Athens would not only have to stick to the path set out by the troika, but would even have to tighten austerity measures, further cutting government spending, laying off more public workers, and increasing the exploitation of labor in order to improve the economy’s ‘competitiveness’.\n\nHowever, as all these measures would very certainly not suffice to significantly lower Greek government debt, one should be prepared for even sharper moves. It is worthwhile taking a look at the troika’s intervention in Cyprus where the bail-out of banks (saving banks with taxpayers’ money) was partly replaced by a bail-in, i.e. forcing small investors and savers to bear the burden of repaying government debt. Also, one should look at the IMF’s publication “Taxing Times” published in October 2013, which proposes a 10 % tax on all private households in order to fill the holes in state budgets. One should definitely expect the troika to enforce measures like these on any future government in Athens.\n\nBut what if Syriza wins the elections on 25 January 2015? Would they be able to withstand the troika’s demands and lead Greece out of its crisis? Well, let’s take a look at their program: On the one hand they are promising Greek voters to put an end to austerity, but on the other they are announcing that they will keep cooperating with the EU. This is, to say the least, a highly contradictory strategy of which one thing can be said for sure: That it will meet with the troika’s fiercest resistance.\n\nSo far Syriza’s leaders and a lot of their followers seem oblivious to the fact that the troika – the executive organ of European and American finance capital and the major international driving force of global financial markets – is much more powerful than any single government in the world. If Syriza does come to power and actually starts cutting back on austerity measures, one can be sure that the financial markets will immediately react, and this reaction will resemble an earthquake. They will bring down the Greek economy within days and force Syriza to comply with the demands of big international financial institutions or resign. This in turn will lead to factional struggles within Syriza and also bring about to a massive radicalization of disappointed voters who will demand that Syriza stick to every one of its promises.\n\nActually, it is this development that Germany’s government, the EU and the IMF fear most: They are deadly afraid that once Syriza gets tangled up in its contradictory policies, the working people of Greece could insist on their demands, take to the streets in huge numbers and spark off protests and demonstrations in other European countries which could easily assume dimensions not seen on the continent since World War II.\n\nErnst Wolff is a freelance journalist and the author of the book “Pillaging the World.

  "latent_25216": "Our number one tip: Find at least one strategic partner. A strategic partner is someone who has a similar, but not competing business. They are business owners who come into regular contact with your target market and can make strategic alliances with you. For example, an art supply store (although invaluable to our craft) would not be a good strategic partner because they cater to other artists, but a home décor store or realtor would be a fantastic strategic partner because they cater to people who are looking to update the art and décor in their homes.\n\nEstablish a social media presence. Make sure your social media accounts – and you definitely need more than one – are cohesive. This lets your target market grow familiar with you and your artist brand. Don’t overdo social media, though, by signing up for every platform out there. Choose the ones that have the most appeal for your target market, not for you. Whatever you do, don’t establish a bigger social media presence than you can manage.\n\nStart on another platform then open a website. A platform like Etsy is a great place to start because it markets for you. Start there and use the popularity it can help you create to drive traffic to your own artist website. The beauty of both these platforms is they give the art loving world a twenty-four hour a day look at your creations.\n\nAll artists love their work and want to share it with the world. While appreciation for your art is a wonderful feeling, dollars in the bank feel pretty good, too. How do you use the Internet to get more of those dollars? Selling art online is a great way to gain exposure for your work and to free up time to create more art work. So, here’s our best advice.Go create a piece of art while you think over these options. Then get to work identifying your target market. That can be done with surveys, polls and contests and can grow your online audience like crazy!",
  "latent_25244": "Every so often contrarians post old newspaper quotes with the implication that nothing being talked about now is unprecedented or even unusual. And frankly, there are lots of old articles that get things wrong, are sensationalist or made predictions without a solid basis. And those are just the articles about the economy.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of science articles that are just interesting, reporting events and explorations in the Arctic and elsewhere that give a fascinating view into how early scientists were coming to an understanding about climate change and processes. In particular, in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic the summer of 1922 was (for the time) quite warm, and there were a number of reports that discussed some unprecedented (again, for the time) observations of open water. The most detailed report was in the Monthly Weather Review:\n\nThe same report was picked up by the Associated Press and short summary articles appeared in the Washington Post and L.A. Times on Nov 2nd (right). As you can read, the basic story is that open water was seen up to 81º 29’N near Spitzbergen (now referred to as Svalbard), and that this was accompanied by a shift in ecosystems and some land ice melting. It seems that the writers were more concerned with fishing than climate change though.\n\nThis clip started showing up around Aug 2007 (this is the earliest mention I can find). The main point in bringing it up was (I imagine) to have a bit of fun by noting the similarity of the headline “Arctic Ocean Getting Warm” and contemporaneous headlines discussing the very low sea ice amounts in 2007. Of course, this doesn’t imply that the situation was the same back in 1922 compared to 2007 (see below).\n\nThe text of Washington Post piece soon started popping up on blogs and forums. Sometime in late 2009, probably as part of a mass-forwarded email (remember those?), the text started appearing with the following addition (with small variations, e.g. compare this and this):\n\nI apologize, I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922. As reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post\n\nHowever, the text was still pretty much what was in the Washington Post article (some versions had typos of “Consulafft” instead of “Consul Ifft” (the actual consul’s name) and a few missing words). Snopes looked into it and they agreed that this was basically accurate – and they correctly concluded that the relevance to present-day ice conditions was limited.\n\nBut sometime in January 2010 (the earliest version I can find is from 08/Jan/2010), a version of the email started circulating with an extra line added:\n\n“Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coastal cities uninhabitable.”\n\nThis is odd on multiple levels. First of all, the rest of the piece is just about observations, not predictions of any sort. Nor is there any source given for these mysterious predictions (statistics? soothsaying? folk wisdom?). Indeed, since ice melt large enough to ‘make most coastal cities uninhabitable’ would be a big deal, you’d think that the Consul and AP would have been a little more concerned about the level of the sea instead of the level of the seals. In any case, the line is completely made up, a fiction, an untruth, a lie.\n\nBut now, instead of just an observation that sounds like observations being made today, the fake quote is supposed to demonstrate that people (implicitly scientists) have been making alarmist and unsupported claims for decades with obvious implications. This is pretty low by any standards.\n\nThe article with the fake quote has done the rounds of most of the major contrarian sites – including the GWPF, right-wing leaning local papers (Provo, UT), magazines (Quadrant in Australia, Canada Free Press) and blogs (eg. Small dead animals). The only pseudo-sceptic blog that doesn’t appear to have used it is WUWT! (though it has come up in comments). This is all despite some people noting that the last line was fake (at least as early as April 2011). Some of the mentions even link to the Snopes article (which doesn’t mention the fake last line) as proof that their version (with the fake quote) is authentic.\n\nLast week it was used again by Richard Rahn in the Washington Times, and the fake quote was extracted and tweeted by CFACT, which is where I saw it.\n\nSo we have a situation where something real and actually interesting is found in the archives, it gets misrepresented as a ‘gotcha’ talking point, but someone thinks it can be made ‘better’ and so adds a fake last line to sex it up. Now with twitter, with its short quotes, some contrarians only quote the fakery. And thus a completely false talking point is created out of the whole cloth.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not unusual.\n\nComparing 1922 and now\n\nTo understand why the original story is actually interesting, we need a little context. Estimates of Arctic sea ice go back to the 19th Century from fishing vessels and explorers though obviously they have got better in recent decades because of the satellite coverage. The IPCC AR5 report (Figure 4.3) shows a compilation of sea ice extent from HadISST1 (which is being updated as we speak), but it is clear enough for our purposes:\n\nI have annotated the summer of 1922, which did see quite a large negative excursion Arctic-wide compared to previous years, though the excursion is perhaps not that unusual for the period. A clearer view can be seen in the Danish ice charts for August 1921 and 1922 (via the Icelandic Met Office):\n\nThe latitude for open-water in the 1922 figure is around 81ºN, as reported by the Consul. Browsing other images in the series indicates that Spitzbergen almost always remained ice-bound even in August, so the novelty of the 1922 observation is clear.\n\nBut what of now? We can look at the August 2013 operational ice charts (that manually combine satellite and in situ observations) from the Norwegian Met Office, and focus on the area of Svalbard/Spitzbergen. Note that 2013 was the widely touted year that Arctic sea ice ‘recovered’:\n\nThe open-water easily extends to past 84ºN – many hundreds of kilometers further north than the ‘unprecedented’ situation in 1922. Data from the last 4 years shows some variability of course, but by late August there is consistently open-water further north than 81ºN 30′. The Consul’s observation, far from being novel, is now commonplace.\n\nThis implies that this article – when seen in context – is actually strongly confirming of a considerable decline in Arctic sea ice over the last 90 years. Not that CFACT is going to tweet that.",

  "latent_25928": "1 . The Bullpen\n\nThe 2014 Oakland Athletics have 13 blown saves in 35 opportunities, a 63% conversion rate that makes them 7th-worst in the majors. Of those 13 blown saves, Luke Gregerson has 6, Sean Doolittle has 3, and Dan Otero has 3. Jim Johnson? He only has 1. Despite the blown saves, the A’s have the 3rd-best bullpen by WAR, due in large part to a 2nd-best Walks per 9 innings of 2.45 and 5th-best runners Left On Base rate of 76.9%. The poster boy for this bullpen’s success may be Fernando Abad, who has inherited 16 runners this year and not allowed a single one to score. He is the only pitcher in baseball to have inherited more than 12 runners and not allowed any to score.\n\nMore from Analysis Oakland Athletics: Billy Beane’s thoughts as the trade deadline approaches\n\nOakland Athletics: Is Dan Straily returning home for a playoff push?\n\nAthletics even the series with a 4-3 win\n\nA’s tripped up in San Francisco\n\nOAK 8, CWS 1: Daniel Mengden, A’s cruise past White Sox\n\n2 . The Unlucky Ones\n\nOakland has three hitters in the top 25 players with the lowest Batting Average on Balls In Play: Josh Donaldson ranks 7th-lowest (.250), Alberto Callaspo is 10th (.253), and Jed Lowrie is 20th (.267). Yoenis Cespedes ranks 26th, at .271. Oakland’s patience/power approach championed by Chili Davis (which is inherently fly ball-centric) naturally depress BABIP, as fly balls are more often converted into outs than groundballs. To illustrate this point, the A’s have the fewest groundballs per fly ball in the majors, at .67. Regression to the mean in the form of batted balls falling for hits should be expected in the 2nd half of the season, however, as it is highly unusual to have so many hitters with depressed BABIP, especially line drive hitters like Jed Lowrie. For a baseline reference, league average BABIP is .299 so far this year.\n\n3 . Team BABIP\n\nMore Batting Average on Balls In Play: In addition to the four players mentioned above, the Oakland A’s as a team are tied for the 2nd-lowest BABIP in the majors, at .286. Only the Padres have a lower hitting BABIP. Conversely, while pitching, the A’s have the 2nd-lowest BABIP against, at .273, meaning Oakland pitchers have been benefiting from a lot of luck. Some of this overall team BABIP depression has to do with the fact that the Coliseum is a pitchers park, and more fly balls fall for outs as opposed to home runs. Most of it is luck, however.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have given away 7 more full innings worth of bunt outs to opposing teams than the Athletics have.\n\n4 . No Bunting\n\nThe 2014 Oakland Athletics have the fewest successful sacrifice bunts in baseball this year, with 7. The next-closest team is the Astros, with 9. For comparison, the Texas Rangers have the most successful sacrifice bunts in the AL, with 28. Simply put, the A’s deserve a round of applause. While it might be a coincidence that the A’s have the best record in baseball with the fewest successful sac bunts while the Rangers have the worst record with the most sac bunts (in the AL), I’m going to say it’s not a coincidence. To put it another way, the Rangers have given away 7 more full innings worth of outs to opposing pitchers than the Athletics have due to bunts. Think about that – it’s almost a full game worth of free outs the Rangers have given to the opposing team in the hopes of advancing runners who may not score.\n\n5 . Plate Discipline\n\nThe A’s have the highest walk percentage in baseball at 9.6%, as well as the 2nd-lowest strikeout percentage at 17.9%. Oakland is 1st in the majors in strikeouts per walk, with 1.86, and it’s not even close – the next closest team is the Rays, with 2.02 SO/BB. For comparison, Seattle is last in this category, with 3.25 strikeouts for every one of their walks. Basically, the Oakland A’s are a meat grinder which opposing pitchers are fed into.\n\n6 . Master Thieving\n\nOakland has the 2nd-highest success rate for stolen bases at 82%. The A’s have 54 stolen bases and have only been caught stealing 12 times, with Craig Gentry being the driving force behind the success – he was 16/16 on the year before being caught for the first time (trying to steal third) on July 8th. Having Coco Crisp, who is 16 for 20 in stolen base attempts, doesn’t hurt either.\n\n7 . Hitting Soft Toss\n\nHere’s a strange one I came across: the 2014 Oakland Athletics have faced the slowest average fastball velocity of any team in the majors, at 91 MPH. This is a full 3/10 of a MPH slower than the next closest team. That is a major drop off; Oakland is the sole outlier in baseball here. Let’s take a look at this graph, which shows the average fastball velocity every team has faced:\n\nWhile it is hard to look too deeply into this, Oakland has definitely faced far more soft-tossers than all other teams in baseball. At this level, that discrepancy is going to impact performance, and it’s going to benefit the A’s.\n\n8 . Donaldson’s Fielding\n\nJosh Donaldson has a fielding UZR of 13.0 so far this season. If you don’t know what UZR is, don’t worry – simply, it assigns positive points for difficult plays turned into outs and negative points for outs that should’ve been made and weren’t. The more difficult the play, the more points the play is worth. The next closest third baseman to Josh Donaldson by UZR, Nolan Arenado, has a 7.3 rating. Yes, it’s an incredibly small sample size so far this year, and yes, Donaldson is an absurdly good defensive third baseman. Allow me to illustrate:\n\nI will use GIFs of Donaldson’s tarp catches until I am told to stop.\n\nA’s Pace Watch :\n\nThe 2014 Oakland Athletics are 59-36 after 95 games, and are still underperforming their Pythagorean win-loss record, which would give them 63 wins based on their runs scored/runs allowed. This is not a small difference, especially in a division that features two of baseball’s other best teams. As stated before in previous entries, deviation from Pythagorean record is due mainly to over or underperformance in one-run games; blown saves and clutch hitting performance are the best metrics to look at when studying this deviation. A quick look tells us the A’s have struggled with blown saves, especially early in the season, while the same can be true for clutch hitting – though they showed great improvement in this latter category in June/early July. The 2014 Oakland Athletics are 14-12 in one-run games.\n\nWith the pace the A’s are currently on, they will win 101 games, while their projected Pythagorean win total puts them at 104 games.",
  "latent_25938": "For more than a decade, researchers have been interested in developing a bra embedded with thermodynamic sensors that could help screen for breast cancer. Cyrcadia Health, previously First Warning Systems, has been working toward this goal since 2008. Most recently, the company, in partnership with Cisco and Ironbound Films, released the trailer of a documentary called “Detected” at SXSW. The film follows Cyrcadia’s development of the iTBra through prototypes and clinical trials.\n\nThe iTbra uses heat sensors that track the temperature fluctuations in a woman’s breasts, and from this data maps out a wearer’s circadian pattern, or daily norms. The pattern is then relayed from the bra to a computer by USB and run through predictive analytics the company has developed to determine whether or not it signals the presence of cancer. Rob Royea, the CEO of Cyrcadia Health, explains: if a flattened circadian profile is identified, it may be indicative of cancer in the same way a flattened EKG profile is indicative of cardiac arrest.\n\nWhat Royea means is this: for a healthy individual, there is likely to be a high degree of temperature variation over a normal 22 to 26 hour cycle. Exercise, hot flashes and sleep will all cause shifts in a woman's baseline temperature. However, individuals with breast cancer typically have temperature profiles that are consistently compressed, with little variation.\n\nUsers must wear the bra for a length of time between two and 24 hours for each respective screening, in order for it to gather the data necessary for this map to be generated. The technology that Cyrcadia has developed currently lives in patches that can be adhered to any bra, but the company is building an integrated sports bra in partnership with Flextronics. This version will be Bluetooth- and WiFi-enabled, allowing wearers to share their information with family and friends for support.\n\nAccording to Royea, the product, now in clinical testing, has come a long way since he first started working on it. “When I came aboard, I was presented with an analog device that looked like an angry octopus,\" he says. \"The question was: can this technology evolve into something that can be scalable?”\n\nThe premise behind the product is certainly a good one. A bra of this type could conveniently and inexpensively monitor the wearer between self-exams and regular breast cancer screenings. But what the company is still missing is comprehensive data to support its claims, says H. Gilbert Welch, a professor at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine and the author of Less Medicine, More Health. While it is an attention-grabbing invention, gathering sufficient data will be an important move for Cyrcadia to validate the effectiveness of the iTBra.\n\n“It is way too early to suggest that monitoring circadian temperature changes in the breast will help anybody,\" says Welch. “While it’s tempting to believe 'newer is always better,' this is a totally untested technology that may well prove to produce more harm than good.”\n\nElaine Schattner, an associate professor at Weill Cornell Medical College and medical journalist, adds, “The iTBra is essentially an untested, commercial device that may tempt some women who don't want to go through the hassle and alleged risks of mammography. It's not plausible that such a contraption would detect early-stage breast cancer in many or most cases. Women who wish to be screened for breast cancer would be wiser, instead, to go with a proven method.”\n\nRoyea and his team created the product in response to two key gaps they observed in the breast cancer screening process today. For women with dense breast tissue, mammography has been found, in certain cases, to be less effective. He believes that using this technology may someday provide an alternative or supplementary option. The iTBra could also potentially be used post-mammography to determine whether a biopsy is required. Today, 80 percent of breast biopsies are done on non-cancerous tissue.\n\nThus far, Cyrcadia has conducted clinical trials with 500 women in partnership with Ohio State University. While it is a small sample size, the results showed that the iTBra was 87 percent accurate when it came to correlating tumors with cancer. Mammography is 83 percent accurate. Within the next six months, under the guidance of lead principal investigator, Joshua D. I. Ellenhorn, professor of surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the company will conduct more trials at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, California in parntership with the Canary Center at Stanford, as well as another large-scale trial including 10,000 women in India and Singapore. These locations were chosen, says Royea, because of the company’s partnerships and the growing incidence rate for cancer in Asia.\n\nIn response to skeptics, Royea points to existing research on the relationship between temperature and cancer cell division that has laid a foundation for the product. He expects that the upcoming trials and support of physicians, including William Farrar, chief of surgical oncology at Ohio State University, who will serve as Cyrcadia's acting Chief Medical Officer, will provide more validation.\n\nDepending on the trials’ results, Cyrcadia plans to release the product in Asia and Europe in early 2016. Waiting for FDA approval, the company hopes to launch in the U.S. later that year. The product provides a “low-cost” option, says Royea, estimating it to cost less than $99 for a version that women could use for monthly screenings. In addition to the consumer version, the company is focusing on a product for oncologists to use to scan patients to insure that biopsies are necessary.\n\nSeth Kramer, the filmmaker behind the Detected documentary, which will be released later this year, was drawn to telling this product’s story because of its interesting confluence between the “Internet of Things” and medical advances. “It’s a glimpse into the future,” he says.",
  "latent_26113": "This week, The Boot Room had the absolute pleasure of interviewing Tony Barrett, Merseyside football writer at The Times newspaper. Tony is renowned across the industry for his inside expertise concerning the region’s top clubs, with particular emphasis on his knowledge of goings on at Anfield.\n\nIn the following Q&A, we talk football journalism, life after Luis Suarez, Liverpool’s Champions League hopes and much, much more. We hope you enjoy!\n\nWhy did football journalism appeal so much to you as a career path? And, what advice would you give to younger, aspiring writers looking to break into the industry?\n\nI wanted to be a football journalist from the age of six or seven. My dad was a Guardian reader and I always liked David Lacey’s writing and I was also a big fan of Brian Reade’s, so they were my main influences in terms of wanting to do what they did. I was a football fanatic to a ridiculous degree as a kid, I’d walk my ball up the stairs going to bed and back down again after getting up and every spare minute was spent either watching, playing or reading about football and I knew very early on that I wanted to work in the game in some way. Like 99% of kids, I wasn’t good enough to be a professional footballer, the first division of the Liverpool Sunday League was as good as it got for me, so I focused on writing about the game which to me is the next best thing.\n\nThe best advice that was given to me as a young writer was to do speak to people. That seems basic, and in many ways it is, but the only chance you’ve got of informing others is if you’re informed yourself. Pretty much anyone can write, by that I mean most of us can put words down in an order that others can read and come up with arguments that put forward our point of view. But the difference between writing and informed writing is the knowledge you glean from contacts. The best journalists have the best and most wide ranging contacts and it’s that that makes their writing the most informative even if there are others who write with more flair.\n\nBrendan Rodgers didn’t hold back during summer, signing no less than eight first-team players with the money received from Luis Suarez’s departure. But, of all the players brought to the club this season, who has impressed you the most?\n\nI wouldn’t have said this at the start of the season but as the campaign wears on Emre Can is the one who stands out. He really does look a special player. When he first arrived he lacked the stamina to play in his preferred central midfield role but he’s worked on his fitness and Brendan Rodgers came up with a masterstroke by putting him in a back three and his talent is there for all to see. I’ve also been impressed by Alberto Moreno and I’m expecting Lazar Markovic to improve in the months and years to come.\n\nLiverpool have clearly adopted a very different system since the sale of Suarez, with Rodgers now favouring a 3-5-2 set-up. Do you agree that they are now offering far more in their overall performances, with their defensive solidity proving paramount?\n\nTheir performances now speak for themselves. I honestly believe there’s a strong argument that this Liverpool side is already a more well rounded team than the one that came so close to winning the league title last season. It is more compact, more solid and has a much stronger mentality. Obviously, there is no Luis Suarez but as a group of eleven players I think this team has a lot more of the qualities that you need to flourish in English football on a long term basis.\n\nThroughout this period of superb form, a number of individuals have upped their game with tremendous effect. We have had a stab at highlighting the club’s biggest improvers since before Christmas – https://tbrfootball.com/five-liverpool-improvers-beginning-impress/ – but for you, who has experienced the biggest surge of form?\n\nSimon Mignolet. I’ve been one of his biggest critics, calling for him to be dropped in the autumn when his form slumped and generally being unimpressed by his overall game since he signed. But since coming back into the side on Boxing Day his entire approach has been transformed. He’s coming for crosses and getting them, taking responsibility for his own penalty area, knocking forwards (and sometimes his own defenders!) about and producing good, solid, all round performances in pretty much every game. His kicking could be better but given the overall improvement that’s just nit picking. Full credit to him for recognising his Liverpool career was on the line and doing something about it.\n\nConsidering Jordon Ibe’s rapid rise to first team prominence, and Raheem Sterling before hand, are there any relatively unknown youngsters who you could see making the same impact? Also, in terms of his potential development, how does Ibe compare to Sterling?\n\nI watch a lot of Academy football and to be honest I thought Ibe was ready to become part of the Liverpool squad at the start of this season. Brendan Rodgers clearly knows infinitely more about player development than I do though and his decision to send Ibe out on loan to Derby County has paid dividends as he’s returned to Liverpool a better and more mature player than he left it. In terms of development, I see no reason why Ibe can’t replicate the impact that Sterling has had at Liverpool and with England.\n\nThere are quite a few quality young players emerging at Liverpool at the moment and you’ve probably heard of most of them but if I had to pick one I’d go for Adam Phillips. He won’t be next off the production line because the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jerome Sinclair and Shey Ojo are ahead of him at the moment but he’s a midfielder with a lot of talent and a really good attitude and he’s already caught Rodgers’ eye.\n\nAt The Boot Room we have been mightily impressed with the performances of Emre Can, who has excelled despite being played in a less familiar centre-back role. How important will the German be for the Reds going forward, and in which position do you envisage him playing in the long-term?\n\nGoing forward, Can will be a central midfielder and a top class one at that. Rodgers described him as “a Rolls Royce” of a footballer and it’s easy to see why. He just glides past players and his composure, for a player of his age, is ridiculous. He looks every inch a future Liverpool captain.\n\nConsidering the number of young players already standing out for the Reds (the likes of Coutinho, Sterling, Can), do the club have a realistic chance of competing for the league in the next few years? Or, do they lack that ‘winning mentality’, much like Arsenal this past decade?\n\nI think we’re seeing a winning mentality develop at Liverpool. They are now finding ways to win, be it through the kind of individual brilliance showed by Coutinho against Man City and Bolton Wanderers, or a collective belligerence and refusal to yield that allowed them to beat Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton. The next step is to take it a step further and win a trophy. Should they do that this season, obviously the FA Cup is their only remaining chance, then I expect Liverpool to grow still further next season.\n\nPerhaps the biggest talking point of the season so far has been Steven Gerrard’s decision to leave the club upon expiry of his contract at the end of the season. In your opinion, have the club handled this is the correct manner, or would it have been better to retain his services – even as a squad player – to support the club in an off-field capacity?\n\nFor me, both Gerrard and the club have handled his departure as well as they possibly could. The old adage about no one being bigger than the club remains as true now as it ever was but Gerrard is one of those figures of such rare significance that the moment when he decided to leave was always going to be massive. I think it’s right that he’s going at the end of this season, primarily because that’s the way he sees it. Steven Gerrard knows himself better than anyone else and he knows exactly what he wants from the final years of his career so if he believes playing regular football for LA Galaxy is best for him, who are we to argue?\n\nHis influence will be missed, though, there is no question about that. I don’t think people outside the club realise the esteem that he’s held in within the club. Almost without exception, players past and present love him. Finding a like for like replacement is impossible. Liverpool may sign a top class footballer who performs brilliantly but I honestly don’t think it’s possible, not in the short term anyway, to find another player who means as much to the club, the players and the supporters as Gerrard does.\n\nWith Stevie G’s departure imminent, Jordan Henderson, who has experienced a huge turn around at Anfield, looks set to become the club’s permanent captain from next season onwards. Is the 24-year-old guaranteed this role, or could he still be overlooked by Rodgers for someone more experienced? Furthermore, can you envisage him captaining England one day?\n\nI think Henderson will get the captaincy. Ideally, there would be another more senior player ready to take over from Gerrard but Liverpool are a very young team and Henderson is the outstanding candidate in the current squad. It’s not that I don’t think Henderson will make a good captain because he’s shown enough already to suggest that he will, it’s more that I believe he’s still a developing footballer and the best thing for everyone would be if he was able to focus on himself and his own game for the next couple of years. But as it is, he’s probably the best man for the job and on that basis he should be promoted. As for captaining England, that could follow if he does well in the role for Liverpool.\n\nDoes the whole ‘Balotelli penalty debate’ perhaps show a division in the camp between the Italian and Liverpool’s senior players? And, what did you make of the situation? Did Balotelli have the right to take the spot kick considering his incredible record?\n\nI hated the whole Balotelli penalty debate. For me, it should only have become a major issue in the event of him missing. As it was, he took responsibility at a big moment and scored a crucial goal. Obviously, the internal politics and dressing room etiquette added a different dimension to the situation but I think if you would have asked the entire Anfield crowd to vote on who they wanted to take the penalty, Balotelli would have won by a landslide.\n\nOn the subject of Balotelli, do you think Daniel Sturridge’s return to action will kick-start his career on Merseyside? We have certainly seen improvements in recent weeks, but Rodgers seems somewhat reluctant to trust him in the starting line-up. Do you think this is the case?\n\nIt’s hard to see Balotelli having a future at Liverpool beyond this season. If Liverpool can find a buyer willing to pay a decent price during the summer they will let him go. I don’t buy into the idea that Balotelli is such a bad influence that he can’t be incorporated into a team but he’s yet to really fit in at Liverpool for various reasons and there’s no point keeping him if he isn’t going to play.\n\nDo you believe renovating Anfield is the right step for Liverpool to take, or should Liverpool have built a new stadium like Arsenal did with the Emirates?\n\nTo be honest, I couldn’t cope with the idea of leaving Anfield. For me, it’s the only place that should ever be Liverpool’s home ground. I understand the reasons why people would argue for a new ground but I don’t think you give up something as special as Anfield unless you absolutely have to.\n\nFinally, fast-forward to the 1st June. Liverpool’s domestic season is over. Both the FA Cup and Europa League finals are done and dusted. How has Brendan Rodgers’ side fared? Will we be seeing Champions League football at Anfield again next season?\n\nYes. I’ll be very surprised if Liverpool don’t finish in the top four. With the exception of Chelsea, they have been the best team in the league in this calendar year and although Manchester United and Arsenal both have a slight advantage on them points-wise, I think Liverpool are playing better, more effective football and expect them to qualify for the Champions League again.\n\nWe would like to say a huge thank you again to Tony for taking the time out to speak to us.",

We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.”\n\nNo president has called for an increase in the country’s estimated 4,500 nuclear arms in decades.\n\nAccording to the Federation of American Scientists, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons has declined significantly since the end of the Cold War.\n\nIt estimates that there were currently 15,350 in nukes in existence in early 2016, down from a peak of approximately 70,300 in 1986.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump was aware of Putin's comments on overcoming U.S. missile defenses when speaking to MSNBC.\n\nDuring the press conference, Putin also said it \"was not surprising that [Trump] talks about nuclear weapons, he talked about the necessity to strengthen the nuclear and defense sector in the U.S. during his campaign.\"\n\nPutin added that the modernization of Russian nuclear forces was in line with existing arms control agreements, including the New Start Treaty with the U.S.\n\nThe New Start treaty, which was signed by President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2011, limited the number of strategic warheads both Russia and the U.S. could possess.\n\nThe pact also reestablished a monitoring system that ended in December 2009 with the expiration of an earlier arms deal.\n\nObama has proposed a $500 billion plan to modernize the aging U.S. nuclear triad, which consists of bomber, intercontinental missiles and submarines delivery methods for nukes.\n\nJames Mattis, the retired Marine general who is Trump's choice for defense chief, has questioned the purpose of the triad system.\n\n\"You should ask, 'Is it time to reduce the triad to a diad, removing the land-based missiles?'\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2015, as the AP reported earlier this month.\n\nAlleged Hacking\n\nPutin also addressed the issue of alleged Russian hacking Friday, stating it was not important who hacked the Democratic Party prior to the presidential election. He added that the hacks revealed that public opinion in America was being manipulated behind the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and against Bernie Sanders during the primaries.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have told NBC News they believed \"with a high level of confidence\" that Putin was personally involved in a covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nRussia has consistently denied accusations Moscow was involved in cyberattacks against the U.S. and on Friday Putin echoed language used by Trump by saying it was impossible to know who was behind the election hacks.\n\n“Maybe they were in some other country and not Russia. Maybe someone did [it] lying on the sofa or bed,” he said.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly rejected claims that Russian hacking influenced the outcome of the election in his favor.\n\nHe told Fox news on December 11 “once they hack, if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them. They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place.”",

  "latent_26290": "No mainstream media journalist has seized onto the IRS scandal of 2013—the “IRS targeting” story, to use her term—like Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel. When the story broke last spring, when an IG report (spoiled, like a movie plot, by then-IRS Commissioner Lois Lerner) revealed that the IRS demanded sheaf after sheaf of evidence before giving tax exemption to Tea Party groups, Strassel declared that the scandal “started at the top,” because the president had publicly critized groups like David Koch’s Americans for Prosperity, and because some Romney donors were audited. The IRS, she wrote, “got its heading from a president, and his party, who did in fact send it orders—openly, for the world to see.” The next month, Strassel offered readers a timeline of the story to prove “that the IRS’s first BOLO list coincided with their own attack against ‘shadowy’ or ‘front’ conservative groups that they claimed were rigging the electoral system.”\n\nStrassel’s continued in that vein ever since. Her argument involves just a little sleight of hand. The Tea Party groups that had the loudest grievances against the IRS were the small, new, prayer-circle-sized organizations set up in early 2009. The groups criticized by the president were 501(c) organizations, like AFP, that had the tax-exempt status of charities and used that to rain untraceable money into swing-state ad campaigns. So the American Issues Project, a group founded and funded by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth strategists/donors to run ads against Obama, became a mere “conservative outfit” that Obama wanted “targeted.” An investigation of the group’s tax status became a post-hoc Obama effort to nail conservatives:\n\nThe Obama campaign takes its vendetta against a political opponent to the FEC. The FEC staff, as part of an extraordinary campaign to bring down AIP and other 501(c)(4) groups, reaches out to Lois Lerner, the woman overseeing IRS targeting.\n\nStrassel’s reporting is solid—she just follows it to conclusions that escape everyone else. This long preamble is my way of introducing her current argument, that a proposed IRS rule would codify the “targeting” for all time. As Strassel wrote, it was dropped during the sleepy Thanksgiving news cycle, though it can be read in full here. The gist: The IRS would redefine “social welfare,” the supposed cause of 501(c)4 groups, so that “the promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect candidate-related political activity.”\n\nAlerted by Strassel, Republicans spent the month between the introduction of the budget and the passage of an attendant spending bill trying to block this rule. Strassel’s reporting:\n\nCongressional sources tell me that House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R., Ky.) had two priorities in the omnibus negotiations. One was getting in protection for groups that morally oppose ObamaCare’s contraception-coverage requirement. The other was language that would put a hold on the IRS rule.\n\nThe White House and Senate Democrats had their own wish list, including an increase in funding for the International Monetary Fund, the president’s prekindergarten program and more ObamaCare dollars.\n\nYet my sources say that throughout the negotiations Democrats went all in on keeping the IRS rule, even though it meant losing their own priorities. In the final hours before the omnibus was introduced Monday night, the administration made a last push for IMF money. Asked to negotiate that demand in the context of new IRS language, it refused.\n\nAnd here, the framing is everything. To Strassel, the Democrats’ insistence on keeping the rule is pure 2014 politics. Their plans:\n\n“ensure that… conservative groups are silenced”\n\n“counting on the tax agency to muzzle its political opponents”\n\n“shut up hundreds of groups that pose a direct threat by restricting their ability to speak freely in an election season”\n\nIt’s unfair, writes Strassel, because “Mr. Obama’s union foot soldiers—which file under 501(c)(5)—can continue playing in politics.” That’s what I mean about the framing. Strassel creates a binary universe in which Democrats get to spend unlimited money via their unions and conservatives spend unlimited money via the 501(c)4s.\n\nLeft unsaid is that the second kind of spending is sort of an accident, and a joke. Donors like 501(c)4s because they don’t have to disclose where the money comes from, and because the old guidelines only say the groups have to be “primarily” focused on social welfare That’s lead to unprecedently huge “educational” organizations that spend all their time on politics but don’t admit it. As ProPublica reported in 2012, the “educational” wing of American Crossroads, Crossroads GPS, asked for tax exemption on the premise that when it wandered into politics, “any such activity will be limited in amount, and will not constitute the organization’s primary purpose.” (GPS stands for “Grassroots Policy Strategies.”) Crossroads GPS spent $70 million on campaigns.\n\nIn the Strassel version of things, to prevent a group like Crossroads from spending its money this way is to “muzzle” the speech of conservatives. But a new rule would apply equally to liberal 501s, which might very well spring up once Chris Christie (or Marco Rubio, or Peter King, or whoever) is president. The FEC’s law department found in 2012 that Crossroads GPS had abused the rules, but because the FEC is composed equally of Democrats and Republicans, the vote to punish the group was a tie. We’re not talking about some constitutional right to free speech being thwarted because of liberal thuggery. We’re talking about a loophole being exploited by wealthy donors, and kept open by the built-in impotence of the FEC.\n\nWhat would happen if the rule went into effect? How would donors be silenced? Well, they wouldn’t be prevented from giving exactly as much money to a 527 as they now give to a 501(c)4. They’d only be aware that their donation to the 527 would, eventually, be disclosed. Current campaign finance law is pretty clear on this: In Citizens United, Anthony Kennedy cited precedent to affirm that disclosure rules do not “prevent anyone from speaking.”\n\nI’m not naive. Right now, the change to the IRS’s rule on “social welfare” would weaken, mostly, groups set up to spend big against Democrats. This rule would be good for the Obama administration. That doesn’t mean it’s meritless, or that to deny some donors secrecy while allowing them all sorts of ways to give infinite sums is “muzzling” or “targeting.”",
  "latent_26371": "\"Salk\" redirects here. For other uses, see Salk (disambiguation)\n\nJonas Edward Salk (; October 28, 1914 – June 23, 1995) was an American medical researcher and virologist. He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital.[1] Two years later he was granted a fellowship at the University of Michigan, where he would study flu viruses with his mentor Thomas Francis, Jr.[2]\n\nUntil 1955, when the Salk vaccine was introduced, polio was considered one of the most frightening public health problems in the world. In the postwar United States, annual epidemics were increasingly devastating. The 1952 U.S. epidemic was the worst outbreak in the nation's history. Of nearly 58,000 cases reported that year, 3,145 people died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis,[3] with most of its victims being children. The \"public reaction was to a plague\", said historian William L. O'Neill.[4] \"Citizens of urban areas were to be terrified every summer when this frightful visitor returned.\" According to a 2009 PBS documentary, \"Apart from the atomic bomb, America's greatest fear was polio.\"[5] As a result, scientists were in a frantic race to find a way to prevent or cure the disease.\n\nIn 1947, Salk accepted an appointment to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In 1948, he undertook a project funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, the organization that would fund the development of a vaccine, to determine the number of different types of polio virus. Salk saw an opportunity to extend this project towards developing a vaccine against polio, and, together with the skilled research team he assembled, devoted himself to this work for the next seven years. The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, \"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.\" Over 1,800,000 school children took part in the trial.[6] When news of the vaccine's success was made public on April 12, 1955, Salk was hailed as a \"miracle worker\" and the day almost became a national holiday. Around the world, an immediate rush to vaccinate began, with countries including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium planning to begin polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine.\n\nSalk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a \"moral commitment.\"[7] His sole focus had been to develop a safe and effective vaccine as rapidly as possible, with no interest in personal profit. As such, there is no patent for the vaccine.[8] In 1960, he founded the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, which is today a center for medical and scientific research. He continued to conduct research and publish books, including Man Unfolding (1972), The Survival of the Wisest (1973), World Population and Human Values: A New Reality (1981), and Anatomy of Reality: Merging of Intuition and Reason (1983). Salk's last years were spent searching for a vaccine against HIV. His personal papers are stored at the University of California, San Diego Library.[9][10]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nSalk was born in New York City on October 28, 1914. His parents, Daniel and Dora (née Press) Salk, were Ashkenazi Jewish; Daniel was born in New Jersey to eastern European immigrant parents, and Dora was born in Russia, immigrating when she was twelve.[11] They had not received extensive formal education.[12] He had two younger brothers, Herman and Lee, a renowned child psychologist.[13] The family moved from East Harlem to 853 Elsmere Place, the Bronx,[14] with some time spent in Queens where he resided at 439 Beach 69th Street, Arverne, New York.[15]\n\nWhen he was 13, Salk entered Townsend Harris High School, a public school for intellectually gifted students. Named after the founder of City College of New York (CCNY), it was, said Oshinsky, \"a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money—and pedigree—to attend a top private school.\" In high school \"he was known as a perfectionist ... who read everything he could lay his hands on,\" according to one of his fellow students.[16] Students had to cram a four-year curriculum into just three years. As a result, most dropped out or flunked out, despite the school's motto \"study, study, study.\" Of the students who graduated, however, most would have the grades to enroll in CCNY, noted for being a highly competitive college.[17]:96\n\nEducation [ edit ]\n\nSalk enrolled in CCNY from which he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1934.[18] Oshinsky writes that \"for working-class immigrant families, City College represented the apex of public higher education. Getting in was tough, but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth.\"[17]\n\nAt his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were \"barely second rate.\" There were no research laboratories; the library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there ... driven by their parents. ... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more Nobel Prize winners—eight—and PhD recipients than any other public college except the University of California at Berkeley.\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"[17]:98\n\nAs a child, Salk did not show any interest in medicine or science in general. He said in an interview with the Academy of Achievement,[19] \"As a child I was not interested in science. I was merely interested in things human, the human side of nature, if you like, and I continue to be interested in that.\"\n\nMedical school [ edit ]\n\nAfter City College, Salk enrolled in New York University to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as Walter Reed, who helped conquer yellow fever. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools—Cornell, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale—had rigid quotas in place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in.[17]:98 During his years at New York University Medical School, Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer.[18]\n\nDuring Salk's medical studies, he stood out from his peers, according to Bookchin, \"not just because of his continued academic prowess—he was Alpha Omega Alpha, the Phi Beta Kappa Society of medical education—but because he had decided he did not want to practice medicine.\" Instead, he became absorbed in research, even taking a year off to study biochemistry. He later focused more of his studies on bacteriology which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients.[16] \"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\"[17]\n\nAccording to Salk: \"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"[20]\n\nConcerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize. And so, by carefully designed experiments, we found it was possible to do so.\"[21]\n\nPostgraduate research [ edit ]\n\nIn 1941, during his postgraduate work in virology, Salk chose a two-month elective to work in the laboratory of Thomas Francis at the University of Michigan. Francis had recently joined the faculty of the medical school after working for the Rockefeller Foundation, where he had discovered the type B influenza virus. According to Bookchin, \"the two-month stint in Francis's lab was Salk's first introduction to the world of virology—and he was hooked.\"[16]:25 After graduating from medical school, Salk began his residency at New York's prestigious[17] Mount Sinai Hospital, where he again worked in Francis's laboratory.[17]\n\nPolio research [ edit ]\n\nIn 1947, Salk became ambitious for his own lab and was granted one at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, but the lab was smaller than he had hoped and he found the rules imposed by the university restrictive.[22] In 1948, Harry Weaver, the director of research at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, contacted Salk. He asked Salk to find out if there were more types of polio than the three then known, offering additional space, equipment and researchers. For the first year he gathered supplies and researchers including Julius Youngner, Byron Bennett, L. James Lewis, and secretary Lorraine Friedman joined Salk's team, as well.[23][5] As time went on, Salk began securing grants from the Mellon family and was able to build a working virology laboratory.[16] He later joined the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis's polio project established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[16][24]\n\nExtensive publicity and fear of polio led to much increased funding, $67 million by 1955, but research continued on dangerous live vaccines.[17]:85–87[4] Salk decided to use the safer 'killed' virus, instead of weakened forms of strains of polio viruses like the ones used contemporarily by Albert Sabin, who was developing an oral vaccine. After successful tests on laboratory animals, on July 2, 1952, assisted by the staff at the D.T. Watson Home for Crippled Children, Salk injected 43 children with his killed-virus vaccine. A few weeks later, Salk injected children at the Polk State School for the retarded and feeble-minded. In 1954 he tested the vaccine on about one million children, known as the polio pioneers. The vaccine was announced as safe on April 12, 1955.[25][26][27][24][4]\n\nSalk in 1955 at the University of Pittsburgh\n\n[4] with over 1,800,000 school children participating in the trial.[6] A 1954 Magazine photo of Jonas Salk to O'Neill, \"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers,\"with over 1,800,000 school children participating in the trial.A 1954 Gallup poll showed that more Americans knew about the polio field trials than could give the full name of the President.\n\ncirca 1957 March of Dimes poster1957\n\nThe project became large, involving 100 million contributors to the March of Dimes, and 7 million volunteers.[28]:54[4] The foundation allowed itself to go into debt to finance the final research required to develop the Salk vaccine.[29] Salk worked incessantly for two and a half years.[30][4]\n\nSalk's inactivated polio vaccine was the first vaccine for the disease; it came into use in 1955.[31][32] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[33]\n\nBecoming a public figure [ edit ]\n\nCelebrity versus privacy [ edit ]\n\nSalk preferred not to have his career as a scientist affected by too much personal attention, as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life, but this proved to be impossible. \"Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you—you've lost your anonymity\", the television personality Ed Murrow said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention.[34] When Murrow asked him, \"Who owns this patent?\", Salk replied, \"Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\"[35] The vaccine is calculated to be worth $7 billion had it been patented.[36] However, lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis did look into the possibility of a patent, but ultimately determined that the vaccine was not a patentable invention because of prior art.[37]\n\nSalk served on the board of directors of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.[38]\n\nAuthor Jon Cohen noted, \"Jonas Salk made scientists and journalists alike go goofy. As one of the only living scientists whose face was known the world over, Salk, in the public's eye, had a superstar aura. Airplane pilots would announce that he was on board and passengers would burst into applause. Hotels routinely would upgrade him into their penthouse suites. A meal at a restaurant inevitably meant an interruption from an admirer, and scientists approached him with drop-jawed wonder as though some of the stardust might rub off.\"[39]\n\nFor the most part, however, Salk was \"appalled at the demands on the public figure he has become and resentful of what he considers to be the invasion of his privacy\", wrote The New York Times, a few months after his vaccine announcement.[27] The Times article noted, \"at 40, the once obscure scientist ... was lifted from his laboratory almost to the level of a folk hero.\" He received a presidential citation, a score of awards, four honorary degrees, half a dozen foreign decorations, and letters from thousands of fellow citizens. His alma mater, City College of New York, gave him an honorary degree as Doctor of Laws. But \"despite such very nice tributes\", The New York Times wrote, \"Salk is profoundly disturbed by the torrent of fame that has descended upon him. ... He talks continually about getting out of the limelight and back to his laboratory ... because of his genuine distaste for publicity, which he believes is inappropriate for a scientist.\"[27]\n\nDuring a 1980 interview, 25 years later, he said, \"It's as if I've been a public property ever since, having to respond to external, as well as internal, impulses. ... It's brought me enormous gratification, opened many opportunities, but at the same time placed many burdens on me. It altered my career, my relationships with colleagues; I am a public figure, no longer one of them.\"[34]\n\nMaintaining his individuality [ edit ]\n\n\"If Salk the scientist sounds austere\", wrote The New York Times, \"Salk the man is a person of great warmth and tremendous enthusiasm. People who meet him generally like him.\" A Washington newspaper correspondent commented, \"He could sell me the Brooklyn Bridge, and I never bought anything before.\" Award-winning geneticist Walter Nelson-Rees called him \"a renaissance scientist: brilliant, sophisticated, driven ... a fantastic creature.\"[40]:127\n\nHe enjoys talking to people he likes, and \"he likes a lot of people\", wrote the Times. \"He talks quickly, articulately, and often in complete paragraphs.\" And \"He has very little perceptible interest in the things that interest most people—such as making money.\" That belongs \"in the category of mink coats and Cadillacs—unnecessary\", he said.[27]\n\nEstablishing the Salk Institute [ edit ]\n\nThe Salk Institute at La Jolla\n\nIn the years after Salk's discovery, many supporters, in particular the National Foundation, \"helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society'.\"[41] Called the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, it opened in 1963 in the San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla. Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, \"I thought how nice it would be if a place like this existed and I was invited to work there.\" This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.\n\nIn 1966, Salk described his \"ambitious plan for the creation of a kind of Socratic academy where the supposedly alienated two cultures of science and humanism will have a favorable atmosphere for cross-fertilization.\"[42] Author and journalist Howard Taubman explained:\n\nAlthough he is distinctly future-oriented, Dr. Salk has not lost sight of the institute's immediate aim, which is the development and use of the new biology, called molecular and cellular biology, described as part physics, part chemistry and part biology. The broad-gauged purpose of this science is to understand man's life processes. There is talk here of the possibility, once the secret of how the cell is triggered to manufacture antibodies is discovered, that a single vaccine may be developed to protect a child against many common infectious diseases. There is speculation about the power to isolate and perhaps eliminate genetic errors that lead to birth defects. Dr. Salk, a creative man himself, hopes that the institute will do its share in probing the wisdom of nature and thus help enlarge the wisdom of man. For the ultimate purpose of science, humanism and the arts, in his judgment, is the freeing of each individual to cultivate his full creativity, in whichever direction it leads . ... As if to prepare for Socratic encounters such as these, the institute's architect, Louis Kahn, has installed blackboards in place of concrete facings on the walls along the walks.[42]\n\nThe New York Times, in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Salk vaccine, described the current workings at the facility:\n\nAt the institute, a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, Dr. Salk holds the titles of founding director and resident fellow. His own laboratory group is concerned with the immunologic aspects of cancer and the mechanisms of autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.[34]\n\nIn an interview about his future hopes at the institute, he said, \"In the end, what may have more significance is my creation of the institute and what will come out of it, because of its example as a place for excellence, a creative environment for creative minds.\"\n\nFrancis Crick, codiscoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule, was a leading professor at the institute until his death in 2004.\n\nThe institute also served as the basis for Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar's 1979 book Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts.[43]\n\nAIDS vaccine work [ edit ]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, Salk also engaged in research to develop a vaccine for another, more recent plague, AIDS. To further this research, he cofounded the Immune Response Corporation (Also known as the IRC) with Kevin Kimberlin, to search for a vaccine, and patented Remune, an immune-based therapy. He was unable to secure product liability Insurance.[44] The AIDS vaccine project was discontinued in 2007, 12 years after Jonas Salk's death in 1995.\n\nAlthough many advances have been made in treating AIDS, \"the world still waited for the miracle vaccine the conqueror of polio had sought\", wrote historian Alan Axelrod.[45]:294\n\nJonas Salk during a 1988 Centers for Disease Control visit\n\nIn 1966, The New York Times referred to him as the \"Father of Biophilosophy.\" According to Times journalist and author Howard Taubman, \"he never forgets ... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\"[42] Salk told his cousin, Joel Kassiday, at a meeting of the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future on Capitol Hill in 1984 that he was optimistic that ways to prevent most human and animal diseases would eventually be developed. Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.\n\nSalk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, Man's Unfolding, and The Survival of the Wisest. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:\n\nI think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. ... People think of biology in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. ... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.[34]\n\nHis definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"[46]\n\nJust prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled Millennium of the Mind.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nThe day after his graduation from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. David Oshinsky writes that Donna's father, Elmer Lindsay, \"a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors.\" Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his \"rather pedestrian status\" by giving himself a middle name.\"[17]\n\nThey had three children: Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan Salk. In 1968, they divorced and, in 1970, Salk married French painter Françoise Gilot.\n\nJonas Salk died from heart failure at the age of 80 on June 23, 1995, in La Jolla,[47] and was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.[48]\n\nHonors and recognition [ edit ]\n\n1955, one month after the vaccine announcement, he was honored by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where he was given their \"highest award for services\" by Governor George M. Leader, Meritorious Service Medal, where the governor added,\n\n... in recognition of his 'historical medical' discovery ... Dr. Salk's achievement is meritorious service of the highest magnitude and dimension for the commonwealth, the country and mankind.\" The governor, who had three children, said that \"as a parent he was 'humbly thankful to Dr. Salk,' and as Governor, 'proud to pay him tribute'.[49]\n\n1955, City University of New York creates the Salk Scholarship fund which it awards to multiple outstanding pre-med students each year\n\n1956, awarded the Lasker Award\n\n1957, the Municipal Hospital building, where Salk conducted his polio research at the University of Pittsburgh, is renamed Jonas Salk Hall and is home to the University's School of Pharmacy and Dentistry. [50]\n\n1958, awarded the James D. Bruce Memorial Award\n\nBecause of Doctor Jonas E. Salk, our country is free from the cruel epidemics of poliomyelitis that once struck almost yearly. Because of his tireless work, untold hundreds of thousands who might have been crippled are sound in body today. These are Doctor Salk's true honors, and there is no way to add to them. This Medal of Freedom can only express our gratitude, and our deepest thanks.\n\nDocumentary films [ edit ]\n\nIn early 2009, the American Public Broadcasting Service aired its new documentary film, American Experience: The Polio Crusade .

  "latent_26386": "Specialist Hall’s lawsuit is the latest incident to raise questions about the military’s religion guidelines. In 2005, the Air Force issued new regulations in response to complaints from cadets at the Air Force Academy that evangelical Christian officers used their positions to proselytize. In general, the armed forces have regulations, Ms. Lainez said, that respect “the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs.”\n\nPhoto\n\nTo Specialist Hall and other critics of the military, the guidelines have done little to change a culture they say tilts heavily toward evangelical Christianity. Controversies have continued to flare, largely over tactics used by evangelicals to promote their faith. Perhaps the most high-profile incident involved seven officers, including four generals, who appeared, in uniform and in violation of military regulations, in a 2006 fund-raising video for the Christian Embassy, an evangelical Bible study group.\n\n“They don’t trust you because they think you are unreliable and might break, since you don’t have God to rely on,” Specialist Hall said of those who proselytize in the military. “The message is, ‘It’s a Christian nation, and you need to recognize that.’ ”\n\nSoft-spoken and younger looking than his 23 years, Specialist Hall began a chapter of the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers at Camp Speicher, near Tikrit, to support others like him.\n\nAt the July meeting, Major Welborn told the soldiers they had disgraced those who had died for the Constitution, Specialist Hall said. When he finished, Major Welborn said, according to the statement: “I love you guys; I just want the best for you. One day you will see the truth and know what I mean.”\n\nMajor Welborn declined to comment beyond saying, “I’d love to tell my side of the story because it’s such a false story.”\n\nBut Timothy Feary, the other soldier at the meeting, said in an e-mail message: “Jeremy is telling the truth. I was there and witnessed everything.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear how widespread religious discrimination or proselytizing is in the armed forces, constitutional law experts and leaders of veterans’ groups said. No one has independently studied the issue, and service members are reluctant to come forward because of possible backlash, those experts said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are 1.36 million active duty service members, according to the Pentagon, and since 2005, it has received 50 formal complaints of religious discrimination, Ms. Lainez said.\n\nIn an e-mail statement, Bill Carr, the Defense Department’s deputy under secretary for military personnel policy, said he “saw near universal compliance with the department’s policy.”\n\nBut Mikey Weinstein, a retired Air Force judge advocate general and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the official statistics masked the great number of those who do not report violations for fear of retribution. Since the Air Force Academy scandal began in 2004, Mr. Weinstein said, he has been contacted by more than 5,500 service members and, occasionally, military families about incidents of religious discrimination. He said 96 percent of the complainants were Christians, and the majority of those were Protestants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was raised Baptist by his grandmother in Richlands, N.C., a town of fewer than 1,000 people.

Their questions about faith prompted him to read the Bible more closely, which bred doubts that deepened over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“There are so many religions in the world,” he said. “Everyone thinks he’s right. Who is right? Even people who are Christians think other Christians are wrong.”\n\nSpecialist Hall said he did not advertise his atheism. But his views became apparent during his second deployment in 2006. At a Thanksgiving meal, someone at his table asked everyone to pray. Specialist Hall did not join in, explaining to a sergeant that he did not believe in God. The sergeant got angry, he said, and told him to go to another table.\n\nAfter his run-in with Major Welborn, Specialist Hall did not file a complaint with the Army’s Equal Opportunity Office because, he said, he was mistrustful of his superior officers. Instead, he told leaders of the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, who put him in touch with Mr. Weinstein. In November 2007, Specialist Hall was sent home early from Iraq after being repeatedly threatened by other soldiers. “I caution you that although your ‘legal’ issues are yours and yours alone, I have heard many people disagree with you, and this may be a cause for some of the perceived threats,” wrote Sgt. Maj. Kevin Nolan in Specialist Hall’s counseling for his departure.\n\nThough with a different unit now at Fort Riley, Specialist Hall said the backlash had continued. He has a no-contact order with a sergeant who, without provocation, threatened to “bust him in the mouth.” Another sergeant allegedly told Specialist Hall that as an atheist, he was not entitled to religious freedom because he had no religion.\n\nResponding to questions about Specialist Hall’s experience at Fort Riley, the staff judge advocate, Col. Arnold Scott, said in an e-mail message, “In accordance with Army policy, Fort Riley is committed to ensuring the rights of all its soldiers are protected, including those of Specialist Hall.”\n\nCivilian courts in the past have been reluctant to take on military cases, and the Justice Department has yet to respond to Specialist Hall’s lawsuit.\n\n“Even if it doesn’t go through, I stood up,” Specialist Hall said. “I don’t think it is futile.”",

In 2017, Ukraine will celebrate the 1945 victory over Nazism, albeit for the last time, most likely.\n\nSource: Pravda.Ru photo archive\n\nThe Kiev authorities want to follow Europe's example to celebrate the day of memory and reconciliation on May 8, apparently to make another step on the way to the cherished dream of becoming a EU member.\n\nIn addition, the new law is said to introduce changes to the International Women's Day of March 8. Kiev wants to rename the holiday into the \"day of struggle for women's rights.\" Strangely enough, changes in the calendar under the slogan of decommunization have not affected the day of May 1.

Sokiryanskaya, Russia project coordinator for the International Crisis Group, told the New Tork Times: “I got numerous, numerous signals… it came from too many sources not to be true.”\n\n“Even delivering the information is very difficult… they are just small islands, isolated.”\n\nAccording to HRW, LGBT Network in Russia opened a special hotline to provide emergency support to those who find themselves in immediate danger.\n\nA spokesman for the Chechen government, Alvi Karimov, previously denied the reports while claiming that gay people haven’t been targeted because “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”.\n\nThey said: “If there were such people in the Chechen republic, law enforcement wouldn’t have a problem with them because their relatives would send them to a place of no return.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge but claimed the Russian government would “investigate” the reports.\n\nIn the UK, activists have written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, calling for the British government to intervene in the crisis.\n\nThe letter, signed by Pride in London’s Michael Salter and Alison Camps said: “Pride in London is alarmed to learn that authorities in the Russian republic of Chechnya have launched a campaign to identify and execute members of the LGBT+ community within the quasi-independent state, formally under Russian control.\n\n“Pride in London would urge the UK Government to take meaningful steps to assist the LGBT+ community in Chechnya and to offer protection and support to what amounts to state sponsored genocide.\n\n“The statements issued by the authorities in Chechnya, that LGBT+ citizens do not exist in the state, are a chilling indictment to the goals of an extermination agenda rather than that of fact.”\n\nThe Foreign Office responded to the pressure, telling BuzzFeed: “We are very concerned by reports of mass arrests of individuals in Chechnya due to their perceived or actual sexual orientation. We condemn any and all persecution.\n\n“The human rights situation for LGBT people in Russia has deteriorated significantly in recent years and we have voiced our serious concern over these developments with Russian authorities at all levels.”\n\nRelated: Russian government warns citizens not to be homophobic while on holiday in Europe",
  "latent_26632": "While the Colts have the day off today from practice, it's been a busy past hour or so for the Colts in terms of roster moves. The team just announced that they've signed outside linebacker Chris Carter and running back Dion Lewis to the 53-man roster, have waived running back Zurlon Tipton, and have signed quarterback Dominique Davis to the practice squad.\n\nCarter is a 6-1, 248 pound linebacker who spent the last three seasons with the Steelers, appearing in 29 games and starting 4. He was the Steelers' fifth round draft pick in 2011 (the same exact round that the Eagles took Dion Lewis in). In his career, he has made 8 tackles and recovered a fumble, in addition to making 9 special teams tackles (5 in 2013). Carter is primarily a pass rusher, which makes sense given the need at the area currently.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Per <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caplannfl\">@caplannfl</a> yesterday, new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Colts?src=hash\">#Colts</a> OLB Chris Carter was the second-best 3-4 option available. Behind only Victor Butler.</p>— George Bremer (@gmbremer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gmbremer/status/509466731010478080\">September 9, 2014</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThe signing of Lewis was one that was reported earlier today, and here's what I wrote then:\n\nLewis was originally drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles (and Ryan Grigson) in the fifth round of the 2011 draft out of Pittsburgh. In college, he rushed for 2,850 yards and 30 touchdowns in two seasons at Pittsburgh, averaging over 5 yards per carry and also adding 405 yards and a touchdown in the receiving game. He played in 24 total games in the 2011-12 seasons for the Eagles, rushing 36 times for 171 yards and 2 touchdowns (averaging 4.8 yards per carry). He also returned 31 kickoffs for the Eagles in 2011, averaging 21.6 yards per return. In 2012, he returned just one kick for 33 yards. He was traded to the Cleveland Browns in the 2013 offseason. This preseason, he rushed 12 times for 30 yards in 4 games and caught 5 passes for 16 yards and a score. The move is an interesting one. Lewis is a guy who would likely take over at kick returner for the Colts and who would likely take Zurlon Tipton's spot on the roster. The really intriguing thing will be to see how much the Colts use him on offense, such as in a third down role or something like that. Let's be real: he's not going to beat out either Trent Richardson or Ahmad Bradshaw for playing time, but he still could see a couple of snaps and it will be something to watch, at least. For sure, though, he should be able to help in the return game.\n\nTipton was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Western Michigan by the Colts this year, and he has potential. A lot of people want to see the Colts stick with him, and I'd be very surprised if they don't. I fully expect Tipton to end up on the practice squad once he clears waivers.\n\nAs for Davis, the quarterback signed to the practice squad, he appeared in one game with the Falcons in 2013, completing 4 of 7 passes for 34 yards. The Falcons originally signed him as an undrafted free agent out of East Carolina University after the 2012 draft.\n\nEarlier today, the Colts announced that outside linebacker Cam Johnson has been placed on season-ending injured reserve and that they waived quarterback Jeff Matthews from the practice squad.",
  "latent_26634": "CLOSE The Supreme Court blocked a lower court's ruling on refugees who have formal assurances from resettlement agencies. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nProtesters demonstrate against President Trump's travel ban outside a federal courthouse in Seattle in May. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court handed President Trump a temporary victory Tuesday, blocking a lower court decision that would have greatly expanded the number of refugees exempted from his controversial travel ban.\n\nThe high court is scheduled to hear arguments next month in the broader constitutional challenge to the travel ban from states and immigrant rights groups. The current dispute is over which immigrants and refugees can enter in the meantime.\n\nTrump administration lawyers asked the court on Monday to set aside last week's federal appeals court ruling that would allow more refugees into the United States while the case is pending. That ruling was due to take effect Tuesday because the lower court had said thousands of refugees were \"gravely imperiled.\"\n\nThe administration argued that by granting entry to any refugees who had been matched up with a resettlement agency in the U.S., the lower court went far beyond the type of personal relationship Trump required.\n\nJustice Department lawyers noted that in its June 26 decision allowing the travel ban to go into effect, the Supreme Court said the refugees eligible for exemptions should include \"students who have been admitted to study at an American university, workers who have accepted jobs at an American company, and lecturers who come to speak to an American audience.\"\n\nChallengers countered on Tuesday that the court should not get involved in \"ensuring that every possible refugee is excluded.\"\n\n\"The government retains the authority to bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country, as indeed it has done for months,\" lawyers for Hawaii, one of the lead challengers, argued. \"The lower courts have simply applied this court’s standard to protect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores.\"\n\nWho's In, Out: Trump's travel ban: Where it stands\n\nMore: The number of Muslim refugees entering U.S. declined after Trump took office\n\nMore: U.S. hits refugee cap set by Trump\n\nAfter a series of court defeats for Trump's proposed travel ban, the Supreme Court in June said parts of it could go into effect pending the outcome of the broader case. A decision isn't expected until next spring.\n\nIn the meantime, the court said travelers from the six targeted Muslim-majority countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — can bypass the travel ban and enter the U.S. if they can prove they have a \"bona fide\" relationship with a U.S. person or entity.\n\nCLOSE Nasro Ahmed a Somolian refugee, is alone in Lancaster, Pa. after her parents and 11 siblings were denied access to the U.S. following the recent travel ban. Jason Plotkin, York Daily Record\n\nThe Trump administration at first defined that close relationship as immediate relatives, including spouses and spouses-to-be, children and parents. Federal District Court Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii later ordered the list expanded to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws.\n\nThe administration also decided that only refugees who have a personal relationship with a U.S. citizen or organization should be allowed to enter. But Watson disagreed and ordered officials to admit a broader array of refugees.\n\nLast month, the justices said additional relatives deserved entry, but not additional refugees, leaving the appeals court in California to sort out the details. That court, the most liberal in the nation, last week sided with Watson rather than the justices.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, a three-judge panel rejected the administration's interpretation of who should be allowed entry into the United States, saying \"the government does not offer a persuasive explanation for why a mother-in-law is clearly a bona fide relationship, in the Supreme Court’s prior reasoning, but a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or cousin is not.\"\n\nIn its request regarding refugees Monday, the Justice Department dropped its objections to that part of the lower court ruling, noting the Supreme Court had favored the expanded list of relatives.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wZhClS",
  "latent_26677": "The embittered, helter-skelter Pakistan-US relationship is coming out of a turbulent decade of mutual suspicions over Islamabad’s alleged duplicity in Afghan matters, discussions with Pakistan observers in Washington indicate.\n\nIs the new engagement embedded in political realism derived from lessons from the past decade, or is it yet another transitory phase of mutual accommodation and appreciation arising out of the pressing challenges that lie ahead?\n\nThe current discourse in Washington revolves around three major issues – the 2014 troop drawdown in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s role before and after the withdrawal, and Islamabad’s own future in a south Asia defined by an economically surging India.\n\nThe administration continues to agonize over a belligerent and unpredictable Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has so far adamantly refused to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA), frustrating the Obama administration’s efforts to get over with the matter before the presidential elections set for April. Karzai’s refusal has also held up decision-making on the drawdown. He gave the US and its allies another jolt on February 14 by releasing 65 Taliban fighters from the Bagram jail, triggering condemnation from US military officials who say the men were “dangerous individuals” directly linked to attacks killing or wounding 32 Nato personnel and 23 Afghans.\n\nDisregarding the US warning, Karzai called the prison at Bagram a “Taliban-producing factory,” set the men free, and alleged that some detainees had been tortured into hating their country.\n\nOnly two days earlier, in an interview with The Telegraph of London, Karzai had caused even greater consternation in Washington by saying that he “saw no good” in the American presence in his country. Questioning the US role in Afghanistan, Karzai asserted: “This whole 12 years was one of constant pleading with America to treat the lives of our civilians as lives of people. They did not work for me, they worked against me.”\n\nNo surprise that Karzai’s erratic attitude seems to have drawn Islamabad and Washington closer.\n\n“The US ignored and dismissed Pakistan for the sake of Karzai but now look what he is talking about,” remarked a diplomat. Pakistanis kept insisting that elements in the Kabul administration were not in favor of the peace process, but nobody gave it credence until Karzai demolished the Doha process,” said a Pakistani-American, associated with the US administration.\n\nWashington also seems to have moderated and revised its expectations of Pakistan on two counts – the role in the reconciliation process and the influence over the Haqqanis and Mullah Omar’s Taliban.\n\n[quote]We took Karzai’s words on Pakistan as biblical revelations[/quote]\n\nThey now realize that high expectations from Islamabad in the reconciliation process were unrealistic, and they US officials gave too much credence to the Karzai narrative on Pakistan, said the official. Policymakers in Washington now appear more aware of the limited influence that Pakistan has over the Taliban. Their also seems to be greater realization of Islamabad’s limitations in going after the Haqqani Network. Officials now sound sympathetic to the possible socio-politically disruptive consequences inside Pakistan that an all-out offensive against all Afghan groups can have, said another official during a conversation at a think tank. We took Karzai’s words on Pakistan as biblical revelations and that was a grave mistake, said the official.\n\nThis also suggests that the anti-Pakistan sentiment that had existed in Washington until former Afghan-Pakistan envoy Marc Grossman’s last Islamabad visit in September 2012 has eased.\n\n“Now Pakistanis need to develop a positive narrative on a nation that is a victim of its own cold war era policies as well as of the consequences of global geo-politics,” suggested the influential Pakistani-origin official, saying that the course of events unleashed by Karzai is the primary driver of the pro-Pakistan sentiment on the Capitol Hill and State Department.\n\nThe US has spent nearly $700 billion in Afghanistan so far and continues to take the flak. There is quite a discernible inclination towards “positive engagement with Pakistan as the preferred option rather than confrontationist squeezing of an ally,” said the official.\n\n[quote]Karzai called the Bagram prison a “Taliban-producing factory”[/quote]\n\nThis too has to be seen in the context of the greater synergy emerging even among Afghan stakeholders – Hekmetyar’s Hezbe Islami has announced full participation in the presidential elections, implying thereby the acceptance of the present system and lending support to the Pakistan-US push for peace through presidential elections with support from most of the factions. People like Motasim Agha Jan too are inclined to working within the system and thus trying to work their way through obstacles and obstinacy of Mullah Omar’s Taliban.\n\nNo surprise therefore, that a number of Taliban leaders have been put down in recent weeks in Hangu, Quetta, Islamabad and now Peshawar (Mullah Raqeeb’s murder on February 18, described by Omar’s Taliban as a terrorist act.) This murder suggests that: a) Taliban – hard or soft, of all shades – are present all over and b) the Afghan-American-Pakistani intelligence may be out to neutralize critical links in Mullah Omar’s organization, and thus deprive him of support that he is getting from inside Pakistan.\n\n[quote]A number of Taliban leaders have been assassinated recently in Hangu, Quetta, Islamabad and Peshawar[/quote]\n\nAbdul Raqeeb Takhari was a minister for Refugees Affairs under the Taliban rule, and a close associate of Motasim, a Taliban leader based in Turkey, who favors peace talks with President Hamid Karzai’s administration to end the insurgency in Afghanistan. Motasim condemned the killing of Raqeeb as “the handiwork of the enemy of Islam, Afghanistan, peace and stability” describing him as “a peace campaigner”.\n\nOn the face of it, Pakistan and the United States believe they can cross the presidential election hurdle in April and then get the BSA signed by Karzai’s successor. The current strategy seems to focus on isolating the hardline Mullah Omar and his associates by getting Hekmetyar and Motasim on board, neutralizing the Haqqani network through Pakistan. This, they hope, will pave the way for relatively comfortable drawdown of foreign troops, and simultaneously build the constituency for peace. Whether they can thereby really pin down the big elephant in the room, ie Mullah Omar is the key question as of now.\n\nImtiaz Gul is the Executive Director of the independent Centre for Research and Security Studies\n\nEmail: [email protected]",
  "latent_26764": "I wish I could say we wrote this comic about Ferguson, Missouri and the tragic police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown, but sadly the issues of an overly militarized police force and their growing animosity towards the populations they are supposed to serve and protect have been going on for quite some time, and show no signs of abating. Hundreds of Americans are killed by the police every year, of all races, but disproportionately black and other people of colors, and the police always seem to get away with it, with little more than a slap on the wrist, if they are punished at all. This issue hasn’t gone away, but in Ferguson we’re seeing maybe a tipping point, where American citizens are showing that they’ve had it up to hear with a brutal, hostile and thuggish police force that shows no compunctions about breaking the law, lying, threatening or attacking their own citizens.\n\nWhat makes this even more disturbing (as if it wasn’t disturbing enough), is the police’s flagrant attacks on journalists and the 1st amendment. While the unconstitutional practice of “free speech” zones has long plagued this country, the police have happily adopted this totalitarian practice and gone further, assaulting journalists themselves in attempts to keep their thuggish behavior of camera. Some officers have even gone so far as to call cameras weapons. Ridiculous. What this shows is that the police are scared as hell about having their thuggish activities recorded in any way. An obvious solution would be to require all police to have cameras attached to their uniforms recording at all times. Rialto, California outfitted it’s officers with cameras in 2012 and has seen public complaints against officers plunge 88% compared with the previous 12 months as well as officers’ use of force fell by 60%. This saves the public money in inevitable lawsuits that the city has to pay whenever police unjustifiably apply excessive force and will go a long way in rebuilding the police’s tarnished reputation.\n\nOf course, police are against this, because as it stands, too many people are willing to take their side automatically without overwhelming evidence proving their fault. Why give up a good thing, right? Courts end up taking the police man’s testimony as if it’s the word of god, and corrupt cops literally get away with murder. Oh well, maybe we can force them to record themselves anyways.\n\nThere’s also the disturbing issue of the militarization of the police by giving them tanks, assault rifles and other military surplus, but I think Audrey covered all that pretty well already in the comic. And hopefully this is an issue Obama will actually address.\n\nThis comic was written by Audrey and illustrated by her, Mikey, Bochay, Me and Antonio.\n\np.s. oh yeah, and if anyone takes exception to my describing the police as a gang of law breaking thugs… tell them to stop acting like a gang, breaking the law and acting thuggish and we won’t have any problems.",

Alastair Clarkson's men started the season 0-4, but despite a heavy injury toll, with defenders James Frawley, Grant Birchall and Josh Gibson among those having spent significant time on the sidelines, they are back in the finals race.\n\nLast Friday's six-point victory against Sydney left them one-and-a-half games behind West Coast, which is eighth.\n\n\"They're back to their best,\" Hardwick said.\n\n\"Offensively they're controlling the ball really well. I think the area that's probably escaping a lot of people is defensively they're doing some stuff that is elite. We showed our boys some vision this morning of how well they're doing that and controlling the ball as well.\"\n\nClarkson has revamped his backline, with regular forwards Jack Gunston and James Sicily among those having switched ends of the ground. Their intercepting prowess will be a key area for the Tigers to stop.\n\nRichmond will keep working on hitting its forwards to help nullify that threat.\n\n\"The one thing we've done really well this year, I think we're AFL (ranked) four with inside-50 entries, which gives us enough supply,\" Hardwick said.\n\n\"We've just got to make sure we've got our connection inside 50 a lot better. That's probably the area that we are still working on. We have got a relatively young and inexperienced forward six, so they're still taking some time to become accustomed to how we move and how we play the game.\"",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nGrizzlies-Rockets Preview\n\nBy MATT BEARDMORE\n\nPosted Dec 22 2012 2:30AM The defensive-minded Memphis Grizzlies are back on track following an undefeated homestand. However, continuing down that path could be a challenge given their recent struggles at Houston. Winners of four straight, the Southwest Division-leading Grizzlies will try to end a 12-game losing streak visiting the Rockets on Saturday night. Memphis (18-6) is giving up a league-low 89.2 points per game, but the team has really clamped down defensively since a season-worst three-game skid, holding its last four opponents to an average of 79.8 points. Grizzlies guard Tony Allen, a member of the NBA all-defensive first team last season, deserves as much credit as anyone for this success. He held Milwaukee's Monta Ellis to four points on Wednesday and Dallas' leading scorer O.J. Mayo to 10 on Friday in a 92-82 victory. \"I told Tony: 'You're going to guard (Mayo) whenever he is in the game,'\" said coach Lionel Hollins, whose team hasn't allowed 100 points since a 101-92 season-opening loss at the Los Angeles Clippers. \"... They had some other people score, but it wasn't the same as when he is playing.\" The Rockets (13-12) find themselves in a similar position. While Jeremy Lin and Chandler Parsons both have 30-point games this season, their success has largely hinged on how often James Harden, the team leader with 25.4 points per game, is putting the ball in the basket. Houston is 6-1 when he scores at least 30. \"James is kind of the head of the spear,\" coach Kevin McHale said after Harden hit a career-high 17 free throws and scored 33 points in Wednesday's 125-103 win over Philadelphia. \"He's the guy that takes us out and gets us going.\" Harden is averaging 29.9 points and has made 76 of 82 from the foul line over his last seven games. He trails only Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard in free-throw attempts per game with 9.9. \"He holds the ball low with his strong hands and gets a lot of foul calls,\" said Parsons, who led the Rockets with 19 points in a 93-85 loss at Memphis on Nov. 9. Harden hit 9 of 10 free throws in that loss, but Allen held him to 4-of-18 shooting and 18 points. Houston, among the league's best offenses with 104.8 points per game, matched its season low in scoring. The Grizzlies could use a similar defensive effort as they eye their first victory at Houston since April 15, 2006. Houston, though, is going for a season high-tying third straight victory and fifth win in six games. \"I can see us starting to build a little momentum,\" McHale said. \"We've got to continue this now and we've got a tough game. Our next game against Memphis is going to be tough.\" Lin and Toney Douglas have a tough matchup with Mike Conley, whose 11 assists on Friday made him the Grizzlies' all-time leader with 2,079, but teams that have been able to pressure Memphis' point guard have enjoyed some success. The Grizzlies are 2-5 when Conley has four or more turnovers and 11-0 when he has two or fewer. Conley committed two turnovers last month against Houston. Grizzlies leading scorer Rudy Gay, a former Rockets draft pick, scored a team-best 21 points in that game while teammate Zach Randolph, the NBA double-double leader with 20, finished with 15 points and 14 boards.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

His plan worked perfectly. James Harden scored 31 points with eight assists, and the Rockets earned their third straight win, 121-96 over the Grizzlies on Saturday night. Memphis entered the game allowing an NBA-low 89.2 points a game. But the Grizzlies had no answer for Harden. He did all his scoring in the first three quarters and reached at least 20 points for an eighth straight game. \"It's easier getting them early than it is going against the defense and trying to get something in the last five seconds of the shot clock,\" McHale said. \"That's where they really get into you.\" Houston used a big run midway through the second quarter to take the lead, and didn't trail after that to break a four-game winning streak by the Grizzlies. \"We know how physical they are,\" Harden said. \"They like to pound the ball in the paint and get easy layups. It was our job to push the tempo, get stops, and get in transition.\" Mike Conley had 16 points for the Grizzlies on a night when leading scorer Rudy Gay finished with a season-low six points. \"We tried to play their game, and they are obviously better at it than us playing at that pace,\" Memphis center Marc Gasol said. \"They beat us in every aspect of the game.\" Memphis hadn't allowed 100 points since the Clippers scored 101 in the season-opener - an NBA-best streak of 23 games. The Rockets needed just over three quarters to reach the mark, hitting it with a free throw by Jeremy Lin with 9 1/2 minutes left that made it 100-80. \"I think tonight we showed how explosive we can be offensively because we put 120 points on a team that hasn't allowed over 100 since the first game of the season,\" Lin said. \"This is just a testament to people moving and passing the ball.\" It was the Rockets' 13th straight home victory over the Grizzlies. Memphis hasn't won in Houston since April 2006. Lin added 15 points and a season-high tying 11 assists, and Marcus Morris scored 16 points. The Rockets took advantage of their speed in this one, outscoring Memphis 33-3 on fast breaks in the Grizzlies' most lopsided loss of the season. \"They were tired,\" Lin said of the Grizzlies, who beat Dallas on Friday night. \"So we wanted to make sure ... that we got the ball out and just run as fast as we can.\" Memphis coach Lionel Hollins was disappointed in his team's effort. \"We just had no juice, no energy, and were not mentally tough,\" he said. \"We just kind of packed it in early.\" The Rockets led by 15 points late in the third quarter when Harden found Greg Smith in the lane for a dunk. Quincy Pondexter made a layup on the other end before Carlos Delfino knocked down a 3-pointer from 2 feet behind the line to extend the lead to 94-76. Zach Randolph made a layup for Memphis to end the quarter with Houston up 94-78. The Rockets had a six-point lead before Harden scored seven straight points to push Houston's lead to 77-64 with seven minutes left in the third quarter. He started the run with a three-point play before jumping in front of a pass and taking it the distance for a layup. The Grizzlies led by three points with about nine minutes left in the second quarter before Houston used a 13-3 run powered by six points from Omer Asik to take a 48-41 lead. Memphis cut its deficit to four later in the quarter. This time, the Rockets used a 12-6 spurt to extend their lead to 64-54 at halftime. NOTES: The Rockets recalled G Scott Machado from the D-League Rio Grande Valley Vipers before the game. ... Asik had 14 points and 12 rebounds for his 12th double-double of the season. ... Houston is 7-1 when Harden scores at least 30 points. ... Randolph finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds for his 21st double-double this season, which leads the league. ... Houston's 32 assists were a season-high.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "For viewers, the effects will be felt on the individual broadcasts, like “World News with Diane Sawyer,” which lost two of its six senior staff members to buyouts. They will not be replaced.\n\nIn the future, more segments will be reported, filmed and edited by jacks-of-all-trades, called digital journalists, internally. They may lack the polish that a traditional four-person crew can provide, but they are much less expensive. Sometimes two of the digital journalists will team up for reports.\n\n“We are now, as a work force, becoming much more flexible,” said Jon Banner, the executive producer of “World News.”\n\nPhoto\n\nDavid Westin, the ABC News president, said that Mr. Banner was having each of his producers trained as digital journalists. But he emphasized that there was still a place for veteran videographers and editors at ABC.\n\nOther changes may be more subtle to viewers. More interviews will happen via Skype, rather than an expensive satellite truck. Prime-time shows will rely more heavily on freelance employees. More assignments will be made from a centralized office in New York, rather than by far-flung bureaus, because some of those bureaus have been severely downsized.\n\nBuyouts were announced in February as the prospect of layoffs loomed, and Mr. Westin made no secret of the fact that they would result in a leaner, smaller organization, a bid for survival in a crowded media landscape.\n\nMore than 300 employees were approved for buyout packages. An unknown number were laid off. A person with knowledge of the cutbacks said 22 staff employees were laid off on Tuesday in a final round of cuts, but ABC would not disclose the numbers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMorale is very low, according to some of the dozen ABC News staff members who agreed to be interviewed for this article. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by ABC to speak publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The cuts came shortly after CBS News, one of the other three network news divisions, lost about 70 staff members. The third division, NBC, is in a much better financial position because it has a cable news arm, MSNBC.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmid the buyout and layoff process, there has been widespread speculation about a potential pairing between ABC News and the Bloomberg TV cable channel. The two already share some content. Mr. Westin said ABC regularly talks to Bloomberg and another partner, the BBC, “about whether there are ways we can expand” their relationships, but “there’s no major change that’s imminent.”\n\nRichard Gizbert, a former ABC correspondent who now is host of a weekly media criticism show on Al Jazeera English, said the extent of the cutbacks stunned some former ABC employees. He noted that ABC’s London bureau, which is responsible for covering Europe and Africa and which employed about 100 people in the early 1990s, had already suffered a series of cuts over the years, and will soon employ barely a dozen people.\n\n“Yet there’s no fewer broadcasts,” Mr. Gizbert noted.\n\n(Mr. Gizbert’s contract was not renewed by ABC in 2004, and he lost a lawsuit against the network in 2006.)\n\nAlready, some bureaus, like Los Angeles, have been reduced significantly. Along with Mr. Rooney, other departing correspondents include Betsy Stark, Lisa Fletcher and Laura Marquez.\n\nBut ABC executives sharply disagreed with suggestions that the news division was throwing up its hands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The entire news industry is at a crossroads right now,” Mr. Westin said. In ABC’s case, rather than simply reducing headcount, “this is, ‘Let’s redefine jobs and what people do and what their skills are.’ ”\n\nBut to Mr. Rooney, the title of digital journalist is “really a code for cheaper and less professional.”\n\n“Good television news is expensive to do,” he wrote. “The shorter the deadline, the more people and equipment it takes. In the western states in particular, it would be very challenging for one or two people to shoot, write, edit and feed a breaking news story by 3:30 in the afternoon. Wildfires tend to happen in places where there is no cellphone coverage and no Starbucks with free Wi-Fi.” Despite his skepticism about the digital journalist strategy, Mr. Rooney said he believed that Mr. Westin was “trying to save ABC News.”\n\n“I hope they succeed,” he said, “although I like to think they will have a harder time doing it without me.”",
  "latent_27651": "Braden Holtby (born September 16, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). He received the 2016 Vezina Trophy after posting a 48–9–7 record and .922 save percentage during the 2015–16 NHL season. Holtby won the Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals in 2018.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nJunior [ edit ]\n\nHoltby spent his junior career with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Blades struggled through his first two seasons with the team, and Holtby managed only 42 wins in 115 games. However, in his last WHL season, after being drafted by the Capitals in the fourth round of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Holtby nearly equaled his wins total from the previous two seasons, posting a much-improved 40 wins in 61 games.\n\nProfessional [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Holtby made the jump to professional hockey and split the season between the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays and the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL). He posted an impressive 24 wins in 37 games for the Bears, with a 2.32 goals against average (GAA) and .917 save percentage. He won seven of 12 games with the Stingrays, and represented South Carolina in that season's ECHL All-Star Game.[1]\n\nHoltby made his NHL debut on November 5, 2010, against the Boston Bruins at the Verizon Center. After replacing Michal Neuvirth with ten minutes remaining and the game tied 3–3, Holtby stopped four Bruins shots as the Capitals scored two goals to give him the win.[2] Holtby made his first NHL start two days later against the Philadelphia Flyers, a game the Capitals won 3–2 in overtime.[3] Holtby recorded his first NHL shutout on March 9, 2011, stopping 22 shots in a 5–0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.[4] After posting a 4–0–0 record, a 1.05 GAA and a .965 save percentage, Holtby was named the NHL's First Star of the Week for the week ending March 13, 2011.[5] On March 27, 2011, Holtby was assigned to Hershey, despite a 10–2–2 record in 14 starts.[6]\n\nWith the Capitals in 2016.\n\nHe returned on the last game of the 2011–12 season due to starter Tomáš Vokoun's and backup Michal Neuvirth's injuries.[7] Holtby started Game 1 of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Boston Bruins, saving 29 of 30 shots in a 1–0 overtime loss.[8] In Game 2, Holtby stopped 43 of 44 shots in a 2–1 double overtime win to tie the series at 1–1.[9] Washington Head Coach Dale Hunter decided to start Holtby for the next game, even though Neuvirth and Vokoun would be available in the playoffs, stating, \"Holtby's our goalie.\" Holtby went on to aid the Capitals in upsetting the second seeded Bruins, stopping all but one of the shots he faced in a Game 7 to beat the Bruins 2–1 in overtime. He continued his sensational play against the top-seeded New York Rangers, splitting two road games in New York and stopping all shots he faced until late in a triple overtime game that saw the Capitals fall 2–1. Holtby continued his impressive goaltending by beating the Rangers in Game 4 to tie the series at 2–2. However, he was not as stellar in Game 5, allowing the game-tying goal with 6.6 seconds left in the game and then giving up the losing goal in overtime. After the game, Holtby stated, \"I didn't see a thing.\"[10] After the loss, Holtby rebounded by making 30 saves in Game 6, with the Capitals winning 2–1 and forcing the decisive Game 7. On May 12, Holtby started in his second career Game 7. One minute and 32 seconds into the game, Brad Richards of the Rangers blasted a slap shot past Holtby, making the score 1–0 early in. Holtby was able to shake it off, however, and play a solid game, finishing with 29 saves, though the Capitals were ultimately unable to beat the Rangers in the final period, losing Game 7.\n\nAfter his impressive playoff performances as a rookie, Holtby was rewarded with the starting goaltender's job for the 2012–13 season, as named by Washington's new head coach, Adam Oates. On February 25, 2013, just over a month after the lockout-shortened season commenced, Holtby agreed to a two-year, $3.7 million contract extension with the Capitals.[11]\n\nOn April 8, 2015, Holtby shut-out the Boston Bruins, 3–0, and having already shut-out Boston in his previous two games in the 2014–15 season, he became the first goaltender to ever perform a season-sweep of three or more games against Boston without a single goal allowed. This victory would also give him 41 wins on the season, tying him with Olaf Kölzig for most in a single season in Capitals history.[12] On May 4, 2015, Holtby shut-out the New York Rangers, 1–0, to capture a 2–1 playoff lead in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. The Capitals lost the series to the New York Rangers 2–1 in overtime in a game 7 at Madison Square Garden.\n\nFollowing the 2014–15 NHL season Holtby became a restricted free agent under the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Washington Capitals made him a qualifying offer to retain his NHL rights and, on July 5, 2015, Holtby filed for Salary Arbitration.[13] On July 24, it was announced by the team that Holtby had signed a 5-year, $30.5 million contract.[14][15] On April 9, 2016, the Capitals defeated the St. Louis Blues 5-1, earning Holtby his 48th win of the season (four of which came via shootouts) and tying him with Martin Brodeur for the most wins in a single season record. He achieved the mark with 66 game starts throughout the 2015–16 NHL season.[16]\n\nHoltby won the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the league's best goaltender, in 2016.\n\nHoltby leads the Capitals onto the ice during the 2018 playoffs\n\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Holtby became the second fastest NHL goaltender to record 200 career wins behind Ken Dryden. He recorded this feat on November 10, 2017, when the Capitals beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4–1.[17] He was also named an NHL All-Star for the third consecutive season.[18]\n\nOn March 28, 2017, Holtby earned his 40th win of the season when the Capitals beat the Minnesota Wild 5–4 in overtime. This win made Holtby the third goaltender in league history to record at least 40 wins in three consecutive seasons, joining Brodeur (2005–08) and Evgeni Nabokov (2007–10).[19]\n\nThe Capitals' head coach Barry Trotz opted to choose back-up goaltender Philipp Grubauer to start the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs.[20] After Grubauer struggled against the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first two games, Holtby stepped in as the Capitals starting goaltender, not being pulled for the remainder of the playoffs. Holtby helped to lead the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, posting a record of 16–7, a .922 save percentage, a 2.16 goals against average and two consecutive shutouts against the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Finals. Holtby is remembered for a play during Game 2 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals, in which he made a sprawling stick save on an open-net shot by Vegas Golden Knights forward Alex Tuch. If Tuch had scored, the Golden Knights would have tied the game with two minutes remaining in the third period.[21] Many people refer to Holtby's stick save as \"The Save\".\n\nHoltby finished third in Conn Smythe Trophy voting as playoff MVP, tied with Golden Knights goaltender Marc-André Fleury, behind only teammates Alexander Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov, the former of which won the trophy.[22]\n\nAfter a slow start to the season posting a 3.62 GAA with a .888 save percentage after 13 games,[23] Holtby made 41 of 42 saves in a 2–1 win on November 7, 2018, over the Penguins.[24]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nHoltby was born in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, but was raised in Marshall, Saskatchewan.

The letter was on Ford’s council letterhead and included a watermarked drawing of Ward 2, Etobicoke North.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nOn the back was an embossed gold seal, the City of Toronto logo and “Rob Ford Etobicoke North Councillor” stamped on the seal. The letter was dated March 19. Toronto has strict rules prohibiting councillors from using their position or city symbols for non-city endeavours. Leiper concluded Ford breached three regulations: those governing gifts and benefits; use of city property, services and other resources; and improper use of influence. She also took issue with Ford’s website statement that his charity “has raised more than $100,000 to purchase equipment and establish football programs.” Records from the Toronto Community Foundation, which administers the charity, revealed it raised just $37,294.68. Leiper recommended Ford correct this statement, but as of Friday night, it stayed on the website. She is recommending that council, at next week’s meeting, adopt her finding that Ford broke the rules and order him to reimburse the lobbyists and corporate donors.\n\nThe report says that, when asked about the issue, Ford responded: “I do not understand why it would be inappropriate to solicit funds for an arm’s-length charitable cause using my regular employment letterhead.” Leiper adds: “He wrote that the complaint had no basis in policy or law and he expressed concern that a ‘worthy cause would be undermined by an inconsequential complaint about the use of letterhead.’”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nLeiper said she gave Ford time to reconsider his position in light of the fact he had been warned twice before, last December and February after other citizen complaints, to stop using his position to raise money for a private charity. Ford, who met Leiper twice and spoke with her twice by phone during her investigation, chose not to revise his stance, she said. Ford has made his work as a volunteer coach at Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School and his foundation a central part of his campaign. According to a solicitation letter on city letterhead posted on Ford’s campaign website, he established the foundation to “help start up high school football programs by purchasing equipment that the school can otherwise not afford . . . Your support will give youth in some of our most vulnerable neighbourhoods the opportunity to participate in an extra-curricular athletic endeavour and will help to provide them with hope for the future.” He has repeatedly raised his football work as proof of his social conscience and community work. The report was released one day after Ford admitted to being convicted of a drunk driving offence after a traffic stop in Miami in 1999, in which a marijuana joint was found in his back pocket. He said he initially denied to a Toronto Sun reporter that he had been arrested for pot possession because he forgot about that charge, which was dropped. He didn’t tell the reporter that he was charged with drinking and driving. In a statement posted on his election website Friday night, Ford stated: “If it’s okay for Kyle Rae to spend $12,000 on a party, but wrong for me to raise money for needy children to get off the streets, out of gangs, and play sports, then something is wrong at City Hall.” Ford has criticized retiring councillor Kyle Rae for throwing himself a farewell party with more than $12,000 from his office budget. Ford added: “They’re trying to stop me from helping out youth, but won’t stop behind-closed-door secret deals or Councillors abusing their expense accounts. This is ridiculous.” Ford noted that he paid for the city logo-bearing stationery out of his own pocket, but didn’t address Leiper’s criticism that he used his taxpayer-funded office staff to prepare solicitations to his private charity and track its progress.",

You can find the second edition You are viewing the a post of the first edition of “Writing an OS in Rust”, which is no longer updated. You can find the second edition here\n\nIn this post, we explore exceptions in more detail. Our goal is to print additional information when an exception occurs, for example the values of the instruction and stack pointer. In the course of this, we will explore inline assembly and naked functions. We will also add a handler function for page faults and read the associated error code.\n\nAs always, the complete source code is on GitHub. Please file issues for any problems, questions, or improvement suggestions. There is also a gitter chat and a comment section at the end of this page.\n\nNote: This post describes how to handle exceptions using naked functions (see “Handling Exceptions with Naked Functions” for an overview). Our new way of handling exceptions can be found in the “Handling Exceptions” post.\n\n🔗 Exceptions in Detail\n\nAn exception signals that something is wrong with the currently-executed instruction. Whenever an exception occurs, the CPU interrupts its current work and starts an internal exception routine.\n\nThis routine involves reading the interrupt descriptor table and invoking the registered handler function. But first, the CPU pushes various information onto the stack, which describe the current state and provide information about the cause of the exception:\n\nThe pushed information contain the instruction and stack pointer, the current CPU flags, and (for some exceptions) an error code, which contains further information about the cause of the exception. Let's look at the fields in detail:\n\nFirst, the CPU aligns the stack pointer on a 16-byte boundary. This allows the handler function to use SSE instructions, which partly expect such an alignment.\n\nAfter that, the CPU pushes the stack segment descriptor (SS) and the old stack pointer (from before the alignment) onto the stack. This allows us to restore the previous stack pointer when we want to resume the interrupted program.\n\nThen the CPU pushes the contents of the RFLAGS register. This register contains various state information of the interrupted program. For example, it indicates if interrupts were enabled and whether the last executed instruction returned zero.\n\nNext the CPU pushes the instruction pointer and its code segment descriptor onto the stack. This tells us the address of the last executed instruction, which caused the exception.\n\nFinally, the CPU pushes an error code for some exceptions. This error code only exists for exceptions such as page faults or general protection faults and provides additional information. For example, it tells us whether a page fault was caused by a read or a write request.\n\n🔗 Printing the Exception Stack Frame\n\nLet's create a struct that represents the exception stack frame:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs #[derive(Debug)] #[repr(C)] struct ExceptionStackFrame { instruction_pointer: u64 , code_segment: u64 , cpu_flags: u64 , stack_pointer: u64 , stack_segment: u64 , }\n\nThe divide-by-zero fault pushes no error code, so we leave it out for now. Note that the stack grows downwards in memory, so we need to declare the fields in reverse order (compared to the figure above).\n\nNow we need a way to find the memory address of this stack frame. When we look at the above graphic again, we see that the start address of the exception stack frame is the new stack pointer. So we just need to read the value of rsp at the very beginning of our handler function:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_handler() -> ! { let stack_frame: & ExceptionStackFrame; unsafe { asm!( \"mov $0, rsp\" : \"=r\" (stack_frame) ::: \"intel\" ); } println!( \"\n\nEXCEPTION: DIVIDE BY ZERO\n\n{:#?} \" , stack_frame); loop {} }\n\nWe're using inline assembly here to load the value from the rsp register into stack_frame . The syntax is a bit strange, so here's a quick explanation:\n\nThe asm! macro emits raw assembly instructions. This is the only way to read raw register values in Rust.\n\nmacro emits raw assembly instructions. This is the only way to read raw register values in Rust. We insert a single assembly instruction: mov $0, rsp . It moves the value of rsp to some register (the $0 is a placeholder for an arbitrary register, which gets filled by the compiler).\n\n. It moves the value of to some register (the is a placeholder for an arbitrary register, which gets filled by the compiler). The colons are separators. After the first colon, the asm! macro expects output operands. We're specifying our stack_frame variable as a single output operand here. The =r tells the compiler that it should use any register for the first placeholder $0 .\n\nmacro expects output operands. We're specifying our variable as a single output operand here. The tells the compiler that it should use any register for the first placeholder . After the second colon, we can specify input operands. We don't need any, therefore we leave it empty.\n\nAfter the third colon, the macro expects so called clobbers. We don't change any register values, so we leave it empty too.\n\nThe last block (after the 4th colon) specifies options. The intel option tells the compiler that our code is in Intel assembly syntax (instead of the default AT&T syntax).\n\nSo the inline assembly loads the stack pointer value to stack_frame at the very beginning of our function. Thus we have a pointer to the exception stack frame and are able to pretty-print its Debug formatting through the {:#?} argument.\n\n🔗 Testing it\n\nLet's try it by executing make run :\n\nThose ExceptionStackFrame values look very wrong. The instruction pointer definitely shouldn't be 1 and the code segment should be 0x8 instead of some big number. So what's going on here?\n\nIt seems like we somehow got the pointer wrong. The ExceptionStackFrame type and our inline assembly seem correct, so something must be modifying rsp before we load it into stack_frame .\n\nLet's see what's happening by looking at the disassembly of our function:\n\n> objdump -d build/kernel-x86_64.bin | grep -A20 \"divide_by_zero_handler\" [...] 000000000010ced0 <_ZN7blog_os10interrupts22divide_by_zero_handler17h62189e8E>: 10ced0: 55 push %rbp 10ced1: 48 89 e5 mov %rsp,%rbp 10ced4: 48 81 ec b0 00 00 00 sub $0xb0,%rsp 10cedb: 48 8d 45 98 lea -0x68(%rbp),%rax 10cedf: 48 b9 1d 1d 1d 1d 1d movabs $0x1d1d1d1d1d1d1d1d,%rcx 10cee6: 1d 1d 1d 10cee9: 48 89 4d 98 mov %rcx,-0x68(%rbp) 10ceed: 48 89 4d f8 mov %rcx,-0x8(%rbp) 10cef1: 48 89 e1 mov %rsp,%rcx 10cef4: 48 89 4d f8 mov %rcx,-0x8(%rbp) 10cef8: ... [...]\n\nOur divide_by_zero_handler starts at address 0x10ced0 . Let's look at the instruction at address 0x10cef1 :\n\nmov %rsp,%rcx\n\nThis is our inline assembly instruction, which loads the stack pointer into the stack_frame variable. It just looks a bit different, since it's in AT&T syntax and contains rcx instead of our $0 placeholder. It moves rsp to rcx , and then the next instruction ( mov %rcx,-0x8(%rbp) ) moves rcx to the variable on the stack.\n\nWe can clearly see the problem here: The compiler inserted various other instructions before our inline assembly. These instructions modify the stack pointer so that we don't read the original rsp value and get a wrong pointer. But why is the compiler doing this?\n\nThe reason is that we need some place on the stack to store things like variables. Therefore the compiler inserts a so-called function prologue, which prepares the stack and reserves space for all variables. In our case, the compiler subtracts from the stack pointer to make room for i.a. our stack_frame variable. This prologue is the first thing in every function and comes before every other code.\n\nSo in order to correctly load the exception frame pointer, we need some way to circumvent the automatic prologue generation.\n\n🔗 Naked Functions\n\nFortunately there is a way to disable the prologue: naked functions. A naked function has no prologue and immediately starts with the first instruction of its body. However, most Rust code requires the prologue. Therefore naked functions should only contain inline assembly.\n\nA naked function looks like this (note the #[naked] attribute):\n\n#[naked] extern \"C\" fn naked_function_example() { unsafe { asm!( \"mov rax, 0x42\" ::: \"rax\" : \"intel\" ); }; }\n\nNaked functions are highly unstable, so we need to add #![feature(naked_functions)] to our src/lib.rs .\n\nIf you want to try it, insert it in src/lib.rs and call it from rust_main . When we inspect the disassembly, we see that the function prologue is missing:\n\n> objdump -d build/kernel-x86_64.bin | grep -A5 \"naked_function_example\" [...] 000000000010df90 <_ZN7blog_os22naked_function_example17ha9f733dfe42b595dE>: 10df90: 48 c7 c0 2a 00 00 00 mov $0x42,%rax 10df97: c3 retq 10df98: 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 nopl 0x0(%rax,%rax,1) 10df9f: 00\n\nIt contains just the specified inline assembly and a return instruction (you can ignore the junk values after the return statement). So let's try to use a naked function to retrieve the exception frame pointer.\n\n🔗 A Naked Exception Handler\n\nWe can't use Rust code in naked functions, but we still want to use Rust in our exception handler. Therefore we split our handler function in two parts. A main exception handler in Rust and a small naked wrapper function, which just loads the exception frame pointer and then calls the main handler.\n\nOur new two-stage exception handler looks like this:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs #[naked] extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( /* load exception frame pointer and call main handler */ ); } } extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_handler(stack_frame: & ExceptionStackFrame) -> ! { println!( \"\n\nEXCEPTION: DIVIDE BY ZERO\n\n{:#?} \" , unsafe { &* stack_frame }); loop {} }\n\nThe naked wrapper function retrieves the exception stack frame pointer and then calls the divide_by_zero_handler with the pointer as argument. We can't use Rust code in naked functions, so we need to do both things in inline assembly.\n\nRetrieving the pointer to the exception stack frame is easy: We just need to load it from the rsp register. Our wrapper function has no prologue (it's naked), so we can be sure that nothing modifies the register before.\n\nCalling the main handler is a bit more complicated, since we need to pass the argument correctly. Our main handler uses the C calling convention, which specifies that the the first argument is passed in the rdi register. So we need to load the pointer value into rdi and then use the call instruction to call divide_by_zero_handler .\n\nTranslated to assembly, it looks like this:\n\nmov rdi, rsp call divide_by_zero_handler\n\nIt moves the exception stack frame pointer from rsp to rdi , where the first argument is expected, and then calls the main handler. Let's create the corresponding inline assembly to complete our wrapper function:\n\n#[naked] extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( \"mov rdi, rsp; call $0\" :: \"i\" (divide_by_zero_handler as extern \"C\" fn ( _ ) -> ! ) : \"rdi\" : \"intel\" ); } }\n\nInstead of call divide_by_zero_handler , we use a placeholder again. The reason is Rust's name mangling, which changes the name of the divide_by_zero_handler function. To circumvent this, we pass a function pointer as input parameter (after the second colon). The \"i\" tells the compiler that it is an immediate value, which can be directly inserted for the placeholder. We also specify a clobber after the third colon, which tells the compiler that we change the value of the rdi register.\n\nWhen we try to compile it, we get the following error:\n\nerror: computation may converge in a function marked as diverging --> src/interrupts/mod.rs:23:1 |> 23 |> extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_wrapper() -> ! { |> ^\n\nThe reason is that we marked our divide_by_zero_wrapper function as diverging (the ! ). We call another diverging function in inline assembly, so it is clear that the function diverges. However, the Rust compiler doesn't understand inline assembly, so it doesn't know that. To fix this, we tell the compiler that all code after the asm! macro is unreachable:\n\n#[naked] extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( \"mov rdi, rsp; call $0\" :: \"i\" (divide_by_zero_handler as extern \"C\" fn ( _ ) -> ! ) : \"rdi\" : \"intel\" ); ::core::intrinsics::unreachable(); } }\n\nThe intrinsics::unreachable function is unstable, so we need to add #![feature(core_intrinsics)] to our src/lib.rs . It is just an annotation for the compiler and produces no real code. (Not to be confused with the unreachable! macro, which is completely different!)\n\nThe last step is to update the interrupt descriptor table (IDT) to use our new wrapper function:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs lazy_static! { static ref IDT : idt::Idt = { let mut idt = idt::Idt::new(); idt.set_handler( 0 , divide_by_zero_wrapper); // changed idt }; }\n\nNow we see a correct exception stack frame when we execute make run :\n\n🔗 Testing on real Hardware\n\nVirtual machines such as QEMU are very convenient to quickly test our kernel. However, they might behave a bit different than real hardware in some situations. So we should test our kernel on real hardware, too.\n\nLet's do it by burning it to an USB stick:\n\n> sudo dd if=build/os-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX; and sync\n\nReplace sdX by the device name of your USB stick. But be careful! The command will erase everything on that device.\n\nNow we should be able to boot from this USB stick. When we do it, we see that it works fine on real hardware, too. Great!\n\nHowever, this section wouldn't exist if there weren't a problem. To trigger this problem, we add some example code to the start of our divide_by_zero_handler :\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_handler(...) { let x = ( 1 u64 , 2 u64 , 3 u64 ); let y = Some(x); for i in ( 0 .. 100 ).map(|z| (z, z - 1 )) {} println!( ... ); loop {} }\n\nThis is just some garbage code that doesn't do anything useful. When we try it in QEMU using make run , it still works fine. However, when we burn it to an USB stick again and boot from it on real hardware, we see that our computer reboots just before printing the exception message.\n\nSo our code, which worked well in QEMU, causes a triple fault on real hardware. What's happening?\n\n🔗 Reproducing the Bug in QEMU\n\nDebugging on a real machine is difficult. Fortunately there is a way to reproduce this bug in QEMU: We use Linux's Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) by passing the ‑enable-kvm flag:\n\n> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/os-x86_64.iso -enable-kvm\n\nNow QEMU triple faults as well. This should make debugging much easier.\n\nQEMU's -d int , which prints every exception, doesn't seem to work in KVM mode. However -d cpu_reset still works. It prints the complete CPU state whenever the CPU resets. Let's try it:\n\n> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/os-x86_64.iso -enable-kvm -d cpu_reset CPU Reset (CPU 0) EAX=00000000 EBX=00000000 ECX=00000000 EDX=00000000 ESI=00000000 EDI=00000000 EBP=00000000 ESP=00000000 EIP=00000000 EFL=00000000 [-------] CPL=0 II=0 A20=0 SMM=0 HLT=0 [...] CPU Reset (CPU 0) EAX=00000000 EBX=00000000 ECX=00000000 EDX=00000663 ESI=00000000 EDI=00000000 EBP=00000000 ESP=00000000 EIP=0000fff0 EFL=00000002 [-------] CPL=0 II=0 A20=1 SMM=0 HLT=0 [...] CPU Reset (CPU 0) RAX=0000000000118cb8 RBX=0000000000000800 RCX=1d1d1d1d1d1d1d1d RDX=0..0000000 RSI=0000000000112cd0 RDI=0000000000118d38 RBP=0000000000118d28 RSP=0..0118c68 R8 =0000000000000000 R9 =0000000000000100 R10=0000000000118700 R11=0..0118a00 R12=0000000000000000 R13=0000000000000000 R14=0000000000000000 R15=0..0000000 RIP=000000000010cf08 RFL=00210002 [-------] CPL=0 II=0 A20=1 SMM=0 HLT=0 [...]\n\nThe first two resets occur while the CPU is still in 32-bit mode ( EAX instead of RAX ), so we ignore them. The third reset is the interesting one, because it occurs in 64-bit mode. The register dump tells us that the instruction pointer ( rip ) was 0x10cf08 just before the reset. This might be the address of the instruction that caused the triple fault.\n\nWe can find the corresponding instruction by disassembling our kernel:\n\nobjdump -d build/kernel-x86_64.bin | grep \"10cf08:\" 10cf08: 0f 29 45 b0 movaps %xmm0,-0x50(%rbp)\n\nThe movaps instruction is an SSE instruction that moves aligned 128bit values. It can fail for a number of reasons:\n\nFor an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS or GS segments. For an illegal address in the SS segment. If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary. For a page fault. If TS in CR0 is set.\n\nThe segment registers contain no meaningful values in long mode, so they can't contain illegal addresses. We did not change the TS bit in CR0 and there is no reason for a page fault either. So it has to be option 3.\n\nSome SSE instructions such as movaps require that memory operands are 16-byte aligned. In our case, the instruction is movaps %xmm0,-0x50(%rbp) , which writes to address rbp - 0x50 . Therefore rbp needs to be 16-byte aligned.\n\nLet's look at the above -d cpu_reset dump again and check the value of rbp :\n\nCPU Reset (CPU 0) RAX=[...] RBX=[...] RCX=[...] RDX=[...] RSI=[...] RDI=[...] RBP=0000000000118d28 RSP=[...] ...\n\nRBP is 0x118d28 , which is not 16-byte aligned. So this is the reason for the triple fault. (It seems like QEMU doesn't check the alignment for movaps , but real hardware of course does.)\n\nBut how did we end up with a misaligned rbp register?\n\n🔗 The Base Pointer\n\nIn order to solve this mystery, we need to look at the disassembly of the preceding code:\n\n> objdump -d build/kernel-x86_64.bin | grep -B10 \"10cf08:\" 000000000010cee0 <_ZN7blog_os10interrupts22divide_by_zero_handler17hE>: 10cee0: 55 push %rbp 10cee1: 48 89 e5 mov %rsp,%rbp 10cee4: 48 81 ec c0 00 00 00 sub $0xc0,%rsp 10ceeb: 48 8d 45 90 lea -0x70(%rbp),%rax 10ceef: 48 b9 1d 1d 1d 1d 1d movabs $0x1d1d1d1d1d1d1d1d,%rcx 10cef6: 1d 1d 1d 10cef9: 48 89 4d 90 mov %rcx,-0x70(%rbp) 10cefd: 48 89 7d f8 mov %rdi,-0x8(%rbp) 10cf01: 0f 10 05 a8 51 00 00 movups 0x51a8(%rip),%xmm0 10cf08: 0f 29 45 b0 movaps %xmm0,-0x50(%rbp)\n\nAt the last line we have the movaps instruction, which caused the triple fault. The exception occurs inside our divide_by_zero_handler function. We see that rbp is loaded with the value of rsp at the beginning (at 0x10cee1 ). The rbp register holds the so-called base pointer, which points to the beginning of the stack frame. It is used in the rest of the function to address variables and other values on the stack.\n\nThe base pointer is initialized directly from the stack pointer ( rsp ) after pushing the old base pointer. There is no special alignment code, so the compiler blindly assumes that (rsp - 8) is always 16-byte aligned. This seems to be wrong in our case. But why does the compiler assume this?\n\n🔗 Calling Conventions\n\nThe reason is that our exception handler is defined as extern \"C\" function , which specifies that it's using the C calling convention. On x86_64 Linux, the C calling convention is specified by the System V AMD64 ABI (PDF). Section 3.2.2 defines the following:\n\nThe end of the input argument area shall be aligned on a 16 byte boundary. In other words, the value (%rsp + 8) is always a multiple of 16 when control is transferred to the function entry point.\n\nThe “end of the input argument area” refers to the last stack-passed argument (in our case there aren't any). So the stack pointer must be 16 byte aligned whenever we call a C-compatible function. The call instruction then pushes the return value on the stack so that “the value (%rsp + 8) is a multiple of 16 when control is transferred to the function entry point”.\n\nSummary: The calling convention requires a 16 byte aligned stack pointer before call instructions. The compiler relies on this requirement, but we broke it somehow. Thus the generated code triple faults due to a misaligned memory address in the movaps instruction.\n\n🔗 Fixing the Alignment\n\nIn order to fix this bug, we need to make sure that the stack pointer is correctly aligned before calling extern \"C\" functions. Let's summarize the stack pointer modifications that occur before the exception handler is called:\n\nThe CPU aligns the stack pointer to a 16 byte boundary. The CPU pushes ss , rsp , rflags , cs , and rip . So it pushes five 8 byte registers, which makes rsp misaligned. The wrapper function calls divide_by_zero_handler with a misaligned stack pointer.\n\nThe problem is that we're pushing an uneven number of 8 byte registers. Thus we need to align the stack pointer again before the call instruction:\n\n#[naked] extern \"C\" fn divide_by_zero_wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( \"mov rdi, rsp sub rsp, 8 // align the stack pointer call $0\" :: \"i\" (divide_by_zero_handler as extern \"C\" fn ( _ ) -> ! ) : \"rdi\" : \"intel\" ); ::core::intrinsics::unreachable(); } }\n\nThe additional sub rsp, 8 instruction aligns the stack pointer to a 16 byte boundary. Now it should work on real hardware (and in QEMU KVM mode) again.\n\n🔗 A Handler Macro\n\nThe next step is to add handlers for other exceptions. However, we would need wrapper functions for them too. To avoid this code duplication, we create a handler macro that creates the wrapper functions for us:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs macro_rules! handler { ($name: ident) => {{ #[naked] extern \"C\" fn wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( \"mov rdi, rsp sub rsp, 8 // align the stack pointer call $0\" :: \"i\" ($name as extern \"C\" fn ( & ExceptionStackFrame) -> ! ) : \"rdi\" : \"intel\" ); ::core::intrinsics::unreachable(); } } wrapper }} }\n\nThe macro takes a single Rust identifier ( ident ) as argument and expands to a {} block (hence the double braces). The block defines a new wrapper function that calls the function $name and passes a pointer to the exception stack frame. Note that we're fixing the argument type to &ExceptionStackFrame . If we used a _ like before, the passed function could accept an arbitrary argument, which would lead to ugly bugs at runtime.\n\nNow we can remove the divide_by_zero_wrapper and use our new handler! macro instead:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs lazy_static! { static ref IDT : idt::Idt = { let mut idt = idt::Idt::new(); idt.set_handler( 0 , handler!(divide_by_zero_handler)); // new idt }; }\n\nNote that the handler! macro needs to be defined above the static IDT , because macros are only available after their definition.\n\n🔗 Invalid Opcode Exception\n\nWith the handler! macro we can create new handler functions easily. For example, we can add a handler for the invalid opcode exception as follows:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs lazy_static! { static ref IDT : idt::Idt = { let mut idt = idt::Idt::new(); idt.set_handler( 0 , handler!(divide_by_zero_handler)); idt.set_handler( 6 , handler!(invalid_opcode_handler)); // new idt }; } extern \"C\" fn invalid_opcode_handler(stack_frame: & ExceptionStackFrame) -> ! { let stack_frame = unsafe { &* stack_frame }; println!( \"\n\nEXCEPTION: INVALID OPCODE at {:#x}\n\n{:#?} \" , stack_frame.instruction_pointer, stack_frame); loop {} }\n\nInvalid opcode faults have the vector number 6, so we set the 6th IDT entry. This time we additionally print the address of the invalid instruction.\n\nWe can test our new handler with the special ud2 instruction, which generates a invalid opcode:\n\n// in src/lib.rs #[no_mangle] pub extern \"C\" fn rust_main(multiboot_information_address: usize ) { ... // initialize our IDT interrupts::init(); // provoke a invalid opcode exception unsafe { asm!( \"ud2\" ) }; println!( \"It did not crash!\" ); loop {} }\n\n🔗 Exceptions with Error Codes\n\nWhen a divide-by-zero exception occurs, we immediately know the reason: Someone tried to divide by zero. In contrast, there are faults with many possible causes. For example, a page fault occurs in many occasions: When accessing a non-present page, when writing to a read-only page, when the page table is malformed, etc. In order to differentiate these causes, the CPU pushes an additional error code onto the stack for such exceptions, which gives additional information.\n\n🔗 A new Macro\n\nSince the CPU pushes an additional error code, the stack frame is different and our handler! macro is not applicable. Therefore we create a new handler_with_error_code! macro for them:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs macro_rules! handler_with_error_code { ($name: ident) => {{ #[naked] extern \"C\" fn wrapper() -> ! { unsafe { asm!( \"pop rsi // pop error code into rsi mov rdi, rsp sub rsp, 8 // align the stack pointer call $0\" :: \"i\" ($name as extern \"C\" fn ( & ExceptionStackFrame, u64 ) -> ! ) : \"rdi\" , \"rsi\" : \"intel\" ); ::core::intrinsics::unreachable(); } } wrapper }} }\n\nThe difference to the handler! macro is the additional error code argument. The CPU pushes the error code last, so we pop it right at the beginning of the wrapper function. We pop it into rsi because the C calling convention expects the second argument in it.\n\n🔗 A Page Fault Handler\n\nLet's write a page fault handler which analyzes and prints the error code:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs extern \"C\" fn page_fault_handler(stack_frame: & ExceptionStackFrame, error_code: u64 ) -> ! { println!( \"\n\nEXCEPTION: PAGE FAULT with error code {:?}\n\n{:#?} \" , error_code, unsafe { &* stack_frame }); loop {} }\n\nWe need to register our new handler function in the static interrupt descriptor table (IDT):\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs lazy_static! { static ref IDT : idt::Idt = { let mut idt = idt::Idt::new(); idt.set_handler( 0 , handler!(divide_by_zero_handler)); idt.set_handler( 6 , handler!(invalid_opcode_handler)); // new idt.set_handler( 14 , handler_with_error_code!(page_fault_handler)); idt }; }\n\nPage faults have the vector number 14, so we set the 14th IDT entry.\n\n🔗 Testing it\n\nLet's test our new page fault handler by provoking a page fault in our main function:\n\n// in src/lib.rs #[no_mangle] pub extern \"C\" fn rust_main(multiboot_information_address: usize ) { ... // initialize our IDT interrupts::init(); // provoke a page fault unsafe { * ( 0xdeadbeaf as *mut u64 ) = 42 }; println!( \"It did not crash!\" ); loop {} }\n\nWe get the following output:\n\n🔗 The Page Fault Error Code\n\n“Error code 2” is not really an useful error message. Let's improve this by creating a PageFaultErrorCode type:\n\n// in src/interrupts/mod.rs bitflags! { struct PageFaultErrorCode: u64 { const PROTECTION_VIOLATION = 1 << 0; const CAUSED_BY_WRITE = 1 << 1; const USER_MODE = 1 << 2; const MALFORMED_TABLE = 1 << 3; const INSTRUCTION_FETCH = 1 << 4; } }\n\nWhen the PROTECTION_VIOLATION flag is set, the page fault was caused e.g. by a write to a read-only page. If it's not set, it was caused by accessing a non-present page.\n\nflag is set, the page fault was caused e.g. by a write to a read-only page. If it's not set, it was caused by accessing a non-present page. The CAUSED_BY_WRITE flag specifies if the fault was caused by a write (if set) or a read (if not set).\n\nflag specifies if the fault was caused by a write (if set) or a read (if not set). The USER_MODE flag is set when the fault occurred in non-priviledged mode.\n\nflag is set when the fault occurred in non-priviledged mode. The MALFORMED_TABLE flag is set when the page table entry has a 1 in a reserved field.\n\nflag is set when the page table entry has a 1 in a reserved field. When the INSTRUCTION_FETCH flag is set, the page fault occurred while fetching the next instruction.\n\nNow we can improve our page fault error message by using the new PageFaultErrorCode . We also print the accessed memory address:\n\nextern \"C\" fn page_fault_handler(stack_frame: & ExceptionStackFrame, error_code: u64 ) -> ! { use x86_64::registers::control_regs; println!( \"\n\nEXCEPTION: PAGE FAULT while accessing {:#x} \\\n\nerror code: {:?}\n\n{:#?} \" , unsafe { control_regs::cr2() }, PageFaultErrorCode::from_bits(error_code).unwrap(), unsafe { &* stack_frame }); loop {} }\n\nThe from_bits function tries to convert the u64 into a PageFaultErrorCode . We use unwrap to panic if the error code has invalid bits set, since this indicates an error in our PageFaultErrorCode definition or a stack corruption. We also print the contents of the cr2 register. It contains the accessed memory address, which was the cause of the page fault.\n\nNow we get a useful error message when a page fault occurs, which allows us to debug it more easily:\n\nAs expected, the page fault was caused by write to 0xdeadbeaf . The PROTECTION_VIOLATION flag is not set, so the accessed page was not present.\n\nNow we're able to catch and analyze various exceptions. The next step is to resolve exceptions, if possible. An example is demand paging: The OS swaps out memory pages to disk so that a page fault occurs when the page is accessed the next time. In that case, the OS can resolve the exception by bringing the page back into memory. Afterwards, the OS resumes the interrupted program as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe next post will implement the first portion of demand paging: saving and restoring the complete state of an program. This will allow us to transparently interrupt and resume programs in the future.",

  "latent_27759": "Football season is going to be here sooner than we think, and that means it's time to start hating anything and everything that has to do with Florida State.\n\nI have a brother who goes to the School That Will Not Be Named up in Tallahassee. As you can probably imagine, this makes visiting home a crash course in trash talking; my brother will kindly point out the horrific losses that the Gators have suffered last year, while I’ll be quick to send him that priceless picture of Jameis tripping over his own feet during the Oregon game (which still brings me to tears, no matter how many times that I see it). With football season starting up again, though, I realized that I was going to have to get some new material, and go on the offensive.\n\nThen, in the past few weeks, the stories about the disciplinary problems about two Florida State players began to come out. First, we heard rumors of freshman quarterback De’Andre Johnson punching a woman in a Tallahassee bar, which we then learned was true after the terrible video was put online. Then, star FSU running back Dalvin Cook was accused of also punching a woman after an argument outside of another bar back in June.\n\nI remember hearing all of this, and my first reaction was to text my brother to make fun of his team, like any good rival would do. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what I did, and while we went back and forth for a while after that, I couldn’t help but feel guilty about it. I had just used this instance of abuse as a way to spur on this petty rivalry that I have with another college.\n\nI think that rivalries in college football are great; they can make a game so much more exciting, and there’s nothing like sticking it to your rival after a big win (maybe we’ll pull it off this year, Gator fans). But I think that this is an incident of a rivalry going too far. I was guilty of it, and from what I saw all over social media over the course of several days after this news broke about these players, there were plenty of other Gator fans that were guilty of this too.\n\nBy using these stories to add fuel to the fire, we end up ignoring the real issue at hand; a man assaulted a woman. That’s a real, tangible, terrible act that shouldn’t be taken lightly. It happens all the time in the landscape of sports, and the actual effects of these acts get swept under the rug. I know that rivalries typically know no limits, but I think that has to change; at some point, a line has to be drawn.\n\nI know that Dalvin Cook’s case still has to be reviewed, and no hard evidence against him has come out. We’ll have to wait and see what happens with the case. But moving forward, we shouldn’t be using these incidents as ammunition in the never-ending war against our state rivals. Remember, our school wasn’t exactly the model of good behavior just a few short years ago. Sports are a large part of society, but let’s not let our rivalries distract us from what it means to be decent people. If we can’t find that distinction, I think that we may be in trouble. So let’s dial it back on using these stories to taunt Florida State. We can just show them the picture of Jameis again, instead.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you have probably already heard about Pongsathorn Wattanabenjasopha, the 12 year old school boy that committed suicide last week by jumping from the 6th floor of our school building. It was front page news last Friday in all the Thai newspapers and on television as well. All of them had a close-up of the last SMS message he had sent on his mobile phone. He had sent it to his friends late the night before. He basically said that the next day would be his last. His father had apparently scolded him for playing video games and forbid him from playing again.\n\nAll of the newspapers picked up on this and basically said that this was why he had jumped. We will never know for sure. I really feel sorry for his father as some newspapers criticized him for being too harsh with his punishment as if he was solely responsible. It wasn’t that long ago that they were blaming parents that allowed their children for playing video games too much. They wanted the gaming shops to be closed down or put out of bounds for young students.\n\nPongsathorn, or Arm to his friends, was just a normal kid loved by many including a number of the teachers. He was a good student that was in “hong king” last year – the class for gifted students. What happened was a real shock to everyone. On Thursday morning he came to school as normal. He walked up to his classroom on the 5th floor and put his bag on his desk. He then climbed the stairs to the computer center on the 6th floor. It was before school and the area was completley deserted. The time was 7.15 a.m. He climbed over the wall which is about three or four feet high. On the other side there is a kind of wide balcony where there are a number of potted plants. He climbed around these to the edge and then jumped to the playground below.\n\nI arrived at the school about twenty minutes later. At the front gate there were some teachers standing in complete shock. One had tears in her eyes. I didn’t know what was going on at the time. As I walked across the playground I could see the students huddled in groups talking in hushed tones. One of the teachers then came up to me and said that one of the students had fallen from the 6th floor. I was puzzled as there was no body nor any blood on the playground. I later found out that he had basically fallen feet first. Luckily he hadn’t hit any of the students as he fell right in front of one of the entrances to the school building. There would have been several hundred students in the playground at that time and most would be on their way up to their classroom. Some would have been as young as four.\n\nAs he was still alive, the teachers quickly summoned a samlor, which is the Thai version of a rickshaw, that had just dropped off some students. He was carried onto this and rushed off to the hospital around the corner. Someone who was on the road outside later told me that they saw him go by on the samlor with a teacher. As there was no blood she just thought that he was feeling ill or something. It didn’t look serious. At the hospital he went straight into surgery and then ICU. He had badly broken both legs and his ribs had punctured his lungs. He died later that afternoon. Understandably, everyone at school was in complete shock.\n\nOn Friday, the Ministry of Health arranged for some local hospital workers to come to the school to counsel the students. Some had difficulty in sleeping the night before. For the following three days a number of the teachers went to the local temple to take part in chanting. Early this morning, thirteen of Pongsathorn’s friends ordained as novice monks for the cremation ceremony. They did this to make merit for him. It is a big commitment for them as they have to shave off all their hair and eyebrows. It is common for boys to become novices for a few days when a grandparent dies. It is not normal for so many to ordain like this.\n\nThe cremation ceremony took place late this afternoon. Many of the older students and teachers from the school attended this ceremony. There was traditional Thai dancing and Thai music performed by our students. Then after the final chanting and the presentation of robes to the monks, we all went up to the crematorium to place a “sandalwood” flower under the coffin. This is symbolic. As everyone left we were given a kind of souvenir which was a Buddhist amulet. Most people then left and only close family remained for the actual cremation. The students that ordained as novice monks today will be back at school tomorrow.\n\nFour days have now passed but we are still in shock. When I arrived at school I didn’t enter my building at the usual entrance. I didn’t want to look up too. I went in a side entrance. I then took the lift up to the six floor and walked past the spot where he had jumped. I sometimes wander what would have happened if I had arrived that day just twenty minutes earlier than normal. For some reason I had woken up one hour earlier than I normally did that day. Could I have been there to stop him? But then, if he had already made up his mind to kill himself, he probably would have tried again. It is so tragic to see them take their life at such an early age. All life is precious but more so for someone who hasn’t had a chance to live his life. May he rest in peace.",

  "latent_28265": "Over the course of Nelson Mandela’s 95 years, South Africa evolved from a white-ruled British dominion to a republic representative of its majority-black population. But while the country has changed politically and demographically, economically it still looks much as it did nearly a century ago, divided along racial lines.\n\nThis infographic from The Economist shows how economic disparities between South Africa’s major racial groups (measured in real per-capita income) have grown over time. The gap between whites and all other groups grew wider till about 1970; white income growth flattened out in the 1970s and 1980s, as sanctions hobbled the country’s economy. But as sanctions were lifted after the collapse of the apartheid regime, whites and Asians (mostly of Indian descent) have benefited the most while black incomes have been nearly flat.\n\nAccording to South Africa’s 2011 census, average annual household income for blacks was 60,613 rand (roughly $8,700 at the then-current exchange rate), about a sixth the average annual income among white households and a quarter that of Asian households. Mixed-race (or “coloured” in South African parlance) households had an average income about twice that of blacks. (Note that those figures are in current dollars, and so aren’t directly comparable to the inflation-adjusted ones in the Economist chart.)\n\nThe other trend the Economist’s graphic makes clear is how much faster South Africa’s black population is growing relative to other racial groups. Blacks made up 79.2% of the country’s 51.8 million people, according to the 2011 census, up from 77.4% in 1996; whites were 8.9% of the population, down from 11% in 1996. (The population shares of mixed-race and Asian people have stayed fairly constant.)\n\nCategory: Chart of the Week\n\nTopics: Sub-Saharan Africa",
  "latent_28479": "Better to be cremated than to fade away?\n\nAlthough death and taxes have long been known as the only two things you can truly count on, what if dying isn't exactly what you thought it to be? From multiple well-funded immortality projects to new studies that are reshaping the way we think about what being \"dead\" actually means, you might want to know a bit more about what awaits you in the ever-looming grave, or wherever you go when you die.\n\nYour body can embarrass you even after death.\n\nYou've probably heard that hair and nails continue to grow after death. This may sound gross, but not only is that not exactly true, but there are far more embarrassing things that happen. First off, although hair and nails may appear to grow, what is really happening is the skin is losing moisture and therefore shriveling back and exposing more hair and more nails.\n\nWhen you die, you'll also likely urinate, defecate and, depending on your gender, possibly even ejaculate -- all are possible. This happens mainly due to the loss of brain function that keeps your body in check, and is then forced through the first stiffening of the body's muscles followed by an eventual return to relaxation and release. If you're male and die face down, blood begins pooling to the the parts of the body closest to the ground, which can also cause an erection.\n\nAnd if you're curious how long it will take to become a skeleton, after about a week, skin can easily be pushed off and after a month, teeth and everything else start to fall out.\n\nThere's a scientific explanation for why your life \"flashes before your eyes.\"\n\nIt is now believed that instead of the brain becoming more inactive during the final moments of life, brain activity actually surges, causing a hyper-aware mental state. This heightened state of consciousness can cause unexpected things to happen, whether that be \"life flashing before your eyes\" or a \"light at the end of a tunnel,\" which is also helped along by the loss of blood and oxygen flow to the eyes. The feeling of time slowing down during near-death moments also may simply be a misremembering of that traumatic experience.\n\nWe may be closer to living forever than ever before.\n\nCalico is Google's recently launched immortality project, which will aim to reverse the aging process, whether that means just for \"five or 10 years of healthy life,\" as one Harvard Medical School professor suggested, or if truly successful, living forever. Although Calico, or the \"California Life Company,\" has become the highest-profile project of its nature due to it coming from Google, another huge project is being run by a Russian billionaire named Dmitry Itskov, which aims to solve immortality by the year 2045. Iskov's plan involves building android bodies for humans, into which brains could be transferred, allowing them to live forever in the never-decaying (or at least easily replaceable) robo-body.\n\nIf you're curious about the philosophical ramifications of immortality, this interview with Philosopher John Fischer is a great place to start, while the New York Times also published an op-ed worth reading.\n\nWe might have a flawed understanding of when someone is actually \"dead.\"\n\nYou've probably heard of people being pronounced \"dead,\" only to \"come back to life.\" This apparently happens about three times a year in Great Britain alone. Due to new resuscitation studies, there's growing research that we might not have the best idea of when people are actually \"dead.\" In the rare instances of successful resuscitation after brain activity has appeared to stop, some people have been able to recount conversations and other memories that a \"dead\" brain should not have experienced. There isn't a \"death moment,\" and the process actually takes place gradually as various functions shut down. Perhaps over time we'll learn new resuscitation techniques that will make revival success stories more common.\n\nWe're running out of room for local cemeteries and cremation is much cheaper than typical burial.\n\nIf you're interested in what the cremation process looks like, here's a short YouTube video.\n\nYou might be breathing in dead people -- but you don't need to worry.\n\nWith higher cremation rates come increasing concerns about the proper procedure and disposal to insure we aren't breathing in the ashes of the dead. This horror story from a town outside Ottawa, Canada, shows what happens when you do it wrong. Soot from the Hope Crematorium spewed ashes into the air and forced nearby residents to keep their windows perpetually closed. As one home-owner put it, \"It makes you feel like you're breathing in the remnants of a … dead body.\"\n\nApparently ingesting these ashes doesn't constitute a health problem, unless it becomes a constant, highly concentrated issue that could lead to something similar to coal miner's lung. So, if Tupac's friends actually \"smoked his ashes\" or Keith Richards truly snorted his father's ashes with cocaine, the negative effects of the drugs that were mixed with the remains would have been more harmful than the ashes themselves.\n\nAround 286 Americans die every hour.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control, 2,513,171 Americans died in 2011. This comes out to a bit more than 286 American deaths every hour or about 6,885 a day. In comparison, the United Nations estimated 58,093,000 people died in the entire world during 2011, which would be about 159,159 deaths a day or 6,631 an hour.\n\nYou can be pronounced legally dead while still being very much alive.\n\nA 61-year-old man named Donald E. Miller Jr. was declared \"legally dead\" by a judge, despite attending the court hearing as a clearly living, breathing human being. Miller was first declared dead by the same judge in 1994 after having gone missing for years, leaving thousands in unpaid child support and leading his ex-wife to make the appeal in order to receive his social security benefits. When Miller re-emerged after years of wandering the United States, he hoped to be re-instated as a living American citizen in order to get back essential rights and a social security number. The judge ended up ruling against Miller, saying that in Ohio where the case was held, rulings of death can't be reversed if the judgment has existed for over three years. A ruling that Miller was indeed alive also could have forced his ex-wife to repay years of social security benefits, financially devastating her and her new family. The judge was quoted as saying, \"I don’t know where that leaves you, but you’re still deceased as far as the law is concerned.\"",

He could be a free agent in 2016 if he does not reach a long-term deal with the Seahawks or does not receive the team’s franchise tag. ProFootballTalk.com reported on Sunday that the Seahawks “remain intent” on working out a long-term deal with Wilson.\n\n• 2015 NFL off-season report cards\n\nWilson will make $1.5 million this season as part of the rookie deal he signed after the Seahawks selected him in the third round of the 2012 NFL draft. The Seahawks could offer Wilson a less-than-market-value deal at some point before the 2015 season starts, as opposed to waiting until 2016.\n\nOver his three NFL seasons, Wilson has completed 63.4% of his passes for 9,950 yards, 72 touchdowns and 26 interceptions. He reached two Super Bowls with the Seahawks, winning Super Bowl XLVIII, and made two Pro Bowls.\n\n- Mike Fiammetta",
  "latent_28599": "Wisconsin governor Scott Walker stealthily signed a bill into law on Friday requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals in order to perform abortions, and women to first have an ultrasound to “bond” with the fetus. The law, which brings the number of abortion clinics in the state down to two, goes into effect on Monday.\n\nSigned in a private ceremony and announced in a press release proclaiming, “This bill improves a woman’s ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future,” the new law was immediately met with a lawsuit and restraining order filed in federal court by Planned Parenthood and Affiliated Medical Services, which is being represented by the ACLU.\n\nThe suit asserts that the law “violates the Constitution’s due process guarantee, puts an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose abortion and unconstitutionally treats doctors who perform abortions differently than doctors who perform other services,” according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.\n\nThere are no plans at this time to challenge the ultrasound provision — which may be performed “using whichever transducer the woman chooses” and requires that the technician must point out the fetus’ visible organs, heartbeat and external features — in court. There are exceptions to the ultrasound requirement in cases of reported rape, incest and “imminent medical emergency.”\n\n“I think we have extremely strong grounds on the harm to patients,” ACLU attorney Larry Dupuis said. “This clearly imposes a significant burden on women seeking abortions when abortion is perfectly legal.” Dupuis maintains that it could take a clinic months to obtain admitting privileges, if at all.\n\n“We are confident this bill will be held to be constitutional,” said Susan Armacost, legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life, when asked about the lawsuit. She scoffed at the idea of “competent” abortion doctors having difficulty obtaining admitting privileges. “Who are these people that they cannot even get admitting privileges at a hospital?” she said.\n\nPhoto: Gage Skidmore via Flickr.com",

  "latent_28716": "The New York City Department of Transportation has released a series of star-studded ads highlighting the importance of bike safety, called \"Don't Be a Jerk.\" Here are the three, starring Mario Batali, John Leguizamo, and Paulina Porizkova. (Published Tuesday, May 10, 2011)\n\nClueless celebrities on bikes commit every possible violation, including riding the wrong way, running red lights and pedaling on sidewalks, in a series of public safety ads designed to remind New Yorkers about cycling rules.\n\nThe Department of Transportation unveiled Tuesday a new bike safety ad campaign highlighting the rules of safe riding, and it's no gentle nudge encouraging cyclists to play by the rules.\n\nInstead, the campaign -- called \"Don't Be A Jerk\" -- features celebrities Mario Batali, John Leguizamo and Paulina Porizkova on their bikes as they ride throughout New York City exhibiting the kind of egregious cycling that incurs the wrath of pedestrians and drivers.\n\nBatali is seen, in his trademark orange Crocs, riding against traffic in the bike lanes; Leguizamo barrels through pedestrians on the sidewalk; Porizkova flies past red traffic lights and stop signs.\n\nAnd the angry refrain hurled at each of them from bystanders in each of the spots: \"Jerk!\"\n\nEach ad closes with the words on the screen, \"Don't be a jerk.\"\n\nThe campaign is meant to \"humorously highlight the essential dos and don'ts of safe, responsible biking,\" said DOT.\n\nLeguizamo's spot is arguably the funniest. Sporting a tracksuit windbreaker, he swaggers to his bike stationed outside Bryant Park, strapping on his helmet. He swings onto his bicycle and takes off down the sidewalk, obliviously commanding pedestrians to get out of his way.\n\nFaced with no choice but to oblige, they shout \"jerk!\" after him (including DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan) -- until Leguizamo encounters a pre-teen boy in braces and sweatshirt.\n\n\"John!\" the boy chides. \"If you're over the age of 12, you can't bike on the sidewalk.\"\n\n\"I've got an appointment to go to, I'm late,\" Leguizamo counters.\n\n\"Don't be a jerk,\" the boy returns with a disapproving look.\n\n\"Don't call me names,\" Leguizamo retorts. But the actor gets off the bike and obliges.\n\n\"I'm doing it, I'm doing it... I'm off the bike!\"\n\nDOT said commuter cycling has bloomed in recent years, and with more bikes on the road, the time is ripe for reinforcing the message of making streets safer for everyone using them.\n\n\"Don't Be a Jerk\" is part of DOT's larger Bike Smart initiative, designed to educate cyclists and other road users about sharing the streets and roadways safely. DOT is distributing 1,500 bike bells purchased with money from federal grants and continues to fit and distribute free bike helmets at events citywide.",

  "latent_29041": "There was this woman named Martha back in colonial New England. She lived in the 1600s in Andover, Massachusetts. In fact, her father had been one of the town’s founders. Life was tough in the colonies, especially so for an independent-minded woman like Martha. Her entire life, she went against the grain, having children out of wedlock and marrying beneath her status. After having four children, Martha’s strong-headedness found her alienated from the other members of her community. She didn’t much mind, though, she had her husband and her four children to keep her company.\n\nWhen smallpox broke out in Andover, however, Martha found herself the target of scrutinizing eyes. Whispers began around town, as more people were killed by the illness. She heard them blame her. In all, thirteen people died, seven of whom were members of Martha’s own family. Rumour had it, Martha was a witch and had caused the outbreaks.\n\nTwo years later, Martha stood trial for witchcraft in Salem, after another smallpox outbreak occurred there. Witnesses assured the court they were haunted by the ghosts of Andover, and they were sure as the sun would rise that Martha was to blame. Martha’s children were tortured bloody until they confessed to being witches themselves and pointed the finger at their mother. It was all over for Martha. She was hanged in August, 1692.\n\nIt was okay, though. The people of Salem were Puritans. Puritans, like most Christians, valued the word of God and the word of God was very clear:\n\nThou shalt not suffer a witch to live. – Exodus 22:18\n\nIt’s hard to argue with that. If you are a believer, and you accept that both the Old and New Testament are the infallible words of God, you must both believe in witchcraft and not want witches to live, no?\n\nBut we don’t execute witches anymore, do we? Even the most devout Christians wouldn’t advocate for the murder of those accused of witchcraft. Outside of small pockets of ignorance throughout the world, we wouldn’t even accuse anyone of witchcraft to begin with.\n\nSo, what changed? What changed between 1692 and now? Was it the Bible? No. It’s right there, in Exodus, written plain as day: Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. God certainly didn’t swoop down from his Heavenly throne to edit that one heinous passage, nor any of the others throughout both testaments.\n\nThe Bible hasn’t changed. It is no different from the copies that floated around in 1692, save for the language. The basis of Christianity and Judaism remains the same.\n\nWhat has changed since 1692 is us. We’ve changed. Our values have changed. Our morals have changed. The vast majority of those of us in developed nations value secularism, whether we are religious or not.\n\nSecular values are what stops us from burning witches at the stake. The separation of church and state prevents us from legislating Biblical law. Adopting our own morality, independent of what the Bible says is the difference between us and the Puritans. While many people remain Christian and Jewish and still revere the words of the Bible, there is something stopping the faithful from heeding the most violent or hateful biblical passages. There is something stopping them from advocating for the execution of witches.\n\nThese values didn’t change because of Christian religious views. They changed in spite of them.\n\nIt can be said that, for the most part, secularism has kept the religious in check in the Western world. Christianity is no longer a violent and murderous threat because secular values make a damned good babysitter.\n\nThis morning, we woke up to the news that dozens of people had been killed in terror attacks in Brussels. We’ve been here before. We’ve risen to the news the Charlie Hebdo staff was massacred. We’ve followed along with the live updates as the Paris attacks unfolded. We all watched the twin towers fall.\n\nThe countries from which most of these attackers hail, are countries that have not discovered the value of secularism yet. Like the Puritans of colonial New England, residents of these countries are free to interpret their religious doctrine literally, and follow every word.\n\nWords like,\n\nThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper. 4:89\n\nand\n\n[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, “I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.” 8:12\n\nand\n\nMen are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. 4:34\n\nLike the Puritans, Muslim extremists take the words of their holy book very seriously. Also like the Puritans, Muslim extremists are not being kept in check by values outside of their holy book.\n\nWith secularism, though, we grew out of the extreme, witch-burning version of Puritanism. With secularism, I believe, we can grow out of the extreme, suicide bombing version of Islam. That is why what outspoken secularists do is so important. That is why we get online and shout about it until we’re exhausted. Eventually, the hope is, people from the most remote, theocratic corners of the world will log on and hear our secular message. Eventually, we hope, this message will make sense to one or two of them and they’ll pass it on.\n\nWhen people ask me why I never shut up about my atheism, or when they ask why I talk so much about something I don’t believe in, the answer is this:\n\nIf I shut up, I might miss that one kid in Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria who hears what I have to say. If I shut up, he might not take my message to heart and put humanity above his own religious beliefs. If I shut up, he might not decide to raise his children in a secular household with secular values keeping their religious beliefs in check. His daughter and her little brother who, if I had shut up, may have grown up to blow himself up on a crowded train in Brussels.",

I don’t sell them any more, and in fact sold less than 20 at the end of 2014. I wasn’t prepared to take the risk of them being used by non-competent swimmers.”\n\nConcern has grown after a mother posted a video on Facebook showing how she had to rescue her daughter from a pool after the child got into difficulties wearing a mermaid suit.\n\nAuckland Council’s McGee said most pools in Auckland had only seen “one or two mermaids” so far, but given overseas experiences they were taking preventative action.”\n\nRise of the mermaids: Weeki Wachee's biggest attraction makes quite a splash Read more\n\nThe focus on isolated swimmers put other pool users at risk. We are asking parents to keep the mermaid tails for home pools where they can have the direct one-on-one level of parental supervision.”\n\nMermaiding NZ said Auckland Council should embrace the “worldwide craze” and set up seasons when mermaids could have access to public pools, or classes for small groups of mermaids.\n\nFacebook user Amanda Jull posted on the Mermaiding NZ page that she was “frustrated” by Auckland council’s decision to ban the suits, which capitalised on the popularity of the Disney film Little Mermaid.\n\n“We only have a small-framed pool, which isn’t big enough for my nine-year-old very competent mermaid. The bigger pools are the only place she can swim freely, now it’s banned...This make me sad.”",

He killed and burnt my daughter,” read a Facebook post by her father.\n\nI can’t begin to imagine the rage her family and friends must be feeling.\n\nSomeone they trusted, who pretended not to know where she was, who “helped” look for her, had taken her life.\n\nHere’s the reality: one in every four womxn in South Africa is physically abused by an intimate partner.\n\nEvery six hours a womxn is killed by a current or former intimate partner.\n\nThese numbers are shocking.

Mind uploading is an alternative to more standard ‘biological’ methods for preventing ageing proposed by others such as Aubrey de Gray of the Methuselah Foundation. Randal believes that proponents of using medicine to extend lives underestimate the difficulty of what they are attempting to do. The reason is that evolution has led to a large number of complex and interconnected molecular pathways which cause our bodies to age and decay. Stopping one pathway won’t extend your life by much, because another will simply cause your death soon after. Controlling contagious diseases extended our lives, but not for very long, because we ran up against cancer and heart disease. Unless some ‘master ageing switch’ turns up, suspending ageing will require discovering, unpacking and intervening in dozens of things that the body does. Throwing out the body, and taking the brain onto a computer, though extremely difficult, might still be the easier option.\n\nThis got me thinking about whether biotechnology can be expected to help or hurt us overall. My impression is that the practical impact of biotechnology on our lives has been much less than most enthusiasts expected. I was drawn into a genetics major at university out of enthusiasm for ideas like ‘golden rice’ and ‘designer babies’, but progress towards actually implementing these technologies is remarkably slow. Pulling apart the many kludges evolution has thrown into existing organisms is difficult. Manipulating them to reliably get the change you want, without screwing up something else you need, even more so.\n\nUnfortunately, while making organisms work better is enormously challenging, damaging them is pretty easy. For a human to work, a lot needs to go right. For a human to fail, not much needs to go wrong. As a rule, fiddling with a complex system is a lot more likely to ruin it than improve it. As a result, a simple organism like the influenza virus can totally screw us up, even though killing its host offers it no particular evolutionary advantage:\n\nFew pathogens known to man are as dangerous as the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Of the 600 reported cases of people infected, almost 60 per cent have died. The virus is considered so dangerous in the UK and Canada that research can only be performed in the highest biosafety level laboratory, a so-called BSL-4 lab. If the virus were to become readily transmissible from one person to another (it is readily transmissible between birds but not humans) it could cause a catastrophic global pandemic that would substantially reduce the world’s population. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by a virus that killed less than 2 per cent of its victims, yet went on to kill 50m worldwide. A highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that was as easily transmitted between humans could kill hundreds of millions more.\n\nMy instinct is to oppose restrictions on developing new technologies. Nonetheless, while biotech seems to be taking a long time to generate inventions that materially improve our lives, it does appear to have enormous potential to do damage. Research into the flu might generate some way to protect ourselves. But current research greatly increases the risk that we will accidentally release a deadly pathogen My instinct is to oppose restrictions on developing new technologies. Nonetheless, while biotech seems to be taking a long time to generate inventions that materially improve our lives, it does appear to have enormous potential to do damage. Research into the flu might generate some way to protect ourselves. But current research greatly increases the risk that we will accidentally release a deadly pathogen of our own making\n\nAdvancing our understanding of how viruses are transmitted is important work. The more we know, the better we may be able to block transmission. However, it is a fallacy to consider every and any experiment fair game. Creating an agent more deadly than exists in nature falls into this category. … If it becomes “legitimate” to mutate a deadly virus we will see an explosion in this type of research. There are many more avian than human influenza viruses. If this controversial work is allowed to continue and more labs are going to be involved, the risk of an accidental release of a mutated H5N1 virus increases exponentially. Accidents do happen. We need look no further than the re-emergence of the H1N1 virus in 1977, after a 20-year hiatus. A group of US scientists investigating the 1977 outbreak concluded that it leaked out of a Russian lab that was working on a live-attenuated H1N1 virus vaccine. Historical data are not encouraging, either. Between 1978 and 1999 there were more than 1,200 incidents in which people were infected from BSL-4 labs. Since 1999, lab workers have been killed by numerous microbes, including Ebola and the Sars respiratory virus. Scientists have a moral responsibility to speak up and question the fundamental wisdom, the ethics and the social advisability of conducting such research. This includes questioning the scientific rationale for research of “dual-use concern”, even if that means taking on the powers that be or making themselves unpopular. This is why it is so important to maintain the moratorium on H5N1 research that involves dangerous experiments to see “what it would take” for the virus to become airborne – and therefore as transmissible from one person to another as the seasonal flu.\n\nIs the promise of better vaccines worth the risk of accidental release? Or the risk generated by developing techniques that a dangerous but intelligent lunatic might appropriate in the future? Humans are fragile, and so destructive applications of this science can easily run ahead of the helpful ones. Regulation of biotech research has to recognise that.\n\nEven in the best of times, it takes months to years develop and scale-up production of enough vaccines to protect more than a small number of people. If such a disease were already spreading quickly, the resulting panic would make this a much slower process. Meanwhile, recent research which produced a new, highly virulent and contagious H5N1 strain, wasn’t even performed in the most secure containment facilities.\n\nUnfortunately, preventing disaster requires our ‘defences’ to beat back the new threats not just most of the time, but every time. This is pretty difficult to begin with, but becomes even more so the more rapidly new innovations are appearing.\n\nGD Star Rating\n\nloading...",
  "latent_29735": "House Republicans released a tax reform plan Thursday that would eliminate a tax break for Americans with student debt.\n\nThe student loan interest tax deduction saves people as much as $625 a year, though most see a smaller benefit.\n\nThe sweeping legislation was described by House Speaker Paul Ryan as a series of tax cuts aimed at helping most Americans. But it eliminates or limits some tax deductions and exemptions to fund those cuts.\n\nThe student loan interest tax deduction is just one on the chopping block. The bill still needs to be approved by both the House and Senate, and signed by President Trump, who has said it will be done \"before Christmas.\"\n\nRelated: What's in the House tax bill for people\n\nHere's how it currently works: Those eligible can claim up to $2,500 of what they paid toward the interest on their student loans, but not the principal.\n\nIt's an \"above the line\" deduction that can be claimed without itemizing. But it's only available to borrowers with a modified adjusted gross income of less than $80,000 ($160,000 for married couples filing jointly.) The benefit is gradually reduced once you earn at least $65,000 (or $130,000 for couples).\n\nAbout 12 million people claimed the student loan interest deduction in 2015, according to the IRS. More than 40 million Americans have student debt.\n\nRelated: Don't worry, your 401(k) plan is safe\n\nThe student loan interest deduction cost the federal government $2 billion in foregone revenue during 2016, according to a report from The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe cost has more than doubled since 2007 as student loan balances grew, even though the maximum deduction ($2,500) hasn't changed since 2001, the report said.\n\nStill, it costs less than the American Opportunity Tax Credit. That allows families who are paying for college out-of-pocket to claim up to $2,500 per student. The benefit, which cost nearly $18 billion in 2016, would be preserved under the House Republican plan.\n\nEven if the federal student loan interest deduction is repealed by Congress, you may still qualify for a state deduction. Thirty-seven states and D.C. offer a similar benefit, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe House bill also proposes nearly doubling the standard deduction. It would raise it for singles to $12,000 and for married couples filing jointly to $24,000.",

Jenifferjit Sidhu said Sunday. Sidhu said the force's LGBT liaison officer has reached out to counterparts in Florida and to Pride Toronto to assess any threats.\n\nThe celebratory nature of Pride has been already been shadowed by the shooting, with a candlelight vigil planned on Church Street Sunday night to honour the 50 who died and the 53 injured in the shooting at Pulse nightclub.\n\nChantelois said that he was sickened by both the hatred and the violence in Florida, saying that he had still been unable to eat by late afternoon.\n\n\"What happened has already changed what this Pride month is about,\" he said. \"There's not one march, not one rally, not one human rights panel that we will not address it.

Chantelois said he and police are meeting Monday to ensure that organizers have taken all the steps they need to make sure that the LGBT community feels physically safe during this year's celebrations.\n\n\"We're meeting with police, we're meeting with the RCMP and we're going to look again at our plan and see how we can make it more solid,\" he said. \"This is what pride is all about, creating a safe space where we can all be together.\"\n\nPast Pride celebrations have been loving and inclusive, the director of LGBT organization the 519 said Sunday.

Click on the image to see how to view the picture via the copyright holder. For more Famous and Iconic Images Click Here\n\nAfter the Mohawk First Nations had fought off the local Quebec police force (which created another iconic image) the Oka Crisis developed into a stand off. The Canadian government sent in the Royal 22e Régiment or Van Doos to create a barb wire perimeter around the Mohawks in order to contain the situation. Entrances at this blockade were often tense as shown when a young Shaney Komulainen captured this iconic moment between baby faced Van Doo member Patrick Cloutier face to face with Brad “Freddy Krueger” Larocque.\n\nOka Crisis\n\nOver three hundred years ago the New France government granted land to the Catholic Sulpician seminary in 1717. Part of the land, a Mohawk burial ground was reserved for the local Mohawk First Nation. The seminary held the land in trust for the Mohawks but would over the years take full ownership. A military confrontation in 1869 between Mohawks and missionaries over the land had to be put down by local militia. The land remained in dispute even when it was sold by the seminary to private concerns. In 1961, the city had obtained ownership of the land and built a private nine-hole golf course, the Club de golf d’Oka, on a portion of the land. When they wanted to expand the golf course the Mohawks erected barricades to stop construction. A court order ruled on the side of the city and ordered the blockade to be removed. The Mohawk’s refused and on July 11, 1990 a police fast action response team tried to drive off Mohawk activists using tear gas canisters and flash bang grenades. In the confusion someone opened fire and a 15-minute bullet exchange ensued forcing the police to fall back, abandoning six police cruisers and a bulldozer. During the firefight, 31-year-old SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay was shot in the face and died a short while later.\n\nTaking the picture\n\nShaney Komulainen didn’t get into the Mohawk enclosure before it was closed off by the military. Arriving late she had to sneak into the encampment through military lines:\n\nI snuck through backyards and past police cars with my camera tucked under my jacket, looking like one of the locals. [Her eyes were drawn to the baby face of private Cloutier ] He just looked so young under that strong helmet and gear, … In the end, it summed up the whole crisis, because there was still this tense standoff, even ‘till the end.\n\nThe siege ended on September 26 and as the people in the Mohawk enclosure left their camp Komulainen was arrested, handcuffed, strip-searched and held by the Quebec police for five hours. The next January Komulainen was involved in a near fatal car crash that left her with a broken arm and two broken legs. While she was recovering in hospital she learned that the police were laying charges against her including, “possession of a weapon or an imitation of a weapon, threatening and interfering with the work of a peace agent, and participating in a riot,” latter in the year she was found “Not Guilty”. To make matters worse her car accident prevented her from working and she returned to school studying journalism and social work. Years later she had recovered enough to return to photography.\n\nThe men\n\nAfter the image was taken private Patrick Cloutier became famous across Canada and around the world. He rose through the ranks to become Master Corporal but in 1993 was demoted after admitting to cocaine use. After a drinking and driving incident he was kicked out of the military and as a civilian seeking to cash in on his fame he started in the 1995 pornographic, Oka spoof, Quebec Sexy Girls. For a while he lived in Florida before moving back to Quebec and lives in the village of Saint-Maxime-du-Mont-Louis.\n\nThe masked man is often confronting Cloutier is often misquoted as being legendary and camera friendly Mohawk warrior Ronald Cross aka Lasagna but was in fact Brad “Freddy Krueger” Larocque a student of Economics at the University of Saskatchewan. From the Ojibway First Nation he had joined the Mohawks in solidarity. After the siege ended he moved back to Saskatchewan.\n\nOther pictures of Protest and Civil Unrest\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Posts:",

  "latent_30071": "If you look at a dollar bill, you’ll see an image of George Washington which is, while pensive, neither happy nor sad. The same is true for his portrait on the quarter and, really, for almost every other portrait of the first President of the United States and Commander of the Continental Army. The exception: the image above. President Washington is clearly quite upset.\n\nWhy? Most likely, he was tired of sitting for portraits all the time.\n\nThe above portrait was painted by a man named William Williams (really) who, per his sparse Wikipedia entry, is “widely regarded as the first American portraitist.” Over his career, Williams painted portraits of a number of Founding Fathers including the first three Presidents of the United States. It’s unlikely that George’s sourpuss is the result of a less-than-skilled artist.\n\nWilliams, through Virginia Governor Henry Lee (a friend of Washington’s), requested that Washington sit for the painting above. But Washington was not interested in posing. According to Laura Simo, a curator at George Washington’s Mount Vernon Estate Museum and Gardens (via this video from the National Archives), Washington posed for more than a dozen portraits during his eight years in office — each of which required a few hours sitting and, for some, a few return visits for touch-up work and completion. The portrait-painting process — as the subject — was not one Washington enjoyed. In a return letter to Lee, dated July 3, 1792, Washington declined the offer to sit:\n\n[T]o be frank, and I hope you will not be displeased with me for being so, I am so heartily tired of these kinds of people that is now more than two years since I have resolved to sit no more for any of them. [. . .] [B]esides the irksomeness of the sitting and the time I lose by it . . . these productions have in my estimation been made use of as a sort of tax on individuals by being engraved (and that badly) and hawked about or advertised for sale.\n\nIn response, to help the President’s concerns, Williams agreed to give the portrait — if he were granted permission to paint it, that is — to the local lodge of the Freemasons, of which Washington was a member (and which would later take his name). Eventually, Washington capitulated — but apparently, he was not too happy about it.\n\nBonus fact : On April 12, 1945, at around noon, then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for painter Elizabeth Shoumatoff. During the sitting, while the President ate lunch, he complained of a “terrific pain in the back of [his] neck” and suddenly slumped forward, collapsing. FDR had suffered a stroke and died at 3:35 that afternoon. Shoumatoff never completed the portrait, preferring to leave in unfinished given the circumstances. It can be seen here.\n\nFrom the Archives: The First Photograph of a Person: It, too, was the result of a slow process.\n\nRelated: “FDR’s Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir” by Elizabeth Shoumatoff.

Chen, a 36-year-old health care executive in New Jersey and mother of two small children, had never considered entering politics, focusing instead on her family, her career and her community. That all changed in January, when she attended the Women's March on Washington. Thirteen hours later, she emailed Democratic officials: \"Here's my resume. I want to get involved.\" (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\nChristine Lui Chen, a 36-year-old health care executive in New Jersey and mother of two small children, had never considered entering politics, focusing instead on her family, her career and her community.\n\nThat all changed in January, 13 hours after she attended the Women’s March on Washington. She emailed Democratic officials: “Here’s my resume. I want to get involved.”\n\nLess than five months later, Chen’s name will be on the ballot, unopposed, in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. She hopes to become her district’s first Democratic state senator in more than 30 years, the first-ever Asian-American woman in her state’s legislature — and a spear-point for legions of enthusiastic, mainly liberal-leaning women inspired by the election of President Donald Trump to get into politics.\n\n“I just never thought politics was in the cards,” says Chen, whose parents immigrated to the United States with almost nothing to their name. “But I don’t want to be the one who didn’t do anything, when we’re at this moment in history where we need to stand up and say, ‘This is what it means to be an American.’”\n\nNew Jersey is one of two states holding general legislative elections this year; the other is Virginia. Political analysts will be watching closely to see if there’s a shift in the red-blue balance, but the newfound enthusiasm for politics among women — particularly young women like Chen — is also drawing attention. Like her, a number of them say they were inspired by Barack Obama’s suggestion, in his farewell speech, to “grab a clipboard” and collect signatures to run for office themselves, if they were disappointed with their elected officials.\n\n“This moment is unprecedented,” says Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, which works to recruit and elect pro-choice Democratic women. “We’ve never seen anything like it.” She says since Election Day, her organization has heard from over 13,000 women from all 50 states interested in running for office.\n\nTo compare: In 2015 and 2016 combined, about 920 women contacted the group. “And that was a good year!” she notes.\n\nThe vast majority, Schriock adds, are running in their local communities or on the state level. “They realize, ‘I’ve got to start local.’ It’s our responsibility to try to guide them into a race and that may be 2018, or it may be 2022. It’s a huge pipeline.”\n\nIn New Jersey, the Center for American Women and Politics holds an annual, non-partisan campaign training program, Ready to Run, each March at Rutgers University. Typically, only four or five women sign up by December, says Debbie Walsh, who heads the center. This year, 100 women had done so. Running out of space, organizers had to limit registration to 250.\n\n“I’ve never felt that kind of energy,” says Walsh of the recent session, where Chen was among the trainees. “I think it’s this universal moment for a lot of women — more on the middle-of-the-road to progressive end of the spectrum — who didn’t really pay that much attention to politics, kind of thought this was a world that they didn’t need to really participate in. This idea that you could be on the sidelines and that that was OK — no longer feels OK.”\n\nAlso among this year’s trainees was Lacey Rzeszowski, 42, a registered Republican until January, when she officially switched to the Democratic side. Rzeszowski is running for New Jersey Assembly; like Chen, she hoping to turn a longtime red district blue.\n\nRzeszowski, who in recent years has been a fulltime mother to her three sons, says she made her final decision to run during the bus ride home from the women’s march. All day, she’d been awed by the crowd — “the scale, enormity and beauty of it,” she says. “Women standing up for women.”\n\nAnd so, when her seatmate fell asleep on the way home, she found herself staring out the window. “I knew that when I got home, I was going to discuss it with my husband,” she says.\n\nLike Chen and Rzeszowski, Lisa Mandelblatt, an attorney and teacher in Westfield, New Jersey, found her career plans changing quickly after the march. She recalls feeling “stunned and horrified” after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, but newly hopeful after encountering the thousands of women — a sea of pink hats — who converged on Washington with her. “I started to feel, ‘OK, we’ve got this,’” says Mandelblatt, 53, referring to the country at large. “We’re gonna be OK.”\n\nPerhaps because she’s a teacher, Mandelblatt already owned a clipboard. “But I grabbed it,” she laughs. She’s now preparing to run for U.S. Congress in 2018, challenging for the seat held by Rep. Leonard Lance, a Republican.\n\nIn Virginia, Danica Roem faces a June 13 primary for the House of Delegates. Roem, 32, says she was motivated less by feelings about Trump than about the longtime incumbent she seeks to unseat, Bob Marshall, a conservative Republican who Roem contends has been “for 25 years, the most anti-LGBT legislator not just in Virginia, but in the entire South.”\n\nBut Roem, a journalist and transgender woman, doesn’t plan to spend a cent on opposition research. She covered Marshall for nearly a decade for several Virginia news outlets.\n\nOn the day Roem announced her candidacy, Marshall introduced his bathroom bill, prohibiting people from entering restrooms designated for use by members of the opposite sex. “His legislative priorities are more concerned with where I go to the bathroom than how his constituents get to work,” she says, referring to a major quality-of-life issue in her district: traffic.\n\nRoem hopes to become what she says will be the first out transgender person ever seated in a state legislature. She’s confident: Asked why her opponent has remained in his seat so long, she replies: “Because he’s never run against me before.”\n\nAlso facing a primary for a Virginia legislative seat is Jennifer Carroll Foy, a public defender. Foy never thought politics would be her thing. But her shock over the election — she’d gone to bed at 7 p.m., certain of a Clinton victory, and thought her husband was joking in the morning — spurred her to action.\n\n“It’s true what they say,” she says about women in politics. “Men have to be told NOT to do it, while women need to be told, yes, you CAN do it.”\n\nIt took the 35-year-old attorney, who was one of the first African-American women to graduate from the Virginia Military Institute, about six weeks to resolve to run. By then, she says, she had gone through various stages of grief: denial, anger. She decided not to be angry anymore.\n\n“I realized that I can either wait for someone else to do it, or I can be that change that I’d like to see,” she says.\n\nIt’s that same realization, says Chen, that has led her to knock on hundreds of doors since resolving to oppose incumbent Michael Doherty, who she says was the first New Jersey elected official to back Trump.\n\nFor Chen, a chief motivating factor was Trump’s immigration policies, a subject close to her heart. “Are we less American because we don’t look like Donald Trump?” she asks, referring to her family. Chen says she is also motivated by the fact that her husband is a cancer survivor.\n\n“Life is short,” she says. “Too much is at stake.”",

  "latent_30606": "Developer From Software has assured fans that there will be a follow up to cult hit Dark Souls.\n\nThe 2011 game was itself a spiritual successor - rather than a direct sequel - to the popular Demon's Souls. Both games have gathered a strong following thanks to its notoriously challenging gameplay.\n\n\"Of course, it's not over yet,\" From Software's R&D head Masanori Takeuchi told GameTrailers.\n\n\"We've always been enamoured by dark fantasy action RPGs. That's just been our core DNA and I think we'll continue to utilise that.\"\n\nAnd the studio's executive producer Eiichi Nakajima adds that the team will be aiming for a much wider audience next time around.\n\n\"We've always been about making games for the core gamer, and they weren't necessarily games that did well financially, which is too bad,\" he said.\n\n\"The success of both Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, which have each sold over a million [units] per title worldwide, has made us shift our thinking internally to not just core gamers, but to globalise our products, that they can be successful on a worldwide scale.\n\n\"That's now one of the key pillars we consider when we develop games in the future.\"",
  "latent_30674": "(Trailer is NSFW due to sex doll humping, coarse language, and cutting off fingers of elderly women, among other things.)\n\nYou know what's cooler than a million dollar movie? A billion dollar movie.\n\nAfter the first teaser trailer for \"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie\" was released on Wednesday, we could barely wait for the full-length trailer. Thankfully, we only had to wait two days to get a red-band trailer and see the first look at footage from the movie.\n\nAnd based on the trailer, this looks like it very well may be one of the most bizarre and unique comedies ever made.\n\n\"Billion Dollar Movie\" is the first movie from Tim and Eric as a team -- the pair have appeared in other films individually, such as Heidecker's mostly-silent turn as the groom in \"Bridesmaids.\" But this movie is their first feature film after working on television for several years with their series \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" and \"Tom Goes To The Mayor.\"\n\nWhile the trailer is mostly an assemblage of Tim and Eric-style nightmareish moments, a press release gives more details on the film's plot:\n\nTim and Eric are given a billion dollars to make a movie, but squander every dime… and the sinister Schlaaang corporation is pissed. Their lives at stake, the guys skip town in search of a way to pay the money back. When they happen upon a chance to rehabilitate a bankrupt mall full of vagrants, bizarre stores and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court, they see dollar signs -- a billion of them.\n\nThe movie may be photographed more professionally than on their cable-access show parody \"Awesome Show,\" but the same tone of dadaist insanity appears to be intact. It's also nice to see cameos from some stars the movie attracted, such as Zach Galifianakis, Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly and Jeff Goldblum, who plays Chef Goldblum.",
  "latent_30847": "President Obama’s reelection campaign has been rapidly increasing the number of big money “bundlers” collecting checks for his reelection, doubling the number of financiers who have brought in at least $500,000.\n\nThe influx during the first quarter of the year shows the president is getting an especially warm embrace from Hollywood and the broader entertainment industry, partly making up for a drop in support from Wall Street after Democrats passed broad new regulations for the financial sector, according to a list of fundraisers released by the campaign on Friday.\n\nThe support comes just as Obama’s Republican rival, Mitt Romney, is expected to get a fresh boost from donors who held out during the Republican nomination contest. In recent weeks, Romney has also started directing his backers to the Republican National Committee, which by law can accept bigger checks than his campaign.\n\nThe Obama campaign has 533 people who have each raised at least $50,000 for his campaign and the Democratic National Committee, including 90 who joined the campaign in the last quarter. The total nearly matches the 558 people who were listed as volunteer fundraisers for the 2008 campaign.\n\nOf this year’s bundlers, 117 are in the top echelon, raising at least $500,000 each, nearly double the number the campaign reported at the end of the 2011 and more than double the 47 who reached that level in 2008.\n\nThe lengthening list of top fundraisers is a sign that bigger donors are coming off the sidelines as the outlines of the race against Romney become clear. The president has so far collected fewer big donors than Romney, instead putting the emphasis on small-dollar contributors. Well-heeled donors have been slower to match the same level of enthusiasm that drove Obama’s fundraising during the hard-fought primary in 2008.\n\n“We’ve had to raise without the same sense of early urgency,” said Andy Spahn, a top fundraiser for Obama in Hollywood. “But the race is coming into focus and the donor community is really starting to step up.”\n\nThe campaign has 13 top fundraisers from the entertainment industry, including actor Tyler Perry, film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and Miramax founder Harvey Weinstein. In 2008, just three of the top fundraisers hailed from the industry.\n\nVice President Biden was in California last week for two fundraisers. Obama is headed back to the state next month after a successful swing in February, which included a 1,000-person Foo Fighters concert in the backyard of a soap opera producer and a separate $35,800-plate dinner.\n\nObama will be at actor George Clooney’s house on May 10 for another high-dollar dinner, slated to be the biggest event of his reelection with an expected haul of more than $3 million.\n\nOverall, Obama has raised at least $53 million in California, including $21 million from the Los Angeles metro area or about 10 percent of the donations listed on his disclosure filings, according to a Washington Post analysis. That’s up slightly from less than 7 percent at the same period in 2008 while other areas, including the Washington and Chicago regions, have accounted for a smaller share of Obama’s total.\n\nAn Obama campaign spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe news is especially good for Obama because top Hollywood personalities have the deep pockets needed to make large contributions to the super PACs supporting him. So far, the main super PAC behind Obama, Priorities USA Action, has shown very weak fundraising compared with those backing Romney, raising $4.6 million in the first quarter compared to $21.7 million raised by the biggest PAC backing Romney and $49 million by two conservative groups affiliated with former Bush administration political advisor Karl Rove.\n\nComedian Chelsea Handler, who hosts a late night talk show on the E! Entertainment Television network, gave $100,000 to Priorities USA Action, the group reported in a disclosure filing Friday. Handler joins Katzenberg, who previously gave $2 million to the group, and comedian Bill Maher, who gave $1 million.\n\n“For people in Hollywood and the creative community I think the main motivation is advancing progressive ideas,” said Bill Burton, who runs Priorities. “Hollywood doesn’t sell more movie tickets if Obama is reelected. They deeply care about equality and the environment and a long list of things that are important to Democrats.”\n\nRomney’s fundraising, meanwhile, is increasingly dependent on the New York City region, with more than 20 percent of the money from donations listed on his disclosure forms coming from the metropolitan area, twice as much as last time.\n\nLawyers, another traditional source of Democratic money, make up the biggest share of Obama’s top bundlers, about one in five. And big law firms have replaced financial houses as the biggest sources of cash for Obama. Lawyers from Sidley Austin have given $400,000 to Obama and the DNC, including $155,000 last month.\n\nThe firm is home to Obama appointee John Levi, whose wife Jill Levi is a bundler for the campaign. John Levi was included on a list of bundlers released last year in error, an Obama campaign aide said. Employees of firm Skadden Arps have given $578,000 and those of DLA Piper have given $509,000.\n\nTwo people were removed from the list of Obama fundraisers. New York lawyer Ricardo Oquendo was taken off after contributions he bundled were returned due to connections with two brothers of Pepe Cardona, a fugitive living in Mexico. Assongba Abake was also removed from the list after a Washington Post story brought attention to a lawsuit against her and her contributions were returned.",
  "latent_30976": "The United States should consider using “military means” against Iran, US Army General Joseph Votel says, calling Tehran “the greatest long-term threat to stability” in the Middle East.\n\nVotel, who heads the US Central Command (CENTCOM), made the hostile remarks while speaking before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.\n\n“I believe that Iran is operating in what I call a gray zone, and it's an area between normal competition between states — and it's just short of open conflict,” he told the panel.\n\nVotel went on to accuse Iran of “destabilizing” the region through “lethal aid facilitation,” using “surrogate forces” and cyber operations.\n\n“We need to look at opportunities where we can disrupt [Iran] through military means or other means their activities,” he said. “We need to look at opportunities where we can expose and hold them accountable for the things that they are doing.”\n\nThe general’s statements fall in line with the anti-Iran rhetoric of US President Donald Trump, who has accused Iran of supporting terrorism and said \"nothing is off the table\" in terms of a response to the country’s defensive missile program. Trump has also said that his administration formally put Tehran \"on notice\" over its missile test.\n\nAs the commander of CENTCOM, Votel is tasked with leading Washington’s military efforts in Central Asia and the Middle East. More than 80,000 US soldiers are stationed across the area under Votel’s command.\n\nThe general also oversees the US-led coalition’s airstrikes and other military operations against purported terrorist targets inside Syria and Iraq, a campaign that began in 2014 and has led to the death of many civilians without any meaningful achievement.\n\nVotel’s comments came less than two weeks after a deadly coalition strike that killed over 200 civilians in the Iraqi city of Mosul.\n\nRead More:\n\nThe Pentagon has admitted to carrying out such “unintentional” raids against civilian targets in Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen as well.\n\nRelatives mourn as bodies of Iraqi children of west Mosul killed in an airstrike by the US-led coalition are covered with blankets, March 17, 2017. (Photo by AFP)\n\nAdditionally, Washington has come under pressure for forging a close military and political alliance with Saudi Arabia, ignoring the regime’s bloody war on Yemen and its clear support for extremist groups.\n\nThis is while the international community has constantly hailed Iran’s active role in curbing the terrorism threat plaguing the region.\n\nPersian Gulf encounters\n\nIn his testimony before the lawmakers, Votel also discussed the recent surge in Iran-US military encounters in the Persian Gulf, saying his team was “paying extraordinarily close attention” to the issue.\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)’s Navy has on several occasions forced US Navy vessels to change course before wandering into Iranian territorial waters.\n\nThe last of such encounters occurred earlier this month, when a US Navy ship and three British Royal Navy boats steered out of the course approved for international naval transit in the Persian Gulf and came within 550 meters (0.3 nautical miles) of IRGC vessels, drawing serious warnings from them.\n\nIran has repeatedly warned that any act of transgression into Iran’s territorial waters would be met with an immediate and befitting response.",
  "latent_30996": "Australia's World T20 campaign has suffered a blow with Mitchell Johnson ruled out of the tournament. The mustachioed left-arm spearhead has been replaced in Australia's World Cup squad by NSW bowler Doug Bollinger.\n\nJohnson had been suffering an infection in a toe after receiving a cut during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. The Australian team had been hoping Johnson would respond quickly to antibiotics treatment and link up with the team in Bangladesh later this week. However, the infection has been deemed serious enough that he will remain in Perth to heal.\n\nCA Chief Medical Officer Dr Justin Paoloni said: “Mitchell had a cut on his right big toe after the 3rd Test against South Africa which became infected when he returned home to Australia after the series. We have given Mitchell as long as we can but unfortunately his infection hasn’t responded to the treatment as quickly as we had hoped with swelling remaining in his toe and foot.\n\n“It is difficult to say how quickly the infection will take to resolve and due to the high risk of infection recurrence with a return to bowling we feel it is in the best interests of Mitchell's health for him to continue to receive intensive treatment in Perth.”\n\nChairman of the National Selection Panel John Inverarity said it was disappointing to have to leave out Johnson. “It was anticipated that Mitch would have a significant impact with his pace and menace,\" said Inverarity.\n\n“Doug Bollinger has been called into the squad to replace Mitchell. Doug has had significant experience in the sub-continent and in international white-ball cricket and his ability to bowl with good pace was a factor in his selection.”\n\nBollinger's call-up is a blow to the NSW Blues, who will now be without the quick for the Bupa Sheffield Shield final in Canberra against the Alcohol Think Again Western Warriors from Friday.\n\nIn this season's KFC T20 Big Bash League, playing for runners-up the Hobart Hurricanes, Bollinger took six wickets at an average of 44.66 and an economy rate of 7.65.\n\nHe has played just two T20 internationals, in South Africa in 2011, taking one wicket in each match. In four ODIs in Asia, all in India, he has best figures of 5-35 and an average of 19.33.\n\nHis Shield return of 31 wickets at 24.09 saw him drafted in Australia's Test squad during the Ashes series as cover for Johnson and Ryan Harris, but was not needed as the 'Unchangeables' completed a five-nil whitewash.\n\nCoach Darren Lehmann had foreshadowed Johnson's replacement after Australia's T20 series win against South Africa in Centurion on Friday night. “He's still not great so we'll make a decision in the next couple of days,” Lehmann said.\n\n“If he's not healthy enough to travel, he won’t travel. The medicos are all over that back home and here so we'll have to wait a couple of days to see how he responds to antibiotics and all that.\n\n“Health is a bit more important than a game of cricket so, if we have to cover him, we'll cover him.",

  "latent_31812": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) sought to boost President Obama's national security credentials in a rapid-fire speech Thursday night that depicted the president as an unflappable commander in chief ultimately responsible for the tough call to go after America's most wanted terrorist.\n\n“Ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off now than he was four years ago,” Kerry told the Democratic National Convention to wild applause accompanied by high-fives and fist-bumps in the crowd.\n\n“That's what I'm talking about!” one young delegate exhorted, while 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis watched on the edge of his seat in the Massachusetts delegation section.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe killing of bin Laden was the theme of that segment of the convention. Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer also mentioned bin Laden shortly before Kerry spoke — “tonight … Osama bin Laden is at the bottom of the ocean” — followed by a short clip showing photos of Obama at the time of the decision.\n\nThe heavy focus on Obama's role in bin Laden's death risks re-igniting accusations that Democrats are spiking the football and ignoring U.S. troops. But Kerry sought to deny GOP nominee Mitt Romney's standing with the military by slamming his failure to mention Afghanistan, the longest war in the nation's history, during his acceptance speech in Tampa, Fla.\n\n“No nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech,” he said.\n\nKerry's remarks aimed to define Obama as a thoughtful yet firm president who has kept the country safe while “responsibly” winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Romney, by contrast, was painted as an inexperienced and indecisive candidate who's \"out of touch at home, out of his depth abroad, and out of the mainstream.\n\n“We've all learned Mitt Romney doesn't know much about foreign policy,” Kerry said in a jab at Romney's widely panned trip to England, Poland and Israel in July. “But he has all these [neoconservative] advisers who know all the wrong things about foreign policy. He would rely on them — after all, he's the great outsourcer.”\n\n“But I say to you: This is not the time to outsource the job of commander in chief.”\n\nKerry reminded voters that Romney has called the idea of going after bin Laden in Pakistan “naive” and has yet to lay out a plan for Afghanistan.\n\n“It isn’t fair to say Mitt Romney doesn’t have a position on Afghanistan. He has every position,” he said. “Mr. Romney, here's a little advice: Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself.”\n\nFrom torture to the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq before the war in Afghanistan was won, Kerry argued, Obama successfully cleaned up a mess left behind by the preceding president.\n\n“Just measure the disaster and disarray this president inherited: A war of choice in Iraq had become a war without end, and a war of necessity in Afghanistan had become a war of neglect,” Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, said. “Our alliances were shredded. Our moral authority was in tatters. America was isolated in the world.”\n\nRomney would unravel that progress by refusing to cooperate with Russia on issues like nuclear disarmament, Kerry added. Obama, by contrast, has created an international coalition against Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program, while vowing to “always to stand with Israel.”\n\nRepublicans have tried to make Israel an issue in this election by accusing Obama of not having the country's best interests at heart. The attacks created one of the few snafus of the Democrats' convention, when they had to amend their party plank to recognize Jerusalem as the nation's capital.\n\nThe prime-time slot — Kerry started speaking shortly before 9 p.m., about an hour before Vice President Biden — is seen as evidence that Kerry has a shot at the spot of secretary of State that he is widely rumored to covet.\n\nChoosing the decorated war veteran and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee does carry risks, though. Kerry polled dismally in the South when he ran for president in 2004 — he lost North Carolina by 12.4 points despite sharing the ticket with home state Sen. John Edwards — and his youthful anti-war activism has still not been forgiven by many pro-military voters.\n\n— Posted at 6:30 p.m. and updated at 9:23 p.m.\n\nBernie Becker contributed to this story.",
  "latent_31826": "Emmy the Empath’s Unofficial How-To Manual: In Pictures\n\nAnneli Rufus Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 26, 2015\n\nEmpaths unwillingly, unwittingly absorb, intuit and feel other people’s emotions — from joy to misery — by as-yet-unknown means. Vibrations? Electromagneticism? ESP?\n\nIt’s like being naked at Disneyland, light-sensitive at Burning Man or having pollen allergies inside a greenhouse.\n\nNot knowing why this happens and/or that it happens, dazed and drained while mistaking random weird feelings for their own, many empaths doubt their own sanity.\n\nDo empaths have a sacred gift, a psychic talent, an annoying hypersensitivity, a biological anomaly or a disease? How can they safely navigate this crowded, sad, mad world?\n\nEmmy the Empath wants to know. She’s scoured the Web and asked friends for empathy-management techniques. Let’s detail some she’s learned and tried, and what she thinks of them:\n\nThe fundamental technique, recommended by many, is “grounding”: Visualize a cord, root, anchor-chain or beam of light extending from your body deep into the earth. Imagine “flushing” unwanted bad energies down this cord and away.\n\nBut: Emmy pictures her cord becoming snarled undergound with those of other empaths and with plumbing pipes, high-voltage cables, gas lines, turbine generators, tree roots, weapon-smuggling tunnels, sewers and stalagmites. She also imagines her cord savagely bisecting moles.\n\nAlso, she wonders: How long and elastic are such cords? What happens to empaths on planes?\n\nGrounding makes sense — if you enjoy visualization and believe energy can be moved around. (Those are big ifs.) Other grounding techniques abound, for example: Touch trees; imagine shooting bad vibes down their roots. Walk barefoot on sand, grass or unpaved earth (ringworm alert!); imagine bad vibes draining through your soles. Wade, swim, bathe or otherwise touch water, preferably saltwater.\n\nWearing crystals and other gemstones can allegedly repel bad vibes and generate good ones. Agates for courage; amethyst for healing; bloodstone for protection; tigerseye for joy — or so they say.\n\nTo Emmy, this technique holds infinite appeal.\n\nAnother popular strategy is “shielding”: picturing oneself sealed inside an impenetrably emotion-deflecting substance: a fiberglass bubble, say, or spiked steel or a hazmat suit.\n\nSuch shields block all vibrations, bad and good — rendering empaths relatively numb. Appealing as that sounds, Emmy asks: Are we meant to feel and use our powers for some higher purpose? Is disabling them wrong?\n\nFor calibrated quasi-numbness, some empaths suggest….\n\n“Filtering”: Visualize yourself ensconced by not an impermeable substance but a porous one — sponge, say, or insulation foam or window-screen — which blocks (because you tell it to) only bad vibes.\n\nEmmy’s favorite filtering technique entails picturing herself surrounded by potent, protective pale blue light. Like rain falling around her in sheets. Made of light. She finds this image easy to maintain.\n\nMost of the foregoing techniques boil down to focused fantasy. This feels to Emmy sometimes effective, sometimes as silly as playing Mystery Date. Skeptics and others might prefer strategies aimed at de-cluttering and decompressing (Emmy calls it “desperate soul retrieval”) before, during and after human contact: For instance, listening to music. Emmy likes techno, bells and binaural beats.\n\nOther popular decompressors include art. Exercise. Nature. Prayer. Meditation. Food. Sleep. Animals. Venting with fellow empaths. Labor.

  "latent_31894": "Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the notorious one-eyed military commander of an al Qaeda-linked terrorist group in North Africa, once earned himself the nickname Mr. Marlboro -- but it wasn’t because of his rugged good looks or cowboy attitude. Belmokhtar, who has been sought by U.S. authorities for years, earned the moniker for his major role in trafficking smuggled cigarettes across the Sahara desert. And like many jihadi leaders of armed groups in the region, he helped funnel the profits toward his group’s activities.\n\nThat was more than a decade ago, when he was still working for al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), but running a team of jihadi militants in the middle of the desert hasn’t gotten any cheaper.\n\n“To maintain these groups you need millions of dollars, and the money has to come from somewhere,” said Pierre Lapaque, regional representative for West Africa of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. To feed that need, he explained, many of the jihadist groups that have blossomed in the lawless desert regions of Niger, Mali and Algeria are getting in on something more lucrative than smuggled cigarettes: They are making money from cocaine.\n\nAQIM and splinter groups such as Ansar Dine or the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa have moved beyond making money from kidnapping ransoms. These days, the bulk of their funds comes from across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n“It comes from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia,” Lapaque said. “It is coming from trafficking.”\n\nAccording to his estimates, between 30 metric tons and 40 metric tons of cocaine come through West Africa every year en route to booming markets in Europe. While a great deal of the profits go to the South American drug cartels, the African traffickers, often from local tribal groups, are getting a big cut, too. Jihadist militias that have blossomed in the region’s chaos in recent years have managed to get a piece of the profits, thanks to their control of ancient trade routes through the Sahara.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Tim Gaynor\n\nAir Cocaine\n\nFor a little over a decade, drug cartels in South America have been sending their products through West Africa to reach eager customers in Europe. Generally, the drugs cross the Atlantic over the infamous “Highway 10” -- a route along the 10th parallel that is the shortest distance between the two continents -- by ship or air.\n\nFrom there, the path to Europe goes north through the Sahara along routes once trod by camel caravans, which for centuries carried goods both legal and illegal. For generations, tribal groups such as the Tuareg and Tebu have controlled these networks. Though their convoys today are made of 4x4s with global positioning systems instead of camels, they are still the experts in trafficking anything from weapons to cigarettes.\n\nAnd Mali, which has been embroiled in conflict for years, is an easy route to take. The latest period of instability began in 2012, when rebel groups seeking independence and autonomy for the country’s northern region began attacking government troops. And despite an intervention from French troops in 2013, extremist jihadist groups continued to thrive in the chaos, with new organizations continuing to reveal themselves through violent attacks against troops from Mali, France and the United Nations.\n\nAt the same time, authorities began seizing larger and larger amounts of cocaine in the area. On one occasion in 2009, authorities recovered north of the Malian city of Gao the fuselage of a Boeing 727 thought to have been transporting up to 10 tons of cocaine from South America, in an incident now known as “Air Cocaine.” By 2014, there had been a major increase in cocaine seizures in Algeria, where it was coming through West and Central Africa, according to the 2014 World Drug Report.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Joe Penney\n\nIt didn’t take much for analysts to make a connection between these revenue streams and the rise of jihadists, but the relationship isn’t a direct one.\n\n“Most of the trafficking and informal trading is by individual clans of many different tribes, but primarily the Tuaregs and the Toubou people,” said Christian Nellemann, expert on threat finance and director of the Norwegian Center for Global Analysis. Generally, for smugglers, the product doesn’t matter as much as the fee. A person could be smuggling cigarettes one day and switch to drugs or weapons the next. And while jihadists aren’t driving the goods themselves, the drivers still have to go through their territory, and that’s where the militants make their money.\n\n“If insurgent or terrorist groups profit from illicit trade, they are more likely do so by taxing the movement of goods through territory they control, rather than being involved in the movement of the goods themselves,” said a 2014 report by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nThe model has worked well. It helps the groups avoid any direct connection to the trafficking, since the transporters themselves take the fall if they do get caught. For instance, Malian authorities eventually arrested a French pilot and a local businessman for their connection to the “Air Cocaine” incident, even though many suspect that jihadi groups profited from the loot.\n\nGroups such as AQIM earn about half the profits generated from drug trafficking, and those can take the form of direct cash payments or weapons, ammunition, vehicles or other equipment, according to a report from Francesco Strazzari, associate professor of international relations at Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies.\n\nIt’s no small business. Cocaine trafficking in West Africa generates about $800 million every year, according to the United Nations. And that’s before it sells for billions in street value after it reaches Europe.\n\nAnd though it’s been very profitable, jihadist groups in the Sahara have recently discovered yet another way to use the same smuggling routes to trade something even more lucrative.\n\nThe Emerging Migrant Market\n\nIn 2010, roughly 4,500 people were picked up by Italian authorities trying to cross from Libya into Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. By 2014, this number had reached 170,000, according to Italian government data cited by the Associated Press. Though the largest part of this group is refugees fleeing war in Syria, more than 50,000 came from sub-Saharan Africa -- each of them paying thousands of dollars to make the journey through the same ancient trade routes across the Sahara to Libya before making the trip to Europe.\n\nWith rising numbers of emigrants making the trade more profitable than ever -- more than 35,000 people have already made the same crossing in the first four months of 2015 -- it’s not surprising that armed jihadist groups are getting in on it.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS)\n\n“This lucrative business has caused a dramatic increase in the number of groups involved in trafficking,” said a recent update from the Global Initiative, which explains how terrorists are getting more involved. After Libya’s fragmentation, the chaotic region has become even more of a safe haven for armed groups to operate relatively freely.\n\n“There seems to be no lack of opportunity for these groups to make alliances with, profit from or to tax the smuggling and trafficking trades perpetuated by the proliferating number of armed groups and criminal networks in the region,” the report said.\n\nAnd for some of those groups, funding jihad through smuggling is nothing new. Al-Mourabitoun, one of many emerging armed groups in the region, which made headlines after a series of attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, happens to be led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar -- none other than Mr. Marlboro himself.",

  "latent_32021": "Published online 27 March 2008 | Nature | doi:10.1038/news.2008.698\n\nNews\n\nAward goes to maths that tames wild shapes and houses the infinite.\n\nMasters of symmetry: John Griggs Thompson and Jacque Tits. University of Florida and Jean-François Dars/CNRS Images\n\nThe Abel Prize, generally considered the ‘Nobel’ of mathematics, has been won this year by two mathematicians whose work has helped to classify the building blocks of symmetry.\n\nJohn Griggs Thompson of the University of Florida, Gainsville, and Jacques Tits of the Collège de France in Paris, France, have been given the prize, worth 6 million Norwegian kroner (US$1.2 million), for their work on group theory, which describes how the symmetry properties of objects fall into distinct classes or groups.\n\nGroup theory is one of the most practically useful branches of pure mathematics, being used in scientific fields ranging from fundamental theories of particle physics to the spectroscopic analysis of molecules.\n\nThe symmetries of objects can be described using fundamental ‘symmetry operations’: manipulations that leave the object looking unchanged. This is true of squares and cubes, for example, if they are rotated by a quarter of a full turn, or if they are reflected in various mirror planes that cut the shapes in half.\n\nThe full set of such symmetry operations for an object constitutes a 'group'. There is only a limited number of such groups, and they therefore supply a way of putting all shapes (or algebraic equations) into a small number of basic symmetry classes — a kind of 'Periodic Table' of symmetry.\n\nPrime symmetries\n\nThompson showed that certain symmetry operations can be broken down into more basic, indivisible operations, rather like the way molecules can be decomposed into their elemental atoms. These elemental operations are related to prime numbers. For example, a symmetry rotation of a 15-sided polygon is equivalent to the rotations of a 5-sided polygon and an equilateral triangle, both inscribed inside the original polygon.\n\n“Tits' work is about trying reduce wild to tame behaviour.” Graham Niblo\n\nIn 1963 Thompson and Walter Feit (who died in 2004) proved that the breaking down of symmetries into those of prime-number-sided shapes is always possible for objects with an odd number of symmetries (such as a 15-sided polygon) but not possible for even-numbered ones (such as a 16-sided polygon). Their Odd Order Theorem proof filled 255 journal pages and occupied an entire volume of the Pacific Journal of Mathematics — several other journals rejected the paper because it was too long.\n\nThis work showed how to tell whether or not a group was reducible to more fundamental groups, and it led to the recognition that so-called finite groups, which have a finite number of symmetry elements, can be classed into families, leading to the periodic table of such groups. These are enumerated in a dense book called the Atlas of Finite Groups.\n\nHousing the infinite\n\n“The Monster can only be fully seen in 196,883 dimensions.”\n\nTits has studied the symmetry properties of so-called linear groups, in which the symmetry operations can be infinite in number. There are, for example, an infinite number of rotations of a circle that will leave it looking unchanged.\n\nAlthough a circle seems a simple shape, the infinite symmetries of such shapes are hard to get a hold on. \"Tits' work is about trying to tame the infinite space of these objects, to reduce wild to tame behaviour,\" says Graham Niblo, a group theorist at the University of Southampton in the UK. Tits' work showed how these groups can be described and analysed in geometric terms, making their properties easier to visualize. He coined the term 'buildings' to describe the geometric structures that arise as a result, and showed that they can be further broken down into so-called 'apartments' and 'chambers'.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTogether the work of Thompson and Tits has led to a better understanding of a strange class of symmetrical objects called sporadic groups, which don’t fit into the periodic table of symmetries. \"They seem to come from nowhere,\" says Niblo. The most bizarre of these, and the largest, is an object called the Monster, which can only be fully seen in 196,883 dimensions and has 8 x 1053 symmetry elements. Thompson devised a formula for predicting how many symmetry operations a sporadic group may have, and Tits has studied some of them: one (the Tits group) is named after him.\n\nThe Abel Prize, established in 2002, is administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo. It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who himself made profound contributions to the foundations of group theory during his short life. Born in 1802, he died aged just 26. Plans for an Abel memorial prize were mooted on the first centenary of his birth, but came to nothing. They were revived on the second centenary, and the first Abel prize was awarded in 2003.",
