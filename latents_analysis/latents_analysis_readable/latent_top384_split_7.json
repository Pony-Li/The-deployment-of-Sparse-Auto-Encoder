  "latent_37": "Sri Lankan government imposes political gag on NGOs\n\nBy K. Ratnayake\n\n10 July 2014\n\nPresident Mahinda Rajapakse’s Sri Lankan government this week banned Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) from issuing media releases, holding news conferences, conducting workshops and training journalists.\n\nThis is a dictatorial attack on fundamental democratic rights, seeking to suppress any opposition to the government and taking a further step toward a police state. While the immediate aim is to gag NGOs, the government’s action sets a precedent for wider use, including against political parties, in preparation for deeper attacks on the working class.\n\nD. M. S. Dissanayake, director of the National Secretariat of NGOs, which functions under the defence ministry, issued a letter outlining the new restrictions on July 8. The letter stated: “It has been revealed that certain NGOs conduct news conferences, hold workshops, train journalists, and issue news releases, which is beyond their mandate.” It insisted that “all NGOs should desist from such unauthorised activities with immediate effect.”\n\nThis means that not only the specified activities have been banned, but NGOs cannot conduct any activity without the military’s authorisation.\n\nMilitary spokesman Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya, speaking at a media briefing, tried to play down the directive, saying it was just a “reminder” to act according to a “mandate” previously issued. However, until now, NGOs in Sri Lanka have held media conferences and workshops and issued press releases, despite continuous harassment by successive governments.\n\nWhen a journalist asked whether the move sought to silence NGOs in the context of the current UN investigation of Sri Lankan war crimes, the brigadier claimed there was “no such thing.” The UN Human Rights Commissioner recently appointed a panel to probe human rights violations committed during the final months of the military offensive against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009.\n\nThe investigation was initiated by a US-sponsored resolution in a UN Human Rights Council meeting. Washington is using the issue to demand that Rajapakse’s government sever its close relations with China. The government certainly fears that some pro-Western NGOs might give evidence on the many war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan military.\n\nHowever, the military’s move to directly control NGOs goes beyond such considerations. This is the first time that far-reaching restrictions have been imposed on these organisations. It is an indication the government is moving against all political opposition, particularly in the working class.\n\nMore than 1,000 national and international NGOs work in Sri Lanka. Previous regulations, issued from the 1980s onward, were mainly administrative in character. NGOs were registered under the health and social services ministry.\n\nDuring the war against the LTTE, the military sought to suppress these organisations. One prominent case involved the killing of 17 aid workers from Action Against Hunger, or ACF, in August 2006 in the eastern town of Muttur. They were murdered, execution style, at the very beginning of the Rajapakse government’s renewal of the war.\n\nThroughout the final two years of the war, the government prohibited or restricted NGOs including the International Red Cross, operating in the northern Vanni area. This was designed to starve Tamil people and deprive them of medical supplies, as well as prevent the leaking of any information about the military’s war crimes.\n\nAfter the war, as part of the government’s intensified militarisation of the country, the NGO secretariat was placed under the defence ministry’s control in April 2010. Organisations were registered only after being vetted, using military intelligence information. NGO trustees, funding sources, agendas and programs of work had to be approved.\n\nThe sweeping surveillance and underhanded activities conducted by the military intelligence service has been exposed by many of its operations against critics of the government and the security forces. In May, the military intelligence authorities blocked a workshop organised for Tamil journalists by Transparency International (TI), an internationally-affiliated NGO, at a hotel in Polonnaruwa in the North Central Province. The hotel management abruptly cancelled the event on the military’s orders.\n\nIn June, when the TI organised another workshop in Negombo, north of Colombo, a mob broke up the event. It is believed that the military intelligence service was behind the mobilisation of the thugs.\n\nThe NGOs Collective of Civil Society has declared it will ignore the ban and carry on its activities as in the past. Its statement said: “This [ban] is a serious blow to democracy in the country. We as part of civil society have the right to freedom of speech and association.”\n\nThis police-state measure is driven by the government’s nervousness about the developing opposition among working people, youth and the rural poor against its attacks on living conditions and social rights. Recent protests by workers in the power sector, railways and health and continuous protests by university students are just indications of deepening discontent.\n\nAlongside its attack on democratic rights, the government is seeking to stir communalism against Tamils and Muslims, in order to split and divert the working class. The recent attack instigated by the Buddhist extremist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) against Muslims in Aluthgama and Beruwela underscored this renewed campaign. The BBS is patronised by the government and enjoys the backing of the security forces.\n\nInterviewed by the Daily Mirror on July 1, Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse, the president’s brother, whitewashed the role of the Buddhist extremists and recalled his previous remarks about threats against the government. He was referring to a speech at the defence academy in June 2013, where he declared: “Although the likelihood of events such as the Arab Spring transpiring in Sri Lanka is minimal… this is yet another threat that needs to be monitored.”\n\n“Arab Spring” was the label given to the revolutionary upsurge of the working class in Egypt that reverberated across the Middle East. The Rajapakse government and the military are preparing to meet similar struggles with repressive and anti-democratic measures.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
  "latent_110": "While I was writing the post comparing the new Qualcomm server chip, Centriq, to our current stock of Intel Skylake-based Xeons, I noticed a disturbing phenomena.\n\nWhen benchmarking OpenSSL 1.1.1dev, I discovered that the performance of the cipher ChaCha20-Poly1305 does not scale very well. On a single thread, it performed at the speed of approximately 2.89GB/s, whereas on 24 cores, and 48 threads it performed at just over 35 GB/s.\n\nCC BY-SA 2.0 image by blumblaum\n\nNow this is a very high number, but I would like to see something closer to 69GB/s. 35GB/s is just 1.46GB/s/core, or roughly 50% of the single core performance. AES-GCM scales much better, to 80% of single core performance, which is understandable, because the CPU can sustain higher frequency turbo on a single core, but not all cores.\n\nWhy is the scaling of ChaCha20-Poly1305 so poor? Meet AVX-512. AVX-512 is a new Intel instruction set that adds many new 512-bit wide SIMD instructions and promotes most of the existing ones to 512-bit. The problem with such wide instructions is that they consume power. A lot of power. Imagine a single instruction that does the work of 64 regular byte instructions, or 8 full blown 64-bit instructions.\n\nTo keep power in check Intel introduced something called dynamic frequency scaling. It reduces the base frequency of the processor whenever AVX2 or AVX-512 instructions are used. This is not new, and has existed since Haswell introduced AVX2 three years ago.\n\nThe scaling gets worse when more cores execute AVX-512 and when multiplication is used.\n\nIf you only run AVX-512 code, then everything is good. The frequency is lower, but your overall productivity is higher, because each instruction does more work.\n\nOpenSSL 1.1.1dev implements several variants of ChaCha20-Poly1305, including AVX2 and AVX-512 variants. BoringSSL implements a different AVX2 version of ChaCha20-Poly1305. It is understandable then why BoringSSL achieves only 1.6GB/s on a single core, compared to the 2.89GB/s OpenSSL does.\n\nSo how does this affect you, if you mix a little AVX-512 with your real workload? We use the Xeon Silver 4116 CPUs, with a base frequency 2.1GHz, in a dual socket configuration. From a figure I found on wikichip it seems that running AVX-512 even just on one core on this CPU will reduce the base frequency to 1.8GHz. Running AVX-512 on all cores will reduce it to just 1.4GHz.\n\nNow imagine you run a webserver with Apache or NGINX. In addition you have many other services, performing some real, important work. What happens if you start encrypting your traffic with ChaCha20-Poly1305 using AVX-512? That is the question I asked myself.\n\nI compiled two versions of NGINX, one with OpenSSL1.1.1dev and the other with BoringSSL, and installed it on our server with two Xeon Silver 4116 CPUs, for a total of 24 cores.\n\nI configured the server to serve a medium sized HTML page, and perform some meaningful work on it. I used LuaJIT to remove line breaks and extra spaces, and brotli to compress the file.\n\nI then monitored the number of requests per second served under full load. This is what I got:\n\nBy using ChaCha20-Poly1305 over AES-128-GCM, the server that uses OpenSSL serves 10% fewer requests per second. And that is a huge number! It is equivalent to giving up on two cores, for nothing. One might think that this is due to ChaCha20-Poly1305 being inherently slower. But that is not the case.\n\nFirst, BoringSSL performs equivalently well with AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305.\n\nSecond, even when only 20% of the requests use ChaCha20-Poly1305, the server throughput drops by more than 7%, and by 5.5% when 10% of the requests are ChaCha20-Poly1305. For reference, 15% of the TLS requests Cloudflare handles are ChaCha20-Poly1305.\n\nFinally, according to perf , the AVX-512 workload consumes only 2.5% of the CPU time when all the requests are ChaCha20-Poly1305, and less then 0.3% when doing ChaCha20-Poly1305 for 10% of the requests. Irregardless the CPU throttles down, because that what it does when it sees AVX-512 running on all cores.\n\nIt is hard to say just how much each core is throttled at any given time, but doing some sampling using lscpu , I found out that when executing the openssl speed -evp chacha20-poly1305 -multi 48 benchmark, it shows CPU MHz: 1199.963 , for OpenSSL with all AES-GCM connections I got CPU MHz: 2399.926 and for OpenSSL with all ChaCha20-Poly1305 connections I saw CPU MHz: 2184.338 , which is obviously 9% slower.\n\nAnother interesting distinction is that ChaCha20-Poly1305 with AVX2 is slightly slower in OpenSSL but is the same in BoringSSL. Why might that be? The reason here is that the BoringSSL code does not use AVX2 multiplication instructions for Poly1305, and only uses simple xor, shift and add operations for ChaCha20, which allows it to run at the base frequency.\n\nOpenSSL 1.1.1dev is still in development, therefore I suspect no one is affected by this issue yet. We switched to BoringSSL months ago, and our server performance is not affected by this issue.\n\nWhat the future holds in unclear. Intel announced very cool new ISA extensions for the future generation of CPUs, that are expected to improve crypto performance even further. Those extensions include AVX512+VAES, AVX512+VPCLMULQDQ and AVX512IFMA. But if the frequency scaling issue is not resolved by then, using those for general purpose cryptography libraries will do (much) more harm than good.\n\nThe problem is not with cryptography libraries alone. OpenSSL did nothing wrong by trying to get the best possible performance, on the contrary, I wrote a decent amount of AVX-512 code for OpenSSL myself. The observed behavior is a sad side effect. There are many libraries that use AVX and AVX2 instructions out there, they will probably be updated to AVX-512 at some point, and users are not likely to be aware of the implementation details. If you do not require AVX-512 for some specific high performance tasks, I suggest you disable AVX-512 execution on your server or desktop, to avoid accidental AVX-512 throttling.",
  "latent_141": "Chimney sweep's cancer, also called soot wart, is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the scrotum. It has the distinction of being the first reported form of occupational cancer, and was initially identified by Percivall Pott in 1775.[1] It was initially noticed as being prevalent amongst chimney sweeps.\n\nPathogenesis [ edit ]\n\nChimney sweeps' carcinoma is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the scrotum. Warts caused by the irritation from soot particles, if not excised, developed into a scrotal cancer. This then invaded the dartos, enlarged the testicle, and proceeded up the spermatic cord into the abdomen where it proved fatal.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nChimney sweeps' carcinoma was first described by Percivall Pott in 1775 who postulated that the cancer was associated with occupational exposure to soot.[2] The cancer primarily affected chimney sweeps who had been in contact with soot since their early childhood. The median age of onset of symptoms in one review was 37.7 years, although boys as young as 8 years old were found to have the disease.[3] It was proposed by W.G. Spencer in 1890 that sweat running down their bodies had caused soot to accumulate in the rugae of the inferior surfaces of the scrotum, with the resulting chronic irritation causing scrotal cancer,[4] but this was shown to be an incorrect artifact of the method used to stain his microscope slides.[3]\n\nIn 1922, R.D. Passey, a research physician at Guy's Hospital in London produced malignant skin tumors in mice exposed to an extract made from soot, demonstrating the presence of carcinogenic substances in soot which were the likely cause of cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps.[3][5]\n\nin the 1930s Ernest Kennaway and James D. Cook of the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital, London, (later known as the Royal Marsden Hospital) discovered several polycyclic hydrocarbons present in soot that were potent carcinogens: 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene; 1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene; and 1,2-benzpyrene (3) benzo[α]pyrene. DNA consists of sequences of four bases – adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine – bound to a deoxyribonucleic backbone. Benzo[α]pyrene interacts with deoxyguanosine of the DNA, damaging it and potentially starting the processes that can lead to cancer.[2]\n\nSocial context [ edit ]\n\nThe disease was principally a British phenomenon; in Germany, for example, sweeps wore tight-fitting protective clothing which prevented the soot from accumulating on the lower surface of the scrotum, whereas boys in the UK were once sent up the chimneys wearing only trousers and shirt, and occasionally naked. In the United Kingdom before the flexible brush was introduced, the master sweeps took apprentices, who were boys from the workhouse or bought them from their parents and trained them to climb chimneys. In the German States, master sweeps belonged to trade guilds and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used. Boys as young as four climbed hot flues that could be as narrow as 230 mm square. Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. The boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed. From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and Acts of Parliament were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage. Lord Shaftesbury, a philanthropist, led the later campaign. In the United States, black children were hired from their owners and used in the same way, and were still climbing after 1875.\n\nSir Percivall Pott [ edit ]\n\nSir Percivall Pott (6 January 1714 – 22 December 1788) London, England) was an English surgeon, one of the founders of orthopedy, and the first scientist to demonstrate that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen. In 1765 he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the Royal College of Surgeons. It was in 1775 that Pott found an association between exposure to soot and a high incidence of chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a scrotal cancer (later found to be squamous cell carcinoma) in chimney sweeps. This was the first occupational link to cancer, and Pott was the first person to demonstrate that a malignancy could be caused by an environmental carcinogen. Pott's early investigations contributed to the science of epidemiology and the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788.\n\nPott describes chimney sweeps' carcinoma thus:\n\nIt is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges.....in no great length of time it pervades the skin, dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges, [sic] hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.\n\nHe comments on the life of the boys:\n\nThe fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, [sic] where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.\n\nThe carcinogen was thought to be coal tar, possibly containing some arsenic.\n\nThough Pott wrote no further papers on the subject, clinical reports began to appear suggesting that others had seen it without realising what it was and like Pott had said:\n\n[as it occurs after puberty]....it is generally taken, both by patient and surgeon for venereal and treated with mercurial [salts].\n\nThe disease was usually preceded by the development of hyperkeratotic lesions on the scrotum, which was what the sweeps called soot warts. These could be benign; sweeps often removed them themselves by trapping them in a split cane and cutting them off with a pocket knife. For instance:\n\n\"he... seized with a split stick and cut off with a razor. He remarked that it was not very painful. He resumed work the following day.\"\n\nBut if the lesion had become malignant it was far more serious. Patients frequently delayed seeking medical opinion, and when they did many were in a dreadful state. A 28-year-old sweep approached Jefferies in 1825, who describes his condition:\n\n\"The sore occupies the whole of the left side of the scrotum and the inner angle of the thigh, extending from the anus to the posterior inferior spinous process of the ileum, presenting a surface as large as a man's open hand, with hard indurated edges and irregular margins, discharging a thin sanies, which is extremely offensive; the left testicle is entirely denuded, and projects from its centre; in the left groin is a mass of indurated glands, the size of a goose's egg, which appears to suppurate in the right groin: there is likewise an ulceration, of the same malignant nature, about the size of a half-crown (5 cm)...\"\n\nDespite the appearance of this growth, the man was in no pain and his only complaint was that about 10 days before his admission he had bled from his groin and lost about a pint of blood. Even this, however, had not unduly affected his constitution.\n\nTreatment [ edit ]\n\nTreatment was by surgery, where all the diseased flesh was cut out. Before the introduction of anaesthetics this was a simple process for the surgeon but terrifying for the patient. Alternative treatments were also proposed including the application of an arsenic paste poultice. The real cause of this cancer was unproved until the discovery of weak carcinogens in soot by Passley in 1922. Until then the most popular theory was that soot got trapped in the rugae of the scrotum and this caused a general irritation. Sweeps were not known for their attention to bodily hygiene and it was assumed they never washed their genitals. The youngest victim, recorded in 1790 by James Earle (Pott's son-in-law), was 8 years old.\n\nRelated diseases [ edit ]\n\nDecades later, it was noticed to occur amongst gas plant and oil shale workers, and it was later found that certain constituents of tar, soot, and oils, known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The related cancer, mule spinners' carcinoma, was blamed on the carcinogenic content of shale oil that was used to lubricate the rapidly revolving mule spindles.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nNotes",

  "latent_232": "Author's Note: There was no chapter numbered 27. I've skipped the numbering from chapter 26 to 28 in order to bring it back in alignment with what FFN thinks it should be.\n\n\"Now, why don't the four of you set your weapons on the ground?\" Orochimaru said. \"You are outnumbered by superior opponents and surrounded. This is serious ground, but not yet death ground. Set your weapons down and let's talk. I promise you will not be harmed.\"\n\n\"Sadly, I cannot promise the same to you,\" said the Nine-Tailed Fox, making Naruto's body step casually away from Hinata and walk forward to stand between the team and their enemies. \"Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.\"\n\nA thousand Fox-Narutos appeared across the battlefield, three around each person, two dozen in an inner perimeter around Team Anko, and hundreds more in an outer perimeter around the entire field.\n\nTeam Anko found themselves each grabbed by a trio of Foxen, hurled to the ground, and buried under a pile of furry bodies. Anko and Shino struggled to no effect; Hinata lay still and watched through her Byakugan as events unfolded. The mass of Naruto pressing down on her blocked all sound, but lipreading was easy enough.\n\nAt the same instant that Team Anko was being tackled, monomolecular claws were tearing the heads off the Sound ANBU...which just activated their contingent kawarimis and switched them with many of the training logs around the field. At which point the Foxen who had been waiting next to those logs tore the heads off the ANBU for real.\n\n\"Your freedom,\" Orochimaru said, in the split second before the bijuu-clones reached him and bore him to the ground.\n\n\"...I'm listening,\" said the original Fox, standing over the Sannin with arms folded.\n\n\"You should recall my former teammate, Jiraiya,\" Orochimaru said, calm and unruffled despite being held down by a combined half a ton of inhuman monsters. \"He is, without a doubt, the best seal smith in the world, and probably the only person who could cleanly undo your seal. I've arranged for him to be here in two days.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" the Fox said. \"And why would you do this?\"\n\n\"My reasons shall remain my own, I think,\" Orochimaru said. \"However, if you would like to be free of the blond, you'll need to bargain with me.\"\n\nThe Fox raised Naruto's eyebrow. \"Will I, now? And what exactly is to keep me from ripping you in half and 'negotiating' with Jiraiya when he arrives? I've found that most monkeys will do whatever you ask after you peel off enough of their skin.\"\n\nOrochimaru snorted. \"Please,\" he said. \"Don't act the fool. You can't compel a sealmaster; all he needs to do is make the tiniest 'mistake' and you'll be in agonizing pain, or locked away again, or banished to Hell.\"\n\n\"A valid point,\" the Fox admitted, diamond-hard teeth grinding together. \"However, I'm sure that Jiraiya will be happy to set me free in order to save his godson.\"\n\n\"I doubt that very much,\" Orochimaru said. \"Yes, he'll want to save Naruto, but he will believe that the first thing you would do upon being released was to kill the vessel of your former imprisonment. Even if you can convince him that you wouldn't, he'll still recognize that both Naruto and Konoha are better off with your power available to them. He may promise to set you free, but actually he'll just imprison you again.\"\n\nThe tooth-grinding got louder. \"Very well,\" the Fox said. \"I note, however, that you have not answered my first question. Explain to me why I shouldn't tear your head off right now?\"\n\n\"Because I can convince Jiraiya to actually set you free,\" Orochimaru said.\n\n\"...Go on,\" the Fox said.\n\n\"No,\" Orochimaru said. \"Get off of me.\"\n\nHinata watched, eyes wide, as the Fox stared down at Orochimaru for long seconds. She could feel the killing intent boiling off the monster, but Orochimaru remained completely unmoved.\n\nSlowly the Fox clones stood clear. Orochimaru waited until he was completely free, then stretched languorously and rolled to his feet, dusting off his clothes.\n\n\"If you do not give me useful information in the next three seconds, I will kill you,\" the Fox said calmly.\n\n\"No you won't,\" Orochimaru said, straightening his tunic without bothering to look at the bijuu. \"If you do, you'll never get your freedom and you'll be sent to Hell when that body dies.\"\n\n\"I can make this body live a long time,\" the Fox snarled.\n\nSatisfied with his appearance, Orochimaru finally looked up. \"Yes, I'm sure you can. How long, though? A hundred years? Two hundred? That's a long time for me, but hardly an eyeblink for you. Stop insulting my intelligence.\"\n\nThe Fox's eyes were glowing red. \"You would do very well to show a little more respect,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"And you would do very well to show a little more intelligence,\" Orochimaru said. \"Now, are you going to continue acting offended and attempting to cow me, or can we actually negotiate like rational people?\"\n\nThe Fox's lava-red eyes blinked back to Naruto's sky blue ones; the killing intent and angry body language vanished.\n\n\"How did you know?\" he asked. \"That works very well on most humans.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, most humans are too stupid to realize that being a ninja is the only career worth pursuing, regardless of how much effort it costs,\" Orochimaru said scathingly. \"And most ninja are too stupid to realize that handseals and calling your attacks is idiotic.\"\n\nThe Fox snorted. \"True. Although, to be fair, most civilians lack the chakra reserves to be ninja, no matter how much they want it.\"\n\nOrochimaru looked at him in disgust. \"You should know who Rock Lee is; Naruto trained alongside him for three years. Lee has zero ability to use chakra, yet he graduated from the most prestigious ninja academy in the world, merely by working hard. Don't tell me that a civilian couldn't become a ninja. Plus, constantly working chakra reserves to exhaustion will allow even a civilian to reach minimal ninja levels after a couple of decades.\"\n\nThe Fox nodded, granting the point. \"Fair,\" he said. \"Now, what's this about Jiraiya and my seal?\"\n\n\"Don't you think you should let the others up?\" Orochimaru asked, gesturing to where the non-Naruto members of Team Anko lay buried under Fox clones.\n\n\"Hm,\" the Fox said, looking from the piles back to Orochimaru. \"I told Naruto I would keep the team safe. Right now my bodies are protecting them. Were I to let them up, you could harm them.\"\n\nOrochimaru sighed in disgust. \"Stop,\" he said. \"I despise word games. If you're going to keep them prisoner, fine; it's little bother to me, although I would be mildly interested in negotiating for their freedom. If you actually want to protect them and maintain good relations with me, let them up. I have every motive to keep them safe—I want them to join me, and killing them would carry a reputational cost with you while not providing commensurate progress towards my other goals.\"\n\n\"Loyalty through enlightened self-interest, hm?\" the Fox said. \"How bijuu of you. Also, congratulations—you slid that into the conversation very smoothly. It would have been so much more clumsy had you explicitly threatened me with betrayal the moment I was no longer useful to you.\"\n\n\"I had rather assumed that was understood,\" Orochimaru said. \"It is what I expect from you in turn, after all. For example, I note that you're not in a hurry to give Naruto his body back.\"\n\n\"I need to ensure that the team is safe,\" the Fox said. \"I'll give the body back as soon as I'm sure that's the case.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Orochimaru said. \"And what exactly is required for you to feel that the team is safe? You just killed ten percent of the Sound ANBU force. The remainder will be displeased, although they're unlikely to challenge you against my orders. Do they constitute a threat? Or perhaps you'll leave and take the team back to Konoha—at which point Hinata's father will go back to having her beaten.\"\n\n\"Not after I tear his arms off and hang his body up by the intestines,\" the Fox said. \"And then work my way down through the family until the survivors get the message.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm sure that will make Hinata so very happy,\" Orochimaru said. \"I see that your definition of 'safe' covers only physical safety. Now, are you going to let them up or not?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" the Fox said, waving his clones off the team.\n\nThe genin and their sensei straightened up, brushing themselves off and—at least on Anko's part—glaring daggers at the Fox.\n\n\"Fox-sama, with the greatest respect, I would humbly ask that you please not harm my family,\" Hinata said, bowing deeply. \"As Orochimaru-sama said, I would be very upset by that.\"\n\nThe Fox looked disgusted. \"They. Are. Beating. You,\" he said slowly. He shook his head. \"A thousand years and I am often still baffled at how you humans react to things.\"\n\n\"Part of it is that she grew up in the environment and therefore regards it as normal,\" Orochimaru said. \"Embarrassment might also be a factor—it would cost face to admit that one's family was abberant. Then there's low self-esteem, which she clearly has; she has probably justified it to herself by thinking that she deserves it. As I recall, Hiashi was a stone-cold bastard, but he was very smart, and very good at manipulation; he's undoubtedly told her that he loves her and the beatings are to help her improve. And of course, there's peer pressure—she may feel that no one would believe her and—\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Anko yelled. \"Stop talking about her like she's not here!\" She pulled a shuddering, tearful Hinata into a hug and glared at her former sensei.\n\nOrochimaru turned to Hinata and bowed respectfully. \"Of course. My apologies, young lady.\"\n\n\"If I may ask, Fox-sama, do you intend to return Naruto-kun to us?\" Shino asked carefully.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Fox said. \"Just as soon as I'm confident that you three are safe, I'll switch places with him again.\"\n\n\"And when might that be?\" Anko asked acerbically. \"When Hell freezes over?\"\n\n\"Not that long,\" the Fox said. \"Just as soon as I'm sure that no one is planning to kill, maim, or kidnap you. Oh, and we have a solution to Hinata's problem, of course.\" He turned back to her. \"Are you sure you won't just let me exterminate your clan?\" he asked hopefully. \"It would be no trouble, really.\"\n\n\"I would be very grateful if you would please not harm them, Fox-sama,\" Hinata said, bowing deeply.\n\nThe Fox sighed. \"Maybe just your father?\" he wheedled. \"Just a little harm. Wouldn't need to kill him, just a bit of maiming? Or maybe not even maiming, just permanent crippling? I mean, he doesn't really need the use of his legs, right?\"\n\nHinata's voice had lost its Hyuuga calm and bobbled back and forth between hysterical laughter and horror as she said, \"No, Fox-sama. Although I thank you for your concern.\"\n\nThe Fox gave a put-upon sigh. \"Very well,\" he said in disgust. \"Can I at least scare him, or is even that too much?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Fox-sama, but that would be—\" Hinata paused, thinking. \"Maybe just a little?\"\n\nThe Fox's newly-inhuman mouth broke into a wide, needle-fanged grin. \"Excellent! Excellent, yes, that should solve everything. All right, I think we can scratch that one off the list. Now, we just need to make sure none of you three are in imminent danger of death and then we're fine and I can give Naruto his body back.\"\n\nOrochimaru cleared his throat. \"I doubt they are in imminent danger at this moment,\" he said acerbically. \"However, I would prefer you not hand the body back just yet, as I have a proposal that I think would benefit all of us, including Naruto.\"\n\nThe Fox turned to him. \"Oh?\" he asked, one blond eyebrow raised. \"Do tell.\"\n\n\"Not here,\" Orochimaru said. \"I want some dinner and some tea first. And I'll need to have the bodies of my people buried.\"\n\n\"Doton: Swamp of the Underworld,\" the Fox said, casually slapping a hand to the ground. Patches of earth throughout the field turned to swamp, sucking down the bodies—and decapitated heads—of the former ANBU. When the Fox lifted his hand the ground immediately reverted to its former state, leaving the field completely undisturbed.\n\n\"Shall we get that tea?\" the Fox asked.",
  "latent_425": "It should come as no surprise to college basketball fans that freshmen have come to possess a significant portion of the star power in the sport. Just look at this year’s NBA draft, where the first upperclassman was not selected until Duke sophomore Luke Kennard with 12th pick. So while some returning players will undoubtedly have a major impact in 2017–18 season, it’s important to get to know the new faces who may come to occupy the spotlight.\n\nWith that in mind, SI.com will be introducing you to the top 25 incoming freshmen in college basketball and breaking down the impact those players could have this season. We move to the No. 11 overall recruit, Oregon’s Troy Brown Jr.\n\nWHAT HE MEANS FOR OREGON’S RECRUITING CLASS\n\nBrown Jr. is the centerpiece of Oregon’s incoming class; in fact, he’d be the centerpiece of the Ducks’ last few recruiting classes. In recent years, they’ve had more success recruiting transfer players than high schoolers, so nabbing Brown Jr., the third-best small forward in his class, is a good get for coach Dana Altman. His 6’7”, 210 pound-frame means he’ll usually line up at small forward, but he has the handle and vision to serve as a guard if need be. Couple his arrival with forward Paul White’s (from Georgetown), and that’s two instant-impact starters headed to Eugene.\n\nBrian Rothmuller, AP\n\nHOW HE FITS\n\nAs far as versatility is concerned, Brown Jr. is one of the most balanced players in his class. The Las Vegas native can truly do a little bit of everything: slash to the rim, shoot from deep, kick out on drives and even facilitate an offense. He’s still more comfortable tunneling toward the hoop than pulling up from behind the arc, but his jumper could eventually evolve into his weapon of choice.\n\nTEAM OUTLOOK\n\nThe Ducks lost all five of their leading scorers from last year’s Final Four team (not to mention Casey Benson and Kavell Bigby-Williams transferring out of the program), so how well the team rebounds largely hinges on the immediate impact from this recruiting class. Sure, Payton Pritchard is back at the point, but beyond him, there aren’t a lot of familiar faces. That’s where Brown Jr. comes in—it’ll be up to him to carry the scoring burden while simultaneously getting his new teammates, namely White and redshirt freshman M.J. Cage, involved on both ends. It’s not an easy rebuilding task by any means, but few freshman are as well-equipped to balance a roster as Brown Jr. is.",

Tramo Jantetelco-El Higuerón\n\nEl plan oficial indica que la Siglo XXI conectará al golfo de México con el océano Pacífico, al interconectar a la autopista Atlixco-Jantetelco con la autopista del Sol, que va a Guerrero, hacia el puerto de Acapulco.\n\nAldesa, con oficinas centrales en España, construye la vialidad desde marzo de 2014 junto con las empresas mexicanas Pinfra y GBM. En este proyecto, al igual que en el Paso Exprés, la compañía también incumplió con la fecha de entrega de la obra porque, de acuerdo con el anuncio oficial del secretario de Comunicaciones y Transportes, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, en marzo de 2014 la autopista sería terminada en dos años, es decir, en marzo de 2016, y posteriormente se haría una concesión a 30 años. Pero Alejandro Fernández, presidente de Aldesa, precisó a la prensa que el plazo correrá a partir de obtener todos los derechos de vía, lo cual previó para mayo de ese año, porque hasta ese momento sólo se habían conseguido en 23 de los 61.8 kilómetros de la obra.\n\nEn diciembre de 2016, el director de la concesionaria, Mario Sugawara, declaró a la prensa que la autopista estaría terminada a mediados de 2017, y el plazo ya venció. En marzo, el entonces secretario de Movilidad y Transporte, Jorge Messeguer, recorrió la zona y afirmó que “entre julio y agosto quedará lista la autopista Siglo XXI, al registrar un avance de 75%”, lo cual tampoco sucedió.\n\nPero la fama de Aldesa en el sur de Morelos es también la de un demoledor de zonas arqueológicas, luego de que en junio de 2015 los trabajos de la autopista se detuvieron por unos días por el descubrimiento de vestigios arqueológicos en Tlaltizapan. A la maquinaria pesada de esa compañía le bastaron 20 minutos para arrasar una superficie superior a 800 metros cuadrados del sitio prehispánico, luego que el INAH determinó que los vestigios no eran parte del patrimonio de la nación.\n\nEl corporativo. Las empresas Aldesem, de Grupo Aldesa, y Epccor, encargadas de la construcción del Paso Exprés de Cuernavaca tienen una historia de anomalías y experiencia “limitada”, en la edificación de carreteras.\n\nEn el caso de Epccor, propiedad de la familia Gutiérrez Cortina, obtuvo 12 contratos de 2012 a 2017, aunque su experiencia en carreteras es limitada.\n\nEntre 2013 y 2017, Epccor ha obtenido contratos por un monto de mil 334 millones 976 mil 556 pesos, sin tomar en cuenta el contrato de la vía, en Morelos. El pasado 14 de julio, EL UNIVERSAL informó que “la Auditoría Superior de la Federación (ASF) detectó irregularidades en la construcción de la autopista por más de 270 millones de pesos”, de acuerdo con la revisión de la Cuenta Pública de 2015.\n\nEpccor es propiedad de los hijos de Juan Diego Gutiérrez Cortina, dueño de Gutsa Infraestructura, compañía inhabilitada en 2007 después de que la SFP determinó que actuó de manera negligente en las obras de reparación de la autopista del Sol, que hubo un retraso de más de mil días en los trabajos y recibió pagos indebidos.\n\nSe conoce que la familia Gutiérrez Cortina abrió esta empresa para evadir la sanción de Gutsa y seguir obteniendo contratos del gobierno federal para obras importantes.\n\nEn el caso de la empresa Aldesem, forma parte de Grupo Aldesa, una de las 10 constructoras más grandes de España, que llegó a México en 2008.\n\nHa participado en obras de carreteras como: autopista Durango-Mazatlán, la cual presenta desperfectos en puentes y túneles, la carretera Chalco-Cuautla, los túneles de la autopista Durango-Mazatlán, los de la autopista Toluca-Naucalpan.\n\nAmago del gobernador. En julio pasado el gobernador Graco Ramírez afirmó que no permitirá la inauguración de la autopista si Aldesa incumple con las obras comprometidas con los campesinos propietarios de las tierras por donde pasa la vía.\n\nA los ejidatarios de la zona dijo que remitió un oficio a la empresa Concesionaria de Autopista de Morelos, S.A. de C.V., compuesta por Pinfra, GBM y Aldesa, para pedirle cumplimiento de las obras.\n\nEl gobernador Graco Ramírez adelantó que se realizará una reunión con la concesionaria para liquidar todas las obras pendientes y convocó a todos los Comisariados Ejidales y presidentes de Bienes Comunales a participar en este encuentro.\n\nGraco y Ruiz son requeridos. La Tercera Comisión de la Comisión Permanente del Congreso de la Unión avaló por unanimidad y con el acuerdo de todos los partidos políticos sostener una reunión de trabajo con el titular de la SCT, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, así como con el gobernador de Morelos, Graco Ramírez, para hablar sobre el Paso Exprés de Cuernavaca.\n\nDe tal manera que los funcionarios acudirán al órgano legislativo dentro de 15 días naturales, independientemente, del informe que entregará la dependencia federal el próximos viernes 11 de agosto, señaló el senador Ernesto Cordero.

I’m not looking to get swept off my feet. I am one of those rare, perhaps slightly jaded individuals who actually likes hookup culture and is happy to live in an age in which monogamy is not necessarily the norm.\n\nBut I believe in big love because I’ve had it.\n\nI’ve had that massive love. That all-consuming love. That ‘I can’t believe this exists in the physical realm of this planet’ kind of love.\n\nThe kind of love that erupts into an uncontrollable blaze an then simmers down to embers and burns quietly, comfortably, for years. The kind of love they write novels and symphonies about. The kind of love that teaches more than you thought you could ever learn, and gives back infinitely more than it takes.\n\nIt is the ‘Love of your life’ kind of love.\n\nAnd believe it works like this:\n\nIf you’re lucky, you get to meet the love of your life. You get to be with them, to learn from them, to give the whole of yourself over to them and allow their influence to change you in unfathomable measures. It’s an experience like nothing else we have on this earth.\n\nBut here is what the fairytales won’t tell you – sometimes we meet the loves of our lives, but we do not get to keep them.\n\nWe do not get to marry them, to pass our years alongside them, to hold their hands on their deathbeds after a life lived well and together.\n\nWe do not always get to hold onto the loves of our lives, because in the real world, love doesn’t conquer all. It doesn’t resolve irreparable differences, it doesn’t triumph over illness and disease, it doesn’t bridge religious rifts or save us from ourselves when we’re corrupting.\n\nWe don’t always get to hold onto the loves of our lives because sometimes love is not all that there is. Sometimes you want a tiny country home with three kids and they want a bustling career in the city. Sometimes you have a whole, wide world to go explore and they are scared to venture out of their backyard. Sometimes you have bigger dreams than one another.\n\nSometimes the biggest, most loving move you can possibly make is to let each other go.\n\nOther times you don’t get a choice.\n\nBut here’s another thing they won’t tell you about finding the love of your life: not ending up with them doesn’t disqualify their significance.\n\nSome people can love you more in a year than others could love you in fifty. Some people can teach you more within a single day than others could teach you over the entire course of a lifetime.\n\nSome people come into our lives only for a particular period of time, but make an impact that no one else can ever quite match or replace.\n\nAnd who are we to call those people anything but the loves of our lives?\n\nWho are we to downplay their significance, to rewrite their memories, to alter the ways in which they changed us for the better, simply because our paths diverged? Who are we to decide that we desperately need to replace them – to find a bigger, better, stronger, more passionate love that we can hold onto for a lifetime?\n\nMaybe we just ought to be grateful that we got to meet these people at all.\n\nThat we got to love them. That we got to learn from them. That we got to have our lives expand and flourish as a result of having known them.\n\nMeeting and letting go of the love of your life doesn’t have to be your life's single greatest tragedy.\n\nIf you let it, it can be your greatest blessing.\n\nAfter all, some people never get to meet them at all.\n\nGet your copy of Heidi Priebe’s debut poetry collection, The First New Universe, here.",

  "latent_633": "A month before the Yale Halloween meltdown, I had a bizarre and illuminating experience at an elite private high school on the West Coast. I’ll call it Centerville High. I gave a version of a talk that you can see here, on Coddle U. vs. Strengthen U. (In an amazing coincidence, I first gave that talk at Yale a few weeks earlier). The entire student body — around 450 students, from grades 9-12 — were in the auditorium. There was plenty of laughter at all the right spots, and a lot of applause at the end, so I thought the talk was well received.\n\nBut then the discussion began, and it was the most unremittingly hostile questioning I’ve ever had. I don’t mind when people ask hard or critical questions, but I was surprised that I had misread the audience so thoroughly. My talk had little to do with gender, but the second question was “So you think rape is OK?” Like most of the questions, it was backed up by a sea of finger snaps — the sort you can hear in the infamous Yale video, where a student screams at Prof. Christakis to “be quiet” and tells him that he is “disgusting.” I had never heard the snapping before. When it happens in a large auditorium it is disconcerting. It makes you feel that you are facing an angry and unified mob — a feeling I have never had in 25 years of teaching and public speaking.\n\nAfter the first dozen questions I noticed that not a single questioner was male. I began to search the sea of hands asking to be called on and I did find one boy, who asked a question that indicated that he too was critical of my talk. But other than him, the 200 or so boys in the audience sat silently.\n\nAfter the Q&A, I got a half-standing ovation: almost all of the boys in the room stood up to cheer. And after the crowd broke up, a line of boys came up to me to thank me and shake my hand. Not a single girl came up to me afterward.\n\nAfter my main lecture, the next session involved 60 students who had signed up for further discussion with me. We moved to a large classroom. The last thing I wanted to do was to continue the same fruitless arguing for another 75 minutes, so I decided to take control of the session and reframe the discussion. Here is what happened next:\n\nMe: What kind of intellectual climate do you want here at Centerville? Would you rather have option A: a school where people with views you find offensive keep their mouths shut, or B: a school where everyone feels that they can speak up in class discussions? Audience: All hands go up for B. Me: OK, let’s see if you have that. When there is a class discussion about gender issues, do you feel free to speak up and say what you are thinking? Or do you feel that you are walking on eggshells and you must heavily censor yourself? Just the girls in the class, raise your hand if you feel you can speak up? [about 70% said they feel free, vs about 10% who said eggshells ]. Now just the boys? [about 80% said eggshells, nobody said they feel free]. Me: Now let’s try it for race. When a topic related to race comes up in class, do you feel free to speak up and say what you are thinking, or do you feel that you are walking on eggshells and you must heavily censor yourself? Just the non-white students? [the group was around 30% non-white, mostly South and East Asians, and some African Americans. A majority said they felt free to speak, although a large minority said eggshells] Now just the white students? [A large majority said eggshells] Me: Now lets try it for politics. How many of you would say you are on the right politically, or that you are conservative or Republican? [6 hands went up, out of 60 students]. Just you folks, when politically charged topics come up, can you speak freely? [Only one hand went up, but that student clarified that everyone gets mad at him when he speaks up, but he does it anyway. The other 5 said eggshells.] How many of you are on the left, liberal, or democrat? [Most hands go up] Can you speak freely, or is it eggshells? [Almost all said they can speak freely.] Me: So let me get this straight. You were unanimous in saying that you want your school to be a place where people feel free to speak up, even if you strongly dislike their views. But you don’t have such a school. In fact, you have exactly the sort of “tolerance” that Herbert Marcuse advocated [which I had discussed in my lecture, and which you can read about here]. You have a school in which only people in the preferred groups get to speak, and everyone else is afraid. What are you going to do about this? Let’s talk.\n\nAfter that, the conversation was extremely civil and constructive. The boys took part just as much as the girls. We talked about what Centerville could do to improve its climate, and I said that the most important single step would be to make viewpoint diversity a priority. On the entire faculty, there was not a single teacher that was known to be conservative or Republican. So if these teenagers are coming into political consciousness inside of a “moral matrix” that is uniformly leftist, there will always be anger directed at those who disrupt that consensus.\n\nThat night, after I gave a different talk to an adult audience, there was a reception at which I spoke with some of the parents. Several came up to me to tell me that their sons had told them about the day’s events. The boys finally had a way to express and explain their feelings of discouragement. Their parents were angry to learn about how their sons were being treated and… there’s no other word for it, bullied into submission by the girls.*\n\nAnd Centerville High is not alone. Last summer I had a conversation with some boys who attend one of the nation’s top prep schools, in New England. They reported the same thing: as white males, they are constantly on eggshells, afraid to speak up on any remotely controversial topic lest they be sent to the “equality police” (that was their term for the multicultural center). I probed to see if their fear extended beyond the classroom. I asked them what they would do if there was a new student at their school, from, say Yemen. Would they feel free to ask the student questions about his or her country? No, they said, it’s too risky, a question could be perceived as offensive.\n\nYou might think that this is some sort of justice — white males have enjoyed positions of privilege for centuries, and now they are getting a taste of their own medicine. But these are children. And remember that most students who are in a victim group for one topic are in the “oppressor” group for another. So everyone is on eggshells sometimes; all students at Centerville High learn to engage with books, ideas, and people using the twin habits of defensive self-censorship and vindictive protectiveness.\n\nAnd then… they go off to college and learn new ways to gain status by expressing collective anger at those who disagree. They curse professors and spit on visiting speakers at Yale. They shut down newspapers at Wesleyan. They torment a dean who was trying to help them at Claremont McKenna. They threaten and torment fellow students at Dartmouth. And in all cases, they demand that adults in power DO SOMETHING to punish those whose words and views offend them. Their high schools have thoroughly socialized them into what sociologists call victimhood culture, which weakens students by turning them into “moral dependents” who cannot deal with problems on their own. They must get adult authorities to validate their victim status.\n\nSo they issue ultimatums to college presidents, and, as we saw at Yale, the college presidents meet their deadlines, give them much of what they demanded, commit their schools to an ever tighter embrace of victimhood culture, and say nothing to criticize the bullying, threats, and intimidation tactics that have created a culture of intense fear for anyone who might even consider questioning the prevailing moral matrix. What do you suppose a conversation about race or gender will look like in any Yale classroom ten years from now? Who will dare to challenge the orthodox narrative imposed by victimhood culture? The “Next Yale” that activists are demanding will make today’s Centerville High look like Plato’s Academy by comparison.\n\nThe only hope for Centerville High — and for Yale — is to disrupt their repressively uniform moral matrices to make room for dissenting views. High schools and colleges that lack viewpoint diversity should make it their top priority. Race and gender diversity matter too, but if those goals are pursued in the ways that student activists are currently demanding, then political orthodoxy is likely to intensify. Schools that value freedom of thought should therefore actively seek out non-leftist faculty, and they should explicitly include viewpoint diversity and political diversity in all statements about diversity and discrimination.** Parents and students who value freedom of thought should take viewpoint diversity into account when applying to colleges. Alumni should take it into account before writing any more checks.\n\nThe Yale problem refers to an unfortunate feedback loop: Once you allow victimhood culture to spread on your campus, you can expect ever more anger from students representing victim groups, coupled with demands for a deeper institutional commitment to victimhood culture, which leads inexorably to more anger, more demands, and more commitment. But the Yale problem didn’t start at Yale. It started in high school. As long as many of our elite prep schools are turning out students who have only known eggshells and anger, whose social cognition is limited to a single dimension of victims and victimizers, and who demand safe spaces and trigger warnings, it’s hard to imagine how any university can open students’ minds and prepare them to converse respectfully with people who don’t share their values. Especially when there are no adults around who don’t share their values.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPost Scripts:\n\n*My original draft of this post included the phrase “with the blessing of the teachers” at this point. But this was unfair and I regret it. The Centerville teachers I met were all very friendly to me, even after my talk. I think they could do more to counter the intimidation felt by students with minority viewpoints, but I have no reason to think that the teachers at Centerville are anything other than caring professionals who try to curate class discussions without inserting their own views. Indeed, the comments from “Centerville” students below, in the comment threads, indicate that the intimidation comes primarily from other students, not from the teachers. This is a pattern I have seen at universities as well.\n\n**To help high schools and colleges measure the scale of their problem, we at Heterodox Academy will develop an “Eggshellometer” – a simple anonymous survey that can be distributed to all students, or to all faculty for that matter – that can be used to quantify the degree to which members of an academic community live in fear. In the meantime, if you are a teacher, you can use the simple “show of hands” method that I described above, or you can easily turn it into an anonymous paper and pencil survey.\n\n*** To read a new post extracting the 13 comments below from “Centerville High” students, with commentary, click here.\n\nThere is no video of my talk at Centerville, but here is a video of an earlier version of the talk that I gave a few weeks earlier, at Yale (coincidentally).

Let's go through, point by point.\n\nIt's December 11 and I haven't heard anything from my SS. I'm not worried because 1) I'm already satisfied with the whole RedditSS process after seeing the enthusiastic reaction my giftee posted, and 2) there's still time! Before okay.jpg even becomes an option, I get an orangered like so much Jordan at the buzzer: \"Sorry man! I didn't forget about you, it's just finals.\" SS showing his colors as a NICE person, no? And a commitment to academics over Reddit is goddamned commendable on its own. A similar orangered popped up on December 20 to update on gift-shipping progress. DOUBLE-NICE.\n\nFast-forward to Christmas Eve. The words \"Your Secret Santa 2011 gift has shipped!\" are a glorious sight. My SS is a man of insane timing who gives a jolt to the Christmas hellastokedometer even before I receive anything. But hold the phone-- no tracking info. Does my SS have a penchant for being super-surprisey, or is this gift so wild that not even its master can tame it? Maybe a gift to be shipped directly from an online proprietor of goods? I would have to wait and see.\n\nUntil today. I'm at my office, tip-tap-typing away and yakking on the phone when I received two packages from Amazon. \"c/o megagnome5000\" in the address confirms this is what I've been waiting for. Hell yeah separate packages arriving on the same day! What did I say about timing again? And having the packages sent directly to me to save on shipping costs sounds pretty damn SAVVY.\n\nI hold off on opening the padded envelope and the what-could-it-be?-sized box until I get back to my apartment. I feel a mix of excitement and fear as I unbox the gifts.\n\nThe first gift is a DVD of a film titled Rubber. An expose on the gritty underbelly of the latex prophylactic industry? No, much better. The DVD cover art of a lone car tire flanked by a crow and a police car immediately indicates that my SS has mined into my love of bad movies and struck gold. The brief synopsis on the case confirms my suspicions. Excerpted: \"Rubber is the story of Robert, an inanimate tire that has been abandoned in the desert and then suddenly and inexplicably comes to life... terrifying telepathic powers... destroy anything he wishes... prey... humans... swath of destruction.\" HELL FUCKING YES. I'm delighted that I have not yet seen this movie, and I'm eager to get this certainly horrible horror film in my brain.\n\nSurely, I thought, no mortal Redditor could follow up such a spot-on gift with something even better? I was a fool to entertain such a thought! The box contained a relatively small book, 'Chant and Be Happy: The Power of Mantra Meditation' featuring conversations with John Lennon and George Harrison. My adoration of The Beatles, which I mentioned in my list of \"likes,\" must have been aided by some fine stalking/gumshoe work/telepathy. What I didn't tell my SS is that George is my favorite Beatle, and I've wanted to learn more about the spiritual underpinnings of his music. I even splurged on a set of George Harrison/Ravi Shankar sitar and chant CDs a few months back. More generally, I've tried to read more Eastern religious/spiritual texts. Get out of my head!\n\nIn short, from the wrath of a killer tire to inner peace with a sprinkling of Beatles, both of my gifts were thoroughly AWESOME.\n\nAlso, my SS divulged his name on a note attached to Chant and Be Happy, so I'm confident that my SS is a DUDE and not a lady.\n\nSecret Santa, you are indeed a NICE, SAVVY, AWESOME DUDE. Thank you so much for bringing a lot of joy to my day!",

German automaker Audi hopes to be one of the first automakers to achieve the feat, and is banking on U.S. graphics chipmaker Nvidia's artificial intelligence car computing platform, which uses deep learning to negotiate complex real-road conditions.To offer a taste of the results of their collaboration, Audi has been demoing its Q7 Piloted Driving Concept, which is fitted with Nvidia's Drive PX 2 processor. The companies claim that after four days of \"training\", equipped vehicles are able to drive themselves over a complex road course, thanks to the PX 2 chip's ability to learn on the fly without recourse to pre-mapped routes.Audi and Nvidia have been working together for almost a decade, but the announcement at this year's CES is an indication of just how far the collaboration has come. Originally the partnership was limited to using Nvidia's graphics processors in Audi's virtual cockpit and navigation systems, but ambitions have since grown, and Audi said it will begin expanding its testing of the highly automated, artificial intelligence-equipped vehicles on public roads in California and select states in 2018.For Nvidia's part, the traditionally GPU-focused company has been working on autonomous vehicle systems for several years now and has rolled out development platforms and agreed partnerships with over 80 automakers and suppliers to realize its self-driving goals. In September the company introduced Xavier, a complete AI system on a chip for self-driving cars that's designed to meet international functional safety standards for in-car electronics.Apple is thought to have refocused its car project recently. The company has shelved plans to build an electric car for now, and is instead working to build a self-driving software platform for use in vehicles made by established automakers.

I don't even know what it would have been like out there,\" the forward told the BBC. \"There's going to be a bunch of yellow shirts out there with my name on it.\"\n\nKamara has come a long way since fleeing the battle fields of Sierra Leone's civil war and migrating to the United States as a refugee.\n\nHe came through the NCAA system and earned a draft to MLS side Columbus Crew in 2006, before moving on to San Jose, Houston and then Kansas. Kamara has 14 international caps.\n\nHis Norwich signing was confirmed before January's transfer deadline, but his international clearance did not come through until last week.\n\n\"After the move became official, for Norwich's last game against QPR everybody was in the cinemas thinking I was playing,\" he told the BBC after playing the last five minutes against the Cottagers.\n\n\"It's a good thing my phone doesn't work right now because if it did I would be having so many phone calls.\n\n\"I represent my country wherever I go but being here now -- it's the talk of the town. \"If I do well people might recognize where I'm from, maybe they will Google Sierra Leone a little bit more.\n\n\"When I go to the national team, everybody always asks, 'when are you going to England?' because it's basically the only game that's screened all around the world.\"\n\nKamara, who had an unsuccessful trial at Stoke in December, admits his path to the English top flight has been far from straightforward, but is an opportunity he will aim to seize.\n\n\"I left Sierra Leone after the civil war ended, when I was 14. I lived in Gambia for two years and at 16 I moved to the USA through a refugee programme, so I could go to school,\" he said.\n\n\"I figured out to get scholarships at college I would have to play soccer, so I did that for two years. Then I got drafted to the MLS and have been in the league for seven years and now I am here.\"\n\nKamara is already a cult figure among Norwich fans, having made a big impression with his positive interviews and through social media.\n\n\"I am just honoured to be here. It gave me goosebumps just warming up on the side and hearing my name being called. I loved it and I am looking forward to playing more games here,\" he said.\n\nNorwich manager Chris Hughton said Kamara needs more match fitness, having only trained with his new teammates for a few days after his midweek arrival from the United States.\n\n\"I don't think it is far off. By the next game I should definitely be in shape,\" said Kamara, who has headed off with the rest of the Norwich squad for some warm-weather training in Abu Dhabi as they have no match for a fortnight.\n\n\"It is about working hard from now and making it a regular thing,\" he said. \"I am a man who can score some goals, but it is also about work-rate -- when you come into a team like this and see people working so hard, if you can work as hard as them then the goals come easily.\"\n\nNorwich has the option to buy Kamara should his short-term move from Sporting Kansas City prove a success.\n\nThe striker said: \"I belong to Kansas City, but I am not here to mess around and just hang about.\n\n\"I am coming here to make a statement about myself and show I can play amongst people I have watched on television.\"\n\nInformation from Press Association was used in this report.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nWhen I started Super Meat Boy, I knew that proper controls would be the make or break for the game. I’m very picky about controls in games, to the point if the game doesn’t control well, I don’t care who makes it or what it is, I will stop playing it. I often get asked which formulas I used for movement, friction, air physics, etc. in Super Meat Boy. Truth is, there are no formulas…it’s just a big huge hack. I spent two months on the controls for SMB to get them perfect. Everything from the weird “friction” that happens when you change directions in the air to the 200MS delay that happens when you’re on a wall and pull away is based on how it feels to me when I play it. None of these formulas are based on physics concepts, they are 100% based on feel.\n\nWhen it comes to hardware I’m, again, very picky. We have a Razer controller that Shannon bought a while back that has strange buttons that click weird. I refuse to play with it. I hated playing the PS3 when it first came out because the SixAxis had no DualShock in them and were too light. I didn’t fully play any PS3 games until I bought a DualShock3 SixAxis controller. I didn’t even bother with the Ouya controller because if other people are reporting latency problems, I know for a fact I will experience them.\n\nI need to press a button, feel good pressing it, and have it react accordingly on the screen. So, ladies and gentlemen… if I say I’m sensitive to controllers you will agree.\n\nThe Steam Controller (or whatever it’s officially called) is strange. Where your thumbs normally rest when holding a controller, there are just the two little circular track pads just like what you see in the pictures. In the center you have your A,B,X,Y buttons surrounding what I was told would be a touch screen display at some point. The touchpad / screen in the center of the controller wasn’t enabled so I can’t really speak on that. The A,B,X,Y buttons surrounding the touch screen seemed to be used more for your standard “Back” button configuration. Think of them not as A,B,X,Y but additional buttons that can perform some functionality. You obviously wouldn’t play a game with those buttons being your primary action buttons. You use the left and right circle pads as your primary inputs.\n\nOn top of the controller you have your standard Left/Right Bumpers and Left/Right Triggers, they work and feel as you would expect. On the back of the controller are two additional triggers that you can hit with your fingers naturally by just squeezing your hand but aren’t so sensitive that the act of holding the controller depresses the buttons.\n\nThe controller I held was a 3D printed functional prototype. It is thicker than an Xbox 360 controller at the base where the sides of the controller rest in your palms. The weight is about the same. I didn’t feel as if the controller was too heavy or too light. I did notice the bulk of the controller, but only as a differentiation from the PS3 controller I’ve been playing with recently (GTA5) and the 360 controller I use for PC gaming. The bulk didn’t bother me.\n\nAfter becoming familiar with the controller I started to play Meat Boy. I played from muscle memory so the more advanced tactics were being used (wall slide, jump height curving, etc). At first I noticed significant lag, and thought to myself “Oh shit, I’m going to have to tell them that their controller is laggy and bad”. They told me the latency was very low so I figured it had to be the TV because without a low latency “Game Mode” most reflex driven games are totally unplayable. Sure enough, I got into the settings of the TV, turned on Game Mode, and the real play session began.\n\nThe configuration they had set up was simple enough. The left circle pad acted as the directional buttons, the right acted as a big giant jump button. The big problem with touch pads/ touch screens is you never know when you are actually over a button or pressing it. Valve has tried to rectify this by having some adjustable haptic feedback fire when you press one of the circle pads. Throughout my play session the haptic feedback helped with the problem, but wasn’t enough to solve it.\n\nThe circle pads were configured so that they could be touched to register input. Having input register without a firm, familiar press feels weird and the reason being is that it was set to both touch AND press. You could make Meat Boy move right by pressing on the pad, but he would also move when my thumb rested on the pad. This naturally didn’t happen often, but did happen enough to be noticeable. Once I pointed this out one of the engineers (I’m sorry for not remembering your name, I’m horrible with names…true story I constantly called my ex-girlfriend Jessica instead of Lindsay. Jessica is her sisters name. It was for no other reason than I’m terrible with remembering and saying names…I could describe your face and what you were wearing to a sketch artist and the cops would pick you up in like 2 minutes…that’s where my memory is allocated…) he went back to his desk and updated the firmware to only react on press. Once this happened the controller felt like a controller. Pressing directional buttons made sense and I felt a greater sense of control.\n\nOne drawback to undefined physical buttons is that your thumbs need tactile contact in order to accurately know what button you are pressing. As the engineers and I were talking about this, the idea of little nubs being on the controller that would be noticeable enough where your thumbs would find them, but not so abrasive that the circle pads couldn’t comfortably used in mouse / trackpad mode came about. They had been thought of prior to my being there, but weren’t on the controller I was using. I expressed that they needed to be put in. They might show up in some form after my feedback…so…you’re welcome Valve / Valve customers.\n\nThe button configuration worked fine for SMB, I was able to get to the Salt factory no problem. I was able to sequence break C.H.A.D. by getting the keys before he could do his attacks. I was even able to do the bandaid the super fast way in the second level of the hospital shown here (though I didn’t wait on the platform above the bandaid, I always fall straight through):http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=JHJsnXRb_Es#t=1392\n\nI was able to play Meat Boy the way Meat Boy can be played on an advanced level (and I’m rusty at it). The right circle button was the jump button and we had both Triggers mapped to the Run button just like a regular Xbox 360 controller. We also had the Run button mapped to the back trigger buttons I mentioned before that can be pressed with your fingers on the back of the pad. This worked great but did lead to a bit of hand cramping. I think this is due more to the way you use the run button in Meat Boy and not the design of the controller or the buttons.\n\nBut that’s Meat Boy, I wanted to see how it would do with a game where multiple inputs were required. Naturally, I requested Spelunky. Spelunky requires Whip, Jump, Bomb, and Rope buttons. We configured the controller to play like an Xbox controller. So the left circle pad was once again used for the directional buttons, and the right circle pad was used as A, B, X, Y buttons in the orientation that you find on an Xbox Controller.\n\nI played through Spelunky and the controller worked great. As I was playing I was describing to the engineers the twitch movements that go into Spelunky. Anyone that’s played it knows what I’m talking about, but to explain further there are often times in Spelunky where you will find yourself in a situation where you will panic and need to compensate. For example, lets say you are jumping on a platform, below it are spikes, above you is a bat. If the bat hits you, you’ll die because you’ll fall into the spikes. If you try to jump on the bat, chances are you’ll hit the bat and fall and possibly die. So in situations like this you find yourself tap jumping with air compensation to whip a bat while still staying on this one tile platform. The Steam controller handled this just fine. The nubs I mentioned above would have solidified the platforming experience better, but again, those might get thrown in as they approach final hardware. I got to the Ice Caves and then a stupid Skeleton knocked me off a platform to my death…then I attempted a daily run and died immediately…pretty much the standard Spelunky play through.\n\nIf you were to ask me if I would play games with the Steam Controller…I would say yes. If you were to ask me to choose between Steam Controller and a 360 controller, I would choose 360. Don’t take that as slight to the controller though because it’s more about the comfort of familiarity over functionality. I would choose a 360 controller because I have several thousand hours experience using it, however if tomorrow all game controllers were wiped off the earth and the only option was the Steam Controller, I don’t think this would be a bad thing. In fact, I don’t think gaming would miss a beat. I’m excited to see what final hardware feels like because I think with the upcoming iterations of the controller we’ll see something that is different, but still feels good.\n\nTL;DR; Great Start, needs some improvements, but I could play any game I wanted with it just fine.",

  "latent_1739": "+ T -\n\nПоделиться:\n\nВ последние годы обозначились черты общественно-политического стиля, который заслуживает особого наименования. Я бы назвал его «гоп» — от слова «гопник». Гопники — городская шпана, полууголовные элементы, еще не полностью криминальные, но скользящие по грани. Главный предмет ненависти — культурные, добропорядочные, которых гопники любят напугать и унизить, испытать над ними свою власть. Гопникам важно не столько ограбить (хоть и это дело святое), сколько покуражиться, найти выход агрессии. Это не просто возвышает их в собственных глазах, но и составляет основу их идентичности и душевного комфорта. Для них моральные законы писаны только во втором значении этого слова. Такие ценности, как право, свобода, честность, труд, интеллигентность, вызывают насмешку и презрение; а подлость и предательство, напротив, одобрительный гогот. Их modus operandi — «подставить», «кинуть», «развести», «слить», «хапнуть»...\n\nЕсть две версии происхождения этого слова. Первая: от «гоп» — прыгнуть, подскочить. Уличная шпана нападает внезапно — выпрыгивает из-за угла. По Далю, «гоп» — это скачок или удар и, соответственно, поощрительный возглас при прыжке. «Не говори гоп, пока не перепрыгнешь». Отсюда такие жаргонизмы, как «гоп-стоп», обозначающий уличный грабеж, или «гоп-скок» — заглавие заметки М. Горького об ограблении прохожего московскими беспризорникам.\n\nДругая версия: «гоп» — это аббревиатура. В конце XIX века в помещении современной гостиницы «Октябрьская» на Лиговском проспекте в Петербурге было создано Государственное общество призора (ГОП), куда доставляли беспризорных детей и подростков, занимавшихся мелким грабежом и хулиганством. После революции в этом здании было организовано Государственное общежитие пролетариата — опять же ГОП — для тех же целей, причем число малолетних преступников в этом районе тогда резко подскочило. В общем, между этими двумя версиями нет существенного противоречия.\n\nИ вот этот агрессивно-куражистый стиль поведения недавно стал все заметнее проникать в разные сферы общественной жизни. Теперь к их названиям можно смело присоединять приставку «гоп-», поскольку все они пронизаны гопничеством.\n\nВозьмем дипломатию — область, казалось бы, совсем далекую от гоп-нравов. Но когда российский чрезвычайный и полномочный посланник на заседании Совета Безопасности в ООН (12.4.17) начал оскорблять британского представителя: «Посмотри на меня! Глаза-то не отводи, что ты глаза отводишь?» — стало окончательно ясно, что перед нами новая разновидность этой старой профессии: гоп-дипломатия. По ее ведомству можно отнести и любимую реплику «дебилы, б...» министра иностранных дел (на пресс-конференции с его коллегой из Саудовской Аравии).\n\nВ. К. Сафронков в ООН\n\nГоп-политика. Собственно, вся международная политика начиная с присоединения Крыма — то, что российские стратеги иногда важно именуют геополитикой, — это по сути гоп-политика. Новизна ее лишь в том, что такой откровенный разбой, когда одно государство не просто вторгается на территорию другого, но и присваивает ее часть себе, — действительно, в новинку современному миру (после Второй мировой войны).\n\nНа меня особенно сильное впечатление произвел недавний эпизод политического гоп-скока. Одно из главных лиц государства проявляет отеческую заботу о министре: как бы не простудился дорогой товарищ в осенние холода, «надо курточку какую-то». А потом передает подарочек: «Корзиночку забирай». Под эту курточку и корзиночку с колбаской — сплошь уменьшительно-ласкательные, прямо щедринский Порфирий Головлев, — сверхзначительное лицо ведет тайную аудиозапись на выданной ФСБ аппаратуре, чтобы засадить друга-коллегу в тюрьму. Гопничество на высшем уровне: налетел из-за угла с лаской на лице и финкой в кармане. Я уж не говорю о государственно поощряемом гопничестве против оппонентов режима: ядовитая зеленка, выедающая глаза, и опасная для жизни вонючая отрава.\n\nГоп-журналистика транслируется по всем гоп-каналам. Порою говорят, что это вообще не журналистика, а пропаганда. Ну тогда и послекрымскую политику нужно называть не политикой (искусством управления), а как-то иначе. Мне кажется, что уместнее все-таки оставить за этими видами деятельности их традиционное название, а то, во что они превращаются (вплоть до полной противоположности себе), обозначить приставкой «гоп-». Гоп-журналистика выдает себя за сбор и распространение информации, а между тем вся ее функция — изнасиловать истину и оправдать насилие. И говорит она в минуту откровенности таким же языком, как и гоп-дипломатия. Телеведущий во время дискуссии подбегает к американскому журналисту и хватает его за пиджак: «Ты что думаешь, я только языком могу. Ты что меня провоцируешь? Я тебе сказал сидеть? Сиди!»\n\nГоп-телевидение прекрасно дополняется другими видами гоп-коммуникации посредством новейших технологий. Армии троллей (не говоря уж о хакерах) щедро оплачиваются из госбюджета. Это все та же гоп-стратегия: налететь исподтишка, оплевать, оскорбить — и скрыться. Не регулярная армия под знаменами, не борцы за идею, а мелкая шпана, которая наскакивает оравой, а потом разбегается кто куда.\n\nГоп-экономика под видом хозяйственной деятельности присваивает себе ее объекты. Коррупция во всех эшелонах власти: откаты и взятки, виллы и яхты, искусство «виолончелить», одним словом, «это вам не Димон». По данным Национального бюро экономических исследований США, офшорный капитал россиян в три раза превышает уровень валютных резервов страны. Граждане хранят в офшорах сумму, равную 75% валового национального дохода (ВНД), объем резервов составляет 25%. И конечно, гоп-экономика — это переливание бюджета на военные расходы за счет медицины, образования и науки, уровень которых катастрофически падает. Гопнику кастеты нужнее, чем книги.\n\nОсобая пикантность гоп-экономики в сочетании с гоп-политикой в том, что за санкции, наложенные на правящую верхушку, приходится расплачиваться всему населению страны. На американский «закон Магнитского» (против коррупции) ответили асимметричным «законом Димы Яковлева» (о запрете на усыновление детей иностранцами). Крупнейших олигархов, друзей президента, попавших под западные санкции, освобождают от налогового бремени, более того, возвращают им ранее уплаченные налоги. Гопничество — это всегда асимметричный ответ. Сорвалась сделка или подставили кореши — выместил злость на улице, избил прохожего или затащил в подъезд девушку. Эта манера гопоты наказывать слабых за поражение от сильных называется «бомбить Воронеж».\n\nЕще одно, весьма неожиданное поприще для гопничества — религия, где тоже все заметнее хулиганская, агрессивная, бандитская составляющая. Когда-то, в 1990-е годы, религия получила приставку «поп-», обозначающую ее массовизацию и коммерциализацию. «Поп-религия» — знак предприимчивой популярности, которая рассчитана на восприятие массового общества, в том же смысле, как поп-музыка или поп-арт. Поп-религия — это религия на потребу масс, инструмент магической или психической манипуляции для извлечения практической выгоды. В 1990-е и 2000-е гг. священники постоянно заседают на презентациях товарных бирж, акционерных обществ, политических ассоциаций, литературных журналов и кинофестивалей. Страшновато, если тот самый владыка и пастырь, который готовит твою душу к предстоянию на Страшном Суде, расхаживает по космодромам, стадионам или заправочным станциям и, размахивая кадилом, освящает всё, от мяча до ракеты. В том числе ядерное оружие.\n\nРаньше эти божьи слуги в основном загадочно молчали, не вмешиваясь в происходящее, но придавая ему своим присутствием оттенок высшего значения и благодати. Однако за последние годы поп-религия перешла к более воинственным действиям, превращаясь в гоп-религию. Наиболее заметное ее проявление — деятельность «православных активистов», нападающих на выставки, кинотеатры, угрожающих деятелям культуры — всем, кто дерзает свободу творчества ставить выше партийно-конфессиональных догм и к кому вдохновение приходит от Бога, а не от патриарха или синода. Если в поп-религии преобладала коммерция, то в гоп-религии — агрессия и милитаризм, которая, впрочем, не отказывается и от коммерческих завоеваний и рейдерских захватов государственной собственности. Российская гоп-религия — это попытка превратить православие в религию войны по образцу ислама, а при возможности и сомкнуть с ним ряды. Прежде всего, против «гнилого» западного христианства, которое застряло на ценностях милосердия, любви к ближнему, прощает грехи «радужным», благословляет врагов и охотно принимает иноверных. Ряды гоп-религии пополняются из внецерковных и околоцерковных кругов, но и сама церковь устами своих первосвященников не торопится их осуждать, а молчанием — поощряет. По сути, объединяется с ними в агрессии против светского образования, науки и культуры, в попрании самой конституции, утверждающей отделение государства от церкви.\n\nГоп-религионеры в Петербурге\n\nДело в том, что гопничество ведет двойную игру. В противоположность честному криминалу, оно все время петляет вокруг границы законного/преступного, избегая открыто ее пересекать. В отличие от преступного сообщества, гопники отчасти интегрированы в нормальную жизнь, чему-то учатся, где-то работают. Это преступность от случая к случаю, спорадическая, контекстная, позволяющая опасно приближаться к «мокрым» делам, но при этом выходить сухим из воды. Днем такой гопник сидит в какой-нибудь бойлерной или мастерской, а вечером идет на улицу промышлять и наводить ужас.\n\nНа современном жаргоне это гибридность. Например, при гибридной войне страна-гопник использует скрытые операции, диверсии, кибервзломы, наемников и повстанцев, но при этом старается более или менее правдоподобно отрицать свою вовлеченность в конфликт, аккуратно голосует на всяких ассамблеях, выступает против двойных стандартов и вмешательства в чужие дела — в общем, ведет себя чуть ли не как отличник, чтобы под покровом темноты опять всласть покуражиться, нагнуть, унизить. Гоп-политика, гоп-экономика, гоп-журналистика, гоп-религия тоже по сути гибридны: они соблюдают одни законы профессии, чтобы создавать себе алиби при нарушении других. Эти фасады, фейки, вывески никого не обманывают, но как бы призваны успокоить нервных наблюдателей и потенциальных жертв: нет, мы не разбойники, мы держим себя в рамках и выходим на промысел только по вечерам.\n\nПитерские\n\nВ результате такого размаха гоп-движений вся страна воспринимается как гоп-государство, импотентное в плане созидания, но подпитывающее свою гордыню большими и малыми пакостями в отношении других государств. Нет ни сил, ни ума на то, чтобы внести вклад в науку и культуру, укреплять здоровье народа, строить дороги, прокладывать пути к другим планетам, объединять человечество большими созидательными проектами. Зато остается радость уличной шпаны: бить окна, залезать в чужие дворы, вмешиваться в чужие выборы, подкупать правящую элиту других стран, радуясь любым неудачам демократических и правовых институций и пытаясь извлечь выгоду из всех человеческих слабостей.\n\nКак следствие зрелого самосознания эпохи гопничества, оно готовит памятник себе. Причем там, откуда оно и пошло, где возникли дореволюционный и советский ГОПы. По сообщению РИА Новости, скульптурное изображение гопника предлагается установить в Петербурге. Отсюда и двинулись во российскую власть питерские, превратив гоп в явление всемирного масштаба.\n\nЭто пока еще только проект, памятник «нерукотворный», но уже очевиден кураж самих планировщиков — соотнести его с александрийским столпом. В конце концов, по логике истории оказывается, что сто лет назад сбросили царя, чтобы на его месте поставить гопника.\n\nМожно было бы дальше перечислять многообразные виды современного гопничества. Гоп-спорт — чего стоит одна только история «моченосцев»! Гоп-наука, новейший герой которой — министр культуры, «историк»! Центральный законодательный орган — Гоп-дума. Социально-экономический строй современной России — гоп-капитализм. Правящая идеология — гоп-патриотизм. Да и вообще сокращение «гос» в названиях разных государственных органов вполне можно переделать в «гоп», что обнажит стиль их деятельности: гопаппарат, гопбезопасность, гопконтроль, гопнадзор, гопслужба, гопучреждение, гопчиновник...\n\nВ целом очевидно: на смену хиппи, яппи и другим субкультурам приходят гоппи. Новая молодежная «субкультура»? Нет, она не согласна быть «суб» и претендует на звание «супер»: всевозрастной, всегосударственной, а по возможности и всепланетной.",
  "latent_1808": "Balaji Srinivasan—a man who is reportedly Trump’s top pick to lead the FDA—has deleted all but one of his thousands of tweets. Normally, that might just seem like a smart move but with the Tweet-happy, shame-proof Trump administration it raises alarm bells.\n\nFuck This Tweet Last week I happened upon a very bad tweet and it’s been haunting me ever since, filling me with a… Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSrinivasan’s name hit the short list as a potential Commissioner of Food and Drugs on Thursday when he visited Trump Tower. Sources told Bloomberg that he has “pulled ahead” of another Silicon Valley pick for the position, Jim O’Neill. Aside from their shared history in tech, O’Neill and Srinivasan are also well-known business associates of Trump’s science and technology advisor, Peter Thiel. Neither of the candidates have a significant medical background, breaking with 50 years of history for the agency’s heads.\n\nSrinivasan co-founded the bio-tech firm Counsyl Inc. which specializes in DNA tests and pregnancy screenings to detect Down syndrome and chromosome-related birth defects. The biggest theory that people are floating for the entrepreneurs decision to delete his account is because he hates the FDA and has been vocal about it for years. He hates it in a burn-it-to-the-ground sort of way, not just a let’s-fix-some-problems sort of way.\n\nFor libertarian-minded folks like Theil, O’Neill and Srinivasan, the FDA simply functions as a way to stop companies from innovating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver time, the internet will surely pull more and more tweets from Srinivasan’s past. You can see many of them on the Wayback Machine, which last logged his tweet count at 11,000. Google has also cached many of them and others can be found at this archive.is page.\n\nHere he is in a typical tweet about the FDA:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Exit” is a word that Srinivasan likes to say a lot. His particular brand of libertarian ideals is mostly about leaving the billionaires alone to do what they like and everyone should just become a billionaire. He even wrote an essay arguing that Silicon Valley should “build an opt-in society, ultimately outside the U.S., run by technology.”\n\nHere’s a good one:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh yes, remember the good ol’ days before the FDA? When a guy would show up in town, sell you a bottle of Magic Mumps Mixer and take off, leaving you to figure out if it works or not? Let’s make America great again.\n\nWhat’s a great, forward-thinking way of killing the FDA? Just build an app:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s also the possibility that Srinivasan doesn’t want any ideas about his role in government carrying any potential conflicts of interest. Counsyl Inc. says that he is no longer involved with the company, that particular conflict may be out of the way. But he is also co-founder of the bitcoin startup 21 Inc. which he still runs. That company is funded by the venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz, which generally has its hands in everything. It doesn’t take a major leap of imagination to believe that his network could extend into potential conflicts that arise from his governmental influence. Andreesen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz is already quite pleased with the potential pick:\n\nBut maybe he’ll disclose his financials instead of giving the ethics office a hard time like everyone else on the Trump team. Of course, we can’t know for sure what kind of money he has in bitcoin or how it’s being used.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that Trump’s picks haven’t really given a fuck about conflicts of interest and that many of them vocally want to destroy the agencies they are being assigned to makes Srinivasan’s decision to delete his account even more mysterious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother possible reason is that he’s been critical of Trump and doesn’t want his thin-skinned boss to see the retweets. It’s unclear what he may have said about the Donald in the 11,000 tweets but here’s one that isn’t particularly flattering:\n\nI’m sure that would play well in the current red scare coursing through our intelligence communities and media at the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, he highlighted the fact that Trump has suddenly changed his tune on Wikileaks and possibly Snowden. He also warned that “encryption is always a better bet than hope.” Speaking of encryption, Srinivasan is a big fan but he questioned whether Trump is in a tweet that was not cached back in February.\n\nAnd as Trump continues to cozy up to the Silicon Valley leaders who fear his authoritarian ways, he might not like this much:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, why did Srinivasan delete all his tweets? There are clearly many reasons to do so. But with an administration as unreasonable as Trump’s it’s tough to pin down exactly which one is the biggest culprit. Maybe it’s best to just take his only remaining live tweet at face value:\n\nHe’s made his views clear through argumentation on Twitter, now it’s time to put them into practice.",

Britain’s blue chip companies are now worth more than on Monday morning – and significantly more than on February 20, when the EU poll was called. Some stocks, such as Guinness-maker Diageo, drugs firm GlaxoSmithKline and tobacco seller Imperial Brands are even up for the day. London’s index of top firms is outperforming the markets in Germany, France and Japan – and is likely to do so in the coming weeks. This is because a weakened pound will be a boon for exporters, like engine maker Rolls-Royce. Look at a graph of the FTSE 100 since the start of the month and it traces the ups and downs of a crazy rollercoaster ride. It tumbled for a week from June 8, as opinion polls showed the chances of a Brexit were growing. Then it picked up on Thursday last week in the wake of England’s Euro 2016 victory over Wales – and rose steadily in recent days as polls veered more towards a Bremain. Today’s crash was inevitable, but brief, and despite panic in the City, the FTSE 100 is now on the way back. We are likely to see some more lurches and drops in the coming weeks and months.

  "latent_2058": "Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThe director of the Secret Service, who was given the assignment of shoring up that agency in a period of crisis, is leaving one of Washington’s toughest jobs after a little more than two years.\n\nIn late 2014, President Barack Obama summoned Joseph P. Clancy, his former detail leader, back from the private sector amid a string of security breaches and employee misconduct in the agency. On Tuesday, Clancy said it’s time to retire for good. He leaves March 4, giving President Trump the chance to select a new director.\n\n[Past coverage: Obama picks Secret Service insider Joseph Clancy to lead troubled agency]\n\nClancy steered the Secret Service as it strained under a heavy workload and the lowest number of employees in a decade. At one point, the 6,300-person agency had 500 fewer people on staff than it was authorized to hire.\n\nOn Clancy’s watch, the Secret Service successfully tackled an intense and rancorous 2016 presidential election campaign — one that featured fisticuffs at some raucous rallies — without major incident.\n\nClancy said his proudest moments came in the summer and fall of 2015 when he watched his team simultaneously shield Pope Francis on a historic four-city visit to the United States and 170 foreign dignitaries at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The agency also relied on staffers from other arms of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“We had been going through a tough time, but I could see in their eyes and hear in their voices they were determined to succeed,” Clancy told The Washington Post. “I knew they were exhausted, but they were determined, and knowing what they had been through over recent years, it was inspirational to me.”\n\nBut Clancy also leaves behind a workforce that continues to complain of burnout, low morale and a lack of experienced, visionary managers.\n\nFormer director Ralph Basham said Clancy will be remembered as a reassuring presence “who has done right by the service.”\n\n“Due to his calm and professional manner and approach to problem-solving, he's just done a tremendous job for the department,” Basham said. “Not to say they don’t have issues remaining, but I think he's put the organization on a good path to getting better.”\n\nA few names are being discussed to replace Clancy: George Mulligan, the current chief operating officer; Mickey Nelson, a former assistant director; and new Deputy Director William Callahan.\n\nClancy joined the Secret Service in 1984, rising to become the leader of Obama's detail in 2009 and retiring in 2011. He returned to his native Philadelphia, taking a job as a security director for Comcast.\n\nClancy agreed to be the interim director in an October 2014 in telephone call with the president, the same day Obama accepted the resignation of Director Julia Pierson.\n\nOn Pierson's watch, a series of embarrassing incidents unfolded in quick succession. Officers and agents were caught in drunken misbehavior while preparing for presidential visits in the Florida Keys and the Netherlands, and even across the square from the White House at a hotel bar. The final straw came Sept. 19, 2014, when a limping, mentally ill veteran jumped the White House fence, bypassed more than a dozen Secret Service guards and hurtled deep inside the White House mansion.\n\n[New breaches revealed in report that says Secret Service is ‘in crisis’]\n\nIn early 2015, an expert panel studied the agency's dysfunction and urged the president to pick an outsider as the permanent director. Congressional Republicans agreed. But Obama chose Clancy; he and his wife preferred the comfort of the familiar “Father Joe.”\n\nOn Tuesday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Clancy's departure provides that critical opportunity to put an outsider atop the service.\n\n“A fresh set of eyes and new perspective is needed to restore the prestige and status expected of such an elite agency,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe Obama administration knew that Clancy wouldn’t rock the boat but hoped he would instill calm in a divided agency.\n\nIn that, he largely succeeded.\n\nA few cases of head-scratching misconduct plagued his time at the top, though. In March 2015, the No. 2 over Obama’s detail and a senior supervisor returned to the White House in a government car after a night of heavy drinking. They drove through an active bomb threat investigation, and supervisors never alerted Clancy to the incident.\n\nIn the most recent case, former and current agents are openly furious with Clancy for not taking action against a high-level supervisor who publicly said she doubted she could “take a bullet” for Trump.\n\nBoth the Obama administration and congressional Republicans hoped Clancy could shore up the Secret Service by boosting morale and rapidly hiring enough agents and officers to keep up with a flood of departures and early retirements.\n\nOn that score, he struggled.\n\nIn the 2016 employee survey, the service ranked dead last among all federal agencies for employee satisfaction, 305 out of 305.\n\nClancy sought to speed up a cumbersome hiring process. In 2015, 416 people retired or resigned from the agency, but only 78 new employees came aboard, according to a federal workforce report. The agency said it picked up the pace last year, hiring 700.\n\nClancy said he faced a steep learning curve, having never worked in the headquarters before. He described needing to gain the trust of the workforce and also to study up.\n\n“I had to acknowledge our past but try to convince our workforce that our body of work over 150 years was too great to simply ignore,” he said. “I had to get up to speed quickly on the work of each of the directorates. What were their goals and their needs? How could I help them? I had a lot to learn.”\n\nHe has now given a collective 29 years to the Secret Service.\n\nThe 61-year-old grandfather said he always planned to be an interim director and is looking forward to moving out of his bachelor's condo in Washington. He'll move back full time with his wife in their home in the Philadelphia suburbs, where they both grew up, met and started a family.\n\nChristian Marrone, the chief of staff to the Homeland Security secretary, praised Clancy for his personal sacrifice in returning to the agency.\n\n“Without hesitation, Joe Clancy stepped forward to serve his country and help the service when it needed it most,” Marrone said. “In my strong view, Joe is a hero and a role model to all of us that aspire to serve.”",
  "latent_2082": "Four years ago, Ron Finley was given an arrest warrant for planting carrots. Finley , who lives in South Central L.A., was tired of driving miles to find healthy food, so he’d planted a vegetable garden in the small strip of city-owned land between the sidewalk in front of his house and the street, an area he was required to maintain. The problem? The city required a $400 permit to use it as a garden, which Finley didn’t pay.\n\nAfter some media coverage of the garden and a petition from community activists, the warrant was later revoked, and the project started to inspire more guerrilla gardening throughout the city. Now, L.A. has finally changed its policy: Under a new law, the city will allow free gardens next to sidewalks.\n\n“In some of these neighborhoods, that’s the only place people have to plant,” says Finley. “Between the concrete, asphalt, and chain link fences, they don’t have any other places. To me, it’s about making food hyperlocal. Not just local, hyperlocal.”\n\nThe gardens help give neighborhoods control over their own food. “It’s about being self-sustaining,” Finley says. “It’s about you changing your life and being responsible for your health, and for your community. It’s you taking a stand that this is mine. … We’ve basically been enslaved by food companies, and they’re killing us slowly. There’s other means and other ways to supply food.”\n\nFor Finley, the sidewalk gardens are also about more than food. “It’s walking outside your door and being greeted by hummingbirds and dragonflies and bees, and a green, healthy ecosystem that’s not in these communities–it doesn’t exist,” he says. “I have birds that I’d never seen in my life before coming to my garden now. And you’re filtering the air. People walk by and see beautiful things, instead of just concrete.”\n\nFinley’s garden, which he shared in a TED talk, has inspired others to grow in vacant lots around the world, from Brazil to South Korea. “I’m the simplest man you know,” he says. “I’m not one of those academics that don’t do shit but reads about it. The difference is, I do shit. I have a proof of concept and it works. I don’t need studies–I know that this kid put a carrot in the ground and she saw it grow, and she took it out of the ground and was proud as hell, and she wiped it off and put it in her mouth and ate it. Now she has skin in the game.”\n\n“I tell people, ‘Change your food, change your life,” he says. “Grow your food, save your life.”",
  "latent_2103": "Anderson Silva was hosting a seminar at Lions Pride Gym in Croydon, London last week and GiveMeSport were there to listen in as one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time spoke.\n\nHis arrival at the venue had everyone on their toes, as person after person entered through the front door, everyone would turn with baited breath but when he finally made his entrance, via the fire exit, the Brazilian's presence was felt immediately as everyone went quiet.\n\nSitting up against the back wall, Silva looked tired, to be expected after flying into London the day before. But he was ready to answer questions as everyone took a spot around him.\n\nA brief silence followed but soon the ice was broken and the questions started flowing and so did Silva's answers.\n\nWhen asked about the bigger key to his comeback after losing to Chris Weidman at UFC 162 in July, he answered 'my mental' and talked at length about the importance of his focus.\n\n\"This is very important because you have training, you have the good coach, you have good sparring but you have normal life, you have problems,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes you have problems in your normal life, this is so important. You think you’re focused for your training, think you’re focused to listen to you coach but you have problems in your normal life, with your family. You not focused.\"\n\nWhen asked what he learned from he replied: \"All the time you need to keep your focus. The fight you have magic moment to finish the fight. You know focus on this, you lost.\n\n\"Everyone who trains for MMA for professional these days has good training, good cardio, good technique… not all of us. But I have guys who no like too much punch to face, too much kick to the legs.\"\n\n'Do you think Weidman got lucky?' enquires a voice amongst the group.\n\n\"Chris Weidman, the night of the fight, was the best.\"\n\nAsked if he could tell Weidman was nervous, especially when Silva was kicking his legs in the first round, he responded: \"Yeah I knew.\n\n\"But God give him the new chance for change my life because I’m perfect fighter now because I lost via knockout for first time in my life.\n\n\"I’m normal now. I have the best experience for inside the ring, in the octagon now.\"\n\n'Do you think, up until it went wrong, did you see it going to go the same way as the Damien Maia fight?' another asks.\n\n\"Yeah my mental was no good. I lost my control and this is bad. You know think you’re faultless for training, faultless for your objectives. It’s problem.\"\n\nSilva said he was yet to start training, but was headed to Japan to do so (he's also been announced to head to Thailand as well) as he just finished up a media tour, but he feels confident heading into his rematch with Weidman at UFC 168 in December, stating that Weidman has the pressure now.\n\n\"Uhm… is normal fight, don’t have too much pressure. The pressure is for Weidman. Wiedmann is champion, I’m normal guy now.\"\n\n'Do you feel nervous before your fights? Holding the title for so long, how did you deal with that pressure?'\n\n\"I training hard, I go for fight because I love it. I no go for fight for belt. It’s a symbol, it’s normal.\n\n\"One day you no have more belt, you’re no good man, you’re no good friend. Stay together with your friends in here because your friends help you. They change your life.\n\n\"You have talent, you have good energy, you go inside octagon but the guys in here, they help you, they change your life.\n\n\"The belt is the symbol, is nothing more. My opinion is the belt is the symbol but my fans, the people in the country don’t understand this.\n\n\"My friends see but the people don’t. “Come on Anderson it’s the belt. We need you to pick up the belt.”\n\nWhen asked the inevitable about a Jon Jones or GSP 'superfight' he noted that Lions Pride owner, the undefeated Jimi Manuwa, has a great chance of facing Jon Jones in the future.\n\n\"In my opinion, Dana White needs to give him the chance for the belt,\" he added.\n\nWrite for GiveMeSport!

Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWhile there are two full years before the 2016 US presidential race, the parade of possible candidates to Israel began Monday afternoon in Jerusalem with a meeting between Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWarren, whose name has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, arrived Saturday in Tel Aviv, and is set to also visit Ramallah and Amman. This is the first trip abroad for the senator, elected in 2012, who has so far concentrated largely on US domestic issues.\n\nIn addition to meeting Netanyahu on Monday, Warren went to the Knesset, where she witnessed an especially raucous session that featured Balad MK Jamal Zahalka being taken off the podium after calling presiding Deputy Knesset Speaker Moshe Feiglin (Likud) a fascist.Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who was among the government officials and Knesset members who met Warren, addressed the chaos from the podium, and then extended a welcome to Warren, standing in the balcony and accompanied by US Ambassador Dan Shapiro. The Knesset, which just a moment ago seemed gripped by bedlam, politely applauded her presence.According to The Boston Globe, Warren has been among only a handful of senators who have not traveled abroad. The paper wrote that while the trip may “reignite speculation of a 2016 presidential run, Warren has been planning to travel to Israel for months.”According to the Globe, “Warren’s foreign policy views seem to be anti-interventionist, with a skeptical eye to any US military action. In February, delivering her only major speech on foreign policy since she took office, she warned of using military might without considering the implications.”During an August meeting with constituents, Warren was pressed on her support of Israel and her votes to send money to support its fight against Hamas, and said that Israel was being attacked “indiscriminately” and had a right to fight back even though civilian casualties were the “last thing Israel wants,” the Globe said.“But when Hamas puts its rocket launchers next to hospitals, next to schools, they’re using their civilian population to protect their military assets,” Warren was quoted as saying. “And I believe Israel has a right, at that point, to defend itself.”A plank on Israel that appeared on her website when she ran for senate in 2012 said that she believed Israel “must maintain a qualitative military edge and defensible borders.”“The United States must continue to ensure that Israel can defend itself from terrorist organizations and hostile states, including Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and others,” she said. “I also believe firmly that a two-state solution is in the interest of Israel and the United States.“Lasting peace, however, requires negotiations between the parties themselves, and although the United States can and should aid in this process, we cannot dictate the terms. Unilateral actions, such as the Palestinians’ membership efforts before the United Nations, are unhelpful, and I would support vetoing a membership application,” she said.Other possible US presidential candidates are scheduled to visit Israel in the coming months.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Parliament will be failing in its duty to reflect the will of the people if it continues to resist calls to introduce a regulated cannabis market, a former coalition minister has warned.\n\nCannabis users gather at London '420 picnic' Read more\n\nA 10-minute rule bill proposing the introduction of a legal cannabis market in the UK, something that would constitute the biggest shakeup of the drugs laws in the past half-century, will end its passage through the Commons on Friday. It was tabled by Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesman, and supported by MPs from all parties, as well as experts including a serving chief constable.\n\nDespite failing in his attempt to steer a similar bill through parliament when he was a coalition health minister, Lamb said it had achieved its aim, by helping frame the debate around the UK’s drugs laws. “Change will happen, it’s just inevitable,” Lamb told the Observer. “We will come back in years to come and see this was the start of the change.”\n\nHe drew comparisons with public support for an overhaul of the euthanasia laws. “This is an issue like assisted dying, where parliament is a long way behind the public. In an age when there is a lot of anger out there and a great sense that the establishment is remote from how people feel, these are two great liberal issues where there is growing public opinion in favour of change. I think it reinforces the view that parliament is unrepresentative of so many people in our country.”\n\nLamb’s bill, co-sponsored by Lib Dems including Tim Farron and Nick Clegg, Green MP Caroline Lucas, Labour’s Paul Flynn and Conservatives Michael Fabricant, Crispin Blunt and Peter Lilley, was shaped by a report from an independent panel of experts. These included Mike Barton, chief constable of Durham police, the retired chief constable of Cambridgeshire, Tom Lloyd, and Professor David Nutt, former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.\n\nUnder its proposals, cannabis producers would be licensed and their products sold in plain packaging. There would be mandatory provision of health advice to consumers at the point of sale and controls on the drug’s potency. It is estimated that a regulated market could raise up to £1bn a year in tax.\n\n“There are some people who say because we are uncertain we shouldn’t act,” Lamb said. “I say because we are uncertain we should act. People start with a fear of substances that can cause harm. The instinctive reaction is to ban it until you see all the unintended consequences of that – like prohibition of alcohol in the US.”\n\nLamb said he had received only five letters opposing his bill from his constituents in Norfolk. He said it was striking that the bill had won support in the liberal press and had not been savaged by rightwing newspapers, proof that public opinion, at home and abroad, was shifting.\n\nOpinion polls suggest the majority of the UK public back a regulated cannabis market. In Canada, the Liberal government was elected on a manifesto commitment to legalise cannabis. Several US states and a number of South American countries now either allow the cultivation of cannabis for personal use or are taking steps to allow its sale through pharmacies.\n\nAltered State: tracing marijuana's long, strange trip through California Read more\n\nFurther calls for reform will come next week when Barton, Kenny MacAskill, the former Scottish justice secretary, and Baroness Meacher, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, will be among the politicians and experts who will attend a conference hosted by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (CCJS) which will hear from João Goulão, one of the architects of Portugal’s health-led approach to drugs policy. Many experts believe the UK could learn from Portugal’s experiences.\n\n‘‘More and more people recognise that the UK’s drug control regime has been a public health disaster that has unnecessarily criminalised countless people,” said Richard Garside, director of the CCJS. “Portugal’s health-based approach to drug regulation and regulated cannabis markets in several US states offer examples of how drugs might be regulated differently. Regardless of the fortunes of the cannabis bill, there is a growing sense that drug-taking needs to be treated as a health and education, not criminal justice, challenge.”",
  "latent_2537": "The Green Party Presidential Nominee faces criminal charges after allegedly vandalizing construction equipment at an energy pipeline site with hundreds of other protesters.\n\nMorton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of North Dakota announced Tuesday his office’s intention to file charges against Jill Stein and others for spray-painting bulldozers and other equipment being operated by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. Though not currently incarcerated, Kirchmeier said he is “working up the information through the state’s attorney’s office to pursue charges (against Stein),” according to the Bismarck Tribune.\n\nStein’s official campaign Twitter account confirms and promoted the act, Tuesday.\n\nState of ND may charge me with vandalism. Will they charge the oil company that razed sacred burial grounds? #NoDAPL https://t.co/PAYmyN2FCm — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 6, 2016\n\nMorton County reports that the incident occurred at or around 10:30 A.M. Tuesday where protesters numbered up to 300, according to the 25 first responders to arrive on the scene. Agitators were reportedly on horseback, wearing masks and carrying hatchets in some cases. No arrests were made at the time.\n\nAccording to the Bismarck paper, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II lauded the alleged acts as reminiscent of the Civil Rights Movement saying, “It was illegal but it was the right thing to do.”\n\nThe North Dakota construction site has been a flashpoint for violent, environmental protests since Labor Day weekend, sending multiple private security employees and their service dogs for medical treatment, Breitbart Texas recently reported:\n\nVarious videos and local reports have confirmed that “hundreds” of Native American protesters and supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux turned violent at a construction site under the management of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners near Cannon Ball, ND. The Associated Press reported that four private security guards and two dogs were injured in the incident as a result, according to the Morton County Sherriff’s Office. Though protesters have asserted through a variety of mediums that they were the ones first attacked, many of their own videos purport to show the opposite occurred. A spokesperson for the Dallas pipeline company told the AP that violence first began when protesters breached a fenced security perimeter and “attacked” the construction crew on the site. Videos uploaded by protesters and supportive media purport to show that the few private security guards were armed only with radios, pepper spray and leashed dogs while unidentifiable objects were hurled at them.\n\nThe pipeline is to span from the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas 1,168 miles through South Dakota and Iowa to Patoka, Illinois, for refining and distribution. The 30-inch, $3.8 billion line is expected to facilitate a maximum daily capacity of 570,000 barrels of crude.

  "latent_2604": "CLAREMONT — Marcela Pinos, a Bronx high school student, and Barack Obama share some similarities.\n\nBoth have a parent born outside the United States. Both have excelled in school. And both have followed, sometimes over difficult terrain, the path of leadership.\n\nThat is one reason why Pinos, 16, hopes to join other top students for an educational conference centered on the president’s January inauguration.\n\n“Remember when President Obama got reelected and gave his inaugural address?” Pinos said she longs to tell her friends and maybe one day her children. “Well, I was there.”\n\nBut because Pinos and her mother, who decorates cakes at a supermarket, can’t afford the event’s $3,195 price tag, the teen has launched her own fundraising campaign by writing letters to celebrities, selling cupcakes and, most recently, joining a crowd-funding site.\n\n“I don’t want to put this burden on my family,” she said, “because I know they don’t have the means to pay for it.”\n\nPinos secured an invitation to the selective five-day High School Presidential Inaugural Conference — where students study government and leadership, listen to speakers such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and watch the inauguration on the National Mall — through her membership in the National Society of High School Scholars.\n\nBut she didn't get invited to the conference until after the deadline had already passed to apply for a scholarship, so now she is trying to raise the money herself.\n\nThe conference is particularly important to Pinos because even though she has maintained a 91 average, been invited into the National Honor Society and earned spots in competitive enrichment programs, she fears that she will have trouble getting into college because of the challenges she faces at the Bronx High School of Medical Science, where she is a junior.\n\nThe school did not offer any math or English classes this semester to some students, including Pinos. Many students worried their test scores and college prospects would slip as they waited until later semesters to take those core classes.\n\nSo Pinos and a few friends met with teachers and administrators about the matter and finally, in desperation, spoke to the media. This month, they formed a group, Academics for All, to organize fellow students to push for classes they believe are their right.\n\n“I’m trying to fight for everyone’s education in that school,” said Pinos, who added that leadership roles can be intimidating for someone who was once shy and not well known by her peers — as is waging a campaign against school officials.\n\n“You don’t know what might happen to you,” she said. “Sometimes it gets scary.”\n\nPinos has made a splash beyond her Claremont-area school as well as she sought to create opportunities for herself and build her resume, most noticeably this past summer through a whirlwind of activities for outstanding students.\n\nFirst, she won a scholarship for a leadership-building summer camp in the British Virgin Islands, where she shared a houseboat with teens from Alaska, China and the United Kingdom.\n\nThen, she attended a NASDAQ closing bell ceremony as a member of the National Society of High School Scholars.\n\nAnd, finally, she took part in an invite-only summer neuroscience course at Rockefeller University, where Pinos, who hopes to become a scientist or doctor, extracted mosquito DNA.\n\nNow, she said, she is eager to attend inaugural conference, run by Envision EMI, an education company.\n\nPinos first raised some money to pay the $3,195 tuition — which covers admission, a hotel room and meals, but not transportation — by selling cupcakes during her lunch period, but she said she was told she couldn’t sell goods in school.\n\nSo she wrote about 50 letters to everyone from Oprah and the CEO of Amazon to local TV stations, politicians and even President Obama. She received only one reply, from Congressman Charles Rangel.\n\n“It is amazing to see a high school student of your academic status given the opportunity to experience an unforgettable event that will change your life,” Rangel wrote in a letter dated Nov. 16.\n\nBut, he added in the next line, “Ms. Pinos, at this time, I regret to inform you that I am not able to contribute to this inspiring fundraiser.”\n\nSo this week she created a page on the website GoFundMe, which allows users to collect online donations for a personal cause.\n\nHer page has yet to attract any donors.\n\nMarcela's mother, Mariela Torres, is asking friends and her coworkers at the supermarket to contribute. Torres studied economics in her native Ecuador, but has struggled to find professional work in the United States while she is still mastering English.\n\nHer main concern now, she said, is to make sure that nothing — from missing classes to pricey tuition — stops her daughter from achieving her dreams.\n\n“She has to do better than me,” Torres said. “To me, my daughter is everything.”\n\nTo help fund Pinos' trip to the High School Presidential Inaugural Conference, visit her donation page.",
  "latent_2614": "Hillary Clinton is praising Republicans.\n\nIn both her speech Thursday and a TV appearance Friday morning, Clinton praised three of the last four GOP presidential nominees for having condemned their supporters' racist and extreme views. There was Bob Dole, urging racists at the 1996 GOP convention to leave the building. There was George W. Bush, assuring us after 9/11 that Muslims love this country, too. And there was John McCain, rebuking claims made by those at his rally that Barack Obama was an \"Arab\" and even a \"terrorist.\"\n\n\"We need that kind of leadership again,\" Clinton said Thursday in Nevada.\n\nSuch episodes have come to be known as \"Sister Souljah moments.\" But Clinton, in this case, is actually underselling just how many recent GOP presidents and presidential candidates have had such moments on race.\n\nIn 1991, George H.W. Bush vocally denounced former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke after the Republican won a spot in the runoff election for governor of Louisiana. Bush called Duke a \"charlatan\" and said he would support the Democrat. Here are his comments:\n\nBut when someone asserts that the Holocaust never took place, then I don't believe that person ever deserves one iota of public trust. And when someone has so recently endorsed Nazism, it is inconceivable that such a person can legitimately aspire to leadership in a leadership role in a free society. And when someone has a long record, an ugly record of racism and of bigotry, that record simply cannot be erased by the glib rhetoric of a political campaign. So I believe that David Duke is an insincere charlatan. I believe he's attempting to hoodwink the voters of Louisiana. And I believe that he should be rejected for what he is and what he stands for.\n\nBush and Reagan had also endorsed against Duke in a 1989 state legislative race that Duke later won.\n\nGeorge W. Bush had one of these moments in 2002, when he publicly rebuked incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) for praising Strom Thurmond's segregationist 1948 campaign, calling the comments \"offensive.\"\n\n\"Recent comments by Sen. Lott do not reflect the spirit of our country,\" Bush said at the time, even as Lott was attempting — ultimately unsuccessfully — to weather the storm and remain in Senate leadership. \"He has apologized and rightly so. Every day that our nation was segregated was a day our nation was unfaithful to our founding ideals.\"\n\nReagan, meanwhile, in both 1980 and 1984 denounced the Klan for supporting his candidacy.\n\n\"I have no tolerance with what the Klan represents, and I want nothing to do with it,\" he said at a 1980 news conference after the Klan publicly endorsed him.\n\nAfter it nonetheless endorsed him again in 1984, Reagan wrote a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights stating:\n\nThose of us in public life can only resent the use of our names by those who seek political recognition for the repugnant doctrines of hate they espouse. The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always stood.'\n\nNone of this is to suggest these Republicans didn't struggle with their own race issues during their campaigns and presidencies.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact. George H.W. Bush's 1988 Willie Horton strategy against Michael Dukakis to this day is regarded as at least operating in a gray area of racist political attacks. And Reagan's 1980 comments came as he was drawing criticism for making his first general election stop at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss. — once a haven for racist political diatribes — and declaring, \"I believe in states' rights.\"\n\nWhat Clinton is getting at here, though, is that all of these GOP politicians at least had their moments — moments of real leadership when it came to rebuking racists in their midst.\n\nIt's no coincidence she made the remarks the same day that her campaign released a video showing KKK members and white nationalists talking about their support for Trump.\n\nAn ad released by the Hillary Clinton campaign says white supremacist and alt right leaders support Donald Trump for president. (Hillary Clinton)\n\nGiven Trump's reluctance to shift course on much of anything — not to mention his past failure to quickly and roundly denounce Duke or any self-proclaimed Trump supporters who engaged in racist or anti-Semitic attacks — she's basically daring him to not denounce this element of his base of support. And the choices for Trump are either to ignore it or to give in and do something that risks alienating key and passionate supporters. This is the central tension at the heart of all Sister Souljah moments.\n\nTrump said earlier this year that he wouldn't be opposed to having his own such moment, but he hasn't.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is smartly forcing the issue by pointing to plenty of other Republicans who have.",

Naturally, I was bored by this point. I was still a bit uncomfortable spending money but I wanted to get something done, so I ended up fitting my turbo kit. The holes for the studs DID NOT line up like they were supposed to I had to bore out several of the holes to get the manifold to actually go on the motor. Starting to look good though.\n\nThe Megan Type II exhaust that was on the car wasnt going to be used on the JZ setup so mini me helped me take it off so that we could sell it. I couldnt bring myself to cut it up. It may be a Megan product (which I dont really get down with) but the exhaust is really a quality piece for the price.\n\nJuly 2014 came around and one of my friends came to my house to help me complete a major transformation on the car.\n\nI forgot to take pics when I got the kit and the fenders, so sorry! I wanted a clean look so I decided to go with the Chargespeed 50mm rear fenders and Origin 20mm front fenders. I had my friend/fabricator chop the rear fenders and build me a bash bar for the front bumper that would work with the zenki blinkers.\n\nEnded up fitting the rear bumper, as well, and closed up the gap between the tires and fenders.\n\nLike every good boy does, I went and got an alignment so I wouldnt burn through my new tires at a ridiculous rate.\n\nNow that the new wheels were on, it was time to part with the old ones. We had a good run girls, you will be missed.\n\nIf you couldnt tell by now, I LOVE me some Work Wheels.\n\nSomewhere along this build me and my good friend picked up a sponsorship from Wiring Specialties if we agreed to help them get the word out about their company and build quality cars to represent their product. Obviously this required no thought on our part and we took the deal. In January 2015 Wiring Specialties delivered on their promise and sent me one of their first completed 1JZ Pro harnesses. This thing is so nice I cant even describe it. Thank you so much to Yury and the whole team at WS, the level of support that they have given us so far has been so good. I couldnt have asked for a better group of people to be teamed up with.\n\nSeveral days after receiving the wiring harness I picked up a new DD. Obviously a truck is the worst DD you could ever have, but the convenience of having a vehicle that you can load up the bed or use to tow other vehicles far outweighs the gas mileage issues.\n\nNow that I had a truck it was time to get some things done with this build. It was the end of January 2015 and I found a buyer for the KA24. I bought an engine hoist and pulled the motor by myself in two days after work. It really wasnt all that bad by myself; I have pulled so many SRs I cant even remember the count.\n\nWith the KA motor out of the car and sold it was time to get some more fabrication work done. I loaded the whip onto the trailer and took it down to my friends shop.\n\nWhile the car was at the shop, I spent more money on more parts. I ended up purchasing a set of front and rear drop knuckles from GKtech. I really wanted a low car but Im not too fond of my suspension geometry being all messed up from being too low. Im hoping this purchase will prevent any future issues from arising and I hope my car will handle amazingly once they are installed.\n\nTook the intake manifold and fuel rail runners in to get powder coated. It turned out really well IMO. The color is called Slate Gray Metallic\n\nFound a guy on eBay that was 3D printing gauge panels to replace the S14 radio surround. He was only making them for 52mm gauges but I contacted him to see if he could make me a panel to fit my 60mm Defis and he did. SCORE!!!\n\nI also picked up a clear cam cover because I thought it was neat. Not sure if I will use it or not. Maybe swap back and forth between this and the stock one???\n\nI was still waiting on a backordered Beech Performance Power Steering reservoir from Driftmotion (from a second parts order that I had placed) so I contacted them. They said they had no ETA on when Beech was going to be producing more reservoirs so they sent me one of their in house DM brand reservoirs that hadnt even been released yet. So much nicer than the Beech unit IMO.\n\nIt is now May 2015 and my fabricator said that he was ready for me to bring the motor down. I picked a hell of a nice day to go. I loaded everything up and took it down to his shop to drop it off.\n\nThis was my first time getting to see any of the fab work and I was really impressed, as I usually am with Jesses work. Here are some shots of the tubs in progress.\n\nAmong other things, I had him stitch weld the engine bay, build a rear bash bar with a jack point, and chop off the ends of the frame rails and box them in to make clearance for the intercooler.\n\nWe dropped in the motor and I left everything with Jesse to finish up what we could at this point. With the Freed Engineering mount kit and Cusco solid motor mounts the engine sat perfectly. There was more than enough room in the transmission tunnel for me to drop the motor in and not have to bang anything with a hammer.\n\nThe next time I checked in with him the removable core support was completed, the throttle body had been chopped, the water neck was also modified. Here is an in progress shot that I took when I went back to Jesses shop. Everything on the core support is removable to make taking the engine out much easier than it normally would be. The throttle body had the traction control removed and the water neck was modified to work with the KA Koyo radiator that I already had.\n\nA few days later I got to pick up the car and get it back to the garage. I wasnt ready to install the engine harness, but I wanted to take a picture of the first time the harness and motor have actually met .\n\nAfter several months of me dealing with anxiety and work I finally felt good enough again to work on the car. The summer in Vegas doesnt really motivate anyone to work on their car, to be honest, and my anxiety seems to get far worse if I start feeling hot. So here we are in September 2015. I had flip flopped with the idea of converting my car to a kouki several times but I instead pulled the plug on some EDM zenki glass lights out of Spain (thanks Razmus). Looks a million times better than my old faded USDM plastic lamps.\n\nFace down, ass up. We had to lift the back of the car in order to unbolt the transmission mount and lower it a bit while we cut the shifter opening a little better to accommodate the tripod shifter.\n\nThe interior in the car is still out so it was time to get to work on finishing up the wire tuck that one of my friends had done for me. I bought some fuse blocks and started to get to work. Im no master of wiring, but the little amount of crap that my boy Ross had left for me was simple enough that I could clean it up.\n\nYou can see whats left of the original fuse box on the floor board.\n\nI want to cut out the rest of the slack so I straightened everything out as much as I could and got to labeling.\n\nThe zipties are temporary, but this is what me and my homie Eric came up with. Its not fancy but I think it will get the job done. Im checking into some things though and this may not be my final setup.\n\nI cleaned up the SuperSpark coilpacks that I bought and then realized that I need to go buy some new screws before I throw them on the motor.\n\nI got some time to fit the side skirts as well and I have to say that the fit is pretty good right from Origin, but there are some areas that need to be trimmed so I wont be leaving these on for now.\n\nFra-gee-lay .must be Italian.\n\nNope its just something from Japan. I was going to put a big ass wing on this car, but about a month ago everyone and their mom started doing that so I figured I would go OEM. I really want to build a car that embodies the Japanese street style that I saw when I was over there, so OEM really is the best choice in the end.\n\nThe end of the month came and the Street Driven Tour passed through the city. I contacted Odi from Feal Suspension to see if he could build me a custom set of coilovers and bring them to the Street Driven Tour to save me money on shipping. He built them, brought them, and they are REALLY nice.\n\nIts a Feal 441 drift setup with 14kg Swift springs in front and 6kg Swift springs in the rear. When they build coilovers for you they valve them according to the spring rates that you asked for in your build. This was the main reason I went with their suspension; I cant wait to drive on these things.\n\nThats all I have right now, so here is a picture of my turbo sunbathing. Excuse the extremely ugly ass lamp Im not even sure why we still have that.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED . Fast forward to June 2014 (yes, it took that long to bounce back from an unexpected career change).

Here are some shots of the tubs in progress.Among other things, I had him stitch weld the engine bay, build a rear bash bar with a jack point, and chop off the ends of the frame rails and box them in to make clearance for the intercooler.We dropped in the motor and I left everything with Jesse to finish up what we could at this point. With the Freed Engineering mount kit and Cusco solid motor mounts the engine sat perfectly. There was more than enough room in the transmission tunnel for me to drop the motor in and not have to bang anything with a hammer.The next time I checked in with him the removable core support was completed, the throttle body had been chopped, the water neck was also modified. Here is an in progress shot that I took when I went back to Jesses shop. Everything on the core support is removable to make taking the engine out much easier than it normally would be. The throttle body had the traction control removed and the water neck was modified to work with the KA Koyo radiator that I already had.A few days later I got to pick up the car and get it back to the garage. I wasnt ready to install the engine harness, but I wanted to take a picture of the first time the harness and motor have actually met .After several months of me dealing with anxiety and work I finally felt good enough again to work on the car. The summer in Vegas doesnt really motivate anyone to work on their car, to be honest, and my anxiety seems to get far worse if I start feeling hot. So here we are in September 2015. I had flip flopped with the idea of converting my car to a kouki several times but I instead pulled the plug on some EDM zenki glass lights out of Spain (thanks Razmus). Looks a million times better than my old faded USDM plastic lamps.Face down, ass up. We had to lift the back of the car in order to unbolt the transmission mount and lower it a bit while we cut the shifter opening a little better to accommodate the tripod shifter.The interior in the car is still out so it was time to get to work on finishing up the wire tuck that one of my friends had done for me. I bought some fuse blocks and started to get to work. Im no master of wiring, but the little amount of crap that my boy Ross had left for me was simple enough that I could clean it up.You can see whats left of the original fuse box on the floor board.I want to cut out the rest of the slack so I straightened everything out as much as I could and got to labeling.The zipties are temporary, but this is what me and my homie Eric came up with. Its not fancy but I think it will get the job done. Im checking into some things though and this may not be my final setup.I cleaned up the SuperSpark coilpacks that I bought and then realized that I need to go buy some new screws before I throw them on the motor.I got some time to fit the side skirts as well and I have to say that the fit is pretty good right from Origin, but there are some areas that need to be trimmed so I wont be leaving these on for now.Fra-gee-lay .must be Italian.Nope its just something from Japan. I was going to put a big ass wing on this car, but about a month ago everyone and their mom started doing that so I figured I would go OEM. I really want to build a car that embodies the Japanese street style that I saw when I was over there, so OEM really is the best choice in the end.The end of the month came and the Street Driven Tour passed through the city. I contacted Odi from Feal Suspension to see if he could build me a custom set of coilovers and bring them to the Street Driven Tour to save me money on shipping. He built them, brought them, and they are REALLY nice.Its a Feal 441 drift setup with 14kg Swift springs in front and 6kg Swift springs in the rear. When they build coilovers for you they valve them according to the spring rates that you asked for in your build. This was the main reason I went with their suspension; I cant wait to drive on these things.Thats all I have right now, so here is a picture of my turbo sunbathing. Excuse the extremely ugly ass lamp Im not even sure why we still have that.TO BE CONTINUED .\n\n: @allouterik __________________: @allouterik",

Comey responded that he followed the proper procedure in notifying DNC officials of the breach, according to The Hill.\n\nOne Democrat reportedly shouted at Comey: \"You let us down!\"\n\nLawmakers at the meeting referenced a tense final 15 minutes, but did not elaborate on what exactly was discussed during the final part of the briefing.\n\n\"I'm disappointed, outraged — many of us are right now,\" Rep.

Some Democrats have accused him of swaying the election in Trump's favor with the move.\n\nThe Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General announced a new examination Thursday into the FBI's handling of the investigation of Clinton's email use.\n\nThe probe will focus on Comey's public announcement of the department's decision not to bring charges against Clinton for her use of a private server. It will also examine the letter that Comey sent Congress days before the general election announcing that the FBI had renewed its investigation into the server, and other aspects of the Clinton investigation.",

REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh\n\nRussia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has urged the United Nations to give its blessing to the fragile ceasefire, the third truce this year seeking to end nearly six years of war in Syria.\n\nClashes and air strikes have persisted in some areas since the ceasefire began on Friday, though the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said on Saturday the truce was still largely holding.\n\n“Continued violations by the regime and bombardment and attempts to attack areas under the control of the revolutionary factions will make the agreement null and void,” a statement signed by a number of rebel groups said.\n\nThe statement said government forces and their allies including Lebanese Hezbollah had been trying to press advances, particularly in an area northwest of Damascus in the rebel-held Wadi Barada valley.\n\nThe Observatory, which is based in Britain, said government forces and the rebels had clashed on Saturday in Wadi Barada.\n\nRebels say the army is seeking to recapture the area, where a major spring provides most of Damascus’s water supplies. Several people were killed in violence there on Friday, the Observatory said.\n\nBlasts from government shellfire were also heard in the southern provinces of Quneitra and Deraa, the Observatory said.\n\nEach side blames the other for continued unrest. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday rebels had violated the truce 12 times in 24 hours.\n\nPEACE TALKS\n\nRussia and Turkey, which backs the armed opposition to Assad, brokered the ceasefire agreement in the hope of preparing the way for peace talks in Kazakhstan in the new year.\n\nRelated Coverage U.N. Security Council council welcomes Syria ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey\n\nIn their statement, the rebels said it appeared the government and the opposition had signed two different versions of the ceasefire deal, one of which was missing “a number of key and essential points that are non-negotiable”, but did not say what those were.\n\nThere has been confusion over which groups in the opposition are included in the ceasefire. Islamic State, which has made enemies of all sides in the conflict, is not included.\n\nThe Syrian army said on Thursday the militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front was not part of the truce. However, several rebel officials said the group, which has been renamed Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, was also included in the ceasefire deal.",
  "latent_3003": "The report compares how successfully immigrants are integrated in 38 industrial nations in a points-based ranking - called the MIPEX index - put Germany in the top ten for the first time since the index was first published in 2004.\n\nCountries were awarded a total out of 100 points. Germany improved on its score from 2011, the year of the last report, by three points to reach a total of 63 points, reports Der Spiegel.\n\nGermany thus scored slightly above the west European average of 60.\n\nThe authors praised Germany for making “slow but steady progress on providing equal rights and greater support.”\n\nGermany, they write, is one of the few industrialized nations where attitudes to immigration are improving.\n\nAs an illustration, the reports authors pointed to a survey which showed that 72 percent of Germans believe non-EU citizens should have the same legal rights as Germans.\n\nA particular improvement that counted in Germany's favour, writes the Süddeutsche Zeitung, was the passing of the Annerkenungsgesetz - the law of recognition - in 2012 which made the process by which foreign professional qualifications are officially recognized much smoother.\n\nIn terms of job opportunities German was the fourth best country on a level with Canada, a country with a much longer history of inward migration.\n\nThe report notes that 78 percent of immigrants in Germany are in work. Only in Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are the numbers better.\n\nThe relative ease with with which one can get citizenship in the Federal Republic also counted in Germany's favour. That being born in Germany enables one to gain citizenship is “trend-setting” said the report's authors.\n\nBut counting against Germany was the fact that it is still difficult for German citizens to carry the passport of a second country.\n\nThe fact that immigrant children can only get a second nationality under specific conditions was regarded as too restrictive.\n\nGermany is the only major industrialized nation not yet to have embraced dual nationality, the authors point out.\n\nThe report also criticized Germany for the restrictions placed on whole families moving to the country together.\n\nArguing that one feels naturally happier when one is surrounded by family, the researchers said that German laws put the Federal Republic considerably below the average in this regard.\n\nIn terms of equality in the workplace Germany also did poorly. It is just as difficult for immigrants to take their employers to court over workplace discrimination as in the Czech Republic or Turkey, the argued.",
  "latent_3087": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - An Arizona apartment complex custodian was put to death by lethal injection on Wednesday for the 1984 rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl, after a flurry of last-minute court appeals failed, prison officials said.\n\nDonald Beaty is seen in an undated prison photo. REUTERS/Arizona Department of Corrections\n\nDonald Edward Beaty, 56, died at 7:38 p.m. local time at a state prison in Florence, Arizona, officials said, in an execution delayed for more than nine hours by a legal dispute over one of the drugs used to kill him.\n\nBeaty, convicted of killing newspaper carrier Christy Ann Fornoff, had won a temporary stay from the Arizona Supreme Court after his lawyers objected to the last-minute substitution of a drug to be used in the lethal-injection mix.\n\nBut the court lifted the stay after conducting a special hearing on Wednesday morning, rejecting arguments that the state breached Beaty’s constitutional due process rights and protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nPetitions to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court were unsuccessful.\n\nWith his last words, Beaty apologized to the murder victim’s parents. He told them “God will let you see her again,” Barrett Marson, an Arizona Department of Corrections spokesman said\n\nMarson added that Beaty was “very emotional” and difficult to understand.\n\nBeaty’s final meal included a double cheeseburger, a shredded beef chimichanga and rocky road ice cream.\n\nArizona switched the sedative in the three-drug “cocktail” it planned to administer to Beaty from sodium thiopental to pentobarbital on Tuesday after federal officials said the state failed to fill out a required form to bring the substitute drug into the country.\n\nSodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner unconscious, has been at the center of a debate over appropriate execution drugs. Supplies have become scarce in the United States, and efforts to buy stocks overseas have stirred controversy and been turned down flat by some manufacturers.\n\nBeaty was convicted of snatching Fornoff from her newspaper route in Tempe, Arizona, in May 1984. He sexually assaulted her, then suffocated her in what was then one of the state’s more sensational criminal cases.\n\nCourt records said he kept the body inside his apartment for two days. She was later found wrapped in a sheet behind a dumpster there.\n\nA jury deadlocked in Beaty’s first trial. He was convicted of murder and sexual assault when a psychologist testified that he confessed to the killing in a group therapy session.\n\nIn last-ditch appeals, Beaty’s lawyers unsuccessfully maintained his life should be spared because he did not have effective legal representation.\n\nHe is the second inmate executed in Arizona this year, and the 26th since the death penalty was reinstated there in 1992.\n\nNineteen people have been executed in the United States so far this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",

This name uses Spanish naming customs : the first or paternal family name isand the second or maternal family name is\n\nAndrés Escobar Saldarriaga ( Spanish pronunciation: [anˈðɾes eskoˈβaɾ salðari'aga]; 13 March 1967 – 2 July 1994) was a Colombian footballer who played as a defender. He played for Atlético Nacional, BSC Young Boys, and the Colombia national team.[1] Nicknamed The Gentleman, he was known for his clean style of play and calmness on the pitch.[citation needed]\n\nEscobar was murdered in the aftermath of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, reportedly as retaliation for having scored an own goal which contributed to the team's elimination from the tournament.[2] His murder tarnished the image of the country internationally.[3] Escobar himself had worked to promote a more positive image of Colombia, earning acclaim in the country.[4] In 2013, then-coach Francisco Maturana denied that Escobar's murder had any connection to football or the World Cup, but rather was due to his being \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\" at a violent time in Colombia's history.[5]\n\nEscobar is still held in high regard by Colombian fans, and is especially mourned and remembered by Atlético Nacional's fans.[citation needed]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nEscobar was born in Medellín on March 13, 1967. He grew up in a middle-class family.[6] He attended Colegio Calasanz and graduated from Instituto Conrado González. He participated in school football teams before becoming a professional football player.[7]\n\nHis father is Darío Escobar, a banker who founded an organization that gives young people the opportunity to play football instead of being on the streets. His brother, Santiago, is a former footballer who played alongside Andrés at Atlético Nacional before moving into team management in 1998.\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEscobar was a defender throughout his career. His jersey number was 2, and he was known by the nicknames \"El Caballero del Fútbol\" (\"The Gentleman of Football\") and \"The Immortal Number 2\". In his club career, he played for Colombian club Atlético Nacional and Swiss club Young Boys.[8] He helped Nacional to win the 1989 Copa Libertadores.[9]\n\nPrior to the 1994 World Cup, Escobar was reported to have been offered a contract by A.C. Milan.[10][11][12]\n\nInternational career [ edit ]\n\nHe made his debut for the Colombia national team on March 30, 1988, in a 3–0 win against Canada. His first appearance in an international competition took place at the 1988 Rous Cup, where he also scored the only goal of his international career in a 1–1 draw against England.\n\nHe played four matches at the 1989 Copa América when he was 22 years old. The team was eliminated in the first round of the tournament. The same year he also played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification. The team was the winner of Group 2, but had to play the Intercontinental Play-off since it had the worst record among the group winners. Colombia won 1–0 on aggregate and qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Escobar played all the matches during the World Cup. The team reached the Round of 16 where it was eliminated with a 2–1 defeat against Cameroon.\n\nEscobar was called up for the 1991 Copa América squad, where he made seven appearances. He did not participate in any games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification, but he was called up for the World Cup.[11]\n\nOwn goal incident and subsequent murder [ edit ]\n\nEscobar's own goal occurred in a match against the United States on June 22, in the second match for Colombia at the 1994 World Cup. Stretching to block a cross from American midfielder John Harkes, he inadvertently deflected the ball into his own net. The United States won the game, 2–1.[13]\n\nAfter the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Escobar decided to return to Colombia instead of visiting relatives in Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] On the evening of July 1, 1994, five days after the elimination of Colombia from the World Cup, Escobar called his friends, and they went to a bar in the El Poblado neighborhood in Medellín. Then they went to a liquor store. Shortly afterwards, they arrived at the El Indio nightclub. His friends split up. At approximately 3:00 the next morning, Escobar was alone in the parking lot of El Indio, in his car, when three men appeared. They began arguing with him. Two of the men took out handguns.[14] Escobar was shot six times with a .38 caliber pistol.[7] It was reported that the killer shouted \"¡Gol!\" (\"Goal!\") after every shot, once for each time the South American football commentator said it during the broadcast.[15] The group then drove away in a Toyota pickup truck, leaving Escobar to bleed to death. Escobar was rushed to the hospital where he died 45 minutes later.[14][16][17]\n\nThe murder was widely believed to be a punishment for the own goal.[18] In the UK, the BBC issued a public apology after its football pundit Alan Hansen commented during the match between Argentina and Romania that \"the Argentine defender warrants shooting for a mistake like that\", on July 3, a day after the murder of Escobar.[19]\n\nEscobar's funeral was attended by more than 120,000 people. Every year people honour Escobar by bringing photographs of him to matches. In July 2002, the city of Medellín unveiled a statue in honour of his memory.[20]\n\nHumberto Castro Muñoz, a bodyguard for members of a powerful Colombian drug cartel,[clarification needed] was arrested on the night of 2 July 1994, confessing the next day to the killing of Escobar.[21] Muñoz also worked as a driver for Santiago Gallón, who had allegedly lost heavily betting on the outcome of the game.[22] He was found guilty of Escobar's murder in June 1995. He was sentenced to 43 years in prison. The sentence was later reduced to 26 years because of his submitting to the ruling penal code in 2001. Humberto was released on good behaviour due to further reductions from prison work and study in 2005 after serving approximately 11 years. His three accomplices were acquitted.\n\nAs part of the 2009–2010 documentary series 30 for 30, ESPN broadcast The Two Escobars, by directors Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, which looked back at Colombia's World Cup run and the relationship of association football and the country's criminal gangs, notably the Medellín Cartel run by Pablo Escobar (who was unrelated to Andrés).[23][24] It is suggested in the program that, had Pablo Escobar still been alive, the Gallón brothers would not have targeted Andrés Escobar, as it was widely known that Pablo Escobar was a fervent supporter of the Colombian national football team.\n\nThere are also allegations that the Gallón brothers bribed the Prosecutor's Office to redirect the investigation towards Muñoz as the triggerman – and the Prosecutor's Office contends that Muñoz was simply following orders from the Gallón brothers – but prosecutors lacked credible evidence to convict them. Pamela Cascardo, the girlfriend of Andrés Escobar, believes that the accusation of the Gallón brothers' bribery of government officials is supported by Muñoz's having killed a national celebrity and serving only 11 years in prison.\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nEscobar's murder tarnished the image of Colombia internationally.[3] Escobar himself had worked to promote a more positive image of Colombia, earning acclaim within the country.\n\nEscobar is still held in high regard by Colombian fans, and is especially mourned and remembered by Atlético Nacional's fans. In a newspaper column published shortly before his killing, he said of Colombia's World Cup: \"It’s been a most amazing and rare experience. We’ll see each other again soon because life does not end here\".[2][25]\n\nAfter Escobar's death, his family founded the Andrés Escobar Project to help disadvantaged children learn to play football.[26]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nPrior to his death, Escobar was engaged to his girlfriend for five years, a dentist named Pamela Cascardo. They would have been married later in 1994.[27] Escobar was a devout Catholic and would go to mass everyday before school with his mother until her death at the age of 52.[28]\n\nCareer statistics [ edit ]\n\nClub [ edit ]\n\nThis table is incomplete, thus some stats and totals could be incorrect.\n\nClub performance League Cup Continental Other Total Season Club League Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Colombia League Cup South America Other[n 1] Total 1986 Atlético Nacional Campeonato Profesional 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1987 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 21 0 1988 42 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 42 0 1989[n 2] 12 0 0 0 1+ 1 1 0 14 1 1990 Atlético Nacional Categoría Primera A 26 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 26 0 1991 37 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 46 0 1992 49 0 0 0 3+ 2 0 0 52 2 1993 21 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 23 0 1994 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 Total Colombia 222 0 0 0 15 3 1 0 238 3 Career total 222 0 0 0 15 3 1 0 238 3\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nInternational appearances [ edit ]\n\nTeam Year Apps Goals Colombia 1988 6 1 1989 16 0 1990 5 0 1991 8 0 1992 2 0 1993 1 0 1994 13 0 Total 51 1\n\nInternational goals [ edit ]\n\nInternational goals Goal Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1 1988-05-24 Wembley Stadium, London, England England 1–1 1–1 1988 Rous Cup\n\nHonours [ edit ]\n\nAtlético Nacional\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Includes Intercontinental Cup ^ This season was cancelled before ending, however, the appearances and goals are counted for statistical reasons.",

The engine for the Valkyrie is a naturally-aspirated 6.0-litre V12 built by racing specialists Cosworth.\n\nThat has led to speculation that Aston Martin, Red Bull and Cosworth could form a partnership to build an engine for 2021 and beyond.\n\nSpeaking to British publication, Autosport, Palmer acknowledged Aston Martin's interest in joining F1 as an engine supplier under the right circumstances.\n\n\"We sit on the periphery of F1, with the Valkyrie, and with Red Bull,\" Palmer is quoted in Autosport.\n\n\"There's always that question, would you want to enter as a team?\n\n\"Our major competitor is Ferrari, so in that sense there's a rationale in being involved in some way.\n\n\"But for a company that's only just moved to making a profit we don't have the 350-400 million a year that you have to spend on F1.\n\n\"If - and it really is the big if - there is a cap put on the number of people or the amount of money that you can spend on developing a new engine, and it's at a reasonable level, we have a good reason to study it.\n\n\"At the moment there are lots of opinions, and it's still morphing into whatever the final idea will be.\"\n\nCosworth is the second most successful engine supplier in the history of F1, winning 176 races between 1967 and 2003 in partnership with Ford.\n\nDespite the connections to Cosowrth Palmer didn't rule out working with a different partner, with both Ilmor (another former F1 engine builder), Ricardo (which is building the gearbox for the Valkyrie) and Zytek also present at the recent rules debate.\n\nRepresentatives from Volkswagen Group were also present amid speculation that Audi or Porsche could finally enter the sport when the new rules begin.",
  "latent_3727": "On 12 April, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her second candidacy for president, this time as the Democratic Party favorite, supported by a large majority of Democratic-leaning voters. The next day, a scientific study declared female candidates front-runners in another career competition that many have long believed is stacked in favor of men: the race for assistant professorships on university science faculties.\n\nBoth events attracted intense media attention. The peer-reviewed article, “National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] tenure track,” by psychologists Wendy Williams and Stephen Ceci of Cornell University, got so many mentions from news reporters, bloggers, Facebookers, and Tweeters that it ranks “amongst the highest ever scored” for the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)—ranked No. “14 out of 33,942” as of 29 April—according to altmetrics, which tracks social media mentions of scientific papers. Some of that attention has been positive—but much of it has been not only negative but also unpleasantly personal. “We’ve had such amazing attacks. They really, really hate us,” Williams tells Science Careers by phone. (See Box)\n\nIt’s tempting to blame gender when you don't get a job and you’re a woman. It’s easier … than to admit that the entire premise of what you've done for the past 7 years of your life was flawed at the root. —Wendy Williams\n\nClinton’s announcement was a big story partly because the prospect of a woman president threatens ancient notions of gender still cherished by many, especially conservatives. But why should a scholarly report on experiments that break little new scientific ground have such an outsized impact? It’s probably because Williams and Ceci’s findings also question strongly held ideas about gender. In this case, though, the people complaining view themselves as progressive advocates for women’s advancement.\n\nMaking sense of the controversy surrounding the paper requires clarifying what it does and doesn’t say. The paper reports on a series of experiments that presented more than 800 male and female biology, engineering, psychology, and economics faculty members at 371 universities with various versions of the credentials of fictitious applicants for assistant professorships. The identical records, which indicated outstanding achievement, were sometimes attributed to a woman and sometimes to a man. In every field but economics, where the data indicated no gender preference, the respondents strongly preferred the purportedly female candidates.\n\nThe paper does not argue that no gender bias exists in academic science. It only examines whether gender bias influences faculty members at the point of choosing among highly qualified candidates, Williams and Ceci emphasize in the interview. “No one is saying that there are no differences in the experiences of women and men in the academy,” Williams says. “We’ve never suggested or said that there are no problems at any … point” other than hiring. In fact, the pair will soon publish findings about other aspects of life as a graduate student and a new assistant professor. And there, “we do find differences,” Williams says.\n\nThe importance of being outstanding\n\n“The [current] Williams and Ceci article presents evidence of a preference for a female candidate over a male when performance and lifestyle are identical. In other words, they do not find that employers would discriminate against women solely because of their gender,” economist Ernesto Reuben of Columbia University writes in an e-mail to Science Careers. “This is an important finding.”\n\nIn March, Reuben and co-authors published a hiring study of their own in PNAS. They found that “both male and female subjects are twice more likely to hire a man than a woman” to do “an arithmetic task” when gender is all that is known about an applicant. The male advantage diminishes, though, when the prospective employer learns that women have proven equally capable of doing the task. (Men, the authors note, “are more likely to boast about their performance, whereas women tend to underestimate it.”)\n\n“Employers, especially [those] with strong implicit stereotypes about women and mathematics … tended not to take this [differential boasting] into account,” the authors continue. Information about performance from an “objective” source, however, strongly reduced discrimination. So, even if an employer holds implicit gender stereotypes, bias does not necessarily control hiring decisions when objective information about performance is available, Reuben’s study suggests. Williams and Ceci’s study provided objective evidence of high accomplishment and “excludes [faculty hiring] discrimination based on [gender] as a major culprit in the lack of women in STEM fields,” Reuben writes in the e-mail.\n\nA large body of other research also finds a female advantage in faculty hiring, Ceci notes. “We looked at eight [faculty] hiring audits [examining] who applies and who gets hired and … all eight … showed that although fewer women than men apply for STEM jobs, those who do apply are hired at a higher rate,” he says in the interview. “In real-world hiring of tenure-track applicants in STEM fields in the United States and Canada … [t]here is a female advantage in all large-scale studies dating back to the 1980s,” he and Williams write in an online appendix to their article. Generally, however, that “female advantage is less than the 2-to-1 finding reported here.” And, they add, “actual hiring analyses may underestimate the strength of female preference” because they count only who took a job, not the number of offers that applicants received.\n\nA meta-analysis of 136 studies of gender in hiring published in January in the Journal of Applied Psychology also failed to find bias when “information clearly indicated high competence of those being evaluated.” This is relevant because the applicants evaluated in the Williams and Ceci study were exceptionally competent, as are all the candidates who make it to a faculty job short list these days. Given the vast oversupply of Ph.D.s, faculty hiring has “been a buyer’s market for years,” Ceci says. A search he recently chaired, for example, attracted 267 applicants, and “any of 30 or more would have been outstanding.” “Every search yields several dozen applicants who are all extraordinary, and you don’t even know how to choose among them they’re so good,” Williams adds.\n\nA large body of data thus converges on the conclusion that bias against women at such rarefied levels of accomplishment is extremely unlikely, they conclude. Indeed, observes Columbia’s Reuben, Williams and Ceci’s finding that women received higher ratings than men “suggests that evaluators understand that there exists discrimination against women in academia and therefore give more credit to a woman who is judged as exceptional by her peers than to a man with the same narrative.”\n\nChanging times\n\nWomen are “hired more often because a lot of us faculty have internalized the value of gender diversity, and they actually want more women when … all other things [are] equal,” Ceci explains. “Ideas about women have changed,” in academic hiring, Williams adds. “It’s just like the evolution of ideas about gay marriage. … I don’t see what’s so threatening about acknowledging that in some areas ideas have changed, and in other areas there still are problems.”\n\n“The outpouring of vitriol [shows, however,] that there are a lot of people who don’t want to acknowledge the data,” she continues. “It’s not like they’re willing to acknowledge it and discuss it. … They try to say that we had an agenda or that the entire method at its root was completely flawed.” Many of their detractors, she adds, falsely characterize their work and its conclusions and then attack “straw men.” This opposition, she believes, is emotional rather than scholarly.\n\nThe venom may arise because some people are deeply invested in a narrative of persistent and pervasive bias against women in academic science, perhaps because of ideological beliefs in the ubiquity of gender discrimination. Some people may be attempting to salve their disappointment at a job market that keeps thousands of well-qualified people from having the careers they want and worked for. “It’s tempting to blame gender when you don't get a job and you’re a woman,” Williams says. “It’s easier … than to admit that the entire premise of what you've done for the past 7 years of your life was flawed at the root.”\n\nIn any case, as we’ve mentioned before, that women are twice as likely as men to be hired onto science faculties does not mean that many of them will actually get jobs. As Williams, Ceci, and co-authors noted in earlier work, one 13-year study of “a large state university” found that 2-to-1 female advantage resulted in the hiring of 4.28% of female applicants as opposed to 2.03% of males.\n\nSome detractors may be protecting established careers, such as scholars and writers who built their reputations on describing discrimination that Williams and Ceci’s data suggest has faded at the point of hiring. Some may be part of universities’ substantial antibias administrative and training apparatus, which, like every part of today’s financially stressed institutions, is under pressure.\n\nWilliams says she and Ceci will soon publish data showing “some challenges for women in some areas” of academic science. “People will embrace that,” she predicts. In the meantime, people “acting as though the [current] study is worthless because it came out in a way that you personally don’t like—that’s not science,” she says. “That’s religion.” Or, as Hillary Clinton might put it, that’s gender politics.",
  "latent_3746": "The Indian board is setting a precedent by ignoring the FTP, and thus seemingly reserving the right to do with international cricket as it pleases\n\nThe ICC govern in the interests of cricket? Not on Srinivasan's watch © ICC/Getty\n\nAt one point in his excellent new book on the modern powerhouse of Indian cricket, The Great Tamasha, James Astill stops to wonder whether India is becoming \"an oligarchy, a democracy stage-managed by a corrupt super-elite\". One might harbour exactly the same thought about cricket.\n\nConsider this: under the ICC's Future Tours Programme, the BCCI was scheduled to visit South Africa between November and January for three Tests, seven ODIs and two T20Is. Except that in July the BCCI began to dicker about the schedule, in the same way as six months earlier it had refused to be pinned down on the matter of a schedule for a tour of New Zealand, also listed in the FTP.\n\nNever mind that South Africa and India, first and third on the ICC Test rankings, represent probably the best cricket we have a chance of seeing in the present environment. Never mind that Cricket South Africa, like New Zealand Cricket, is an organisation whose finances depend acutely on television revenues, of which the presence of an Indian cricket team would afford them a share; in fact, that was the point. Then the BCCI announced that India will play two home Tests against West Indies, not part of the FTP, partly overlapping with the time previously allotted to the South African tour. It is now possible there will be no visit to South Africa at all.\n\nOn all this, there was no elaboration whatsoever, official or unofficial. In positing nine possible explanations for the Wisden India website, Suresh Menon observed that the BCCI had gone beyond its usual domineering ways and was \"functioning like a secret society\". All that seems agreed is that the BCCI and CSA have a feud. We know this because CSA's chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, has offered to apologise, which apparently BCCI's locum president Jagmohan Dalmiya thinks is a good idea without troubling to specify for what - something that transpired when Lorgat was running the ICC, one must assume. Dalmiya was certainly sorely grieved when Lorgat shifted the India v England match from the badly incomplete Eden Gardens during the 2011 World Cup.\n\nThe other salient fact is that the BCCI has its annual general meeting coming up on September 29, the overpowering presence at which will be its il capo dei capi, N Srinivasan, temporarily restricted by the betting misadventures of his son-in-law in the IPL but still the master string-puller. Since the May allegations about Gurunath Meiyappan, and about spot-fixing in the IPL, the BCCI has lurched about like many a debauched and embattled political regime.\n\nQuick private inquiry to exonerate all concerned - thank you, former judges Chouta and Balasubramanian! Rehabilitation of former enemies it is now expedient to embrace - sorry that we once expelled you \"for life\" for corruption, Mr Dalmiya! Morale-boosting tributes from selected kiss-ass courtiers - congratulations, Mr Shastri, on a Sardesai Lecture that had it been delivered in North Korea would have brought a blush to the cheek of the Dear Leader!\n\nThe decision to superimpose West Indies' visit on what should have been the trip to South Africa is double the fun. There's crude populism - hey everyone, let's cheer for Sachin's 200th Test! There's gratuitous gunboat diplomacy - if you want our money, Mr Lorgat, you better beg for it! And it coincides nicely with the meting out of \"justice\" to the previous regime - that means you, Mr Lalit Modi! Because that general meeting has already been designated for imposing a life ban on the IPL's Icarus-like founder after a three-year investigation found… well, not as much as it wanted. After all the initial finger-pointing, the BCCI's star chamber had to work pretty hard to make the crime fit the pre-ordained punishment, because in the end he has really only been convicted of the high-handed unilateralism for which he had always been known, and in which the BCCI had previously indulged him. Perhaps his misdeeds lie elsewhere; perhaps the charges themselves achieved the desired end anyway.\n\n****\n\nTo be fair to the BCCI, cricket administration is hardly to be associated with transparency and accountability anywhere. It is the domain of self-constituting national monopolies. Cricket boards have no shareholders to appease or voters to placate. The cricket-loving public, in whose name administrators sometimes purport to govern, are diffuse, unorganised, and care little about who's running things, providing they enjoy a bit of what they want every so often - whether that's semi-regular ebullitions for Sachin in India, or the maximum Ashes cricket in Australia and England. Unlike players, bound tight by codes of conduct, boards essentially police themselves, with all that that entails. What some regard as cricket's overall governing body, the ICC, has the barest powers of oversight, and receives from most of its directors only perfunctory attention: they have not visited its headquarters for nearly 18 months, preferring to meet in a resort at colossal expense while complaining that the council costs too much.\n\nThis is actually a subtext of the present imbroglio. None hold the ICC in such conspicuous contempt as its largest member, the BCCI having declined to sign the FTP and now setting a precedent in ignoring it altogether. The casus belli was the Woolf Review, a thorough examination of the governance of world cricket initiated by Lorgat, which in February 2012 made high-minded, far-reaching and arguably unrealistic proposals for turning the ICC into a full-fledged governing organisation with independent directors.\n\nThe BCCI was having none of it. The ICC govern in the interests of cricket? Not on Srinivasan's watch. And as it happens, a tiny chink of light is available to study this by: it's a copy of the minutes of the ICC's January board meeting, which has for many months been passing surprisingly unremarked on what we might call Modileaks - Lalit Modi's idiosyncratic but entertaining website.\n\nThe BCCI is an organisation with many more problems than are sometimes acknowledged - full of ambitious people pulling in different directions, operating in an uncertain political, commercial and legal environment, shaped by a turbo-boosted economy that has bestowed its benefits unevenly and whose impetus is currently faltering\n\nFor connoisseurs of shambolic governance, these minutes contain much to savour, but let's confine ourselves to two nuggets. Firstly, at section 6.2, you will find an attempt by ICC ethics officer Sean Cleary to raise Clause 3 of the council's code of ethics which binds ICC board members to act as, amazing to say, ICC board members. Let the minutes record: \"Mr Srinivasan explained that he did not agree with that principle and that his position was that he was representing the BCCI.\" Singapore's Imran Khwaja, one of three Associate member representatives on the executive board, then pointed out the bleeding obvious, that \"this matter needed to be resolved one way or another in order to avoid directors technically being in perpetual breach of the Code of Ethics and for the ICC to be seen as a credible organisation and an effective Board\". And, of course, everyone then stepped delicately round the multi-billion-dollar elephant in the room.\n\nIn order to convey his point, Cleary rather bravely invoked examples of ethical failures at FIFA, the International Olympic Committee, and Union Cycliste Internationale: \"He emphasised that the current version of the Code of Ethics binds everybody, but that if it is flouted by all, then it becomes meaningless.\" Yet rather than an address what might be regarded as a pretty fundamental point, Srinivasan responded by calling on Cleary to investigate \"certain matters, which relate to the former Chief Executive, Mr Lorgat\".\n\nWhat this means, who is to say? Innuendo now swirls around Lorgat in much the same way as it did around Modi, with nobody showing much interest in clearing it up - not even journalists, happier these days to feed a swirl of rumour than do anything so vulgar as unearth a fact. Anyway, precisely nobody was prepared to point out the manifest absurdity of Srinivasan's position - the board member who openly scorned the code of ethics in his own case demanding that it be applied to someone else.\n\nSecondly, at section 9.3, ICC legal officer Iain Higgins attempts to lead a discussion of the FTP agreement, whereupon Srinivasan explains why the BCCI refused to sign it. Let the minutes record:\n\n\"Mr Srinivasan explained that the BCCI's position was that it wished to retain the right to unilaterally terminate the FTP Agreement: a/ in the event of certain financial or structural changes emanating from the implementation of certain recommendations from the Woolf Report; and b/ should it be required to use DRS in any bilateral matches. In the meantime he explained that the Indian national team would continue to play the fixtures in the FTP Schedule, but he noted that it was finding it difficult to continue the commitments because there are so many events in the calendar.\"\n\nWell that's jolly nice of them, then.\n\nIncidentally, although Modi is being a little cheeky posting these minutes online, there's really no reason for them not to be freely available. They concern matters of significance to every cricket fan, and contain no information that could be described as commercial-in-confidence. An administrative class that took transparency and accountability seriously would make all such deliberations public. We are in a day and age of whistles being blown left and right. Yet we know more about the internal policies of the US' super-secret National Security Agency - thanks to Ed Snowden - than we do about the attitudes and purposes of those who run cricket. So let's get it out there, shall we?\n\nThe BCCI represents itself at the ICC in open defiance of the council's code of ethics, and deigns to play other countries only in an unspecified \"meantime\", reserving the right to set the whole of international cricket at nought if anything should happen it doesn't like. If it won't acknowledge it publicly, then we should spread the word ourselves.\n\n****\n\nFor the moment, international cricket under the foregoing conditions quite suits the BCCI, preserving its freedom to reward those in favour, to punish those out of favour, and generally to intimidate the equivocal. Those favoured at the moment evidently include the West Indies Cricket Board, whose captain was among those who obligingly changed their vote on the ICC cricket committee away from Tim May of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations to Srinivasan's water carrier Laxman Sivaramakrishnan.\n\nIs the BCCI's long-term aim to prostrate an on-field rival, extending possibly to also levering CSA out of the Champions League? © Getty Images\n\nThe BCCI gave the WICB a nice fat tri-series three months ago; now the WICB has returned the compliment by volunteering to provide extras for The Tendulkar Show. NZC now also enjoys a crumb from the rich man's table, a truncated visit by India being not only confirmed but brought forward, now that its mettlesome chairman and ICC executive board member Chris Moller is about to depart.\n\nThe out of favour obviously include CSA, despite the fact that four years ago it was CSA that made possible IPL 2 at the 11th hour. The trouble was, of course, that this abetted the BCCI's previous regime, the Modi-Pawar-Bindra alliance, rather than the present mob, the Srinivasan-Dalmiya-Sundar Raman junta; given the latter's manicheanism, that probably constitutes giving aid and comfort to the enemy. (In the annals of cricket administration, by the way, the relocation of IPL 2 must now be eligible for some sort of hall of shame, given its legacies of crises and ill will at both CSA and the BCCI.)\n\nAs noted, CSA is acutely beholden to the BCCI. The members of its superb Test team are in their playing and earnings prime, and understandably eager to play in the IPL. The country's six professional franchises depend heavily on the BCCI-led Champions League, in which CSA, with Cricket Australia, is a minority shareholder. Rightly or wrongly, some in South Africa sense that the BCCI's long-term aim is to prostrate an on-field rival, perhaps also by levering CSA out of the Champions League and replacing it with the ECB, thereby pauperising South African first-class cricket. So while the wranglings of administrators can seem as remote to the everyday fan as supersonic fighters in the stratosphere, they are, under the influence of an over-mighty BCCI, forming part of a more worrisome pattern. And what happens when Srinivasan's unspecified \"meantime\" expires?\n\n****\n\nFrom your more militant apologist for Indian power in cricket, response to observations like the foregoing usually condenses to: well, tough luck; you ruled; now we rule. Yet this misunderstands the nature of the change in cricket's patterns of governance. In the hundred years and more that authority emanated from Lord's, cricket was run along the lines of an English public school, at least as defined by Lytton Strachey: anarchy tempered by despotism. Under the economic dominion of the BCCI, the world is converging on the opposite model: despotism tempered by anarchy, the anarchy coming mainly from within India itself. For the BCCI is an organisation with many more problems than are sometimes acknowledged - full of ambitious people pulling in different directions, operating in an uncertain political, commercial and legal environment, shaped by a turbo-boosted economy that has bestowed its benefits unevenly and whose impetus is currently faltering.\n\nAt an operational level, ironically, the BCCI is an increasingly impressive and efficient organisation, which probably deserves more credit for what it does and how it does it: allegations of player corruption in the IPL have been dealt with capably and expeditiously. At a governance level, however, it is an arena of self-advancement and self-aggrandisement.\n\nExternal fights the BCCI is inclined to pick, like the current feud with CSA, sometimes look like the phoney foreign war confected to distract from an American president's personal peccadillos in Wag the Dog. \"The president will be a hero,\" says the political fixer. \"He brought peace.\" Someone quibbles: \"But there was never a war.\" Explains the fixer: \"All the greater accomplishment.\"\n\nCertainly the BCCI annual meeting is being treated with outsized importance. Dalmiya has deferred consideration of the dispute with CSA until afterwards: \"What we will decide we will decide only after the AGM. We are very busy with our AGM at the moment.\" Hey, never let the triviality of competition between the world's two best cricket teams stand in the way of something really important, like a meeting of administrators! But if we accept the BCCI at its self-estimation, there is a logical conclusion to this, in which international cricket, especially Test cricket, dwindles independent of its relations with India.\n\nFor some time, there have been essentially two tiers of cricket: the tier involving India (significantly lucrative) and the tier that doesn't (where, with the exception of the Ashes, the rewards are so thin that Sri Lanka can hardly afford to play Test matches any longer, and Zimbabwe and Pakistan must play consecutively at the same venue). The latter can only weaken further; the former is ripe for rationalisation.\n\nOne of the most fascinating passages in Astill's book is an interview with BCCI vice-president Niranjan Shah, the board's longest-serving member, who runs cricket in the region of Saurashtra, thanks to a membership populated with friends, relatives and cronies that has not changed in 20 years. From his secure vantage point, Shah regards the cricket world simply as an irritation. Why does India have to send cricket teams abroad anyway? The IPL lights the way: all should come to India as supplicants.\n\nIn the years in which authority emanated from Lord's, cricket was run along the lines of an English public school: anarchy tempered by despotism. Under the economic dominion of the BCCI, it is despotism tempered by anarchy, the anarchy coming mainly from within India itself\n\nAt the moment we are getting money only when there is an international game. So I think IPL is the first step on this issue. Like in baseball, America is not worried whether other country is playing or not. Because cricket is a major game here, so we should not depend on whether England or South Africa come to India to get money… ICC is trying to control us. That's my feeling. Most of the other boards do not like that we make so much money and that their revenue depends on whether our team goes to play them. So the whole thing has been reversed. For cricket the only market in the world is India. The market is here. So we will control cricket, naturally.\n\nShah isn't exactly one of cricket's leading-edge thinkers, being remembered at the ICC for his fervent denunciations of T20 during Malcolm Speed's period as chief executive: he declared it an abomination to which India would never be reconciled. Yet Astill came away from their conversation with the feeling that Shah represented the BCCI's \"majority view\". This may or may not be true. What it more likely reflects is the prevalence of a view at the BCCI that the cricket world's only proper attitude to it is one of homage.\n\nFor the time being, as it negotiates a broadcast deal for the cycle of events beyond the 2015 World Cup, the ICC is relatively secure. But it is also in the throes of reviewing its group structure, specifically the use of the British Virgin Islands by its development arm, and its revenue-distribution model, including how it will handle the allocation of its next lot of rights monies. Late next year, too, an option is exercisable on the ICC's headquarters under which it can be \"put\" back to the building's developers, Dubai Sports City.\n\nThe council could emerge from the process a very different-looking entity, most likely a smaller one, relocated to somewhere like Singapore and reduced to a kind of provider of auxiliary services, although still available to blame when things go wrong. Such a step would be unobjectionable to most cricket publics, who identify the council mainly with fiascos - overlong tournaments, unintelligible playing conditions, the DRS passim.\n\nThat would leave the way open to a long-awaited extension of the IPL season. In the IPL, the BCCI created a mighty sporting product that was also a rod for its own back. The league in its original specifications and duration was only a marginal commercial proposition for franchisees: why invest in a sporting brand name in order to leave it inactive for nine or ten months of the year? As soon as private capital entered cricket, the rules were different - its impact has simply been deferred, not avoided. The one thing of which we can be fairly certain is that the interests of cricket will be the least concern of anyone with influence over the decision. The predominant motivations will be individual ambition, commercial advantage and potential political gain, and by the time we're told what has happened, there will be nothing to do about it.\n\nGideon Haigh is a cricket historian and writer\n\n© ESPN Sports Media Ltd.",

A more grounded approach might look at a range of factors, from a country’s energy mix to its democracy.\n\nThat’s what a new report from investment advisors RobecoSAM does, and the results are quite different from the standard narrative.

That would be Nigeria, in 59th place, despite all that oil.\n\nThe factors include environmental (which accounts for 15% of scores, and includes things like renewable energy and emissions), social (25%; e.g. life expectancy, and level of worker unrest), and governance (60%; e.g. corruption and inequality). The aim: to provide a comprehensive picture of a “country’s ability to safeguard the needs of its future generations.”\n\nAustralia (which does better for governance than environmental factors), Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, and the U.K. come next. The U.S. is in ninth place, scoring solidly in most categories, though lower relatively on the environment.\n\nSweden scores well across most of the criteria, including “use of renewable energy sources and CO2 emissions,” on factors like “labor participation, education, and income inequality,” and governance. Above, you can see how it lines up against Russia, which comes in 55th, just above Indonesia, Venezuela, Egypt, and Nigeria.

This week, Bond goes to space and jumps the shark in Moonraker.\n\nDuring the credits of The Spy Who Loved Me, on-screen text proclaimed that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only. However, that same year, Star Wars changed the rules and made extravagant sci-fi into box office gold. With that in mind, Albert R Broccoli opted to change plans and produce a film with sci-fi inflections, inspired by Fleming’s celestially titled novel Moonraker.\n\nRoger Moore returned to play Bond and the regular MI6 roster also came back to the fold.

It features a jaw-dropping action set piece in which Bond is pushed from a plane by Jaws, managing to grab another henchman’s parachute from his back in mid-air.\n\nHowever, as with so much of Moonraker, this moment of quality action is marred by an awkward comedy beat seconds later as Jaws crashes into the big top of a circus. And then, after Shirley Bassey’s incredibly forgotten theme tune, the film itself begins…\n\nBond is despatched to investigate the apparent theft of a space shuttle. He is soon drawn to Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), who appears to have taken the shuttle for his own bizarre plan to rejuvenate the human race. With CIA agent Dr Goodhead (Lois Chiles) alongside him, Bond must track Drax all the way to a space station orbiting the Earth.\n\n\"You persist in defying my efforts to provide an amusing death for you.\"\n\nMoonraker never really gets going, hamstrung by a plot that seems more concerned with jamming in multiple locations than constructing a coherent narrative. The best Bond films are those in which the plot continuously propels Bond around the world, being led by pursuit of the villain or the clues they leave behind. In Moonraker, there’s no impetus and no momentum.\n\nIt’s not the fault of the villain. Lonsdale’s Drax is an interesting and intelligent bad guy, with an impressively malevolent physical appearance and an aptitude for one-liners that rivals Moore himself. In a better film, he could’ve been amongst the best of the Bond villains. Even Jaws, so impressive in The Spy Who Loved Me, is wasted here and loses all of his potential as a threat. By the time he picks up a love interest out of nowhere and allies himself with Bond, he’s like a neutered animal wearing a muzzle.\n\nScreenwriter Christopher Wood, who co-wrote the previous film with long-time Bond writer Richard Maibaum, gives short shrift to Lois Chiles as the utterly ludicrously named Dr Holly Goodhead, who is nominally Moonraker’s female lead. Immediately following the brilliant Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me, Goodhead is written as a woman completely in thrall to Bond’s sexual potency and without any agency at all. It’s as if, forced to throw a film together, they simply reverted to the sexist Bond formula.\n\nEclipsed by silliness\n\nAny issues with the characters, however, are minor quibbles in comparison to Moonraker’s biggest flaw – its mind-blowing stupidity. Desperate to mimic the success of Star Wars, the film shoots its protagonists into space and decides to have them fire lasers at each other, seemingly unaware of how ridiculous that feels outside of a sci-fi context. It’s no coincidence that many aspects of this finale formed the third act of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n\nThe Moore era of Bond was always goofy and that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing by default. In the case of Moonraker, though, the goofiness is turned up to eleven and the spy thrills are pushed into second place. Jaws is a comedy character, every other Bond line is a double entendre and the central villainous plot is the work of nonsense.\n\n\"His name is Jaws. He kills people.\"\n\nAlmost worse than the silliness, though, is the fact that Moonraker is, for most of its running time, offensively dull. Moore, so alive in The Spy Who Loved Me, completely phones it in here, looking too old for the role and devoid of any of the effervescent energy that made his earlier films so entertaining. The fact that Goodhead is more of a thumbnail sketch than a character doesn’t help.\n\nMoonraker was a dud long before it left Earth’s atmosphere, but by the end, it feels more like an insult to the audience’s intelligence than anything else. It is certainly the worst film of Roger Moore’s tenure as Bond and could be the low point of the entire franchise.\n\nCritical orbit\n\nIn order to send Bond into space and mimic Lucas’ blockbuster space opera, Eon stumped up an enormous budget twice the size of the previous film and four times that of The Man with the Golden Gun. The box office returns paid dividends, though, with Moonraker breaking the franchise record set by its predecessor with a worldwide haul of $210m.\n\nCritics were divided straight down the middle on the film. Vincent Canby, of the New York Times, gave Moonraker a wildly positive assessment and later called the film the franchise’s best, alongside Goldfinger. Frank Rich described the film as “irresistibly entertaining” in his Time magazine review and James Monaco called it a “minor masterpiece” in The Connoisseur’s Guide to the Movies.\n\nOthers were more critical of the film’s extravagances, with MSN Movies ranking it as the fourth worst movie in the entire series. Danny Peary, in Guide for the Film Fanatic, described Moonraker as the “worst James Bond film to date”, noting that there’s “little suspense and the humour falls flat”. I know which side of the critical coin I’m on.\n\n\"I don’t know if I trust you either. That’s what makes it more exciting, doesn’t it?\"\n\nFor me, the critical division over Moonraker is an odd one given the film’s obvious deficiencies and glacial pacing. Roger Moore looks thoroughly bored and the final hour is utterly ludicrous in the worst way. It may not quite be the worst Bond movie but, made almost solely to capitalise on the Star Wars phenomenon, Moonraker is certainly the one that feels the most cynical.\n\nNext time, Bond returns to his grittier roots in For Your Eyes Only.\n\nWhat do you think of Moonraker? Does it mark a low point in the Bond franchise, or do you enjoy its comedy flavour? Let me know in the comments section and keep your eyes peeled for an early new Bond Reloaded this week.\n\nYou can read my look back at The Spy Who Loved Me here and find other Bond Reloaded articles here.",
  "latent_3858": "Ever since Slashbot hit the blogosphere and Youtube a lot of people have been asking questions about the project. We have especially loved reading the comments on Youtube, very entertaining. Below are responses to some general questions we have received. If you have more questions, we’d love to hear them. Just leave a comment!\n\nHow does Slashbot work?\n\nThere is a post in the blog that describes our approach but the concept is as follows. The “notes” to be played are the brightest images on the screen. This means we can look at a black and white (actually grayscale) version of the video and observe “notes” very easily. The brightness of a pixel is defined by a voltage between 0V(black) and 1V(white). By using NI LabVIEW to observe the waveform of the video signal, we monitor specific pixels on an individual line of video. When a “note” crosses that line, we see a spike in the signal’s voltage. Depending on where the spike occurred in the waveform, we can determine which note needs to be played by the robot.\n\nHow long did it take to make Slashbot\n\nThis was a semester long project that began in January 2008. Our team would work on Slashbot two days a week for about 4-5 hours each day. We had a working design after a couple months. We then spent a month tweaking and improving the overall design and performance. So in all, it took about three months from design proposal to fully functioning.\n\nWhy use the robot to press the buttons? Wouldn’t it be better to wire a signal directly to the controller’s electronics? You could probably achieve 100% that way.\n\nThis is a valid question. From a purely performance standpoint, wiring control signals directly to the game would likely have improved the system’s accuracy. However, there are already existing solutions that implement this approach. It was very important for us to create a system without hacking the game controller. We wanted our robot to have a human element to it. By physically seeing the buttons being pressed, someone watching could more easily relate to Slashbot. We wanted to blur the lines between man and machine. Plus, it is REALLY cool to see the actuators firing at break-neck (or “break-guitar”) speed!\n\nCan you make it play “Through the Fire and Flames” on Expert?\n\nThis is by far the most common request. For those unfamiliar with Guitar Hero 3, “Through the Fire and Flames” by DragonForce is notoriously the game’s most challenging song. It is extremely fast and includes intricate solos lasting several minutes.\n\nTo answer the question, YES! We can make Slashbot play TTFAF and have done so. At our project demonstration day at Texas A&M a worthy challenger played against Slashbot. The robot finished with 68%.\n\nSo what’s the problem? Many have speculated that the actuators would not be fast enough to react to the incredible speed of the song, but this is not the case. The problem lies in the “note” detection software. Our algorithm currently has difficult differentiating between long strings of the same colored note and the long bar that appears for held notes. For the long strings of notes, Slashbot will strum on just the first note because the video signal is very similar to that of a held note. We are working to improve this.\n\nCan Slashbot use Star Power or the whammy bar?\n\nSlashbot does use Star Power. The game allows two ways to activate Star Power, by lifting the neck of the guitar or by pressing the “Select” button. We have mounted an actuator above the “Select” button. Its fires roughly every 10 seconds. There is no effect from pressing “Select” unless Star Power is available. As for whammy, we have the software implemented to handle it, but have yet to attach a motor to move the bar. We may eventually add this feature.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Slashbot?\n\nThe main purpose of Slashbot was to complete our requirements for our Electrical and Computer Engineering degrees. That has been accomplished. We have been asked to demonstrate Slashbot at some public appearances, details TBD. We may make some improvements and will post any news here on the blog.",

  "latent_4196": "TORONTO – The case against two former top political aides in Ontario accused of illegally destroying emails in the premier’s office took a serious blow Thursday when the judge ruled a key prosecution witness could not testify as an expert.\n\nThe witness, a former provincial police officer, was simply too close to investigators and the investigation known as Project Hampden to offer impartial evidence as legally required, Ontario court Judge Timothy Lipson ruled.\n\nLipson noted Robert (Bob) Gagnon, a retired police computer specialist, was integrally involved in investigating and prosecuting David Livingston and Laura Miller, even at one point suggesting one of the three charges laid against them. The pair has pleaded not guilty.\n\nREAD MORE: Defence attacks bias of key ‘expert’ Crown witness at Ontario gas plants trial\n\n“There really was no separation between the work of Mr. Gagnon and that of the Project Hampden investigators,” Lipson said. “Over time, he became an important member of the Project Hampden team.”\n\nThe prosecution had wanted Gagnon to testify as an expert witness against Livingston and Miller, chief of staff and deputy to former Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty. As an expert, he could have offered the court his opinion on what he discovered.\n\nBut the defence said he didn’t meet the test of independence, impartiality and freedom from bias. It cited his extensive involvement in the probe virtually from the start, when investigators set him up with a separate computer forensics laboratory at provincial police headquarters.\n\nThe separate facility, Lipson said, was an appropriate step, but turned out to be the “only one.” Gagnon’s involvement “expanded rapidly over time” to the point where he became an important resource for the investigative team, the judge said.\n\nHis lack of independence and impartiality, the judge said, was thrown into stark relief in an email to his colleagues in February 2015, when he suggested laying a mischief charge against the accused.\n\n“Livingston was leaving public service but had to protect his reputation and that of the party for any future employment elsewhere and the parties (sic) future election,” Gagnon wrote in the email. “Based on the above, an additional charge of mischief in relation to data would meet the test.”\n\nLipson noted the law on expert evidence has seen a “dramatic evolution” since a Supreme Court of Canada ruling in 2015. The courts, he said, have come to recognize the potential for “egregious miscarriages of justice” based on faulty expert witness testimony.\n\nIn particular, the judge said, expert police witnesses attract heightened scrutiny about their independence, and Gagnon, although officially retired since 2009, was essentially acting as a police officer during the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: Defence attacks bias of key ‘expert’ Crown witness at Ontario gas plants trial\n\nWhile he said he had no doubt about Gagnon’s sincerity or good intentions, his long, ongoing involvement – taking part in numerous case conferences with officers and prosecutors and providing legal and strategic advice – simply raised too many concerns about his impartiality.\n\n“I agree with the defence submission that the evidence shows Mr. Gagnon has conflated the roles of expert and investigator,” Lipson said in a ruling that ran to 16 pages and took an hour to read.\n\nFollowing his ruling, Lipson called a break to allow the two sides time to consider next steps. Prosecution lawyer Tom Lemon told Lipson it was too soon to determine the impact of the Gagnon ruling, but said he planned to start with another witness.\n\nFri, Sep 22: Two senior aides to former Premier Dalton McGuinty are accused of acting illegally in the deletion of computer hard drives. Alan Carter has more.\n\nLemon had previously told court there would be unspecified “consequences” if Gagnon was excluded as an expert.\n\nLater Thursday, Linda Jackson, retired chief administrative officer for cabinet office, testified how Livingston, as he prepared to leave the premier’s office in late January 2013, requested administrative computer rights for one of his employees. Such rights would essentially give a person free run of a computer.\n\nA month earlier, cabinet office decided individual email accounts in the premier’s office would be frozen rather than deleted after the person departed given numerous pending access requests for information in the two offices.\n\nLivingston and Miller are accused of destroying emails related to the politically explosive cancellation of two gas plants near Toronto before the 2011 provincial election. Both had previously pleaded not guilty to the three charges they face: breach of trust, unlawful use of a computer, and mischief.",

Stanton.\n\nBaptiste lived in Huntsville in 2011 and was acquainted with Ralph Swinehart, who along with his father, Ronald Swinehart, also lived in Huntsville, according to the indictment and statement. Ronald Swinehart was a retired employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and had a retirement savings account through the company. The retirement account was held at ING Institutional Plan Services, according to the statement.\n\nIn September 2011, Ronald Swinehart signed and executed a durable power of attorney naming his son Ralph Swinehart as his agent. Ronald Swinehart died on Oct. 11, 2011. His son died on Oct. 23, 2011, according to the statement.\n\nBaptiste filed a fraudulent power of attorney in Madison County Probate Court in October appointing himself as Ronald Swinehart's agent, according to the indictment. In December 2011, Baptiste opened two commercial accounts, which he controlled, in the name of Swinehart Investment Solutions at BBVA Compass Bank. Baptiste also changed the beneficiary designation on Ronald Swinehart's retirement account from Ralph Swinehart to himself, according to the indictment.\n\nBaptiste then changed the bank account information on Ronald Swinehart's retirement account, directing any distributions to be made to one of the BBVA accounts.\n\nBaptiste committed four counts of wire fraud when he directed four transfers, totaling $545,669, from the retirement account to a BBVA account, the indictment charges, according to the statement.\n\nBaptiste committed aggravated identity theft when he used Ronald Swinehart's name, Social Security number and address, to conduct the wire fraud, according to the indictment.\n\nBaptiste committed mail fraud when, on Dec. 9, 2011, he mailed to ING a package containing a fraudulent \"spousal consent form,\" required for making withdrawals from the ING retirement account, the indictment charges. The form purported to bear Ronald Swinehart's signature and noted that his wife, Rosalie Swinehart, was deceased.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Baptiste laundered money as follows:\n\nOn Dec. 28, 2011, he withdrew $496,085 from the BBVA account he had directed the retirement funds into, then deposited $375,000 into a new account he opened at BBVA in the name of Baptiste Inc. On Jan. 27, 2012, Baptiste drew a $225,000 check to \"cash\" on the new BBVA account, and three days later opened a \"Baptiste Inc.\" account at Regions Bank and deposited into it a $225,000 BBVA cashier's check.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2012, according to the indictment, Baptiste withdrew $225,000 from the Regions account.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney's Manu Balachandran and John B.

Four days later, he said, Beckow returned and was again seen viewing pornography online.\n\nOn Wednesday, police obtained a warrant and arrested Beckow at his home on the 200 block of West Burlington Avenue. Court filings allege three adults witnessed the activity and were \"alarmed and disturbed.\"\n\nIn a police interview, Beckow admitted using library computers to look at pornography, Thompson said.\n\nLibrary officials said they have a written policy against viewing such materials because children may be present.\n\n\"We try to create a safe space for children, and obviously we're going to pay attention,\" library Director Christine Kuhn said.\n\nThompson said police previously arrested a man for viewing child pornography at the library, but it was several years ago. In an unrelated case, a 58-year-old sex offender was charged with looking at child pornography in July at the Bloomingdale Public Library.\n\nBeckow, who returns to court Oct. 28, remained in custody Thursday after DuPage County Judge Elizabeth Sexton set bail at $15,000. The most serious charge against him is a Class A misdemeanor.",
  "latent_4490": "Sevdha (\"Sev,\" \"Seva,\" \"Sevy\") is a professional dance artist (especially known for belly dance and Bollywood dancing) and also a musician and artist (graphic artist, painter, and more). She is from Jamaica and was recognized as Miss Jamaica IC 2012. Sevdha has performed all over the United States and internationally. She has received a lot of press for appearing onwith a story of \"nerd to belly dancer.\" Sevdha has also directed a group affectionately known as the \"geek belly dancers\" who would do anime/video game-related performances at conventions across the U.S. Visit Sevhda's website for more details on this multi-talented artist.\n\n1. As you were growing up, what forms of artistic expression became important to you?\n\nIf I were to pinpoint the one form of artistic expression that was of most importance in my younger days, it would have to be the violin.\n\nBack then, particularly in my preteen years, I was associated with playing the violin as much as I am associated with dancing today. The violin was my solace during those typical trying times of teenagedom, and I'd admit to have been pretty darn good at it!\n\n2. What styles of dance have influenced your work as a dancer, and what are some elements that distinguish your work from that of other dancers/choreographers?\n\nIndian, and Indo-Caribbean dance styles have influenced my work greatly, so much so that I've created a style that I refer to as \"Chutney-fusion bellydancing,\" which is a nod to my Indo-Caribbean roots. Others include hip hop & pop n' locking, Moroccan Guedra, traditional Japanese dance (NihonBuyo), and more. My group and I were also the only group to specialize in performing belly dance to fan-requested video-game and anime music (and sometimes incorporating cosplay) at conventions all over the nation.\n\n3. Could you talk a little bit about your work as a musician and how your knowledge of music informs your other projects?\n\nI started working with music production far before it became a necessity for me to edit my own music for dance performances. When I was a young teen, I'd compose what I'd refer to as modern Classical music that I'd then make into midis. Shortly after, when I started dancing, I began to teach myself how to remix the music that I'd perform to, and eventually started making music altogether. This knowledge is terribly useful, as I'm in constant need of editing/creating music for my performances and other artistic endevors.\n\n4. What have you been working on most recently in terms of your visual artwork?\n\nRecently, I've been working on traditional animation--an extremely taxing pursuit, I'd be the first to admit. Other than that, I have been practicing my usual semi-realistic art style, and I've also been working on fantasy photo manipulations along with designing laptop and video game covers.\n\n5. As an artist who works in different modes, from dance to music to art, do you find that your different projects often intersect, or are they sometimes very separate from each other?\n\nBoth.\n\nAll modes of art in my case are oftentimes interconnected. For example, my music influences my dance and vice-versa. I also find that it is easier to think up melodies when I am drawing.\n\nOn that note, we have a weekly web show in progress that will also serve to make use of our different modes of artistic abilities (and by we, I am referring to my absolutely talented and awesome dance partner, Ilia, and our quirky cast of friends and entertainers). In it, we'll be taking audience requests to perform on-the-spot belly dancing to anything but traditional belly dancing music. Techno, rock, even Classical... you name it.\n\nThanks, Sevdha!",

Although Obama has insisted that the orders fall within his legal powers, he is sure to encounter resistance from Congress, which he is bypassing.\n\nA centerpiece of Obama's plan is to place more restrictions on sales by unlicensed dealers, particularly those who sell firearms at gun shows and online. Under the new rules, anyone engaged in the business of selling guns must obtain a federal seller's license and check the backgrounds of all buyers. The measure seeks to distinguish between hobbyists and collectors and for-profit traders who've managed to avoid stringent regulation.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you conduct your business — from a store, at gun shows or over the Internet. If you're in the business of selling firearms, you must get a license and conduct background checks,\" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said Monday.\n\nThe Obama administration outlined the proposed orders for the press Monday evening, but Obama will announced them publicly in a Tuesday morning speech in which he is expected to be backed by people who lost relatives in mass shootings.\n\nThe initiative also includes the hiring of hundreds of additional examiners to help the FBI conduct the added background checks. It also requires gun dealers to notify the ATF when their guns are lost or stolen.\n\nThe point of all of this, administration officials said, is to keep more guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.",

Christopher Salladin, 22, of Fernandina, Florida has been hired as a coin grader by Numismatic Guaranty Corporation, PNG’s official grading service.\n\n“When NGC offered me a full-time position grading I couldn’t even comprehend it. It was even harder for me to think I’d be sitting in the same room with industry leaders everyday! I had to take a few days to realize what an excellent opportunity it was and has turned out to be,” Salladin said.\n\nThe PNG internship project is designed to provide education, training and mentoring for the next generation of coin and banknote dealers. Each successful applicant has the opportunity for a series of four, three-month-long salaried internships.\n\nThere currently are five PNG member-dealer companies mentoring PNG interns: Harlan J. Berk, Ltd. in Chicago, Illinois; Dillon Gage in Dallas, Texas; Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas; Numismatic Guaranty Corporation in Sarasota, Florida; and Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Irvine, California.\n\n“The early success of this new mentoring program is exciting! We already now have two former PNG interns working as full-time, professional numismatists. Four other young adults currently are in the mentoring program or soon will be starting their internship rotations at leading numismatic companies across the country,” explained Carol Raia, Administrator of the PNG Promoting Numismatic Growth program.\n\n“Applications are encouraged and being accepted from all other prospective professional numismatists, ages 21 to 32, who want to participate in the program,” Raia said.\n\nSpecific information about the internship program and how to apply is available online at www.PNGdealers.org under the “Promoting Numismatic Growth” navigation links near the top of the PNG’s home page. For additional information, contact the PNG by phone at (951) 587-8300 or by email at internship@PNGdealers.org.\n\nSalladin said he is grateful for the opportunity PNG provided for him to become a full-time numismatist, and he encourages others to apply for the program.\n\n“One of the first reactions I had to the program was that the age range was so broad. I had no idea the PNG would choose someone as young as me when the oldest to be considered is 32. This experience has been the perfect opportunity for me, and if it weren’t for my Dad telling me, ‘Just go for it”, I wouldn’t have. My parents are the main reason I’ve come so far over the years,” Salladin stated.\n\n“My advice to young adults is to learn as much as you can about numismatics and don’t be afraid to make mistakes along the way. If you are thinking about applying and are hesitant, don’t be because the PNG internship program can make the impossible happen. What you learn in the online courses and the book work is very informative, and (PNG Internship Administrator) Carol Raia will help you if you have any questions or concerns throughout the entire program,” he explained.\n\nSalladin was hired full-time by NGC only a few weeks into his initial internship rotation.\n\n“Numismatic Guaranty Corporation is proud to be partnering with the Professional Numismatists Guild in their Promoting Numismatic Growth initiative. Through this internship program, the PNG is introducing the brightest and most enthusiastic young men and women to the professional numismatic community. In turn, NGC and others involved in this program are introduced to highly qualified, astute numismatists,” said NGC President Rick Montgomery.\n\n“We are very fortunate to have hired our first candidate in the Promoting Numismatic Growth program, Christopher Salladin. After several weeks in our grading departments, it became clear that he was a young numismatist with a very keen eye. Christopher has a strong appreciation for modern Chinese coins and we discovered that he could also bring his grading acumen into the modern US grading room. We could not be more pleased that he has joined the NGC grading team and we look forward to a long and thriving relationship,” emphasized Montgomery.\n\nThis past March, Zeke Wischer, 22, of Abilene, Kansas was hired as a cataloger at Heritage Auctions where he started his PNG internship program a month earlier.\n\nFounded in 1955, the Professional Numismatists Guild is composed of many of the country’s top rare coin and paper money dealers. PNG member-dealers must adhere to a strict code of ethics in the buying and selling of numismatic merchandise.

  "latent_4643": "SAN JOSE — When the new Silicon Valley patent and trademark office was proposed 1½ years ago, it was hailed by politicians and business leaders as a blessing for local entrepreneurs and inventors. But so far, the project seems more like a curse for taxpayers.\n\nWith construction set to begin Friday at San Jose City Hall, officials revealed that the total cost of the project is now pegged at $18.2 million, triple the original estimate. And its opening has been delayed — again.\n\nThe good news for the city of San Jose is that the federal government is picking up most of the increased portion of the tab. The City Council is set to approve the inflated budget and longer timeline on Tuesday, the second major cost increase and delay to the project in as many years.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office chose San Jose for one of four new outposts in late 2013 after four years of lobbying from local leaders. At the time, officials said the cost to retrofit a partly empty portion of the downtown City Hall wing along Fourth Street would be about $6 million. Last year, the cost jumped to more than $10 million when it was revealed that most city employees in the wing would need to be moved across the plaza to the main 18-story City Hall tower, adding significant relocation costs.\n\nNow, with the design completed, it turns out even those higher estimates undershot the price tag.\n\nBarry Ng, the city’s interim public works director, said there were “some very distinct design challenges” to build a specialty office for more than 100 patent examiners and judges, along with space for the public. Even though City Hall is less than a decade old, the majority of the space being used for the patent office is just a shell with only walls, ceilings and floors.\n\nAdditionally, the task of relocating city departments is more complicated than first thought, requiring more heavy construction.\n\n“A lot of the costs started to creep in, and creep up,” Ng said.\n\nCity officials stress that they still forecast making all their money back in seven years through rent payments from the USPTO leasing 35,200 square feet of space; and if the agency decides to stay longer, the city has a chance to make money off the deal. Local leaders continue to tout the economic benefits of having their first permanent patent and trademark office, an upgrade from the current temporary Menlo Park location or the need to fly to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a brief statement, the USPTO said only that it “had to keep track of shifting real estate pricing, and other market realities, which have impacted the cost and time of setting up our new permanent space.”\n\nThe city has allocated $850,000 from higher-than-expected revenues during the economic resurgence to cover its share of the latest cost increase, while the USPTO will fund the rest, though it did not say how. The feds are paying for the actual $12.7 million satellite office while the city is footing the $5.5 million cost to relocate its employees. At the same time, the timeline for the project — delayed during the federal sequester years ago and then again last year — has been pushed back another two months, with an opening now set for October. Ng said the design changes contributed to the late start and said construction will still fit into a “very tight schedule.”\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2011 had announced plans for four satellite offices, which had been set for Detroit, Dallas, Denver and somewhere between San Jose and Mountain View. Although it’s unclear if any other local city offered subsidies to get the office, San Jose officials said they kicked in extra money because they were worried about losing the hub to a neighbor.\n\nThe City Council, which has previously been united in its support for the patent outpost, is expected to approve the plans on Tuesday after public works officials previously agreed to the added costs. The contractor, Turner Construction, is already set up at the site and has spent weeks preparing for the job.\n\nContact Mike Rosenberg at 408-920-5705. Follow him at Twitter.com/RosenbergMerc.",
  "latent_4652": "• Lack of share market liquidity and funds shortfall to blame • Initiative in 2010 aimed to give supporters stake in team\n\nArsenal’s pioneering Fanshare scheme, lauded by the government as an example to other Premier League sides as a means of giving supporters a stake in their team, is set to close after the club withdrew its backing.\n\nThe scheme was launched in August 2010 by the Arsenal Supporters’ Trust with the vocal backing of the club’s chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, as a vehicle for fans to buy part shares in Arsenal.\n\nMore than 1,800 members have invested almost £2m in the scheme, which gave fans the rights that came with share ownership, including the ability to attend the Arsenal annual meeting, pose questions on club finances and vote on policy.\n\nBut, as explained in a letter to members who have bought a total of 116 shares, it has struck two insurmountable issues that the majority owner, Stan Kroenke, has been unwilling to explore solutions to.\n\n“The scheme has faced two major problems: a lack of liquidity in the share market and a shortfall in funding,” it said.\n\nWhen the scheme was set up, it was assumed that shares would be readily available to buy and that Fanshare could be widely promoted and marketed. During the first year of operation Arsenal ran adverts in the Emirates and promoted the scheme in its annual membership pack.\n\nThe idea was that the scheme would become self-sufficient through a 2% fee levied on contributions. But after the takeover of the club by the American Kroenke in a £731m deal in 2011, almost all of Arsenal’s shares were concentrated in the hands of two shareholders. Kroenke holds 67% and Alisher Usmanov’s Red & White Holdings has 30%.\n\n“As a result of both the takeover by KSE, and the subsequent buying of shares by Red & White, it has not been possible to develop the scheme in the way that was initially envisaged,” says the letter.\n\n“The Fanshare board has on several occasions asked the Arsenal board to consider options for the placement of new shares to the scheme (including the idea of a specific offer of 125 shares on Arsenal’s 125th anniversary). While this was initially favourably received it has subsequently been ruled out.”\n\nWith hardly any shares available on the open market and Kroenke unwilling to consider a placement of new shares, the original idea of funding it through a levy on new purchases has hit the buffers.\n\nIn the absence of other options, the Fanshare board is reluctantly looking into how the scheme might be wound down.\n\nFanshare was launched against the backdrop of a loud debate about the role of fans in running their clubs in the wake of the Portsmouth meltdown, the Liverpool high court case and the green and gold protests at Old Trafford.\n\nAll the political parties made commitments in their 2010 general election manifestos to exploring new ways to give fans more of a voice and specific ways of allowing them to take a stake.\n\nThe Fanshare model was seized upon by government as a potential way forward, because it allowed fans to invest as little as £10 a month and yet enabled them to effectively have the same basic rights as other shareholders.\n\n“It is part of the coalition agreement to encourage supporters to have more representation at their clubs,” said Hugh Robertson, the sports minister at the time.\n\n“Arsenal’s proposal is an enlightened and forward looking way of doing this and makes it affordable for their fans to own a part of their club. Clearly it is for individual clubs to decide, but this is a model I’d like to see other teams explore.”\n\nDuring a subsequent select committee inquiry into football governance, it was held aloft as a beacon for other Premier League clubs to follow.\n\nWhen the scheme was launched Gazidis was effusive in his backing for it. “We believe it is fundamentally helpful to the club to have supporters who are active and engaged,” he said at the time. “The important thing is that supporters are valued and nurtured, not exploited. That is good for the club’s soul, and for its all-round health.”\n\nSome Arsenal supporters’ groups fear that the move is symptomatic of Kroenke’s wider attitude to fan engagement. In his offer letter he said he “fully expects himself, the Arsenal directors and club executives to continue to engage with supporters for the long-term good of the club”.\n\nAt the time of the takeover the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said of Kroenke that he “had heard very positive noises that he is very supportive of fan involvement,” and urged him to run the club as a “community asset”.\n\nBut although Gazidis has continued to be proactive in meeting fans’ groups, fans say that no meeting with Kroenke has ever been arranged.\n\nAn Arsenal spokesman said that when they launched the scheme the Fanshare board had asked for financial support for a three-year period and the club had subsequently extended that for another year.\n\n“It has always been the understanding that the scheme would need to become self-sufficient at some point and in the absence of indefinite outside funding the Fanshare board has made the decision to consider closing down the scheme,” he said.\n\n“We will continue to maintain ongoing dialogue with our supporters through numerous forums. It is an important part of how we run the club.”\n\nKevin Rye of Supporters Direct, the body that helps and advises supporters on setting up trusts, said of the decision: “As has happened before, the potential positive effects of supporter involvement in the ownership of a football club have been sacrificed because of the particular circumstances at the club in question.\n\n“The type of positive role that fans have played at clubs like Swansea City is something that we believe must become the norm, and we are convinced that this can only happen through proper rules enforced by a proper regulator.”\n\nThe government has promised to convene an “expert group” with Supporters Direct by the end of the month, looking into removing practical obstacles and setting up supporters trusts.",

  "latent_4801": "Federal authorities are investigating whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange violated criminal laws in the group's release of government documents, including possible charges under the Espionage Act, sources familiar with the inquiry said Monday.\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the Justice Department and Pentagon are conducting \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation.'' Others familiar with the probe said the FBI is examining everyone who came into possession of the documents, including those who gave the materials to WikiLeaks and also the organization itself. No charges are imminent, the sources said, and it is unclear whether any will be brought.\n\nFormer prosecutors cautioned that prosecutions involving leaked classified information are difficult because the Espionage Act is a 1917 statute that preceded Supreme Court cases that expanded First Amendment protections. The government also would have to persuade another country to turn over Assange, who is outside the United States.\n\nBut the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is rapidly unfolding, said charges could be filed under the act. The U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria - which in 2005 brought Espionage Act charges, now dropped, against two former pro-Israel lobbyists - is involved in the effort, the sources said.\n\nThe Pentagon is leading the investigation and it remains unclear whether any additional charges would be brought in the military or civilian justice systems. Pfc. Bradley Manning, an Army intelligence analyst suspected of being the source of the WikiLeaks documents, was arrested by the military this year.\n\nHolder was asked Monday how the United States could prosecute Assange, who is an Australian citizen. \"Let me be very clear,\" he replied. \"It is not saber rattling.\n\n\"To the extent there are gaps in our laws,\" Holder continued, \"we will move to close those gaps, which is not to say . . . that anybody at this point, because of their citizenship or their residence, is not a target or a subject of an investigation that's ongoing.\" He did not indicate that Assange is being investigated for possible violations of the Espionage Act.\n\nAlthough the Justice Department has taken the position that media organizations could be prosecuted for printing leaked classified information under the legislation, that prospect is unlikely because of official aversion to running afoul of the First Amendment, experts said. Indeed, the Justice Department has never brought such a case, they said.\n\n\"Whenever you're talking about a media organization, the department is going to look very closely to ensure that any prosecution doesn't undermine the valid First Amendment functioning of the press,\" said Kenneth Wainstein, former assistant attorney general in the national security division.\n\nBut when it comes to Assange, Jeffrey H. Smith, a former CIA general counsel, said: \"I'm confident that the Justice Department is figuring out how to prosecute him.\"\n\nSmith noted that State Department general counsel Harold H.

  "latent_4931": "A BAT and a ball cost $1.10 between them. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does each cost? By paying attention to how people actually think, behavioural economics has qualified some of the underlying assumptions of classical economics, notably that everyone is perfectly rational. In fact, the mind plays tricks, dividing up $1.10 (in this example) neatly into $1 and 10 cents, rather than correctly into $1.05 and 5 cents. People also tend to copy others and often prefer to co-operate rather than compete. For these reasons, some of the simplifying assumptions of economics are not always correct: people do not act in every instance in their long-term self-interest; they do not weigh up all the costs and benefits before taking a decision.\n\nMany of the insights of behavioural economics were based on studies of American university students and other privileged folk. But they apply with greater force to the poor—both the poor in rich countries and the more numerous inhabitants of developing ones. Behavioural economics therefore has profound implications for development. The new “World Development Report”, the flagship publication of the World Bank, considers them.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nAs the report shows, the poor are more likely than other people to make bad economic decisions. This is not because they are irrational or foolish but because so much is stacked against them. They are more likely to lack the basic information needed to make good choices, such as which fertiliser to use or when to apply it. They are more likely to live in societies which hold mistaken or harmful views, such as that girls should not go to school.\n\nConventional economic thinking assumes the poor will want to earn their way out of poverty. But as studies from countries as different as Ethiopia and France show, poverty makes people feel powerless and blunts their aspirations, so they may not even try to improve their lot. When they do, they face obstacles everywhere. They have no margin for error, making them risk averse. If they do not know where their next meal is coming from, saving and investing for the future is hard. George Orwell said, “Within certain limits, the less money you have the less you worry.” He was wrong. The poor are subject to exceptional levels of stress: childhood sickness is more likely to be life-threatening; crop failure can lead to destitution. And stress makes good decision-making harder. Above all, the poor lack the institutional framework which, in the West, improves decisions. Everywhere, people underestimate the benefits of education and save too little for their retirement. But children in the West go to school as a matter of course; pension systems make some savings automatic. Poor countries provide few such props.\n\nAll this helps explain why the poor stay poor; why (for example) subsistence farmers do not buy fertiliser or put children into secondary school, though they would benefit from doing so. More important, though, behavioural economics provides a different way of thinking about some of the problems of poverty.\n\nTraditional development programmes stress resources and markets. People are poor, the argument goes, because they lack resources: not just money but roads, clinics, schools and irrigation canals. The job of development is to provide those things. And since resources also need to be allocated properly, prices have to be right. So a lot of development is about freeing prices and making markets more efficient.\n\nA behavioural approach to development is different. It focuses on how decisions are made and how they can be improved. For example, in Bogotá a conditional-cash transfer programme paid mothers a monthly stipend if they took their children to school. Attendance during the school year was good but re-enrolment rates were low. A shift in the timing of the hand-out—withholding a part of the regular payment until just before the start of the school year—boosted enrolment sharply. This makes little sense in conventional economic terms: going to school is so beneficial that families should not need extra incentives and the overall sum available did not change. Yet the pay-off was substantial.\n\nActions like this sound marginal. Economists should be paying attention to the details of policy anyway. It may not seem to amount to a profoundly different approach—but it actually might.\n\nA tweaking revolution\n\nSome small-scale policies turn out to be far from marginal. A programme in Jamaica in the 1990s taught mothers of chronically malnourished toddlers how to play with them in such a way as to encourage greater verbal and physical skills—a behavioural tweak. Twenty years later, the average earnings of these children (among the most deprived in the country) were higher than those of children who had not been malnourished, and far higher than malnourished children who were not part of the programme. Paying attention to how the poor actually think would also imply big changes to financial-inclusion policies, encouraging financial products that people want to buy.\n\nMoreover, development experts have their biases and blind spots, like anyone else. In principle, behavioural development could sit happily alongside the traditional sort. In practice, the two will compete for resources and professional attention.\n\nA behavioural approach to poverty is not new. The World Bank has long had a behavioural unit. The Poverty Action Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has championed randomised control trials to test tweaks to policy. But by making this the subject of its main annual publication, the Bank has brought behavioural economics into the mainstream of development. It is likely to prove a challenge to traditional ways of combating poverty, as well as a complement to them.\n\nEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchange",

  "latent_5161": "Beatrice Kim is suing her former employer, BetterWorks, and its CEO Kris Duggan for allegedly assaulting her in a sexual manner during a company retreat. The lawsuit also implicates the performance management software startup’s regional VP Matt Hart and VP of People Operations Tamara Cooksey for allowing sexual harassment in the workplace and not taking action against Duggan after the alleged assault was reported to the company.\n\nKim is suing over sexual harassment and discrimination, assault and battery, demanding a jury trial, Kim’s lawyer Conor D. Mack of Arena Hoffman LLP told TechCrunch,\n\n“As described in the verified complaint, we intend to prove that BetterWorks CEO Kris Duggan assaulted Plaintiff Bea Kim in a sexually suggestive manner, ignoring her protests and attempts to free herself from Duggan until a co-worker had to physically intervene. We also intend to prove that BetterWorks fosters a hostile and discriminatory work environment for women by tacitly endorsing and actively covering up abusive misconduct by members of senior management.”\n\nTechCrunch reached out to BetterWorks for comment. CEO Kris Duggan called TechCrunch, but only gave the on-the-record statement that “We are not commenting on any pending litigation.”\n\nDuggan co-founded BetterWorks in 2013 to create enterprise software so a company’s employees could set and track performance goals. BetterWorks has raised $35 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins and Emergence Capital Partners. This week Duggan published a guest post on The Next Web titled “6 lessons every business leader should learn from Uber’s uphill culture battle.” In it, he chides Uber because “In Uber’s sexual harassment case . . . it seems the employee didn’t have an appropriate channel for raising her complaint and concerns.” Kim’s lawsuit alleges the same problem was prevalent at BetterWorks.\n\nLawsuit alleges assault, harassment and ignored complaints\n\nThe suit alleges that the “Plaintiff experienced a hostile working environment based on gender while working at BetterWorks, enduring vulgar and graphic jokes and comments about women, rape, and female body parts,” with jokes made by Duggan and Hart. It notes that “individuals in the highest levels of the organization encouraged, condoned, and even engaged in conduct that created the hostile working environment. Women who attempted to complain to HR and upper management were deterred from complaining and told to be a ‘cool girl’ or that ‘it’s a female issue’ and ‘cattiness’ or were simply ignored.”\n\nDuggan allegedly told a female employee who complained about the lack of gender diversity on the sales staff that she should “tell recruiting we need to hire more boobies.”\n\nIn October 2016 during a BetterWorks two-day off-site retreat at a camp in Pescadero, California, Duggan allegedly assaulted Kim. He’s said to have consumed alcohol aggressively, danced inappropriately with female co-workers and draped his arm over a female employee inappropriately. At one point, the CEO is said to have entered a cabin and while dancing, chest-bumped a female employee repeatedly until she fell down, causing Kim to leave for another cabin.\n\nAt this point, the suit explains that:\n\n“Plaintiff was partly laying on one of the beds in cabin #143 when Duggan entered the cabin and immediately picked up Plaintiff’s legs so that her body was in an ‘L’ shaped position while lying on her back. Her buttocks and genitalia were physically proximate to Duggan’s pelvis. Duggan then began pumping and pounding Plaintiff’s legs up and down and dancing with her legs and feet. Duggan continued to do this even after Plaintiff told CEO Duggan repeatedly, ‘Stop. It’s time to stop. I’m uncomfortable.’ Duggan ignored Plaintiff and continued to pump and pound her legs and removed her shoes, which made Plaintiff feel even more vulnerable and Scared. Plaintiff’s efforts to physically free herself were unsuccessful. Duggan bent Plaintiff’s legs closer to her head, drawing his pelvis closer to her buttocks and genitalia and continued to pound Plaintiff’s legs (and as a result, her buttocks) up and down. Duggan also lifted Plaintiff off the bed by her ankles and legs. One of Plaintiff’s co-workers intervened and pulled Plaintiff away from Duggan. Duggan then left the room. After a brief exchange with co-workers, Plaintiff began sobbing uncontrollable and went back to her own cabin, where she sat on her bed and cried. . . Because Plaintiff did not feel safe sleeping in her room by herself, she decided to stay with one of her co-workers in the main hotel. As she was leaving the cabin, Plaintiff was horrified to find that Duggan was on the walkway outside her room, alone and intoxicated. Plaintiff’s co-workers hurried her away.”\n\nKim reported the incident to Cooksey the next morning. Two days later, Duggan sent a company-wide email apologizing for his misconduct and promising the company would hire an “outside employment expert” to investigate the situation and would “review and implement recommendations that the investigator makes.” But Kim alleges that BetterWorks failed to take any significant action against Duggan.\n\nAfter waiting weeks, Kim says BetterWorks declined to share the results of the investigation with her, and eventually stated that Duggan did not violate the startup’s harassment policies. Kim also alleges that Cooksey dismissed other harassment complaints as “cattiness,” told victims not to file formal complaints, and instead be a “cool girl.” Kim was compelled to resign from the company.\n\nKim’s lawsuit emerges as more whistleblowers stand up to report sexual harassment, discrimination and assault in the tech industry. Susan Fowler’s report about misconduct at Uber leading to its CEO’s resignation has been met with widespread support. That appears to have emboldened victims to come forward despite the risk of defamation or blackballing by potential employers, leading to the departure of partners at Binary Capital, 500 Startups and Ignition Capital.\n\nBelow is embedded the legal filing from Kim vs. BetterWorks, where Kim is suing over sexual harassment in violation of FEHA, discriminatory constructive discharge based on gender in violation of FEHA, failure to prevent harassment and discrimination in violation of FEHA, aiding and abetting harassment and discrimination, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent hiring, retention and supervision.\n\nView this document on Scribd\n\n[Featured Image Credit: Amanda Delzell]",
  "latent_5164": "Bleacher Report\n\nCharles Tapper, a junior defensive end for the Oklahoma Sooners, was lounging around his off-campus apartment playing NBA 2K with fellow lineman Charles Walker and cornerback Zack Sanchez on the evening of Sunday, March 8. With a 5:45 a.m. workout scheduled for the next day, the time was quickly approaching for them to head to bed.\n\nThen Tapper, a team captain, got a call.\n\n\"Man, where are you guys?\" yelled Eric Striker, fellow captain, his gravelly voice at a fever pitch. \"Why aren't y'all flipping out about what's going on? You haven't seen what happened with the SAE guys?\"\n\n\"Nah, what are you talking about?\" Tapper asked.\n\n\"Man, I'm gonna send you the video!\" Striker said. \"Y'all need to get over here right now! We can't just let this slip under the rug.\"\n\nRob Ferguson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn the bowels of the Citrus Bowl after last year's embarrassing 40-6 loss to Clemson—which ended an 8-5 debacle of a season—Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops told the assembled media, \"I want to start off expressing my disappointment and anger at the way this season went. I take accountability, responsibility for all of it. It starts with me and ends with me.\"\n\nLittle did he know that his disappointment and anger would deepen a few months later after an unforeseen controversy during what some would suggest was the most critical stretch of spring practices during his tenure.\n\nCollege football coaches, at least those with Stoops' distinguished resume, are all about control. But the Sooners coach instinctively grasped that in order for his team to move forward, in order to heal and grow as football players and men, things didn't necessarily need to start or end with him.\n\nHe realized that, in this specific instance, he couldn't micromanage—he needed to cede the play-calling to his players.\n\nThe wobbly, slightly out of focus nine-second video clip was captured by someone's cell phone aboard a chartered bus carrying members of the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, their dates and a number of high school students who were potential fraternity recruits on Saturday, March 7.\n\nDressed in formal attire, they were headed to a party to celebrate SAE's Founders Day.\n\nAt some point during the ride, the fraternity members began excitedly clapping their hands, animatedly pumping their fists and boisterously reciting a racist chant that had seemingly been rehearsed and customarily woven into the fabric of their chapter's culture.\n\nTwo young frat members stand up, their red faces beaming with joy as they lead the cheer. The mantra is recited to the tune of the popular children's song \"If You're Happy and You Know It.\"\n\n\"There will never be a n----r in SAE. You can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me. There will never be a n----r in SAE.\"\n\nWarning: This video contains offensive language.\n\nThe next day, the university's student paper, the Oklahoma Daily, received the video in an email. Within the next 24 hours, it became one of the hottest trending topics on Twitter. A national furor ensued.\n\nEvery major news outlet descended on the Norman campus. A highly touted football recruit in the Class of 2016, 6'5\", 280-pound offensive lineman Jean Delance of Mesquite, Texas, was so disturbed by the incident that he rescinded his verbal commitment to Oklahoma.\n\nSchool President David Boren launched an immediate investigation and swiftly moved to have the chapter banned from campus. SAE's national office closed the chapter and suspended its members hours after the video surfaced.\n\nBy March 10, moving trucks were hauling away furniture and the fraternity members' personal possessions. OU facility workers removed the large Greek letters from the SAE house as the expansive building was shuttered.\n\nTwo of the students who had taken a leadership role in the incident, Levi Pettit and Parker Rice, were expelled.\n\nTapper had actually viewed a sliver of the video earlier, when a classmate from his Cherokee foreign language class asked him if he'd seen it.\n\n\"When I saw it earlier, I couldn't really hear all the words and what they were saying,\" Tapper recalled as he sat outside of the team's locker room on a too-small chair, still attired in his dirt- and grass-stained white practice uniform two days before OU's spring football game. Salty remnants of dried sweat were caked on his forehead, discoloring his closely cropped beard.\n\n\"I didn't hear all of the lyrics and the full context of what they were actually saying the first time I saw it,\" Tapper said. \"But when Striker sent it over, that's when I realized how ugly it really was.\"\n\nTapper, Sanchez and Walker abandoned their video game trash-talk and hustled over to the nearby Buffalo Wild Wings on Classen Boulevard, where a growing crowd of Sooner athletes was gathering.\n\n\"We were all talking about how we could address the situation, how we could get involved and do something,\" Tapper said. \"We started strategizing, but as the crowd got bigger, we decided we needed to be in a private space. So then we headed over to Striker's house.\"\n\nStriker, a 6'0\", 225-pound All-American linebacker from Seffner, Florida, was having a difficult time controlling his rage.\n\nHe'd already sent out an incensed, profanity-laced Snapchat video.\n\n\"I was in a meeting watching film when it was sent to me,\" Striker said. \"When I watched it after the meeting, I was so pissed off that my head and my stomach hurt. My heart dropped.\"\n\nAfter arriving home, he couldn't stop pacing back and forth. He started calling his teammates, searching for a way to channel his mushrooming fury.\n\nStriker had experienced a litany of microaggressions with OU frat members that he felt were laced with racism since he arrived on campus as a freshman.\n\n\"There were a lot of incidents where classmates would invite me to a party at their frat house,\" Striker said. \"We showed up, and the person who invited us had to actually come to the door and vouch for us to get in. It was not a good vibe at all.\"\n\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nAs he spoke, you could feel the hurt in his sincerity. At times, he paused thoughtfully, searching for the right words through deep breaths. He orated with a preacher's cadence, gesturing for emphasis.\n\n\"I could tell when and where I was not welcomed,\" Striker continued while lounging against a wall outside of the team auditorium a few days prior to the spring game.\n\nHis mom had always offered him books when he was younger, instructing him to read certain sentences, paragraphs and chapters. She'd ask him follow-up questions about what he'd learned.\n\nHis home library contained manuscripts about black leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., among others.\n\nOne book that his mother handed him in the 10th grade, The Making of a Slave by Willie Lynch—which is a study of the brutal physical and psychological tools used to condition black slaves—made him break down in tears.\n\n\"I hit a wall when I read the Willie Lynch book,\" Striker said. \"It hurt me so much, I broke down. But my mother put me in a position to think outside the box and to see things beyond what is simply in front you. It was mandatory in my house growing up to have an understanding of history and the African-American experience in this country.\"\n\nWith approximately 30 Sooner athletes gathered at his house on that Sunday evening when the SAE video went viral, they talked about what kind of steps and actions they could take within the university community.\n\n\"We just kept saying that this was something that we weren't going to tolerate or let happen,\" Striker said. \"We knew that this was bigger than football and bigger than the University of Oklahoma. We were determined that something good was going to come from this.\"\n\nThe impromptu meeting lasted until the wee hours of the morning. It could hardly be characterized as one that followed Robert's Rules of Order.\n\n\"Everybody was just essentially expressing their hurt and anger,\" Tapper said. \"Things got really raw and emotional.\"\n\nWith his mind racing after the meeting dispersed, Striker couldn't sleep.\n\nExhausted, with bloodshot eyes, he attended an on-campus march that morning that had been organized by Unheard, the student group that initially brought the SAE video to light.\n\nMany familiar with SAE and the inner workings of other predominantly white fraternities did not see the situation at Oklahoma as an anomaly, but rather as an enduring problem.\n\nSAE was founded in the antebellum south in 1856 and has a long history of racially demeaning behaviors. In 1949, when Harvard's Student Council passed a ban on discrimination based on color, nationality or race, SAE's national charter said that only \"members of the Caucasian race\" could join the fraternity. Faced with losing its Harvard affiliation, SAE acquiesced and changed its charter.\n\nAn SAE party on Martin Luther King's birthday in 1982 at the University of Cincinnati featured flyers asking students to bring things such as a canceled welfare check, \"your father if you know who he is\" and \"a radio bigger than your head.\" The flyer also included prominent images of James Earl Ray, the man convicted of King's assassination.\n\nAt Texas A&M in 1992, an SAE \"jungle fever\" party featured revelers in black face and slave huts. Other racially charged incidents involving SAE members have sporadically surfaced all over the country in recent years, including one at Washington University in St. Louis two years ago, when pledges were ordered to hurl racial slurs at a group of black students.\n\nTyler Drabek for B/R\n\nChristopher Felix became a fan of the University of Oklahoma's football program when he was five years old. While out shopping one Saturday afternoon, his father stopped to check the score of the game being televised.\n\n\"Dad, who are we going for?\" Felix asked.\n\n\"Son, we're going for OU,\" his dad replied.\n\n\"I've been a Sooner fan ever since that day,\" said Felix, who is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the nation's oldest historically black fraternity. He's a mechanical engineering major who is also minoring in business.\n\nFelix was walking into what he thought would be a regular meeting on campus that Sunday evening when the video surfaced, and he immediately found himself, and his beloved OU community, immersed in a firestorm.\n\nWhen he saw the school's football players active and engaged, he knew that the incident and the groundswell of activism on campus was prone to reach a wider audience.\n\n\"There is a lot of power in celebrity, and there are few bigger celebrities in Norman and in the entire state of Oklahoma than the football players at OU,\" Felix said. \"When they said they weren't going to tolerate it, it became everybody's issue.\"\n\nThe day after the video went viral, all 105 members of the football squad gathered in the team auditorium, where they normally pore over film and digest on-field tactics and game plans. They began debating some different strategies.\n\nWhere photos commemorate the program's seven national championships and a quote in white script reads, \"The only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion. No one remembers anything else,\" the players argued back and forth about what role, if any, they should play.\n\n\"Things got very heated, especially at that first meeting,\" said wide receiver Sterling Shepard, a political science major and another team captain. Shepard was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award last season, presented annually to the country's best receiver.\n\n\"None of us were equipped to handle a situation like this,\" Shepard said. \"Guys were almost getting into fights because everybody comes from different belief systems, political thoughts and economic backgrounds. The room was split.\"\n\n\"You had guys standing up and saying, 'I didn't come here to be a civil rights activist, I came here to play football,'\" said senior center and Academic All-American Ty Darlington, a member of the Sooners leadership council.\n\nTapper, Striker, Shepard and other black players shared their hurt and previous experiences with racism with their white teammates.\n\n\"Obviously, being a white male here, as much as I can empathize and say that I understand how they feel, I haven't lived that,\" said Darlington, a native of Apopka, Florida, whose mom was once a cheerleader when she attended OU. \"I had to sit down with them and try to understand, in depth, what they were going through.\"\n\nRusty Costanza/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nStoops was angry when he saw the video. Growing up in the rugged blue-collar town of Youngstown, Ohio, as the son of a legendary high school football coach, he had a diverse group of friends and teammates. The vehicle of sport, he later learned, allowed them to transcend their differences and appreciate one another as individuals.\n\n\"I truly believe that a big part of our job as coaches is relating to our players as if they're a part of our family, because they are,\" Stoops said while sitting on a comfortable leather couch in his spacious, wood-accentuated office in the Barry Switzer Center.\n\nWith two days of work remaining before the spring game, you could see the intensity etched into his poker face, even as he hastily flipped through a copy of Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven, a book he has already read.\n\n\"You have to have a sense of the pulse of your team,\" Stoops continued. \"I felt strongly, with the level of emotion that so many of them had with this, that we were going to have to work through it. It was about allowing them the space to do that. And they were very thoughtful and put a lot of time into meeting and thinking about what the message should be and how we were going to deliver it.\"\n\nFour days after the SAE video went viral, and just five days after spring practice began, the football players shunned their pads, skipped practice and held a silent protest—dressed in black, linked arm-in-arm—with Stoops and the entire coaching staff participating, demanding punishment for more than just the two SAE students who were swiftly expelled by Boren.\n\n\"We found out that the song in that video was being taught at a national convention, on a cruise,\" Stoops said. \"The team's purpose was to bring attention, not only to the young guys at Oklahoma who said it, but to who was teaching this. Why would something like that be taught, and why did they feel like it was acceptable?\"\n\nTyler Drabek for B/R\n\nThe day prior, as the next-to-last practice before the spring game wrapped up, the crack of shoulder pads crashing together, whistles and hand claps echoed in the cavernous and empty Memorial Stadium. Footballs whizzed through the air as ominous storm clouds hovered above.\n\nSoon, the mesmerizing spectacle of OU football will be back, a fact that Sooner Nation can't welcome soon enough.\n\nBut remnants of the damage to a wounded community can still be found at 730 College Avenue, the former address of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house.\n\nOn a magnificent, luminous early afternoon the day before the spring game, when the main walkways on campus are awash with bustling students, most of them wearing T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, the scene on College Avenue is subdued. The parking lot at the old SAE house is cordoned off by yellow caution tape attached to five orange OU traffic cones, with a hulking floodlight to the left of the lot entrance.\n\nThe gate with two standing, roaring lions that leads to the huge house is chained. Someone has spray-painted \"Tear it D\" in black letters on the right side of the house, with a squiggly line trailing after the letter D.\n\nThe windows out back are boarded up with plywood. The basketball half-court behind the house, with its soft, fancy purple and grey rubbery surface, is missing the rim from its backboard.\n\nA few steps away, a landscaper is blowing leaves and tending to the meticulous lawn of a white-columned sorority house.\n\nSlightly more than a block away at JJ's Pizza Stop on West Lindsay, a group of white freshmen males, some of them sporting Greek fraternity letters, are enjoying the lazy afternoon. A few of them are watching the Masters on the elevated flat screen near the establishment's entrance as they snack on appetizers and talk about Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth. Others are off to the side shooting pool.\n\nWhen the conversation switches to the spring football game, they talk about growing up as OU football fans and how crazy the stadium is on game days. When asked how they thought the football team responded to the SAE video, their smiles and laughter disappear.\n\nOne abruptly says, \"No. We're not talking about that,\" as another summons the guys over from the pool table to let them know what's going on.\n\nBut Will O'Connor, a conscientious, innocent-looking first-year student from Tulsa who is a pre-med and biology major, does talk about it.\n\n\"I'm in a group called the President's Leadership Class, and Coach Stoops talks to the group at least once a year,\" O'Connor said. \"This was a week after the incident, so tensions were still high. He was very emotional but very positive. He talked about how his own family and children, along with the football family, had been hurt and affected.\"\n\nAt the spring game, some members of the 1985 team gathered to begin a yearlong celebration of the 30th anniversary of their national championship.\n\nJamelle Holieway, that squad's electrifying option savant who remains the only true freshmen to quarterback a major college football team to the national title, enjoyed the hugs and jokes he shared with former teammates like tight end Keith Jackson and former coach Barry Switzer.\n\n\"I was sad that the people at the university had to go through something like that,\" Holieway said. \"That video was a black eye that was felt by a lot of people. And when I saw Coach Stoops and the players out there together, protesting and making their statement, I felt like that was the first step toward mending what had been broken.\"\n\nHolieway loved being around his old teammates, reminiscing about the good times. And he has faith that the good times will return to OU football very soon.\n\n\"Playing good football is going to help everybody heal, because everybody comes together around the Sooners,\" he said.\n\n\"We were a close team before, and we're probably a closer team now,\" Stoops said. \"When you're a part of athletics and in an environment like this, you learn to love the other guy regardless of their background. This situation was thrust on us, but we were obviously strong enough to handle it, to look it in the eye and to try to bring about a national change. And that was our purpose.\n\n\"Because you have incidents like this all over the country, and there doesn't need to be any more.\"\n\nTyler Drabek for B/R\n\nWandering through the student union a few days prior to the spring game, the mood of the many students lounging and milling about is mostly buoyant.\n\nThe most powerful and inviting elements of the atmosphere are the photos that hang on the walls—the black and white snapshots that stare back at you. These are frozen images of school history—like the ones featuring the OU football team in 1896, the men of ROTC in 1939, the school orchestra in 1906, a sorority rush event in 1939, the track team in 1906 and an individual photo of Prentice Gautt, Oklahoma's first black football player in 1956.\n\nOn the third floor, to the right of the office of Student Life, is a poster from 2005. Its symbolism is inescapable. Standing center stage in the dazzling Reynolds Performing Arts Center is mammoth former Sooners offensive lineman Davin Joseph. Dressed in his crisp uniform and sporting a wide, toothy grin, he is holding a diminutive ballerina in the air. Above the photo is a caption that says, \"University of Oklahoma.\" Below, it says, \"We Have It All!\"\n\nFootball's powerful force and unique strength is supporting, lifting and holding up something beautiful. They're an odd couple. But they're working together. She assumes her ballerina pose. He carries her. Both jobs are hard work. But they're both smiling.\n\nAlejandro Danois is a senior writer and editor with The Shadow League.

  "latent_5372": "Hillary Clinton’s narrow victory over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses made clear that the race for the Democratic Party nomination is far from over. Even if Sanders fails to secure the nomination, he can claim to have substantively changed the dynamic of the race. On domestic policy, Sanders has pushed Clinton to the left, bringing discussions of economic inequality and financial regulation to the forefront of the campaign. But when it comes to foreign policy, Sanders has been much less influential. Many assume that he just can’t compete on foreign policy with Clinton, who served as secretary of state for four years. In the last two televised debates, Sanders offered glimpses of his views on U.S. engagement with Iran and the need for multilateral coalitions to fight the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), but he has yet to offer a comprehensive foreign policy vision.\n\nHe would not have to look far for one. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the inspiration for the “democratic socialism” that underpins Sanders’ domestic policy, can also provide the inspiration for how Sanders might engage in foreign policy. By embracing Roosevelt’s pursuit of great power cooperation within international institutions and international law, Sanders can articulate what the Princeton University professor John Ikenberry has described as a post-hegemonic foreign affairs strategy: the United States would relinquish its dominant role in maintaining a liberal world order and instead share power with rising hegemons in a system that treats all states as equals. Under this framework, the United States would promote multilateral cooperation through international organizations such as the United Nations and by encouraging collective compliance with international law.\n\nThis approach would build upon U.S. President Barack Obama’s liberal internationalism while rejecting Clinton’s embrace of American exceptionalism, encapsulated in her remark in the first debate: “We’re not Denmark!” Sanders could thus turn Hillary Clinton’s supposed leadership and experience against her and define her as being allied with neoconservative views and out",
  "latent_5613": "Complications during pregnancy, viral infections, and genetic disorders have all been associated with autism. But for the past few years, an increasing number of researchers have started to focus their attention on another important risk factor: environmental pollutants. These neurotoxins, which include everything from pesticides, to mercury and diesel, are thought to alter brain development in fetuses. Now, a new study further confirms this link by showing that pregnant women who live within a mile of farms and fields where pesticides are employed see their risk of having a child with autism increase by 60 percent — and that risk actually doubles if the exposure occurs in the third trimester.\n\n“Pesticides are one of the toxicants that appear to have the strongest association with autism,” says Dan Rossignol, an autism expert at Jeff Bradstreet’s International Child Development Resource Center in Florida who did not participate in the study, published today in Environmental Health Perspectives. These latest results, he says, “strengthen that association.”\n\nIn the study, researchers linked data from the California Pesticide Use Report to the residential addresses of 970 children participating in the ongoing Childhood Autism Risks from Genes and Environment (CHARGE) study. This allowed the scientists to make connections between various developmental delays, and the types of chemicals that mothers may have been exposed to before conception, and during pregnancy. They also took note of prenatal vitamin intake, socio-economic status, and metabolic disorders during pregnancy to avoid interference by possible confounders.\n\nRead more",

At least one occupier, who gave his name as Jeff Boffo, of Oakland, was ticketed for not having a boat permit. “[OPD] equated it to getting a speeding ticket,” he said after his release from custody.\n\nFollowing a call on Twitter for supporters to come down to Lake Merritt at around 10 p.m., about 30 people showed up at the sailboat clubhouse, where seven police cars and at least 10 officers could be seen.\n\nBy 10:30 p.m., a police vessel with six officers was bringing the Aquapy vessel back to the docks at the boat house. Upon arriving, the officers escorted the three occupiers, their arms zip-tied behind their backs. They were then led to the boat house and detained for about 30 minutes before being released to an enthusiastic crowd.\n\nOfficers on scene would not comment on why the occupiers were being detained, and OPD’s Public Information Officer couldn’t be reached for comment. But according to Boffo’s ticket, he was being cited for violation of city code 12.64.200, which pertains to having an unpermitted boat on the lake. The protesters had also previously been warned by the city’s Parks and Recreation Department that they could not stay out on the lake past the park’s closing at 5 pm.\n\nOne of the people who helped construct the boat, and who gave his name only as Gino, was on scene. He criticized the OPD for worrying about a boat on the lake when there is so much crime occurring in the city. “I think they have better things to worry about in Oakland,” he said.\n\nGino said that OPD warned the occupiers over the past three days or so that what they were doing was illegal, though he said that they would not specify what it was that they were doing wrong.\n\nFollowing the dismantling of Occupy Oakland’s camp on Frank Ogawa Plaza a month ago, protesters have shifted tactics, finding new and inventive ways to spread their message about what they see as the ills of Wall Street and a corrupt political system. Along with Aquapy, occupiers in the city have also taken over a foreclosed home on Mandela Parkway and 10th Street and, last Monday, attempted to shut down the Port of Oakland in a coordinated action with other West Coast cities.\n\nYou can see Oakland North’s complete coverage of Occupy Oakland here.",

  "latent_6048": "In a piece repeating erroneous BuzzFeed reporting, the Atlantic expresses concern that the left is now sharing fake news stories just like the right shared them during the election.\n\nAs I laid out, BuzzFeed’s claim that most Americans believe fake news was not what BuzzFeed’s poll actually showed; rather, it showed that those who remember fake stories believe them, but that works out to be a small fraction of the people who see the story. And this piece is one of many that points out some methodological problems with BuzzFeed’s count of fake news sharing.\n\nThe Atlantic then goes onto cite stuff (like the @AltNatParSer and @RoguePOTUSStaff) that is not verified but might be true but in any case is critique as the left’s new habit of fake news.\n\nAll that said, the Atlantic is right that the left can be sucked in by not-true news — but that was true during the election, too. Consider this Stanford study that, generally, found that fake news wasn’t as impactful as often claimed.\n\nWe estimate that in order for fake news to have changed the election result, the average fake story would need to have f ≈ 0.0073, making it about as persuasive as 36 television campaign ads.\n\nBuried deep inside the story is a detail one or two people have noted, but not mentioned prominently. Among the fake news stories studied by the authors (which were limited to stories debunked at places like Snopes, which is a significant limit to the study), two stories favorable to Hillary were the most believed.\n\nBlue here is the percentage of the US adult population that believed a story and red is being “not sure.” Both if you aggregate those two categories and if you take only those who affirmatively say they believed something, this story — claiming Congressman Jeff Denham helped broker Trump’s deal for the Trump Hotel in DC — and this story — repeating Kurt Eichenwald’s claim that he had proof WikiLeaks led all the fake stories Stanford tested, with close to 30% definitely believing both (see my post on that story). This story claiming Clinton paid Beyonce for a campaign appearance was the most-believed anti-Hillary story, which came after a third Hillary-friendly story claiming Trump was going to deport Lin Manuel-Miranda (note, as also shown in other studies, the fake news stories weren’t recalled or believed at the same rates as the true ones, though in the aggregate, the Denham story rivaled “small true” stories).\n\nNote, the Stanford study did not test this story, which also claimed Wikileaks had doctored emails. It appeared on the same Clinton site three days earlier, which was itself based off a fake news created by a Hillary supporter (with some spooky ties), and magnified by Malcolm Nance and Joy Reid. Those two stories likely reinforced each other.\n\nI’m interested in both of these stories — in part, because the reality about Trump’s corruption and his ties to Russia are both bad enough, without Democratic operatives inventing stories about it. But obviously, I’m particularly interested in the latter, in part because so even in spite of the real evidence implicating Russia in the hack of the DNC, Democrats tend to believe anything involving Russia without evidence.\n\nThat’s ironic, given that the risk of fake news is supposed to stem from Putin poisoning our airwaves.\n\nUpdate: I’ve added “three” to the title because a number of people said it would make it more clear.

  "latent_6078": "If the Federal Communications Commission still intended to enforce net neutrality rules, a court decision issued today would have qualified as great news at the commission.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the broadband industry's petition for a rehearing of a case that upheld net neutrality rules last year. A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 in favor of the FCC in June 2016, but ISPs wanted an en banc review in front of all of the court's judges. The request for an en banc review was denied in the order issued today.\n\nISPs could still appeal to the Supreme Court, but the net neutrality rules are likely to be eliminated by the FCC's current leadership. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, opposed the rules when they were implemented by his predecessor, Democrat Tom Wheeler.\n\nThe court decision and its timing were influenced by Pai's proposal last week to dismantle the net neutrality rules and the classification of ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. The ISPs and broadband industry lobby groups that sued the FCC wrote to the DC Circuit court on Friday to alert judges of the new FCC proposal. Judges noted in today's order that \"the en banc court could find itself examining, and pronouncing on, the validity of a rule that the agency had already slated for replacement.\"\n\nTechFreedom, a libertarian think tank that opposes the net neutrality rules, said it intends to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nPai optimistic about eliminating rules\n\nPai said the court decision came as no surprise.\n\n“In light of the fact that the Commission on May 18 will begin the process of repealing the FCC’s Title II regulations, it is not surprising, as Judges [Sri] Srinivasan and [David] Tatel pointed out, that the DC Circuit would decide not to grant the petitions for rehearing en banc,\" Pai said today. \"Their opinion is important going forward, however, because it makes clear that the FCC has the authority to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service, as I have proposed to do. I also agree with many of the points made by Judges [Janice] Brown and [Brett] Kavanaugh in their compelling opinions explaining why the Commission’s Title II Order was unlawful.”\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge offered a different take. \"The DC Circuit has once again confirmed that the FCC's Open Internet rules are lawful and supported by the evidence,\" Public Knowledge Senior Counsel John Bergmayer said. \"Now, the primary threat to these important consumer protections is FCC Chairman Pai's determination to roll them back and to hand more power to monopolistic Internet access providers.”\n\nIncompas, a trade group that represents pro-net neutrality companies, said that \"the current law has shown itself to be both legally sustainable and market effective.”\n\nToday's decision could provide pro-net neutrality groups grounds for an argument when they try to block the impending reversal of the net neutrality rules. While the FCC has authority to reclassify broadband providers, judges wrote that \"the agency must carry out its authority in a reasonable and non-arbitrary way.\"\n\n\"Defenders of the current rules, now upheld, will undoubtedly challenge any reclassification as arbitrary and capricious, since they are motivated not by changed circumstances, but purely by partisanship and ideology,\" Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Program at New America's Open Technology Institute, told Ars.",

Fifth Avenue will remain open to southbound traffic, with some restrictions at certain points during the president’s stay. Along Fifth and Madison Avenues, the police will perform random inspections at vehicle checkpoints.\n\nThe Fire Department has also made special arrangements, including a team at Trump Tower to respond to alarms, fire companies dedicated to respond to any calls to the building and specialty units at the heliport Mr. Trump will use to arrive and depart.\n\n“People can expect some delays in the area as well as along any motorcade routes during the period of his visit,” said Stephen P.

This time, he is scheduled to arrive from Bedminster on Sunday, and then return briefly to Washington on Monday, according to travel plans shared by a government official who requested anonymity because they were not at liberty to disclose the president’s schedule. He will return to New York later that day, and then leave for New Jersey again on Wednesday. The White House would not elaborate on the nature of the president’s meetings in New York or Washington.\n\nMr. Trump was last in his Manhattan home as the president-elect. At the time, the streets around Trump Tower, which is flanked by luxury shops on Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Streets, were at different points closed to traffic completely, narrowed or blocked by security checkpoints. Those restrictions have loosened in the months since, as the city has adjusted to the rhythms of its newest-minted politician — and businesses on choked-off streets complained about losing customers. Today, police officers with dogs patrol the area around the building, but the main impediments to traffic are tourists stopping outside it for sidewalk selfies.\n\nOn Friday, the scene at Trump Tower was placid, inside and out.

Persistent non-compliance could, for example, stem from missing three appointments with an employment service provider.\n\nThere were roughly 12,000 penalties for voluntary unemployment or unemployment due to misconduct.\n\nNational Welfare Rights Network executive officer, Matthew Butt, said it was misleading to use “persistent non-compliance” to gauge the willingness to work or stay in a job.\n\nHe said those cases disproportionately involved Indigenous people in remote communities, where jobs were few and far between.\n\n“At least in published data, if we use the number of penalties as a way of measuring how prevalent people actually avoiding work actually is, the numbers are very, very low, and don’t suggest there’s a widespread problem,” Butt said.\n\n“Given the very low rate of Newstart allowance, I think that common sense would tell you that few people would actually choose that level of impoverishment,” he said.\n\n“It is not the experience of our organisation or our members that people choose to be on a poverty-level income support payment. People want to work and they want to participate in the community.”\n\nThe Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) also questioned the data, saying compliance data clearly showed that very few people turned down work.\n\nAcoss policy director Jacqueline Phillips said current Newstart rates were at $38 per day, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\n“People are much better off in employment than living on Newstart and the vast majority of job seekers move into paid work when they find a suitable job,” Phillips said.\n\n“It’s unclear what data the Daily Telegraph is relying on, but the publicly available compliance data show that very few people are turning down work,” she said.\n\nThe government has repeatedly stated its intention to reduce unnecessary welfare expenditure, largely through debt collection.\n\nPress Council rules against Daily Telegraph story on pension 'bludgers' Read more\n\nOECD data, however, shows Australia’s spending on unemployment benefits is actually lower as a percentage of GDP than it was in 2000, and is still well below the OECD average.\n\nNews Corp’s report also claimed that “about half” the people aged 18 and over in the New South Wales electorates of Cowper and Blaxland received welfare payments.\n\nThe Australian bureau of statistics lists only four areas in Australia having more than 50% unemployment– all remote Indigenous communities. Acoss believes the Cowper and Blaxland claim may rely on the high number of age pensioners in those electorates.\n\n“Where there are regions with high numbers of income support recipients, most recipients are age pensioners,” Phillips said. “In Cowper, age pensioners alone comprise 20% of the electorate, while people on Newstart comprise just 6% of the electorate. In Blaxland, age pensioners and carers make up 21% of the electorate.”\n\nNews Corp also published a report over the weekend alleging Centrelink was paying spousal benefits to Muslim families with multiple wives.\n\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said on Monday the government needed to look closely at the allegations.\n\n“The law and its implementation cannot condone polygamy, it’s against our values, it’s 100% wrong,” Morrison said.\n\n“So the extent that there needed to be changes here and I think from what we have heard we have to look really closely at this, but you don’t want to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire.\n\n“You cant have people claiming single parent benefits and they are supported.

The Legion, made up mostly of Vietnam and Korean War-era veterans, is breaking with other leading vets’ groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars in lobbying for the removal of the major roadblock in pursuing marijuana treatment.\n\nBut it also comes as the new administration, led by Sessions, is sending strong signals of its desire to thwart marijuana decriminalization and legalization efforts. Expectations are growing in Congress that DOJ may even try to roll back medical marijuana laws in 29 states.\n\nFederal regulators classify marijuana as a \"Schedule 1\" drug, a category that includes heroin and LSD, saying it offers a “high potential for abuse” and has no accepted medicinal properties. That means that with few exceptions it cannot be studied for therapeutic purposes. And the exceedingly small number of research studies, which have taken years to get off the ground due to the bureaucratic hoops, must rely on only a single government-sponsored lab to provide the cannabis.\n\n\"We desperately need more research in this area to inform policymakers,\" said Sue Sisley, a psychiatrist at the Scottsdale Research Institute in Arizona who is running one of the only cannabis studies underway focused on vets suffering from PTSD. \"I really want to see the most objective data published in peer reviewed medical journals.”\n\nShe added that she isn’t prejudging what the outcome of the research will be.\n\n“I don't know if cannabis will turn out to be helpful for PTSD,” Sisley said. “ I know what veterans tell me but until we have rigorous controlled trials, all we have are case studies that are not rigorous enough to make me, medical professionals, health departments or policymakers convinced.\"\n\nSome veterans’ activists are angry at the federal government’s continued resistance to even studying cannabis, even as an average of 20 vets kill themselves every day.\n\n\"We need solutions,\" said Nick Etten, a former Navy SEAL who runs the Veterans Cannabis Project, a health policy organization. \"We need treatment that works. We need treatment that is not destructive. The VA has been throwing opiates at veterans for almost every condition for the last 15 years. You are looking at a system that has made a problem worse the way they have approached treatment.\"\n\nPTSD’s symptoms include sleeplessness, nightmares, flashbacks and feelings of hyperarousal. Sisley’s study includes 14 vets so far and is striving to enroll a total of 76 — with participants who are not receiving a placebo being provided with different varieties of 1.8 grams of marijuana per day, or less than two cigarettes’ worth.\n\nThe VA declined to address whether it is reconsidering its stance on the issue, citing the illegality of marijuana in all its forms under federal law.\n\n\"Possessing, distributing and dispensing marijuana are criminal offenses under the Controlled Substances Act,\" the department told POLITICO in a statement. \"Even if a state in which a provider practices has a legalized medical marijuana program, federal law prohibits Department of Veterans Affairs physicians from prescribing medical marijuana and from completing forms/paperwork necessary for patients to enroll in State medical marijuana programs.\"\n\nIt added that \"VA will not provide for use or conduct research with illegal substances regardless of state laws.\"\n\nMost leading veterans’ groups are toeing that line, including Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\n\"The VFW has no official position regarding this ongoing debate because marijuana is illegal under federal law,\" said Joe Davis, the group's spokesman.\n\nBut grassroots support is growing among veterans — both young and older — and in Congress to reconsider the current approach. Much of that is because of growing anecdotal evidence that marijuana helps some veterans with PTSD control their symptoms when approved drugs do not, such as ridding them of nightmares and helping them sleep.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Celli said the group's Veterans Affairs & Rehabilitation Commission, which represents veterans from World War II to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, recently gave the Legion \"overwhelming support\" to advocate changes.\n\n\"President Trump has received testimony on this epidemic and The American Legion would like to present a sample of our research,\" its letter seeking a meeting with Kushner says.\n\nIn addition to cannabis, the organization is advocating for more research on so-called Quantitative EEG neurometrics, which measures the brain's electrical activity.\n\n\"The American Legion believes these two areas alone can help cut the amount of veteran suicides and cases of chemically addicted veteran by more than half,\" the letter to the White House says. \"The American Legion respectfully requests a meeting with President Trump as soon as possible and looks forward to partnering with this administration in the fight against narcotics addiction and reducing the veteran suicide rate from the tragic loss of 20 warriors per day, to zero.\"",

Today, I look at some players who are unlikely to be back in 2017.\n\nS Duke Ihenacho—He can play some but the coaches seem determined to give him only minimal playing time. The word is that he freelances too much. He will be an unrestricted free agent and he seems likely to head someplace that that will give him more of an opportunity to play. It would be surprising if the organization made much of an effort to bring him back.\n\nS DeAngelo Hall—The veteran will have a year left on his contract at a salary of $4.25 million. But this makes three years in a row that he has lost a substantial chunk of the season to an injury. It’s hard to see the team bringing him back at age 33 under those circumstances. Even if he is willing to take a pay cut, it would be hard for the team to count on him at any price.\n\nOL Kory Lichtensteiger—This is another player who has missed a lot of time with injuries in the past couple of years. It looks like the team is happy to have Spencer Long at center and the guard spots look set. There just doesn’t appear to be any need to have him back at a $3.25 million salary.\n\nWR DeSean Jackson—You don’t have to dig too deep here. All you have to do is see Jackson’s reaction on the many occasions when he is open deep and doesn't get the ball. Unless the Redskins make him a financial offer he can’t refuse he’s probably going to look elsewhere. And Scot McCloughan is unlikely to be inclined to make a pre-emptive offer to a 30-year-old who has priorities other than OTAs in the spring.\n\nWR Pierre Garçon—The popular theory is that McCloughan will make a run to keep at least one of his veteran wide receivers. But I think that Garçon will want to move along; like Jackson he sees to be frequently frustrated.\n\nTandler on Twitter\n\nPer @fboutsiders the Redskins have a 27.6% chance of making the playoffs, up 2% from last week. https://t.co/nV1nVe0F6w — Rich Tandler (@TandlerNBCS) November 2, 2016\n\nIn case you missed it",
  "latent_6698": "Perhaps you have heard that the world of astrology is “in a crisis.” Some are calling it the “Zodiac crisis” – because “Zodiac” is a cool-sounding word that starts with “z”. This is all really a manufactured non-event by Minnesota astronomer Parke Kunkle, who decided to send out a press release informing astrologers and the public that their signs are all wrong.\n\nThis is all, of course, old news. Sun-sign astrology is supposed to be based on the constellation that the sun is in at the time of birth. The Babylonians made the 12 signs 2000 years ago. They left out a 13th constellation, Ophiucus, because they wanted there to be only 12. But worse, astrologers at the time did not know about precession.\n\nThe earth rotates like a spinning top – the earth spins and has an axis tilted to its rotation about the sun and for the same reason a top will rotate its axis, so does the earth. The earth goes through one precession cycle every 26,000 years. That means in the 2,000 years since the Babylonians locked in their dates for the astrological signs, the dates that the sun is actually in those signs have shifted by 1/13 – or one sign.\n\nAstronomers love bringing this up because it is just one more way in which astrology can be shown to be pre-scientific superstitious nonsense, and astrologers can be shown to be classic pseudoscientists. They have charts and philosophies and elaborate methods – but their methods are utterly divorced from reality (which is a nice definition of pseudoscience). Not only is there no possible way the relative position of distant astronomical objects can affect a person’s personality and fate (this is as close to pure magical thinking as feng sui), but astrologers don’t even get the basics right.\n\nAstrology does not square with astronomy in several ways. Precession is just one. The omission of Ophiucus is another. But also astrologers ignore the debate about what is a planet. I am not saying that how we categorize large objects in our solar system should affect their behavior, but it brings up the point that there are other Pluto-like objects in the solar system that astrologers ignore. Why, according to their philosophy, would Pluto affect the astrological chart and not Ceres, or any other of the dwarf planets – discovered or not discovered?\n\nWhat is interesting about this episode is how astrologers are responding. Astrologer Malanie, who heads a Texas Astrology Retreat, wrote:\n\nWestern Astrology (the type of astrology commonly practiced in Europe and the Americas) uses the tropical zodiac, which begins with the spring equinox designating the start of Aries – regardless of where Aries the constellation happens to be. The start of Libra is at the autumnal equinox. Cancer and Capricorn begin with the summer and winter solstices, respectively. Each zodiac sign is then divided into thirty degree sections – totaling 12 sections or 360 degrees.\n\nWhat she is saying is not an explanation of any kind. She simply says that the method they use (the tropical zodiac) is locked in place and does not account for precession. But that’s what Kunkle is saying. Their methods are based on what constellation the sun was in 2,000 years ago. There is no underlying theory. There is no explanatory or predictive power. It is symbology and magic.\n\nTrolling through the articles on this topic you will find some priceless quotes from astrologers, like this one:\n\n“When astronomers make fun of us, they’re making fun of the human suffering that leads people to seek answers,” he said. “People do get comfort and wisdom from astrology — and science gives us Prozac.”\n\nNo – we’re making fun of astrology and astrologers, not the marks you con. Notice also the anti-scientific sentiment.\n\nAstrologers are right about one thing – this latest episode will blow over and astrologers will go on as they have before, blissfully unconcerned about reality. Still, it is fun to every now and then poke astrologers with the actual astronomical facts. Kunkle did a great job, and his stunt happened to go viral. Perhaps this will wake a few people up to the fact that astrology is baseless. Perhaps others will become curious about precession and may actually learn some real astronomy.\n\nOne article gives their five (they appear tongue-in-cheek) reasons not to panic about your sign changing. But really, there is only one – astrology (of any flavor) is utter bunk.",
  "latent_6717": "Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and a man who might be the next president of the United States, was in Ottawa yesterday to address an audience at the Chateau Laurier. After his prepared remarks, the governor was joined on stage by Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for one of those friendly chats that are de rigueur at these sorts of things.\n\nO’Malley had twice used the phrase “data-driven” during his short speech, and the use of data to drive and direct government policy is a trademark of his time as governor and mayor. Trudeau’s first question for O’Malley was about that.\n\nHere’s the full exchange that ensued. (At a couple small points, my recorder failed to pick up the sound well enough to transcribe.)\n\nTrudeau: When we first met, a year ago, at the Center for American Progress conference in Washington, D.C., we both geeked out a little bit on data. And I’d love to hear a little bit more about CitiStat and StateStat. We have a real need, and one of the centres of the platform that I’ve been pulling together to govern this country better, possibly, in the future, is very much on evidence-based policy, on science, on data. We have a government that, unfortunately, has cut the long-form census, which gives us information about how government services are . . . communities, has gone after scientists and evidence-based policy in general. How important is data and what are the tools that you developed and can they be scaled up to a nationwide vision, not just city or state? O’Malley: Great question. I was very fortunate when I was elected mayor of Baltimore, and that I had been watching our city struggle with what had become the biggest violent-crime problem of any city in America, and that I saw in New York City what they were doing with performance-measured policing and this new way of leadership called CompStat: timely, accurate information shared by all . . . affecting tactics and strategies and the relentless follow-up that allows you to determine whether what you’re doing is working or not working—in this case, to reduce violent crime. And so we took that approach and we made that our enterprise-wide approach to all of city government. And we weren’t doing it to be clever or to win awards, though we did win the innovations in government award from the Kennedy School at Harvard. And let me tell you what the crux of the innovation was. Usually, governments, until that time, even municipal governments, to the extent they measured anything, they measured only inputs. And they measured them annually, in something called a budget. And Mark Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, once said to me, “Kid, if you ever want to hide something, make sure you put it in the city charter or the city budget, because nobody ever reads either one.” So our big innovation was that we started measuring outputs and we started measuring those outputs, not once a year, but every day. And then, every two weeks, we would gather around . . . the common platform that is GIS technology that allows all those formerly separate silos of endeavour to land on the same map. And, instead of playing scramble, we started running plays. And, man, it’s amazing, when you create a compelling scoreboard that everyone in your organization can see, when you itemize the leading actions that we’re pursuing together to move to the big goal—in this case, violent crime reduction—and the leader, the modern leader, insists upon a cadence of accountability, where people get together regularly, it’s amazing how much progress smart people can figure out, not in a prescriptive way, not in an orders-from-on-high way, but in a collaborative, questioning way. And so that’s what we did across all city government. It wasn’t an accident, in the United States, that the top three cities with the biggest reductions in violent crime over the last 15 years have been Los Angeles, New York and Baltimore, because all three cities embrace this. And, as I’ve travelled around the country over this last year, I’ve found that, in stark contrast to people’s opinions about our Congress and how it functions, or does not, people are feeling a lot better about how their cities are run.\n\nO’Malley had brought some slides with him and proceeded here to go over a series of charts, graphs and maps. “An essential part of this is also setting strategic goals: the modern leader being willing to make him or herself vulnerable for achieving those goals by telling the public: This is what we want to achieve, by a date,” he said. “The difference between a dream and a goal is a deadline. We’ve set up a number of dashboards so citizens can see whether we’re on track or not.”\n\nSo is Trudeau interested in following O’Malley’s lead? Here is the official word to me from Trudeau’s office:\n\nGovernor O’Malley’s insights into the importance of data-driven and evidence-based policy in governance have huge implications here in Canada. Mr. Trudeau believes in many of the same principles of setting targets and measuring progress in order to get the best public policy results.\n\nThere’s something here, I think, in the current challenge for progressives who want to win the public’s support for a more activist government, but, more generally, this speaks to the principles of open data and the burgeoning desire to see the work of government better analyzed (including the Moneyball for Government initiative).\n\n“Evidence-based policy” seems both an obvious idea and an easy talking point for the Harper government’s critics and rivals, but the execution of such an agenda is complicated by several factors. There is the matter of adapting an approach that has been used at the city and state level to the federal level, the federal government being less responsible for direct service delivery. There is the question of political will: a prime minister and government having to be willing to deal with what the data show. There is, as David Eaves has written, the potential for the politicization of data.\n\nAnd it’s not so easy as imagining that data will provide definitive answers that bring policy debates to tidy conclusions. There will be debates over different measures and data that are dismissed. But we might at least hope that there is some basis for the debates that are had. We could, at the very least, imagine that the government would estimate how jobs might be created by a $550-million job-creation initiative.\n\nAll of this would probably start with restoring some kind of long-form census.\n\nThe degree to which Trudeau is tipping his hand, or what this will amount to in a Liberal platform, remains to be seen. But, as politics and policy, this is potentially intriguing stuff.",

There is still a path to recovery, she said, but it is “a narrow one.”\n\nJean-Claude Trichet , the president of the European Central Bank , called the move “a clear illustration of our very close cooperation at the global level.” Noting that the collapse of Lehman three years ago could have provoked a depression, Mr. Trichet said, “We still have a long way to go to move beyond this crisis.”\n\nThe European Central Bank said it would allow banks to borrow dollars for up to three months, instead of just for one week as before, giving them breathing room for the rest of the year. The E.C.B. said it was acting in cooperation with the Federal Reserve of the United States, the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent days some European banks have faced difficulties in borrowing dollars, whether from other banks or from money market funds in the United States. There was fear that if they could not borrow dollars, they would be forced to cut off loans to American companies or sell dollar-denominated assets, perhaps forcing prices down in already unsteady markets.\n\nThe move was possible under deals between the central banks that were already in existence, and the Fed saw no need to make an announcement on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile there now is more certainty that banks will have access to funds, deeper issues remain unresolved, including whether they have enough capital to withstand a possible default by Greece on its government debt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It predicted, though, that Europe would just barely avoid a double-dip recession .\n\nThe euro system, established in 1999, created a common currency for 11 countries, a number that has grown to more than 20. But it did not unify national finances. Over time, inflation and a failure to reform labor markets left most countries in the group uncompetitive with Germany but unable to regain competitiveness through devaluation.\n\nThat is a problem that some say Europe has yet to deal with.\n\n“The lesson of 2008 and earlier crises is that the later you act, the more you have to do, and the more painful it becomes,” said Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank , in a speech Wednesday. “It is not responsible for the euro zone to pledge fealty to a monetary union without facing up to either a fiscal union that would make monetary union workable or accepting the consequences for uncompetitive, debt-burdened members.”\n\nAnalysts said they expected Mr. Geithner to press European ministers in Wroclaw to increase the resources available to their bailout fund for the euro zone countries. But even the expansion of the fund to 440 billion euros ($611 billion), agreed to in July, has yet to be ratified. There is some worry that countries guaranteeing the bailout fund might themselves face doubts about their own credit .\n\n“Part of the problem for policy makers is that they are still waiting for last big initiative to get off the ground,” said Peter Westaway, chief European economist in London for Nomura. “We’re all kind of on hold until then.”\n\nAngela Merkel , the German chancellor, said Thursday during a visit to the Frankfurt Motor Show that her nation has “a duty and responsibility to make its contribution to securing the euro’s future.” But she added, stabilizing the euro area “won’t happen overnight or with any one-time thunderbolt.”\n\nUnited States money market funds and other institutions have cut European banks’ access to about $700 million in short-term loans over the last year, according to research by JPMorgan Chase and CreditSights.\n\nEuropean banks have only rarely used an existing one-week dollar credit line offered by the E.C.B.

  "latent_7104": "California Attorney General Jerry Brown, who has asked that the courts overturn Proposition 8, writes in the Huffington Post on the eve of the hearing.\n\nThe case touches the heart of our democracy and poses a profound question: can a bare majority of voters strip away an inalienable right through the initiative process? If so, what possible meaning does the word inalienable have?\n\n…\n\nFundamental rights in California are recognized and protected by our constitution, which declares in Article I, Section 1 that “all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights” and “among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.”\n\nThese fundamental premises of a free people were declared when the constitution was first adopted. The initiative process came much later in 1911, when the immediate concern was to give the people power over the railroads, which were seen as having a stranglehold over the legislature. In creating this initiative process, there was no discussion or any evidence of intent to permit a simple majority of voters to take away the pre-existing rights deemed inalienable by Article I.\n\nIn 2008, the California Supreme Court was faced with the question of how the values enshrined in Article I apply to same sex marriages. It concluded that the concept of “liberty” includes the right to form the enduring relationship called marriage and that no compelling interest justified denying this right to same sex couples. Just like the right to be free from discrimination in housing, citizens have the right to be free from discrimination in state-granted marriage licenses.\n\nWith this Supreme Court decision, same sex marriage has the protection of Article 1 and, like other inalienable rights, cannot be taken away by a popular vote — whether it be 52% (as was the case in Proposition 8 ) or 65% (as it was for Proposition 14).\n\nI believe, therefore, the Court must conclude as I have that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional and should be stricken.",

While details are scant for the Marvel Studios’ sequel, it does seem that Dennings’ role has expanded from that of the comic relief sidekick she played to Natalie Portman in the first Thor. But then a lot has changed for Dennings since Thor came out in May 2011. For one thing, she is now on one of the hottest sitcoms on TV. Since its September 2011 debut, 2 Broke Girls has been one of the highest rated new series this season. On the CBS comedy, Dennings stars as Max Black, one of the leads. Beth Behrs co-stars as Max’s former society girl roommate and fellow Williamsburg Diner waitress Caroline Wesbox Channing. The second season of 2 Broke Girls is scheduled to start on September 24, 2012 on CBS. Thor: The Dark World will be released on November 8, 2013. Dennings is repped by CAA, Management 360 and attorney Harris Hartman.\n\nRELATED: We Have a ‘Thor 2’ Villain: Christopher Eccleston To Play Malekith The Accursed",
  "latent_7185": "Why do you do this to me, Disney? Just when I had signed myself over to being a full-time fan of your new series, you go and leave me and thousands more hanging for a month!\n\nAnd so, I’ve had no choice but to come up with odd postings and topics such as this one…then again, the series is so new, that this might be one of the first rundowns regarding some of these things. I may be on the ground floor of a new animation phenomenon (doot-doo-do-do-doo!).\n\n*Warning: the following post contains spoilers and episodic story information from the series. If you are wanting to view the show without knowing some of what is coming up, you might want to turn back now.*\n\n__________\n\nWhen we first encounter Star Butterfly, we see that she has blush-marks on her cheeks, in the form of hearts. While I and many assumed they were some form of make-up, it seems they are moreso an emotional extension of her character. We’ve seen them turn into hourglasses when she gets bored, and in worrying over her wand dying, they fracture, and turn to skulls.\n\n__________\n\nWhen I first watched the show, I didn’t realize an interesting artistic touch regarding the dimensional portals: each one is themed around its destination! For example, The Bounce Lounge dimension’s portal, has a blobby light ring, very similar to the cloud-like atmosphere. Regarding the Quest Buy store’s light ring, it looks like a shield, which is similar to the shield-like logo on one of their shopping carts.\n\nMy favorite though, is the one that goes to The Amethyst Arcade, with its phasing, cube light ring.\n\n__________\n\nWe seem to be living in an era where there are all sorts of hidden secrets in some of the shows we watch. 5 episodes into SvtFoE, I have grown curious regarding a certain, little blue creature. We first see him hovering near Star’s parents as they see how she “can’t handle” her wand responsibilities on Mewni.\n\nThe next time we see him is in Monster Arm, when he quickly appears from between some pages of the wand’s instruction manual.\n\nJust who he is, I haven’t the faintest clue…but he also figures into the pause screen (below) for the DisneyXD app’s game, Star vs The Dungeon of Evil. However, even here, there’s no name or ID.\n\nIs he Star’s guardian angel, a magically-transformed Grandfather, or maybe like Aladdin’s Genie is to his lamp, this guy is tied to the wand in some way? I did pose this question to Daron Nefcy on Twitter, and got the following response:\n\nSo as it stands, I’m hoping as the season gets further along, we’ll learn more.\n\n__________\n\nA fun-yet-crazy moment came in the segment titled Brittney’s Party. One girl at school is such a fan of Star, that she wallpapered her locker with pictures of her (including one of Star in her nightgown!).\n\nIt seems weird…until it’s revealed that Star has done the same for her fangirl (who happens to be voiced by Star’s creator, Daron Nefcy).\n\nTake note of the little unicorn-monster doll in that locker. Does it look familiar? Well, it’s the same one we saw in Star’s flashback to her youth, in the School Spirit episode.\n\nThough by the looks of it, the stuffed toy had some repair work after its neck was ‘snapped’ by this lug of a royal guard.\n\n__________\n\nIt seems the Echo Creek area is most likely being plagued by a few more missing persons reports than they’ve had in awhile. So far, Star’s presence has caused the disappearance of one student at Echo Creek Academy, 3+ football players from Silver Hill Prep, and a car load of persons (number: unknown) getting sent to another dimension, courtesy of Ludo’s goons.\n\nWhere did they go? Was the one student horribly savaged by the butterfly-monster-thingy Star created? In truth…we may never know.\n\n__________\n\nBeing an ‘old person’ (well, considering I was born in 1980, I’m considered ‘old’ by the target demographic of the show), I was somewhat surprised that not many people got the references when Star accidentally turned their teacher Ms Skullnick into a troll. Some questioned the wild hair, let alone the gem in her belly-button.\n\nUnknown to some, this is a direct nod to one of the big marketing trends in the last 50 years: The Troll Doll! There was a time when these things were everywhere (even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ‘mutated’ into them in one iteration of their action-figure line!). Word is, Dreamworks is currently working on a film based around the toys. And if you think I’m old…some sleuthing around the internet, tells that the Troll Doll craze first started in 1959!\n\n__________\n\nWatching cartoons growing up, it was sometimes fun to see extra little things the animators or artists did to push character emotions. On the US Acres segment of the Garfield and Friends cartoon, Wade Duck wore an inner-tube, with a little duck-head on it. The funny thing was, the head’s eye expressions almost always copied Wade’s! One assumes this was a fun little gag added by the series creator, Jim Davis. Even the comic strip versions of Wade had this feature.\n\nA similar series of “attire expressions” happens in Cheer Up, Star. Star wears one of her standard outfits, an aquamarine dress, with a little “squid ghost” on the front. However, instead of the neutral look on the squid’s face as always, the animators have some fun with it, mimicking Star’s reactions. When Oskar Greeson finally calls her, it reflects her happiness…\n\n…but, when Ludo’s Bearicorn minion interrupts her call, her anger comes out…and the little guy also gets a little cross.\n\nThese are some fun blink-or-you’ll miss them expressions, and a few more of them pop up during the episode.\n\n__________\n\nTo someone who’s a little obsessed with California, some of the strange names in the show can be deciphered into their real-world meanings from The Golden State.\n\nTake this sign. These are obviously nods to three known Boulevards around the more famous parts of Los Angeles: Cahooga is a reference to Caheunga (pronounced kah-wang-ah) Blvd, Holliwood to the famous Hollywood Blvd, and Setsun,to Sunset Blvd.\n\n__________\n\nCities often put signs in certain areas for a reason. Star really should have read this one to the right.\n\n__________\n\nIn the episode Cheer Up, Star, Marco attempts to do a crazy stunt to cheer her up…but largely just causes a giant mess…which included the sound of breaking glass, and a small waterfall of water pooling down around Star’s bed.\n\nSome might find this a little strange, and maybe seem odd that water would be pouring down into the main floor of Star’s room…but it actually does make sense!\n\nHere’s a screen-shot from part of the interior shot of Star’s 3-story room, from the first episode, Star Comes to Earth:\n\nAs we can see, she actually has a large aquarium! Which would explain the water…though what happened to the puffer-fish and other creatures?…I have no clue.\n\n__________\n\nIn Match Maker, we get to see Star’s test-taking results…which shows that she doesn’t quite understand human mathematics. Her F- paper just largely consists of scribblings.\n\nAlong with a happy dragon, it looks like she attempted to try and solve two problems…though it looks like “Love+Hugs=Bandaids.”\n\nThis isn’t the last time we see this paper, as it shows up in Star’s room in the episode Cheer Up, Star (see screencap below).\n\n__________\n\nSpeaking of test-taking, Match Maker also gives us another bit of blink-and-you’ll-miss-it information about Marco Diaz. When he shows Star his A+ (with a smiley-face) test paper, we get to see that he has a middle name: Ubaldo!\n\nSo his full name is Marco Ubaldo Diaz…or, M.U.D. if you want to talk acronyms.\n\nOne thing that’s noted is when Ms Skullnick hands back the tests, Marco’s is the only one in the front row to get a positive grade…so I assume he’s at the top of his class.\n\n__________\n\nIn Cheer Up, Star, Marco Diaz recounted one of his worst days ever. When someone makes fun of his Karate-Con shirt (“You kissed a ninja!”), Marco angrily grabs a newspaper to cover himself with.\n\nThanks to the magic of frame-by-frame viewing, I was able to see a little more of what was on that paper. Most interesting, is the name of it: Las Cebollas Times, which translates into, “The Onion Times.” Which makes one wonder…is this a little inside-joke towards the humor newspaper, The Onion?\n\n__________\n\nMore fun with words! Guess the “mew” in Mewni, is a lot like the use of the word “Smurf” in The Smurfs. Given her age, I guess it’s a no-brainer that Star would have a book like this.\n\n__________\n\nUnlike standard license plates, the one on Brittney Wong’s party bus just has an emoticon smiley face. I guess we can assume her rich parents paid enough to make the thing possible.\n\nHowever, the license plate does change to actual words for a few seconds.\n\nWhen Brittney gets the driver to pull over and kick Star and Marco off, one can see the words “WOOHOO!” on the front plate.\n\nFor the majority of the segment, the smiley face hangs on through thick-and-thin during the night…until the bus meets a crumpled end.\n\n__________\n\nWhen it comes to Ludo and his army of monsters, he seems to gain and lose them every other episode.\n\nCase in point:\n\n– Green pig guy: last seen picked up by a purple bull-thingy in Quest Buy.\n\n– Lobster guy: last seen falling into a black hole, in Quest Buy.\n\n– Two-headed red guy: last seen in the passenger seat of this elderly man’s convertible, in Brittney’s Party.\n\nThe two-headed red guy has been a major part of Ludo’s gang since the start of the show, so it does make one wonder, if after the Brittney’s Party episode, he made it back to Ludo’s castle or not.\n\n__________\n\nAnd that’s all I have for now. Maybe in a few months (when the show starts giving us more episodes), I’ll have some more things to point out…and maybe, some of the questions posed in this post will be answered.\n\nIn the meantime, kudos to the staff and persons who have worked on this series. Word is that Season 2 is currently in production, and we can hope that the continued adventures of Star Butterfly and Marco Diaz, will yield further weird and wacky fun (both up-front, and hidden within).\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_7296": "A while back, Kevin Smith announced he was working on a TV version of the 1984 sci-fi comedy The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension. At the time he said little more than “It’s something I’m going to do,” but in a recent interview with Comingsoon.net (via Slashfilm), the Clerks and Yoga Hosers director offered a few more details.\n\nFor one, he intends to re-tell Across the Eighth Dimension as a ten-episode first season, with information relayed via Earl Mac Rauch‘s witty dialogue to become episode-long flashbacks. “In Buckaroo Banzai, they’re all standing around talking about when the aliens came during the night of the War of the Worlds broadcast,” explained Smith. “It’s people trading information, saying it out loud. We’re gonna do a whole episode about that night and them approaching Orson Welles and all that.”\n\nWhich, to be honest, sounds like he’s missing the point of the film’s pace and rapid-fire world building. But it’s possible such an approach could work as long as there are no episodes explaining the watermelon.\n\nSmith also said he intends to incorporate details from Rauch’s novelization of the script and bring back original star Peter Weller to play Banzai’s arch-nemesis, Hanoi Xan, who was referenced in a handful of deleted moments in the film. He also hopes to convince directors like Edgar Wright, Richard Kelly, and Quentin Tarantino to take on episodes. “Here’s a chunk of change, a fifty-page script, eight days… go make your section. That’d be fun,” he said. “It also means I won’t take all the heat myself. ‘Quentin was here, he didn’t f*ck it up!'”\n\nIf the first season is successful, Smith intends to follow it up with the sequel promised in the original film: Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League. Again, presuming Smith’s exploration of the concept works.\n\n(Last Updated )\n\nRelated Posts\n\nNone found",
  "latent_7310": "Climate Desk A proposal would downplay climate change in N.M. schools The state’s education agency could eliminate curriculum about evolution and more.\n\nThis article was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nNew Mexico’s public education agency wants to scrub discussions of climate change, rising global temperatures, evolution, and even the age of planet Earth from the standards that shape its schools’ curriculum.\n\nThe state’s Public Education Department this week released a new proposed replacement to its statewide science standards. The draft is based on the Next Generation Science Standards, a set of ideas and guidelines released in 2013 that cover kindergarten through 12th grade. The NGSS, which have been adopted by at least 18 states and the District of Columbia, include ample discussion of human-caused climate change and evolution.\n\nBut the draft released by New Mexico’s education officials changes the language of a number of NGSS guidelines, downplaying the rise in global temperatures, striking references to human activity as the primary cause of climate change, and cutting one mention of evolution while weakening others. The standards would even remove a reference to the scientifically agreed-upon age of the Earth—nearly 4.6 billion years. (Young Earth creationists use various passages in the Bible to argue that the planet is only a few thousand years old.)\n\n“These changes are evidently intended to placate creationists and climate change deniers,” says Glenn Branch, the deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit group that defends the teaching of climate change, evolution, and other scientific-backed subjects in the classroom. The proposed changes, Branch added, “would dumb down New Mexico’s science education.”\n\nkillbox/Flickr\n\nStandards such as New Mexico’s act as a guide for educators in determining the knowledge and abilities their students are supposed to acquire. School districts craft their curricula based on statewide standards; textbook publishers write their books to fit the standards; and state bureaucrats design their tests around what’s contained in the standards.\n\nThe public has just over 30 days to weigh in on the proposal, and the department will hold a hearing on the changes on Oct. 16 in Santa Fe, the state capital.\n\nIn one instance, as seen in the document below, New Mexico would rewrite a standard about geology intended for middle schoolers. We’ve crossed out the language the agency removed from the original NGSS guidelines, and we’ve bolded the language the agency added:\n\n“Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is used to organize Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-old geologic history.”\n\nIn another instance, laying out standards for middle schoolers, the new text misrepresents the reality of rising global temperatures:\n\n“Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the fluctuation rise in global temperatures over the past century.”\n\nA third example would make a similar change to a discussion of climate change for high schoolers:\n\n“Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change fluctuation and associated future impacts to Earth systems.”\n\nA fourth change would cut a mention of evolution in standards intended for high schoolers:\n\n“Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors biological diversity is influenced by: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment.”\n\nAnd a fifth change is a newly written standard for New Mexico middle schoolers that appears to be little more than state-sponsored boosterism for the state’s powerful oil and gas industry:\n\n“Describe the benefits associated with technologies related to the local industries and energy production.”\n\nThere are more climate-related changes in the proposed standards, though it’s worth noting that a few references to evolution appear to have survived. You can read them all in the document here.\n\nThere is no serious debate among scientists that the Earth is nearly 4.6 billion years old. NASA, on its website under the heading “Facts,” states unequivocally that the planet’s average temperature is not “fluctuating”—it is steadily increasing and shows no sign of slowing down. And it is the scientific community’s overwhelming consensus that evolution is real and that it underpins our understanding of human biology.\n\nIn April, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, vetoed legislation that would have forced the state to adopt the Next Generation Science Standards. Martinez said the law was too strict and that the state’s education department was already in the process of crafting its own science standards—the standards the department released earlier this week.\n\nNote: After this story was published, a spokeswoman for New Mexico’s Public Education Department emailed the following response:\n\n“The PED has and will continue to listen and respond to input from all of New Mexico’s stakeholders across the state when putting together new content standards, from the fine arts to the STEM fields, that haven’t been updated in the last decade. It is time for New Mexico to again raise the bar. We must come together and push forward so that our kids can prepare to advance in their career prospects in the 21st century,” said Deputy Secretary of School Transformation Debbie Montoya. “As science, technology, and engineering advance in concert with our business and industry partners, New Mexico is working hard to ensure that children have access to the most rigorous standards and assessments while also expanding science resources and opportunity for schools and educators.”",

Hollywood movies and American comic books have done the same in the West. Avatar did it with blue paint, and before that, there were Marvel mutants like Mystique. In both parts of the world, there is a long tradition of colorful characters. Here, that tradition is now intersecting with fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This past Halloween, I did an in-store event where I dressed up like a devil, painting my whole body red,” says Miku, who was decked out in purple for the recent shoot. This time, covering herself in stage make-up took around three hours. “I needed help painting my back, though, because I couldn’t do that myself,” Miku says, chuckling.\n\nWhile Miyako and her ishoku-hada crew are just now getting noticed online for their colorful creations, appearing on the Japanese version of The Huffington Post, don’t assume this is part of a mass Japanese fashion trend. It’s not. Even when there were yamanba wondering the streets of Tokyo and Osaka, that was never mainstream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it became widely covered and promoted by Egg Magazine, a niche but influential fashion periodical that’s no longer in publication. The mainstream Japanese media also covered the Yamanba trend, and it’s starting to cover ishoku-hada, which could spawn imitators and actually turn this into a niche fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, ishoku-hada is already inspiring fan art. “I enjoy transforming myself, so I think it would be great if ishoku-hada caught on,” says Miku. “I want to do it again, too,” says Sonorama, who was painted in orange for the shoot, while Cherry Sunaga, who was in yellow, says she’s keen to do ishoku-hada next time she’s dancing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIshoku-hada hasn’t started a brand new subculture in Japan.

  "latent_7507": "Editor's note: We're introducing a new column called Modernist Eats from Linda of Salty Seattle. She'll be using science in the kitchen to reinvent classic recipes! —The Mgmt.\n\nGet the Recipe Pepperoni Powder\n\nTry as I might, I've never been able to combine the two American flavors of pepperoni pizza and popcorn without making a soggy, gloppy mess. Until now.\n\nI have harnessed the might of modernist cooking and smashed two of the best things in life into one just like a sorceress on steroids. No, I haven't conjured David Hasselhoff naked while playing hacky sack; I've figured out a way to smatter pepperoni onto popcorn.\n\nIt involves a culinary technique called transformation. In cooking, transformation occurs when an ingredient that is typically in one state undergoes an unusual shift and becomes something else entirely.\n\nIn this case, I've turned pepperoni into powder using a magical ingredient called tapioca maltodextrin. While most starches will thicken fats (think roux), tapioca maltodextrin is exceptional in that it has the unique ability to turn high-fat liquids into powdery suspensions.\n\nThe process is relatively simple and easily satisfies a craving for classic American comfort food faster than the Domino's delivery boy can hot-foot it to the front door. It's also addictive.\n\nSince my giant tub of maltodextrin arrived from Willpowders, I've been powdering everything from foie gras to Fluffernutters. But pepperoni remains at the top of my list because of its intense flavor.\n\nWhile tapioca maltodextrin is nearly tasteless, you still need quite a bit of it to oomph up oil, which leads to dilution in flavor. Consequently, you wouldn't want to powder a blasé oil like canola; instead, choose something that packs an Everclear-spiked punch.\n\nThe technique for turning oil into powder involves little more than a whisk and a strainer, which debunks the myth that modernist cookery is elaborate, complicated or highly-processed. It's important to use fat that has been cooled to room temperature; if it's too hot it will result in clumpier powder. If you hanker for the sweeter spectrum, Nutella powder makes just about the best melt-in-your-mouth sundae topping imaginable.\n\nI am always looking for ways to entice my child into the kitchen and transformation is one way to do it because of the serious science geek cred. It's like a magician's parlor trick with edible and delicious results. The wow factor is so high, in fact, that little kitchen helpers inevitably try to powder everything from popsicles to peanut butter.\n\nI fully support the notion that we can improve upon the world around us through the judicious use of science, and the kitchen is one of the very best places to experiment. I only get put off when excessive scientific manipulation of food causes it to be too precious, overly-stylized and veers into the territory of haute couture rather than haute cuisine.\n\nPepperoni powder is so lacking in airs; it appeals to everyone from my three-year-old to my grandmother.

  "latent_7559": "My first encounter with Junot Díaz was brief and wondrous. I was grabbing lunch with a few classmates at a hole in the wall in the East Village when I spotted him hunched over a plate of shawarma. Like the rest of the country, I had been dazzled by his Pulitzer-winning \"Oscar Wao\" -- its eponymous character but especially its narrator, Yunior, Díaz's literary döppelganger -- and so despite myself, I hazarded an \"Excuse me, are you Junot?\"\n\nThat was all it took.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\"What's going on, young people!?\" His exuberance was so infectious I came this close to answering \"falafels, yo!\" (I resisted, mercifully). Before my friends realized what was happening, he was peppering us with questions about where we were from, what we were studying, what we wanted to do. He was a dude, and he was cool -- far cooler than he had any reason to be with a group of strangers in a Middle Eastern dive on a dreary winter afternoon. Mostly he sounded exactly like the effervescent narrator of his fiction, Yunior made flesh.\n\nI was reminded of this run-in when I found him trembling very slightly beside a sculpture of a golden sea urchin in the lobby of the SoHo Trump hotel earlier this month. Díaz blamed his inability to sit down on severe back problems. Yunior, the protagonist of his latest short story collection about a \"scumbag cheater,\" suffers from stenosis and a numbing sensation in his arms and legs. And yet despite these many parallels, Díaz would be the first to admit that he both is and is not the hero of his short stories. \"The same way you're a complex person when you read,\" he says, \"I'm a complex person when I write.\"\n\nIt's this tension in part that makes \"This is How You Lose Her,\" like \"Drown\" and \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" before it, so readable. You're never entirely sure if you're being conned by Yunior or Junot, neither or both. His fiction also explains why the debate over \"likable characters\" is not only absurd but destructive; it demeans the author's creation and insults the reader's intelligence.\n\nDespite his obvious discomfort, Díaz gamely spoke to Salon at length about how his fiction is as indebted to the Wu Tang Clan as it is to writers like William Gibson and Toni Morrison, and why our favorite books tell us only so much about their authors.\n\nRace is obviously one of the central themes of your fiction, whether it’s handled comically in a story like “The Cheater’s Guide to Love” or more often tragicomically in stories like “How to Date a Brown Girl.” I was wondering what you make of the debate about cultural appropriation Miley Cyrus has incited.\n\nAs a country, we’re addicted to our consumptions. Among our primary consumptions are images of black bodies as being hip, as being renegade, as being kinda fucking dangerous, even if they’re malign imaginaries. It’s something that’s been in circulation for a long time. What I think is incredibly fascinating is that this is occurring while the president is pushing a war. Nothing could be more perfect about where we’re at on an ethical level, nationally. Had I written this up in some sort of Dickensian attempt to lacerate American culture, people would be like, “Oh, this is too absurdly pat.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Onion really nailed it.\n\nOh, I didn’t see the Onion article!\n\nIt was a fake letter from the editor of CNN.com explaining why they chose to lead with the story.\n\nI love the Onion. Seamus Heaney just died, and one of the great obituaries of him was a wonderful quote he had about being on the side of undeceiving. And I always thought that something like the Onion is the deceiver that undeceives, which is what fiction at its best attempts to do.\n\nA few months back, Claire Messud lit into a Publishers Weekly interviewer for suggesting the protagonist of her latest novel wasn’t especially likable. She argued that we’d never question whether we like Raskolnikov or any of Jonathan Franzen’s characters or even Oscar Wao. Does she have a point?\n\nI’m going from hearsay here, but I can imagine the sort of umbrage she took. There’s a profound trivialization of literature in the way that it is used and, yes, if you’re a woman or a person of color, there are certain biases that are built in. There’s no fucking question.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut I get people saying “I don’t like Yunior” or “I don’t like Oscar” all the time. When people say that to me, I always remind them that in the same way that I’m a more complex person when I write, you’re a more complex person when you read. The real question for me as the writer is why you’re friends with the people you’re friends with. Most of us are friends with people we don’t like, so what’s the big deal? We’re used to hanging out with people we don’t like, so this should be a familiar feeling.\n\nReturning to Franzen, in an interview with Vice you said “a writer like Franzen, with each coming generation, is more and more absurd and more and more exactly what he is.” What did you mean by that?\n\nMy point was that in a country that has become so extraordinarily diverse, we still imagine a white writer as the universal writer – and that absurdity is becoming almost unsustainable. I visit high schools all the time. When I look at the kids that are coming up, they look nothing like the writers that we’re all running around calling the voice of this country. Despite what we would like to think, the lag time between what a culture recognizes as its country and what the country is, my brother, is quite extraordinary. Outside of a few strains, I feel like the literary apparatus still thinks of this country very much in the 1950s.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDo you see any parallels between publishing and academia?\n\nOh, yeah. We must understand that power and privilege tend to hew to each other. Just look at how long it took for MIT to start granting tenure to women – white women! But look, I emigrated to this country. If anything prepared me for a place like MIT or a place like publishing, it was being an immigrant from an illegal parent, trying to enter American society. Jersey prepped me real good.\n\nIn an interview with the Rumpus, you said you thought the linked story collection could capture certain aspects of the human experience better than a novel or an anthology. There’s a clear narrative arc from the first to the last stories of “This Is How You Lose Her.” Do you ever worry about readers consuming your fiction out of order?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere are many other easier ways to write books, but I am deeply attracted to the game of collaboration. When you write a collection like this, it permits your reader to create their own books in ways that I don’t think a novel necessarily can. So I don’t mind at all. I have readers that put together books that are wildly different than the ones that I imagined. And it’s that distance that makes me feel like I’ve done my work correctly. When I see that difference and disparity, that’s when I can say I’ve given enough material for readers not only to build their own cathedrals, but something entirely unique if they wish.\n\nIn that same interview, you also mentioned you used to be embarrassed about being a slow writer.\n\nI wasn’t just a little embarrassed. I have to say I felt shame about it. Typical good immigrant kid – if you’re not doing the work, you should feel ashamed.\n\nHas the recognition you’ve received helped you let go of that?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI don’t think it was the awards. I’m fucking 45, and I just don’t have the same energy to be as neurotic. You have to put triage on your injuries. I really wearied myself into acceptance -- I just kinda got tired of hating myself for it.\n\nYou’re conspicuously absent on Twitter. I actually find it refreshing, but I was wondering if there was a reason behind that.\n\nI’m already fucking half nuts. I think anything that’s good about my writing comes from my resisting my desire for attention and approval. I can write shit that risks my readership, and the one thing that I know is that my readership is predominantly female. When I decided to finish this book about a real fucked-up scumbag cheater, I still remember the early notes I got back from my female friends when the book was done like, “Dude, you need to game it a little bit, make the female characters less from his selfish, narcissistic point of view.”\n\nCan you envision yourself ever leaving Yunior’s universe?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI think hopefully my next book won’t be about him. We’ll see. The dream – when I used to have a dream of productivity – would be that I’d write a few books about him, and write a few books about some other shit. But right now I don’t know. I’m like that dude who can’t even promise his kids breakfast right now.\n\n“Monstro,” at least in part, is an apocalypse novel about the spread of an infectious disease that originates in Haiti. Why do you think sci-fi is enjoying such a renaissance right now? It seems like there’s an entire wave of literary authors resurrecting the genre, Jonathan Lethem and Colson Whitehead to name a few.\n\nI’m sure the answer is very complex, but I’ll tell you one thing: A lot of artists are figuring out how to make fucking money. I’m not saying that’s what these cats are doing – Lethem’s been in the game from the beginning. He started out as a hardcore genre writer and became a literary writer. But ultimately, I think it’s a matter of privilege. Literary writers can attack new markets without ever losing their cachet as literary writers. I don’t think that tide has raised the boats of genre writers. A literary writer who writes a sci-fi novel will get a fucking Guggenheim. A genre writer who is classically genre, writing a genre book, will not get a fucking Guggenheim.\n\nI’m less interested in a kind of artistic zeitgeist as much as I am in IPE, international political economy. If there were no money to be made from genre, would anyone be doing this? Part of my interest in doing a genre book was actually to put that question front and center. Because the funny thing about being a person of color is you’re already being considered a fucking genre, you know? Or better yet, you’re already being considered science fiction.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHave you been following any of the drama surrounding the adaptation of “Ender’s Game”?\n\nThis is the problem with thinking you know your artists. If you read more of Orson Scott Card’s work, it becomes clearer. But if you just read “Ender’s Game,” and you read Orson Scott Card’s comments -- you can’t square them, man.\n\nIt seems like he says something awful every few months.\n\nHe can’t stop. This is someone who’s clearly addicted to the negative attention. He’s like the opposite of the monster that always needs to be fed. But this is why we’re so fascinating. We’re far more complex than reading and writing. Orson Scott Card is a cretinous fool in his political life, and yet when he wrote this one book, something else came together. So wild.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nYou grew up in New Jersey and you’ve been outspoken about your progressivism. What do you think of Cory Booker’s candidacy?\n\nI mean, the guy’s a superstar. On paper, he seems to be much more humane than our president is, certainly when you consider our president’s deportation policies. I wouldn’t think Cory Booker would endorse something like that, but you never know. The gap between what we need from our political leaderships and what one must be to be a politician has never been wider. If we don’t get a new political order, we’re going to keep finding ourselves in this same situation.\n\nBut let’s not front, Hillary Clinton and him as vice-president? It would be a fucking wrap. It’s not like Hillary needs to pump up her credentials. She could literally pick Miley Cyrus.\n\nI knew we’d circle back to Miley eventually. Speaking of musical artists, I hear you do a mean RZA impersonation.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat!? No. I can’t do impersonations. My friends say I can’t even do a Spanish accent. They say, “Yo, you’ve got this ill block.”\n\nA friend of mine, who used to be an editorial assistant at Riverhead (the publisher of “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” and “This Is How You Lose Her”), told me you fooled her all the time.\n\nShe’s probably confusing me calling up my editor to fuck with him. But that’s great. If I’m getting credit for a brilliant RZA impression just from my crank calls, then I’ll take it.\n\nYou came of age as a writer during the golden age of hip-hop, and I’m curious if that had any influence on you.\n\nIt’s weird, I have this aching void in the years before hip-hop came into my life because I could never connect to what my friends were listening to. I was a Caribbean kid. The Who didn’t mean shit to me, and neither did the Doors, apologies to everyone. It wasn’t until about ’81 that music began to be a big part of my brain. So oh my God, hell yes, son. I mean I was fucking writing “Drown” when “36 Chambers” dropped.\n\nI’ve always thought Yunior sounded a little like a storytelling MC.\n\nAs a writer, I’ve had an enormous range of privileges, from the privilege of being able to emigrate to the privilege of having a family who in the D.R. was actually able to feed us. But one thing I’ve never had is the privilege of being reviewed by anyone who’s able to talk about how much black American vernacular and music is my American baseline. I grew up in black America, and I didn’t discover white America until I went to college. I’ve always thought Yunior’s voice isn’t possible without hip-hop.\n\nSo as a Jersey kid, were you a big Redman fan?\n\nAre you crazy? Huuuuge, man. I even like Mobb Deep’s disses on Redman. They hated him, man. They used to have ill punch lines. No shit. I’m glad I never was in hip-hop. I couldn’t have lasted one battle.\n\nAll right, give me three albums.\n\nThat’s easy. I would say Immortal Technique's \"Revolutionary Vol. 2.” Because we’re talking about the Wu, I gotta say “Enter the 36 Chambers.” And of course, “Long Live the Kane.” I saw Big Daddy Kane in a show last month. Motherfucker looks good. And he never broke his line. Never broke his line, son. Never lost his breath. I couldn’t keep up.",

Republicans were planning on blame for the GOP shutdown being shifted to Democrats as time went on, but a new Post-ABC poll shows that in week 2, more Americans disapprove of the GOP’s tactics. Disapproval “shot up to 70 percent, with 51 percent disapproving ‘strongly,'” according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nAt the time, President Obama’s approval rating went up a few notches. Or, as Ted Cruz likes to call it, “Winning GOP Style.”\n\nThe poll asked the question, Q: Do you approve or disapprove of the way The Republicans in Congress are handling negotiations over the federal budget? Just 24% approved, with 70% disapproving. That’s moving in the wrong direction for the GOP, since in the polling from September 25-29, 63% disapproved of Republicans and 26% approved.\n\n“Q: Do you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling negotiations over the federal budget?” 45% approve to 51% who disapprove, which is an up from the 41% approval to 50% disapproval in the September 25-29th poll.\n\nBut the public is blaming Democrats too. They have 61% disapproval, and 35% approval, but Republicans have 51% who disapprove strongly. That number grew from 42% in the September 25-29 poll. In the September 25-29 poll, 56% disapproved of Democrats while 34% approved.\n\nThis is that phenomenon that Republicans bank on – the blame for “gridlock” and “shutdown” gets spread around, especially with our media reporting “he said she said” style instead of fact checking. So Republicans take a hit, but so do Democrats. Republicans bank on the “both sides do it” false equivalency meme that our media likes to embrace. But even the white knight of false equivalency might not be able to save the GOP this time, because polls are also showing them losing the House in 2014 against generic Democrats.\n\nYes, it’s early for 2014 predictions and the Republican party is no doubt soothing itself with dreams of gerrymandered safe districts and the short term memories of the American voters, but if they let this shutdown continue and default on the debt ceiling, they can forget 2014. They are already facing challenges in red states due to their unprecedented failure of governing responsibility.\n\nIt should be noted that the poll question itself is a misleading one. Do you approve or disapprove of the way the party is handling “negotiations over the federal budget”? That’s not what’s going on. That is how Republicans are framing what’s going on, but it’s not what’s going on.\n\nA) No one is “negotiating”. B) Republicans refused to come to budget conference 18 times, preferring to wait until they had two hostages in their crosshairs. C) This is not about the federal budget; it’s about whether or not one party should be allowed to hold the government hostage when they lose elections. D) ObamaCare is unrelated to the federal budget. It’s a law that already passed and was vetted by both the Supreme Court and the voters. If this is about the “federal budget” why did Republicans shutdown the government over ObamaCare?\n\nSo, even within the framework of this poorly worded, Republican narrative oriented question, Republicans are still losing support for the way they are handling things. Meanwhile, Obama’s approval over his handling of it is moving skyward. If Obama is the enemy of Republicans, this means they are losing their battle against this President.\n\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

  "latent_7578": "On Friday, Mr. Scott said that the state expected to lift the advisory on the zone of transmission in Wynwood.\n\nThe same strategy is playing out in Miami Beach, where active transmission was discovered in mid-August. Mosquito control officials say they are seeing a reduction in the mosquito population since the aerial spraying began. But the reaction has been decidedly different on this island of mostly wealthy, beach- and nightlife-loving people, and those who cater to them.\n\nProtesters here are drawing inspiration from Puerto Rico, where Gov. Alejandro García Padilla rebuffed pressure this summer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to spray naled. Puerto Rico is now in the throes of an epidemic, with nearly 20,000 reported cases of Zika. As of Friday night, Florida had 93 cases of local transmission. The virus is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause severe brain abnormalities and other problems in fetuses.\n\n“No one likes the aerial spraying. I don’t like it. I don’t want it. We have a choice. Do we become Puerto Rico, or do we eliminate or eradicate this virus?” said Mayor Philip Levine of Miami Beach, who emphasized that the federal government had found naled to be safe in the dose being used.\n\nMr. Levine said a balance must be struck between fear of naled and protecting pregnant women.\n\nBut residents said they were also seeking a balance, arguing that the level of Zika mosquitoes in Miami Beach is not so alarming to warrant continued use of naled. They argue that people are out and about in Miami Beach on weekends at 6 a.m., which is typically when the spraying occurs.\n\n“My main issue is that all safe options should be explored before you take something out that on the labels says can cause birth defects,” said Diane Fragale, a holistic practitioner.\n\nMs. Fragale, who lives near the aerial spraying, said she did not believe it was a coincidence that hours after the first naled application she developed sties in her eyes, something she said had never happened. Ms. Fragale said she had followed the county’s advice and shut off her air-conditioning and stayed indoors.",

On 10 December 2005 the parties PORA and Reforms and Order Party agreed to create a bloc \"Civic party\" PORA-ROP \" that would contend in the March 26, 2006 Kiev city council elections.[27] The bloc was led by Vitali Klitschko a Ukrainian professional boxer and current WBC heavyweight champion and became Bloc Vitali Klitschko \"PORA-ROP\" which won 14 seats in the 2006 election.[27] Klitschko thus is a deputy of the Kiev City Council since April 2006[28] The bloc felt apart very soon after the election.[27] During the simultaneous elections for Mayor of Kiev, Klitschko received 26 percent of votes.[29]\n\nDuring the 2008 Kiev local election the Vitali Klitschko Bloc was a combination of the parties People's Movement of Ukraine, Political Party \"European Capital\" and \"Ukrainian Social Democrats\" and it won 10.61% of the votes and 15 seats in the Kiev City Council.[30] During the simultaneously held elections for Mayor of Kiev Klitschko received 17.9 percent of votes.[31]\n\n14 October 2008 Vitali Klitschko announced that participation of his bloc in the next Ukrainian parliamentary election was possible.[32] He added that a decision on the participation in the race will be definitely taken by the entire political team making up the Bloc of Klitschko, not by him personally.[33] A possible candidate to run with the Vitali Klitschko Bloc in an electoral bloc was the European Party of Ukraine.[33][34]\n\nVitali Klitschko Bloc:\n\nPeople's Movement of Ukraine\n\nEuropean capital\n\nUkrainian social-democrats\n\nUkrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform [ edit ]\n\nOn a party congress, held on 24 April 2010, the Political Party \"New Country\" (founded in 2005 as Political Party \"European Capital and renamed into \"New Country\" 14 months before April 2010[1][24]) renamed itself into Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform and elected boxer Vitali Klitschko as its leader.[24][35] The party officially became Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR) of Vitali Klitschko mid-July 2010.[36]\n\nDuring the 2010 Ukrainian local elections the party won about 400 representatives in municipalities and Oblast Councils (regional parliaments).[37][38][39][40]\n\nThe Bloc of Vitali Klitschko faction in the Kiev City Council changed its name to UDAR of Vitali Klitschko in February 2011.[41] The party has a strong popularity in Kiev.[42]\n\nResults in the 2012 elections\n\nIn September 2011 party leader Klitschko stated that the party was considering the possibility of merging with other political parties before contending in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary elections.[43] In December 2011 UDAR of Vitali Klitschko and Civil Position where negotiating a unification.[44] But Civil Position eventionally joined Batkivshchyna during these elections.[45]\n\nUDAR became a partner of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in November 2011.[46] Udar is supported by the German government and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation[47][48] and received support in particular from Angela Merkel and also politicians from the conservative European People's Party. According to information gained by the German magazine DER SPIEGEL, the target was to \"set up Klitschko purposefully as a new strong man in Kiew - in order to counter this way the Kremlin's growing influence\". Support consisted in logistics, training and joint performances. Assistance was also promised by Christoph Heusgen, Ronald Pofalla and Guido Westerwelle.[49]\n\nUDAR did not join the Dictatorship Resistance Committee; but on 22 January 2012 it did sign an agreement on joint actions with that alliance.[50]\n\nStarting in March 2010 the party's popularity in opinion polls reached a level almost twice as high as the election threshold (which was raised to 5% in November 2011[51]).[52][53][37][54][55][56] The election list of the party was a mixture of candidates who used to represent parties from all over the political spectrum of Ukraine.[57]\n\nAfter a successful application the European People's Party started on 5 April 2012 the process of making UDAR an observer member of the organization.[58]\n\nIn July 2012 party leader Klychko stated that his party would not cooperate with the Party of Regions in a new parliament.[59]\n\nEarly August 2012 the party complained its candidates for people's deputies (and all other parties not involved in the first Azarov Government) suffered \"psychological and physical pressure\" and this \"ten times higher than other parties\".[60]\n\nTwo weeks before the 28 October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election UDAR withdrew 26 of its candidates running in single-member constituencies in favour of Batkivshchyna candidates and Batkivshchyna withdrew 26 parliamentary candidates in favor of UDAR in an attempt to maximise votes for the opposition.[61] In the election the party won 13.97% of the national votes and 6 constituencies (it had competed in 183 of the 225 constituencies[62]) and thus 40 parliamentary seats.[63] Support for UDAR was the least diversified at the regional level compared with the results of the other leading parties.[64] Independent candidates Yaroslav Dubnevych and Fedir Nehoi joined the UDAR parliamentary faction on 12 December 2012; the same day party leader Klitschko was elected to lead the party's faction. [65] The party is coordinating its parliamentary activities with Batkivshchyna and Svoboda.[66]\n\nLate December 2012 UDAR and the United National Movement from Georgia signed a cooperation agreement.[67]\n\nIn May 2013 UDAR, Batkivshchyna and Svoboda vowed to coordinate their actions during the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.[68]\n\nOn 6 September 2013 the party was granted \"observer status\" in the European People's Party.[13][nb 2]\n\nParty leader Klitschko confirmed on 28 February 2014 that he would take part in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election(, this also ended the May 2013 agreement to coordinate with Batkivshchyna and Svoboda).[69] But on 29 March 2014 announced that he had changed his mind and would run for the post of Mayor of Kiev in the 2014 Kiev local election (including Mayoral elections) set for 25 May 2014.[70][71] In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election Klitschko endorsed the candidacy of Petro Poroshenko.[72] Klitschko won Kiev's mayoral elections with almost 57% of the votes.[73][74] Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May 2014.[75] Klitschko was sworn in as Mayor on 5 June 2014.[76] The same day the Ukrainian parliament had deprived Klitschko of his MP mandate (Ukrainian MPs are not entitled to combine parliamentary activities with any other public employment).[77] Hence Vitaliy Kovalchuk was elected to lead the party's faction in parliament on 7 June 2014.[78]\n\nMerge into the Petro Poroshenko Bloc [ edit ]\n\nOn 2 September Kovalchuk stated that since his party and Petro Poroshenko Bloc had agreed to \"joint participation in parliamentary elections\" on 29 March 2014 the two parties were \"in discussion\" about \"the format\" for how to do so in the (late) October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.[79] On 15 September it became clear that 30% of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc election list would be filled by members of UDAR and that UDAR leader Vitali Klitschko is at the top of this list, Klitschko vowed not to resign as incumbent Mayor of Kiev.[20] Petro Poroshenko Bloc went on to win the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election with 132 seats; surpassing the runner up People's Front which won 82 seats.[21] However, People's Front did perform better than the Petro Poroshenko Bloc with 0.33% in the nationwide election under party lists (22.14% against 21.81%) but the party did win 69 constituency seats while People's Front won only 18 constituencies.[21]\n\nOn 28 August 2015 Petro Poroshenko Bloc and UDAR merged into 1 party, Petro Poroshenko Bloc.[4] At the unifying congress (of 28 August 2015) Klitschko was elected as leader of this party.[4]\n\nIn 2017 UDAR was still registered as a political party and it employed two persons.[17] According to former UDAR member and Ukrainian lawmaker Dmytro Belotserkovets it was necessary that \"the party performs only the technical functions necessary in terms of Ukrainian legislation.\"[80]\n\nIdeology and political positions [ edit ]\n\nUDAR tends to avoid sensitive and polarising subjects and focuses instead on popular topics, such as more empowerment to ordinary Ukrainians and a ruthless campaign against corruption, the indifference of the authorities, the lack of local governance, inequality, and poverty.[81][82][83] The party wants to \"unleash the power of the state and provide conditions for welfare\".[84]\n\nThe party is in favor of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union (EU).[85] It has made no stance on a possible NATO membership of Ukraine.[84]\n\nUDAR wants to overcome social inequality with \"the abandonment of the idea of cheap labor\".[84]\n\nIn education, the party wants to bring education in Ukraine to \"European standards\" by \"development of external testing and monitoring the quality of education\".[84] UDAR wants to return to a 12-year compulsory secondary education with specialized training in the last two classes and three cycles of learning in higher education – bachelor's degree, master's degree and postgraduate.[84] It also wants to guarantee autonomy of educational institutions by legislation.[84]\n\nThe party wants to combat corruption in Ukraine with more transparency and the creation of an independent anti-corruption agency.[83][84]\n\nUDAR wants to reduce the number of state agencies in order \"to minimize the interaction of the citizen with an official\".[84] And it wants to simplify procedures for registering property.[84] It wants to reduce the number of taxes from 23 to 7 and to generally simplify the taxing system.[83][84] \"Owners of the land for agricultural purposes\" should only be citizens of Ukraine.[84]\n\nUDAR wants to abolish the privileges of the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) and former Presidents of Ukraine[86] and to reduce benefits for current parliamentarians.[87]\n\nThe party has pledged to \"reboot\" the court system, and \"reinforce the control of the public over elections\".[83]\n\nThe party is in favor of holding Citizens' initiatives after 150,000 signatures are collected.[84] The party is in favor of elections with regional open lists[84] and mayoral elections in two rounds.[84] In local elections, it favors a voting age of 16 (currently 18).[84] It also wants to introduce in Ukraine a law on impeachment of the President of Ukraine.[84]\n\nThe party wants to simplify procedures for the establishment and registration of public and charitable organizations.[84]\n\nIn June 2013, the party's parliamentary faction voted for the denunciation of the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty.[nb 3][89]\n\nElection results [ edit ]\n\nVerkhovna Rada [ edit ]\n\nYear Popular vote Percentage Overall seats Change Government Remarks 2006 12,027 0.04 0 / 450 as Political Party \"European Capital\" 2007 Did not participate 2012 2,847,878 13.97 40 / 450 40 Opposition 2014 Petro Poroshenko Bloc Coalition government as non-partisan politicians of Petro Poroshenko Bloc\n\nKiev City Council [ edit ]\n\nYear Popular vote Percentage Overall seats Change Government Remarks 2006 12,027 0.04 14 / 120 14 Opposition as Vitali Klitschko Bloc \"PORA-ROP\" 2008 122,243 10.61 15 / 120 1 Opposition as Vitali Klitschko Bloc 2014 2,847,878 40.54 77 / 120 62 Government\n\nLeaders [ edit ]\n\nYears Party leader 2005–2009 Lev Partshaladze 2009–2010 Roman Romanyuk 2010–present Vitali Klitschko\n\nNotes [ edit ]",
  "latent_8341": "BARCELONA, SPAIN—We're making the rounds at Mobile World Congress checking out all the new flagship smartphones, and next up is Huawei's latest: the P10 and P10 Plus. The rumors on the P10 Plus claiming it had a curved screen were totally wrong; the 5.1-inch P10 and 5.5-inch P10 Plus have identical, flat-screen designs.\n\nThe P10 looks and feels just like an iPhone 7, which is both a ding on the design and very high praise for the build quality. As usual, Huawei does a great job building an aluminum phone that just oozes quality. It feels super solid, and the smooth, rounded edges make it a joy to hold.\n\nIt's thin and surprisingly heavy, and it has a \"2.5D\" Gorilla Glass screen that rounds nicely into the sides. The buttons all feel solid and clicky, and I really like the power button, which has diamond knurling and an anodized red highlight. It might be unoriginal, but it's hardware that looks and feels great.\n\nHuawei is offering a whopping eight color options, which have three different finishes among them. The finishes greatly affect the feel of the phone, and when I say I like the design and it feels high quality, I'm referring to my time spent with the \"Sandblast\" finish.\n\nSandblast comes in green, pink, silver, black, and gold and is basically the \"bare metal\" option. \"High gloss\" is available in white, but unfortunately this option wasn't on display. The one finish I really didn't like is the \"Hyper Diamond Cut\" finish—available in blue and gold—which has a textured, ridged surface that feels exactly like a lenticular print \"hologram\" toy. Huawei says it's metal, but it sure doesn't feel like it. If my eyes were closed, I would swear it was a big, plastic sticker.\n\nOften OEMs come up with really \"creative\" names for their device colors, and Huawei definitely takes the cake here with the green version: it's called \"Greenery\" and was named the \"Pantone Color of the Year 2017.\"\n\nAs is the case with the Moto Z, I'm not a big fan of the P10's awkward combination of on-screen buttons and front fingerprint reader. I always want to use the fingerprint reader as a home button, and it just doesn't do anything when the phone is on.\n\nBoth devices use the new 2.4GHz Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 960 SoC, an eight-core big.LITTLE SoC with four \"big\" Cortex-A73 cores and four \"little\" Cortex-A53 cores. It's hard to know exactly where these 2017 high-end SoCs stand in terms of performance at the moment, but the Kirin 960 should at least be an upgrade over last year's chips. The 16nm process probably won't be able to stand up to the 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 9 8895, however.\n\nBoth devices are only shipping Android 7.0, a pretty pathetic situation given that every other phone at MWC is running Android 7.1.1. It is at least on the February security patch. Qualcomm has a near SoC monopoly on Android phones, so we're sure Qualcomm and Google work very hard to get the latest version of Android up and running on Qualcomm's lineup. So if you're an OEM using a Qualcomm chip, most of the porting work is going to be done for you. On Huawei's in-house chip, all that work is totally up to Huawei, so updates will inevitably be slower.\n\nThe P10 gets a 5.1-inch, 1080p display and a 3200mAh battery, while the P10 Plus has a 5.5-inch 1440p display and a 3750mAh battery. They both have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with an optional 6GB/128GB tier for the P10 Plus.\n\nEMUI, Huawei's Android skin, looks like your usual \"change for change's sake\" Android skin. It's very iOS-like with no app drawer and rectangular icons. It doesn't seem like it supports Google's awesome \"Smart Lock\" functionality, which, among other things, can disable the lock screen at home or work. There are some nice parts, though, like a theme engine and a customizable navigation bar.\n\nNeither the P10 nor the P10 Plus is coming to the US, which marks the latest chapter in Huawei's struggles in the US. Despite being ranked third in worldwide market share by the IDC—after Samsung and Apple—Huawei just can't seem to break into the US market. ComScore tracks smartphone market share for the US market, and it doesn't even show Huawei in the top five OEMs. A lack of US distribution for its two main flagships definitely isn't going to help matters.",

  "latent_8414": "NEW YORK -- Bernie Sanders, the Vermont U.S. senator who stoked liberal passions nationwide as a Democratic candidate in last year's presidential contest, stepped into New York politics for a day on Monday, casting first-term Mayor Bill de Blasio as the antidote to the \"un-American\" leadership of President Trump.\n\nEverything de Blasio is trying to do is \"the opposite\" of what Mr. Trump is trying to do, a fiery Sanders declared at a de Blasio campaign rally in Manhattan.\n\n\"Trump, in an extremely un-American, ugly and almost unprecedented way, unprecedented way, is trying to divide us up, based on the color of our skin or our religion, or the country we came from or our sexual orientation,\" Sanders said. \"And this mayor is leading this city in a way to bring us together.\"\n\nSanders' appearance came as de Blasio worked to energize voters just eight days before New York's mayoral election. The Democratic mayor is expected to cruise to victory against a little-known Republican opponent, but there are signs of malaise among some supporters.\n\nFor a night, at least, Sanders changed that.\n\nAt the Fulton Street subway stop in Lower Manhattan, with Sanders at his side, de Blasio renewed his pitch for a tax to fix the subways, CBS New York writes.\n\n\"I know where the money is. I know it! We all know it!\" de Blasio said. \"Those who have benefited so much in this society have the resources, it's time for them to pay a little more -- and to them, I assure you, it is just a little more, so the rest of us can get around!\"\n\nSanders chimed right in.\n\n\"If we say to the wealthiest people in this country: 'You know what? You need to start paying your fair share of taxes,'\" he said.\n\nBut Sanders did say he was not taking sides in the skirmish between the mayor and Gov. Andrew Cuomo about how to finance fixing the subways.\n\nSanders, a democratic socialist who was born and raised in Brooklyn, earned hero status in last year's presidential contest despite losing the Democratic Party's nomination to Hillary Clinton. He helped draw hundreds of voters, many in their 20s and 30s, to a crowded music hall just a mile from Mr. Trump's longtime residence on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.\n\nWith de Blasio and his wife looking on, Sanders repeatedly slammed the Republican president, who has dubbed him \"Crazy Bernie.\" Slamming Mr. Trump was a theme de Blasio welcomed.\n\n\"We will stand up to Donald Trump every single day,\" de Blasio vowed. \"So long as he's in the White House, this city cannot be as fair as it needs to be unless we take him on.\"\n\nThe speakers were clearly concerned about next week's turnout. While few political observers expect the mayor to lose re-election, Sanders and de Blasio repeatedly called for a huge turnout to help send a message to Washington.\n\n\"Bernie taught us in too many ways, the system is still rigged,\" de Blasio said.\n\n\"This is your city,\" he added. \"It doesn't belong to the titans of Wall Street. And lord knows it does not belong to Donald Trump.\"",
  "latent_8573": "FastCGI is Pointless\n\nSummary Why do we have a plethora of gateway interfaces with new protocols that mimic CGI when we could have just used a web server instead?\n\nThis is not the interface you were looking for...\n\nI've been writing a lot of web applications over the years, and in doing so I've grown rather fond of our favourite, stateless resource transfer protocol HTTP. It's got a lot going for it: it's simple, stable, reliable, extensible. Some implementations may be broken or a little off but in general it does what it's supposed to rather swell. In fact, it's so versatile that it's quite often used as the basis for completely different protocols. Which makes sense, as HTTP itself is really just MIME with an added request line. About the only thing I don't like about the protocol, is that the headers are plain text and would probably be a lot smaller if we had a binary version of the protocol to use instead. And even that tends to be a bonus when writing software that has to parse or talk HTTP.\n\nWith HTTP being all that great, I have a hard time figuring out why the designers of FastCGI - or pretty much any \"updated\" CGI variant - had to go out of their way to design a completely new wire protocol for web servers to talk with FastCGI backend servers. For those of you who forgot, FastCGI was designed to solve the problem of the CGI interface wasting resources by spawning a new process every time a resource on a web server that was handled via CGI was accessed. Process creation sounds negligible, but often these CGI binaries were things like perl scripts, which meant that every single time a request was to be handled a fully-blown script interpreter was launched, the script was compiled and run - or interpreted - and then the interpreter instance was killed off. This imposes a natural limit on how many simultaneous connections a web server can process.\n\nFastCGI's solution to this is to allow the interpreter - or proper programme - to remain in memory, waiting for an incoming network connection to handle. The solution is quite sound, especially compared to the one other typical solution at the time, which was to use an extension API provided by the web server you're using. The advantage of FastCGI, here, is that it's vendor-neutral in that there is a single API for all web servers, and a malfunctioning FastCGI programme cannot nuke the web server itself. By now it has also become a feature that virtually all web servers support, so the vendor-neutrality is a real thing and not just a promise. Nevertheless, FastCGI is, sadly, solving a problem that is not actually there, with new twists that would not have been necessary.\n\nFastCGI vs. HTTP\n\n\"But you just said it's solving the problem CGIs had!\" - Indeed I did. The thing is, we already have a vendor-neutral protocol for accessing potentially generated resources from a web server that is supported by all major web servers and doesn't require spawning a new process for each requested resource: it's called HTTP! All decent web servers can proxy incoming requests to other web servers via HTTP. This has been a feature of virtually all web servers since long before FastCGI came around. In fact, the best web server currently alive and kicking - nginx - is famous for this capability. You'll stumble over a lot of guides and howtos describing how to use nginx as a load balancer for \"heavy duty\" web servers like Apache, by intercepting HTTP requests and proxying them to one of several backend servers. So why would you use FastCGI for your next web application's backend? Let's compare the two...\n\nFeature FastCGI HTTP Purpose Generate dynamic responses to HTTP queries Allow web clients to talk to web servers Specified in... FastCGI 1.0 [1996] HTTP/0.9 [c. 1991], RFC 1945 [1996], currently RFC 2616 [1999] Protocol Requirements any bi-directional, stream-based network communication method (TCP/IP, Unix sockets, duplex pipes, ...) Standard Use FastCGI process is launched by a web server like a CGI binary; fd=0 (stdin) is initialised with a bi-directional communication channel, fd=1 and fd=2 (stdout/stderr) are closed; programme then receives requests on fd=0, which it accept()s and subsequently processes. The programme may be kept around to answer to arbitrarily many requests. HTTP server is started separately on the server host and will listen on TCP/IP port number 80. Incoming connections are accept()ed by the server, processed and the server closes the connection. Common Extensions Web servers may support connecting to externally-managed daemons speaking the FastCGI protocol on a TCP/IP or local Unix socket. Web servers typically support proxying incoming requests to other web servers accessible via TCP/IP or local Unix sockets. HTTP servers typically allow users to specify the TCP/IP port to bind to, and may support binding to local Unix sockets. Common Limitations Some web servers do not support starting FastCGI programmes themselves, e.g. nginx; Web servers typically do not support the Filter and Authorizer roles of FastCGI programmes. Web servers never support automatic spawning of proxy target HTTP servers, so those would need to be started separately. Security Some implementations may support SSL encrypted connections to remote FastCGI servers. This is not defined in the original standard (which would not need it as the web server will launch the binary and only communicate with the FastCGI programme through a loopback socket). SSL/TLS encryption and authentication is a standard feature defined in RFC 2818 [2000] and generally well-supported. Protocol Summary Custom binary protocol that multiplexes several streams over a single duplex channel. Standard MIME messages with added request/status line. Request Summary Client and server exchange messages of the form VERSION[1] TYPE[1] REQUESTID[2] CONTENTLENGTH[2] PADDINGLENGTH[1] RESERVED[1] CONTENTDATA[PADDINGLENGTH] PADDINGDATA[PADDINGLENGTH] (square brackets indicate field length in bytes). The TYPE field is used to distinguish between different streams within the same REQUESTID and to set up new requests or complete old ones. REQUESTIDs are managed by the calling application. Supported streams are FCGI_STDIN, FCGI_STDOUT and FCGI_STDERR, mimicking the capabilities of CGI. A simple request taken from the FastCGI specifications in the form { TYPE, REQUESTID, CONTENTDATA }: C: {FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST, 1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}} C: {FCGI_PARAMS, 1, \"\\013\\002SERVER_PORT80\" \"\\013\\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... \"} C: {FCGI_PARAMS, 1, \"\"} C: {FCGI_STDIN, 1, \"\"} S: {FCGI_STDOUT, 1, \"<MIME HEADER> <CR> <LF> <MIME BODY> ... \"} S: {FCGI_STDOUT, 1, \"\"} S: {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}} C: <CONNECTS TO HTTP SERVER> C: <METHOD> /<RESOURCE> HTTP/<V.v> <CR> <LF> C: MIME HEADER <CR> <LF> C: <CR> <LF> C: <MIME BODY> S: <CODE> <DESCRIPTION> <CR> <LF> S: MIME HEADER <CR> <LF> S: <CR> <LF> S: <MIME BODY> S: <DISCONNECT> Performance Features Pipelining supported optionally supported Multiplexing Requests supported not supported Concurrent Sessions optionally supported typically supported\n\n... so what does tell us? Well, basically, it'll be a lot easier to just use or implement your own HTTP server and run that on a Unix socket instead of implementing FastCGI for the same purpose. You'll probably be prone to fewer bugs in other people's code and you'll get the exact request you're trying to respond to, and considering HTTP is a lot easier to read, you'll also be making fewer bugs parsing it yourself. It's quite easy, really, I came up with a 900-ish line C++ header-only library that implements an HTTP server and client with ASIO.hpp.\n\nUsing your own HTTP server has another advantage: it's easier to debug since you can just run it on a TCP/IP socket and connect to it with your browser. You can't do that in FastCGI - although you could run that directly on the command line. But then you'd have to set up tons of environment variables and hope the library you're using acts the same with regular CGI requests than with FastCGI requests and the bug isn't just in the latter.\n\nThere's absolutely no point to FastCGI or other \"improved\" CGI variants these days, so don't fall for them for your next web application project. Go straight for the real thing, use HTTP.\n\nUpdate: I've gotten some very out-of-band feedback to the above proof-of-concept HTTP mini-server, and I've taken some time to write up some thoughts on that feedback in a separate blog post.\n\nUpdate 2: The old link wasn't working anymore because I've forked everything out into a different project called CXXHTTP.\n\nLast Modified: 2015-06-08T21:00:00Z",
  "latent_8577": "This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nJohn Miller, last seen on 60 Minutes tossing the NSA a bunch of softball questions about what its does and why that should be okay with all of us, is leaving journalism to work for the NYPD again.\n\nThis comes as no surprise; rumors that Miller would leave CBS to work for incoming police commissioner William Bratton -- who Miller has worked for in the past -- began even before Miller's much-derided NSA report, and picked up momentum in its aftermath. (I'm not sure why both the AP and Mediabistro said the reports began after Miller's interview aired. Christopher Dickey's Daily Beast article, published the Wednesday before, said Bratton was expected to appoint Miller \"to revamp the NYPD intelligence division.\")\n\nMiller finally confirmed the move on CBS' New York affiliate, but would not specify what his new role will actually be. WCBS said it would have something to do with the NYPD's counter-terrorism division. CBS, which Miller joined in 2011, said he would be welcome back any time.\n\nLast week, Miller spoke to New York Times' David Carr to defend his NSA report. Carr wrote:\n\nHe is nothing if not confident, dismissing his critics as ankle-biting, agenda-ridden bloggers who could not be compelled to get out of their pajamas and do actual reporting. 'I fully reject the criticism from you and others,' he told me. 'The N.S.A. story has been a fairly one-way dialogue. There has been no conversation and when you do hear from the N.S.A., it is in a terse, highly vetted statement.' 'We went there, we asked every question we wanted to, listened to the answers, followed up as we wished, and our audience can decide what and who they believe. As we constructed it, the N.S.A. was a story about a debate, not a villain, and we added to that debate with important information. I fail to understand how a shrill argument for the sake of creating televised drama would have accomplished anything.'\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.",
  "latent_8671": "2014 National Championships Seeding Predictions: Men’s Division\n\nWhat do you think of these seedings and pools?\n\nHere are Ultiworld’s seeding predictions (and associated pools) for the Men’s Division at the 2014 USA Ultimate National Championships:\n\nPOOL A POOL B POOL C POOL D San Francisco Revolver (1) Chicago Machine (2) Seattle Sockeye (3) Boston Ironside (4) Austin Doublewide (8) Portland Rhino (7) Raleigh Ring of Fire (6) Denver Johnny Bravo (5) New York PoNY (12) Minneapolis Sub Zero (11) Toronto GOAT (10) Atlanta Chain Lightning (9) Kansas City Prairie Fire (13) Washington DC Truck Stop (14) Pittsburgh Temper (15) Vancouver Furious George (16)\n\nHere is the basic reasoning for the seedings presented above.\n\n1. San Francisco Revolver — Clear #1, defending Champions, World Champions, finished at the top of the rankings, head-to-head (H2H) win over Machine\n\n2. Chicago Machine — Arguably had best overall regular season with tournament wins at Pro-Elite Challenge & Pro Flight Finale\n\n3. Seattle Sockeye — 0-2 v. Revolver, #3 in USAU rankings, H2H win over Ironside\n\n4. Boston Ironside — #2 in USAU rankings; losses to Sockeye, Bravo; wins over Revolver, Machine\n\n5. Denver Johnny Bravo — #5 USAU, early season win over Ironside not enough to outweigh losses\n\n6. Raleigh Ring of Fire — #6 USAU, beat Rhino to win Colorado Cup\n\n7. Portland Rhino — #7 USAU, only losses came to Ring and Sockeye\n\n8. Austin Doublewide — H2H over Chain, #8 USAU\n\n9. Atlanta Chain Lightning — #10 USAU, but much more impressive resume than Prairie Fire\n\n10. Toronto GOAT — H2H loss to Chain, strong Regionals, USAU #13, better late season performance than Sub Zero\n\n11. Minneapolis Sub Zero — H2H loss to Chain, USAU #12\n\n12. New York PoNY — USAU #11, 1-2 v. GOAT, poor late season results\n\n13. Kansas City Prairie Fire — H2H loss v. PoNY, USAU #9\n\n14. Washington DC Truck Stop — H2H over Temper\n\n15. Pittsburgh Temper — USAU #15\n\n16. Vancouver Furious George — USAU #18, no notable H2H\n\nNOTES\n\n– The top five teams are obvious. Their ordering is not exactly. I do think Ironside/Bravo will go 4/5, and, because of the seeding snake, that order doesn’t really matter. If you weigh rankings, Ironside goes #4. If you weigh H2H, Bravo goes #4. Either way, Sockeye should be ahead of both of them.\n\n– Seems fairly clear from 6-9\n\n– GOAT, Sub Zero, and PoNY are difficult to place. PoNY has the highest USAU ranking, but is clearly going behind GOAT after their 0-2 against them at Regionals. Sub Zero is such a tricky team to seed; should they go at #10? #12? We split the difference.\n\n– Prairie Fire is another wild card. I think the loss to PoNY hurts them, and there’s no way they should go above #10 (or above Sub Zero), regardless of what the algorithm says.\n\n– 14-16 pretty clear.",
  "latent_8680": "Conservation and content of highly reduced genomes\n\nWe generated three high-quality genome assemblies, including the first P. murina genome assembly and new assemblies for P. carinii and P. jirovecii, all of which are at or near the chromosome level and contain the complete gene set except for a small number of msg (in all three species) or kexin genes (in P. carinii alone) in several subtelomeric regions that may remain unidentified. Compared with these assemblies, the previously reported assemblies for P. carinii7 and P. jirovecii8 are less complete and continuous, with some genes missing entirely or in part, as evidenced by the shorter average gene and protein lengths, the absence of ∼30% of exons in P. jirovecii (Supplementary Table 1), and the lack of both msg and kexin genes in P. carinii and msg genes in P. jirovecii.\n\nThe P. murina genome assembly is 7.5 Mb in size across 17 scaffolds, which range in size from 292 to 588 kb (Supplementary Fig. 1a), consistent with the number and size of chromosomes revealed by electrophoretic karyotyping and Southern blotting (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3; Supplementary Note 1). The P. carinii genome assembly is 7.66 Mb in size across 17 scaffolds, which range in size from 268 to 635 kb (Supplementary Fig. 1b), in line with previously reported chromosome number and size from electrophoretic karyotyping experiments14. The P. jirovecii genome assembly is 8.4 Mb in size across 20 scaffolds, ranging in size from 72 to 635 kb (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Previous studies have estimated the P. jirovecii genome to be 7.0 Mb in size distributed over 12–13 chromosomes15, though this estimate may be inaccurate given the poor quality of available P. jirovecii samples.\n\nThe genomes of P. murina and P. carinii are very similar in total length, chromosome structure and gene organization, and show limited rearrangements while the genome of P. jirovecii is highly rearranged (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Note 2). Between two P. jirovecii strains, there is ∼0.3% genetic variation, with subtelomeric regions showing the highest diversity (Fig. 1b) as observed in some other fungi16. Despite these rearrangements, conserved syntenic regions include nearly all genes of P. murina compared with either P. carinii (96.1%) or P. jirovecii (92.9%). In contrast, comparison to other phylogenetically related fungi identified only small blocks of three to seven genes with a conserved order in comparison of P. murina to Schizosaccharomyces pombe17 (8.1%) or Taphrina deformans18 (3.3%). The high number of inter-chromosomal rearrangements in Pneumocystis contrasts to the primarily intra-chromosomal pattern reported for Saccharomycetes19 and other ascomycetes.\n\nFigure 1: Conservation of Pneumocystis genome structure. (a) Conserved synteny among three Pneumocystis genomes. Shared syntenic regions are depicted with grey boxes. Scaffold numbers are listed on the x-axis, and red dots indicate the location of msg genes. (b) Genome-wide SNP frequency between the P. jirovecii isolates from the United States (RU7) and Switzerland (SE8)8 with the same scaffold order as in top panel. The region beyond 8 Mb with a high number of SNPs is composed primarily of small scaffolds containing msg genes not assembled into the 20 large scaffolds. Using our genome assembly (RU7) as a reference, we identified a total of 24,902 SNPs, or 1 every 337 bases, between these 2 isolates, which are over-represented in subtelomeric regions where msg genes are found. Full size image\n\nCompared with other fungi, all three Pneumocystis species have a small genome size and a reduced gene set; between 3,675 and 3,812 genes (including transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) are predicted (Table 1) compared with an average of 5,044 genes in the four related Schizosaccharomyces genomes17. Other unusual features of the Pneumocystis genomes are their possession of only a single copy of rRNA genes (Supplementary Fig. 5), a minimal number of tRNA genes and an extremely low GC content, all of which are among the lowest in eukaryotes (Table 1). These features may reflect a slow transcription and translation machinery (Supplementary Note 3), which, together with the loss of many biosynthetic pathways as discussed below, may lead to the slow growth of Pneumocystis organisms as observed in animal models, where doubling times are estimated to be 5–8 days20, as well as to the failure to grow in vitro. The reduced genome size and content likely reflects adaptation to and dependence on human and other mammalian hosts, as has been previously noted for Microsporidia21.\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Pneumocystis and related fungal genomes. Full size table\n\nGene family expansions and contractions\n\nTo examine the predicted functional impact of genome reduction, we examined gene gain and loss in Pneumocystis relative to seven closely related Ascomycete species (Supplementary Fig. 6) using protein homology and subcellular localization analysis tools (Supplementary Methods). To identify common features of reduced genomes, we also compared these changes in gene content with those in two microsporidial species21, both of which are intracellular organisms and have the smallest known genomes in the fungal kingdom (Fig. 2). Based on a phylogenetic tree inferred from 413 single copy core orthologues (Supplementary Methods), the three Pneumocystis species cluster with Taphrina deformans18 as a sister group to the Schizosaccharomyces species (Supplementary Fig. 6). As previously recognized based on mitochondrial genome sequences22, P. murina and P. carinii are more closely related to each other than either is to P. jirovecii, although all three species show substantial divergence.\n\nFigure 2: Protein domains depleted or enriched in Pneumocystis. Significantly enriched (top panel) or depleted (lower panel) Pfam domains (Fisher’s exact test, q value<0.05) are included in the heat map if the domains appear at least twice in the following comparisons: Pneumocystis versus Schizosaccharomyces, Pneumocystis versus Schizosaccharomyces and T. deformans, Pneumocystis versus S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, Pneumocystis versus E. cuniculi and E. intestinalis, Pneumocystis versus all others shown. Broader functional categories of proteins are indicated on the left, while specific Pfam domains are listed on the right. The number of proteins containing each domain is indicated within each box for each species. The heat map is colour coded based on a Z score, as indicated by the key at the bottom right. Fungal species are ordered based on their phylogenetic relationship as indicated at the bottom. Full size image\n\nProtein domains enriched in Pneumocystis include host-interacting cell-surface proteins and proteins required for basic cellular functions. The most significantly enriched domains in Pneumocystis are the Msg domains, which are shared among Pneumocystis species but absent in all other sequenced species. Msg is encoded by a large multi-copy gene superfamily (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Data 1; Supplementary Note 4). Msg genes account for about 3–6% of an otherwise highly reduced genome, suggesting that the encoded proteins play an essential role in the organism’s survival. We found extraordinary diversity in genes encoding the Msg superfamily; there were 64 to 179 unique genes per species, which represent the largest surface protein family identified to date in the fungal kingdom23 and which show conservation among most Msg families or subfamilies across species, but also species-specific amplifications. Based on domain structure and phylogenetic analysis, the Msg superfamily is classified into five families, designated as Msg-A, -B, -C, -D and -E families (Fig. 3). The high diversity of these Msg families therefore could specify different proteins at the cell surface, both between strains and between species. Msg is thought to play an important role in host–pathogen interactions and potentially facilitates evasion of host immune responses through antigenic variation23,24. The fact that different P. jirovecii strains have unique msg repertoires2,25 dramatically expands the potential for antigenic variation, possibly against T-cell rather than B-cell host responses26. Msg antigenic variation by gene recombination is supported by the presence of homologoues to all the key genes involved in homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Supplementary Data 2).\n\nFigure 3: The Msg superfamily in three Pneumocystis species. (a) Phylogeny of 384 Msg proteins identified in P. murina (blue squares), P. carinii (pink circles) and P. jirovecii (green diamonds). They are classified into five families of Msg-A, -B, -C, -D and -E, as indicated by the vertical bars on the right side. The Msg-A family is further classified into three subfamilies of Msg-A1 (classical Msg genes), Msg-A2 (Msr genes) and Msg-A3 (other Msg-associated genes). (b) Schematic representations of conserved domains in five Msg families. (c) Sequence logos showing the frequency of amino acid composition in Msg domains. Previously identified Pfam MSG and Pfam Msg2_C domains are included for comparison. Additional information on the Msg domain analysis is provided in Supplementary Note 4. Full size image\n\nPeptidases of the S8 and M16 families are also highly enriched (Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 3; Supplementary Fig. 7). A large difference between the Pneumocystis species is the expansion of the S8B peptidase subfamily (kexin) in P. carinii, which contains 39 copies compared with 0–1 copy in P. murina, P. jirovecii and the other analysed fungi. Kexin is potentially involved in the processing of Msg proteins in the Golgi27,28,29, though in P. carinii many of the kexin genes encode proteins predicted to be on the cell surface through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor29 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). The protein encoded by the single-copy kexin gene in both P. murina and P. jirovecii has been predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus27,28. Other enriched domains include another cell-surface family, the cysteine-rich CFEM (common in fungal extracellular membrane) domain (Supplementary Fig. 8), as well as proteins involved in regulation of transcription, translation and other cellular activities (histone deacetylase family, ATPase family and the RNA recognition motif (RRM), Supplementary Data 4–6), all of which potentially facilitate the survival of Pneumocystis organisms in the host as discussed below.\n\nBy contrast, all three Pneumocystis species show extensive reduction of multiple gene families, as expected from their small genome size (Fig. 2). The most significantly reduced Pfam domains in Pneumocystis comprise the following three major categories: (1) transporters, with <25 transporters in each Pneumocystis species compared with 131–217 in other ascomycetes for the 6 depleted Pfam domains; (2) transcription factors, with only 3 genes in each Pneumocystis species in the 3 depleted Pfam domains, an order of magnitude fewer than other fungi except for Microsporidia; (3) enzymes, including oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases and coenzymes. Most of the significantly depleted domains in Pneumocystis are also depleted in Microsporidia (Fig. 2), suggesting common dependencies of these obligate pathogens on their hosts to complement these biologic functions. While additional transcription factor and transporter-associated domains are conserved (Supplementary Data 7 and 8; Supplementary Fig. 9), the total number of transcription factors and transporters in Pneumocystis is among the lowest in fungi.\n\nSubstantial reduction and unique features of metabolic pathways\n\nSince the chromosome-level genome assemblies we generated are more complete than previously reported assemblies7,8, we mapped all major metabolic pathways for all three Pneumocystis species (Figs 4 and 5; Supplementary Figs 10 and 11; Supplementary Data 9–19; Supplementary Note 5). Among the most significantly reduced pathways are those involved in amino acid metabolism. As previously noted8,12, each Pneumocystis species lacks ∼80% of genes involved in de novo amino acid synthesis in yeast (Supplementary Data 9). In addition, Pneumocystis has impaired capacity for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulfur10. Consequently, none of the 20 standard amino acids can be synthesized de novo although a few can be synthesized from others. Moreover, in contrast to these earlier reports, we have identified only 1 potential amino acid transporter (Ptr2), which is predicted to localize to the plasma membrane in each species compared with over 20 such transporters in yeasts. Nevertheless, intracellular transport appears highly conserved; nearly half of the 26 mitochondrion- and vacuole-associated amino acid transporters in yeast are preserved. While it is believed that polyamines are ubiquitous in all organisms and serve diverse functions, none of the three Pneumocystis genomes encodes any of the enzymes necessary for de novo synthesis of polyamines, though there is one potential polyamine transporter in each species, consistent with previous in vitro studies of P. carinii30. All three Pneumocystis species have retained the genes required for de novo nucleotide synthesis but are missing nearly all the genes for nucleotide salvage pathways (Supplementary Data 10).\n\nFigure 4: Reduction of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in Pneumocystis. A condensed version of pathways highlights retained (green arrows) and lost (grey arrows) pathways. Enzymes and membrane transporters absent in all three Pneumocystis species are highlighted in red font; those retained in all three species are highlighted in blue. Yellow and grey boxes indicate metabolites present and absent, respectively. Some metabolites are included more than once as they interact with multiple pathways, in which case the yellow or grey colouring refers to their role in different pathways. Enzyme Sur2 (in pink) is present in only P. murina but not P. carinii or P. jirovecii. Enzyme Mct1 (in pink) is present in both P. murina and P. carinii but not P. jirovecii. The boxed question mark (‘?’) leading to inositol indicates a hypothetical enzyme. The names of enzymes, transporters and metabolites follow the standard abbreviated names for S. cerevisiae. The enzyme and transporter names containing two or more digits represent duplicated enzymes and transporters. Full size image\n\nFigure 5: Summary of mechanisms of adaptation to host lungs by Pneumocystis. Different mechanisms are highlighted by different colours. Potential mechanisms of uptake of nutrients (which cannot be synthesized de novo) include the use of plasma membrane-localized transporters (indicated by T), conversion of other metabolites scavenged from hosts (indicated by C), endocytosis (indicated by E) and unknown (indicated by U). §Potential uptake of haem or haemoglobin from lungs by endocytosis mediated by CFEM domain-containing proteins. *Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is retained in P. jirovecii but lost in P. murina and P. carinii. ¶β-glucan is present in cysts and absent in trophic forms. β-glucan as well as chitin and mannan in other fungal pathogens are known pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) involved in host immune recognition; none of these components is detected in Pneumocystis organisms except for the presence of β-glucan in the cyst form (Figs 6 and 7; Supplementary Fig. 13). Pneumocystis is the only fungus identified to date that cannot synthesize chitin. Full size image\n\nFor carbohydrate metabolism, loss of a subset of pathways further highlights nutritional dependency. All three Pneumocystis species have a full complement of genes necessary for uptake and catabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 11). In addition, all three species have all the enzymes necessary to convert fructose and mannose to glucose, and to synthesize and utilize glycogen and trehalose. However, key enzymes that convert galactose and sucrose to glucose are missing. Additional notable losses include two enzymes for glyoxylation8, one key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, and all enzymes for pyruvate fermentation. These findings, together with the identification of almost all genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Supplementary Data 16), suggest that energy production in Pneumocystis largely relies on glucose through oxidative pathways.\n\nLipid metabolism genes in Pneumocystis are also greatly reduced in number, thus resulting in distinctive differences in predicted lipid content compared with other fungi (Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 12). All three Pneumocystis species are able to synthesize fecosterol and episterol, but unable to convert them to ergosterol, which potentially accounts for the resistance of Pneumocystis to classical antifungal agents as noted previously11. Moreover, only P. jirovecii but not P. murina or P. carinii can synthesize cholesterol13 (Supplementary Fig. 11). These findings support the hypothesis that P. murina and P. carinii, but not necessarily P. jirovecii, may scavenge cholesterol from their hosts31, though the genes involved in sterol uptake have not been identified. Utilization of cholesterol rather than ergosterol may be contributing to a less rigid cell wall, thus allowing development of the trophic form of Pneumocystis since cholesterol-containing membranes are more flexible than ergosterol-containing membranes. All three Pneumocystis species lack not only the de novo synthesis pathways for myo-inositol, choline, complex sphingolipids, ether lipids, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and fatty acids (the cytosolic pathway involving fas1 and fas2 genes) but also the transporters for direct uptake of these lipids from external sources (Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 12). Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms could supply cells with phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, inositol and choline (Fig. 4; Supplementary Note 5).\n\nStrikingly, most of the genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation are missing in all three species, suggesting that fatty acids are not an energy source for Pneumocystis, further supporting a high reliance on glucose as the main energy source. Of note, all three Pneumocystis species lack the enzymes for synthesis of glycerol from glycerone-phosphate or monoacylglycerol but encode homologues of yeast proteins (Gup1 and Fps1) responsible for glycerol uptake and export (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 9b). Although glycerol is the only non-sugar carbon source that can enter into the TCA cycle, and is also required for synthesis of glycerolphospholipids, these two transporters may also play an important role in maintaining osmotic balance given the loss of critical cell wall components as discussed below.\n\nCofactor metabolism is also largely reduced in Pneumocystis (Supplementary Data 13). All three Pneumocystis species are missing almost all enzymes required for de novo synthesis and membrane transport of pantothenate, but retain all enzymes needed to convert pantothenate to CoA, as well as a mitochondrial carrier protein (Leu5) for CoA (Supplementary Fig. 10), implying possible scavenging of pantothenate or its downstream metabolites from the host by other mechanisms (for example, endocytosis. Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 14). All three Pneumocystis species lack enzymes required for de novo synthesis of vitamins B1 and H, as well as ubiquinone and siderophores, but have a potential plasma membrane transporter for each of these cofactors (Supplementary Data 13; Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 9c,d). P. jirovecii also lacks enzymes for de novo synthesis of NAD, while retaining one salvage pathway using exogenous nicotinic acid mononucleotide imported by a transporter (Tna1). In contrast, both P. murina and P. carinii have all the enzymes and the transporter needed for de novo synthesis and salvage of NAD. All three Pneumocystis species show a near complete absence of proteins necessary for reductive iron assimilation and siderophore biosynthesis32 (Supplementary Data 13). Since each Pneumocystis species encodes five proteins with cysteine-rich CFEM domains (Supplementary Fig. 8), it is possible that, like Candida albicans33, Pneumocystis is able to scavenge iron from host haem and haemoglobin using one or more of these proteins as an extracellular haem receptor.\n\nOur analysis suggests that endocytosis may serve as a mechanism for Pneumocystis to obtain nutrients in the absence of multiple different receptors. In support of this hypothesis, we found that each Pneumocystis species encodes nearly all proteins involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Supplementary Data 14). In addition, genes encoding various degradative enzymes (including proteases, lipases, ATPase families and proteasome shown in Supplementary Data 3,5,12 and 15) and transporters localized in mitochondria and vacuoles are expanded or retained, and some of them are highly expressed (Supplementary Data 20), while biosynthetic pathways for many nutrients (including amino acids, lipids and cofactors, as noted above) and plasma-membrane-associated transporter families are completely lost or reduced. Loss of these transporters may reflect low concentrations of their targets in the host lung milieu.\n\nLack of chitin, outer chain N-mannans and α-glucan in cell wall\n\nFungal cell walls typically are composed primarily of chitin, chitosan, glucans, mannans and glycoproteins, which are covalently cross-linked together to protect the cell from changes in environmental stresses, while allowing the organism to interact with its environment. The structure and biosynthesis of such cell walls are unique to fungi and thus serve as an excellent target for antifungal agents. The formation and assembly of the Pneumocystis cell wall remain poorly understood, though numerous studies have found it to be rich in glycoproteins and, in cysts only, β-glucans34,35.\n\nRemarkably, none of the three Pneumocystis species encodes the key enzyme chitin synthase required for chitin synthesis, or chitinases involved in chitin degradation during cell wall remodelling (Fig. 6; Supplementary Data 17). The absence of these two gene families strongly suggests that Pneumocystis does not contain chitin in its cell wall. While each Pneumocystis genome does encode homologues of a few accessory proteins not directly involved in chitin synthesis or degradation (such as Chs5 reported elsewhere36), none of these shares any signature protein domains found in chitin synthase or chitinase (Supplementary Fig. 12). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Chs5 functions as a component of the exomer complex involved in export of chitin synthase and other membrane proteins37; in Pneumocystis Chs5 could serve only the latter function, given the absence of chitin synthase. While the detection of chitin in P. carinii has been previously reported36,38 based on reactivity with non-specific lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin, this staining may be detecting other molecules based on the absence of chitin synthases in the genome.\n\nFigure 6: Analysis of chitin in Pneumocystis and related fungi. (a) Enzymes and accessory proteins involved in chitin metabolism in fungi. Pneumocystis genomes do not encode any chitin synthase or chitinase, which are present in other fungi, but retain genes encoding four accessory proteins (Supplementary Data 17). (b) Gas chromatograms of partially methylated alditol acetates of P. carinii and S. cerevisiae (control) cell walls. Terminal and 4-linked N-acetylglucosamine signals (T-GlcNAc and 4-GlcNAc in red font) were detected in S. cerevisiae but not in P. carinii. Glucose (Glc) and mannose (Man) signals were detected in both species. (c–e) Detection of chitin with recombinant chitin-binding domain (Alexafluor 488) using P. murina-infected lung tissue (c) and C. albicans-infected kidneys (e) as a positive control. Pneumocystis organisms are demonstrated in d by dual staining with anti-Msg (red), which labels both trophic forms and cysts, and a dectin-Fc construct (green), which labels β-1,3-glucan in cysts. Chitin staining is absent in P. murina but readily detected in C. albicans, while β-1,3-glucan is easily seen in P. murina. Original magnification, × 400; scale bar, 10 μm. Full size image\n\nWe assayed for the presence of chitin in the Pneumocystis cell wall using a recombinant chitin-binding domain (CBD). While we found strong reactivity with Candida cell walls by in situ labelling, reactivity with Pneumocystis was totally absent (Fig. 6). In addition, we directly examined the cell wall content of partially purified Pneumocystis organisms and cultured S. cerevisiae cells using mass spectrometric analysis. No chitin-related oligosaccharides were identified in Pneumocystis, while they were detected in S. cerevisiae; glucan-related oligosaccharides were detected in both (Supplementary Note 6). The combination of these genomic and experimental results demonstrates that Pneumocystis is the first identified member of the fungal kingdom that does not have chitin.\n\nβ-glucans have been identified in the wall of the cyst form of Pneumocystis, but are absent from the more abundant trophic form34,39. Pneumocystis genomes encode all the enzymes required for β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucan synthesis and degradation34,39,40,41 (Supplementary Data 18). However, Pneumocystis species do not have any genes involved in synthesis and degradation of α-glucan, which has been found in many fungi, and which can block innate immune recognition by the β-glucan receptor42.\n\nAlthough all Pneumocystis species have abundant surface glycoproteins, especially Msg, little is known about their glycosylation state and other post-translational modifications. We found that Pneumocystis species encode enzymes required for synthesis of the N- and O-linked glycan core structure (containing up to nine mannose residues), which are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, but lack genes for enzymes residing in the Golgi apparatus, which add mannose outer chains, including all the enzymes comprising mannan polymerase complex I and complex II, and α-1,6-, α-1,2- and α-1,3-mannosyltransferase (Supplementary Data 19). The absence of these enzyme genes suggests that, unlike other fungi, Pneumocystis cell wall proteins including Msg are not highly mannosylated. N-linked profiling of PNGase-F-released N-glycans showed that M5N2 is the predominant N-linked glycan on P. carinii Msg proteins (Supplementary Fig. 13; Supplementary Note 7). Although trace amounts of M6N2 to M9N2 were detected as minor components, mannan type N-glycans with more than nine mannose residues were not detected. Moreover, glycopeptide mapping of Msg tryptic digest by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 31 N-linked glycans in 15 Msg isoforms, all of which carried M5N2 as the predominant component and only 1 of which carried M6N2 as an additional, minor component (Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. 13; Supplementary Data 21). The lack of N-linked outer chain mannan may allow the organism to avoid recognition by innate immune responses, since in Candida such mannosylation is required for recognition by dectin-2, DC-SIGN and the macrophage mannose receptor of dendritic cells, while mutants that can synthesize only the core structure are poorly recognized43,44.\n\nFigure 7: Lack of hyper-mannose (mannan) glycosylation in Pneumocystis.

Full size image\n\nTranscription enrichment during infection\n\nThe expression level of each annotated gene was estimated using RNA-Seq data from three heavily infected animals each for P. murina and P. carinii. Overall, we find evidence of expression for nearly all genes (99%, see Methods) but variation in expression level over 5 orders of magnitude. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA45), we identified functional categories that were enriched in highly expressed genes in each species (Supplementary Data 20; Supplementary Fig. 14). The most highly enriched categories include Msgs and predicted secreted proteins (24–25 other than Msgs in each species). The enrichment of the latter suggests that additional secreted proteins may play an important role during infection. In addition, many functions involved in general metabolism of RNA and proteins, including the RNA RRM and LSM domain, are enriched among highly expressed genes in Pneumocystis.\n\nEach Pneumocystis genome contains an exceptionally high intron density, with an average of 5 introns per gene, similar to only a few fungal genomes such as Cryptococcus with high levels of splicing and only slightly fewer than that in mammalian genomes (7–9 introns per gene)46. This is unusual for highly compacted fungal genomes where intron loss is usually observed, as in S. cerevisiae47 and Microsporidia48. The transcription and splicing process for genes with many introns requires higher energy and cellular resources; this appears correlated to the relative expansion and high-level expression of RRM domain-containing genes (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 14; Supplementary Data 6) and genes involved in spliceosome and mRNA surveillance in all Pneumocystis genomes (Supplementary Data 22). Using the RNA-Seq data, we identified high-level alternative splicing events in P. murina and P. carinii, with intron retention being the most common (detected for 42–49% of introns) and other types being infrequent (≤3% of introns for each type) (Supplementary Data 23). We assembled full-length alternatively spliced isoforms without premature termination codons for 263 and 275 genes of P. murina and P. carinii, respectively, though there is no functional enrichment of these genes. The high rate of intron retention correlates with the presence of all the components of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay machinery in each Pneumocystis species (Supplementary Data 22). Alternative splicing of intron-containing genes could increase transcript diversity and regulate gene transcription or mRNA stability in this otherwise reduced genome, as suggested in earlier studies of P. carinii49 and other organisms50.\n\nAdaption to a host lung environment\n\nOur genome analysis has revealed new insights into the dependence of Pneumocystis on mammalian hosts. Pneumocystis has been identified almost exclusively in the lungs of humans and other mammals, where it remains extracellular but preferentially attaches to type I pneumocytes. Although an environmental reservoir has been hypothesized, there is no convincing evidence of such a reservoir; the current genome data strongly suggest that the entire life cycle occurs in the host. Genes involved in mating and meiosis are present and transcribed in all three Pneumocystis species (Supplementary Data 24), suggesting that sexual reproduction is actively occurring in lung tissue, as postulated in previous studies9,11. Thus, Pneumocystis presumably must obtain nutrients and proliferate in the lung environment, and at the same time it must withstand host defenses for sufficient periods to allow direct transmission to another susceptible host.",

  "latent_9065": "Protests of the national anthem aren’t just happening in the NFL— Tampa Bay Lightning forward J.T. Brown raised his fist in the air during The Star Spangled Banner earlier this month, and also before a pre-season game in September against the Panthers. Brown was of course following in Colin Kaepernick’s footsteps, protesting police brutality and racial injustice in America.\n\nThe move caught the attention of Tampa interim police Chief Brian Dugan, who invited Brown to the academy last week. To his surprise, Brown took him up on the offer only a few days later.\n\n\"I never did discuss with him about race and his fist,\" Dugan said, reports the Tampa Bay Times. \"He can do whatever he wants to do. As a police department, we've always been supporting of people protesting peacefully. I just wanted to give him a different perspective. Not trying to change his mind, just wanted to educate him.”\n\nAnd an education he surely received:\n\nJ.T. Brown spent Friday afternoon getting shot at during a traffic stop. The bullets were blanks, of course, with the Lightning wing role-playing as a police officer in the Tampa Police Department's Citizens Police Academy. The red sedan that Brown and Lightning teammate Gabriel Dumont pulled over was missing a tag. They weren't expecting an ambush. Boom. Boom. Boom. \"You realize every time you leave the (police) car, it could be the last time,\" Dumont said. Said Brown: \"You see what they go through. I have a better understanding, I can guarantee you that.\" […] Brown, Dumont and Vladislav Namestnikov were taken through the academy, offered a few times a year to citizens. They went through mock traffic stops, and attended to reports of domestic violence and drunk and disorderly at a bar.

  "latent_9144": "House Speaker Paul Ryan answers questions during a press conference on Tuesday. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nAs House Republican leaders claim they’re getting ever closer to acquiring the votes they need to pass the American Health Care Act, pressure is mounting on a number of still-reluctant, vulnerable GOP members of Congress to fall in line. As such, those members want to go into hiding. Here is a taste of what it’s like trying to pin down an undecided Republican member of Congress on his or her possible Trumpcare vote this week.\n\nMaine Rep. Bruce Poliquin has yet to declare either his support or opposition for the bill. As he was walking out of the House Republican conference’s morning meeting Tuesday, I asked him if he had arrived at a decision. He said nothing and made a beeline to the restroom. Unfortunately it was the door to the women’s restroom that he had first run to, so he corrected himself and went into the men’s room. When he emerged several minutes later, he was wearing his earbuds and scurried away.\n\nFlorida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, another undecided member, met with Vice President Mike Pence on Monday afternoon. Pence had come up to Capitol Hill to whip health care votes. When Diaz-Balart emerged to a flock of reporters, he had with him his wife and child, to whom he introduced everyone. I am not saying that Diaz-Balart brought them solely as a diversionary tactic, but if he did, it didn’t work. When asked about his health care vote, he merely stated that his focus was on appropriations. (Negotiations on the appropriations bill are complete, but it’s still awaiting a final vote.) So what was Pence’s pitch to him on health care? He said that they were talking about other things. Of course.\n\nNo undecided member is leaning more heavily on the focus-on-appropriations excuse, though, than the Appropriations Committee chairman himself, New Jersey Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen.\n\nFrelinghuysen, whose declaration that he would vote against the first version of the bill in March put a dagger in that effort, cannot be broken this time around. A herd of 15 or 20 reporters followed him down the hall as he exited the Tuesday conference meeting with seemingly everyone getting a chance to ask him a variation of the same health care question. Is he on the fence? “My focus has been on making sure the government doesn’t shut down.” Where does he stand? “The position I’ve taken is the most important thing is keeping the government open.” And so on, ad infinitum.\n\nYou can see why these undecided members, few of whom can truly be undecided, don’t want to go public.\n\nIf you go public with your “no” this late in the game, you unleash unpleasantness upon yourself from party leaders. Missouri Rep. Billy Long announced he was a “no” on Monday, citing the bill’s weakened protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Though House Majority Whip Steve Scalise argued on Monday that this wasn’t a surprise and leaders have known about his reservations for a while, it sure seemed like it shocked them.\n\nIf they’d known for a while, perhaps President Trump wouldn’t have bothered making a phone call to him Monday afternoon shortly after the news broke. If they’d known for a while, perhaps Speaker Paul Ryan wouldn’t have held a lengthy, and seemingly unfriendly, conversation with Long on the House floor during Monday’s afternoon votes. But both of those things happened. Long lingered in the chamber for a while after votes ended, sitting alone in a near-empty chamber in what appeared to be a state of deep thought. Leaders believe that they will restore Billy Long—who represents a safe, R+23 district—to the “yes” column.\n\nIf you’re a public “yes,” meanwhile, you might invite unpleasantness from your constituents—without any assurance that the bill will pass.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Darrell Issa, typically a loyal vote for leadership, now finds himself representing a pure toss-up district comprised of a growing number of minorities along with white professionals who are terrified of Trump. I asked him on Monday if he was still undecided, and he waved me off, saying he was on the phone. (At the very least, he was wearing a Bluetooth headset.)\n\nIf Issa were a “yes”—and I’d expect he probably will fall in line if needed—then what would he have to gain by announcing that to a reporter? It would just inflame his constituents without altering the state of his commitment to leaders. And if leadership ultimately fails to reach 216 votes, what good will it have done for Issa to go on the record as a “yes” when a recorded vote was never held? He would have handed his Democratic opponents’ all the ad material they needed to end his career with nothing to show for it.\n\nAll of this makes it hard to get an accurate whip count that tells us how close the House really is to passing this bill, which they hope to do before members leave for next week’s recess. Public whip counts are converging on a similar number of professed noes: The Huffington Post has 20, the Hill 22, the New York Times and CNN 21 as of this writing. House leaders can only afford to lose 22 if they want to pass the bill, and each of these counts contain a whole lot of undecideds. Leaders would need to sweep just about all of them.\n\nHouse leaders are certainly acting as though they’re only a handful of votes away. If true, that would indicate that most of those undecideds really are closet “yes” votes who want to keep their mouths shut until leaders reach 216.\n\nBut at least one of Monday’s undecideds confirmed that he would be voting against the bill—and it was a big one. Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, a senior member of the House Republican conference who until recently served as chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee—which has health policy jurisdiction—told a local radio show Tuesday morning that he would vote against the AHCA. This might end up being a Frelinghuysen-Level Event that offers cover for less senior members to vote against the bill.\n\nIf so, House leaders are much, much further away than either they or the mysterious undecideds are letting on.",

At least one Chinese embassy worker was killed in the attack and many others were wounded. Shabaab used a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, or a suicide car bomb, to detonate near the hotel after ramming the gates of the complex. A Shabaab spokesman told Reuters that the bombing was in response to “attacks and helicopter bombing against al Shabaab by AMISOM and the Somali government.” [See LWJ report, Shabaab targets Jazeera hotel in Mogadishu.]\n\nHowever, according to the statement from the TIP, which has been translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, the group claims the attack was a “practical response to the aggression of the communist government of China against the Muslims in the forgotten Islamic East Turkistan.” The statement, which was posted to Twitter, continues by saying, “We the mujahideen in Turkistan Islamic Party congratulate the Islamic Ummah for this blessed operation, and we endorse it, and we encourage the Shabaab al Mujahideen Movement in Somalia to carry out more of such jihadi operations.”\n\nThe TIP is largely made up of ethnic Uighurs and fights with the aim of creating an Islamic state in the Chinese province of Xinjiang. It operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, and Syria. It fights alongside the Taliban, al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan, while in Syria, it fights alongside the Al Nusrah Front, al Qaeda’s official branch in the country. The TIP’s leaders and fighters have been killed by Coalition forces in Afghanistan and by US drone strikes in Pakistan.\n\nSeveral top leaders of the TIP have held senior roles in al Qaeda’s leadership. For example, Abdul Shakoor Turkistani, the former emir of the group, was also appointed by al Qaeda to lead its forces in Pakistan’s tribal provinces.

The AG’s department suggests he claimed $176,014 in ineligible expenses and his case should be referred to the RCMP.\n\nZimmer was appointed to the Senate by Paul Martin after a loyal career as a Liberal Party bagman (he was a member for the fundraising committee for Martin’s leadership campaign in 2003). He claims his primary residence is in Winnipeg, but the AG claimed he stayed in Ottawa 613 of 731 days during the audit period.\n\nIn addition to the $47,132 in ineligible living expenses, the AG says he took several round trips to Winnipeg during which no parliamentary business was done, charging the Senate $102,524. Other expenses were ladled on the taxpayer for a board meeting of a corporation of which he was a director, for taxis for personal activities and miscellaneous gifts. A digital camera and computer equipment belonging to the Senate were not returned when he retired in August 2013.\n\nZimmer claims this should all be sub-judice during the Duffy trial, where Senate residency rules are central to the proceedings. He says he is a proud resident of Winnipeg and only ill-health prevented him spending more time there.\n\nHe also complained he only had 500 words to make the case for the defence in the report. But it wouldn’t have mattered if he and his fellow senators had been given the word count of War and Peace.\n\nCanadians have already heard enough — the Senate’s credibility is shot. Parliament might make mistakes that cost millions — the AG’s report itself will cost $21-million. But spending $2,000 on taxis over two years on personal business in a small town like Ottawa is something that everyone can understand. It’s the little things that get you into trouble.\n\nCanadians don’t need the auditor general to tell them that “oversight, accountability and transparency” of senators’ expenses are not adequate. Or that “senators did not always consider the requirement to ensure expenses funded through the public purse were justifiable, reasonable and appropriate.” Or even that 30 senators “incurred expenses that we determined were not in accordance with the applicable Senate rules, policies or guidelines.”\n\nThey know all this intuitively. The revelations in the report will merely pour some gasoline on a bush-fire of anger that is already smouldering across the country.\n\nIt requires an almost ancien regime sense of entitlement to justify claiming a per diem meal allowance when a meal has already been provided. We’re in Marie Antoinette territory when the justification is that it’s not possible to get a reasonable meal on an airplane in Canada.\n\nBut what to do about it all?\n\nA recent study by Richard Albert, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, suggested the Canadian constitution is the world’s most difficult democratic constitution to change by formal amendment. Major changes are “virtually impossible,” he said, to the detriment of our democracy.\n\nThe NDP attempted to starve the Senate of $57 million of funds in a vote on Monday night. It was defeated in the House of Commons, but even it had succeeded the Supreme Court has been clear that letting the Senate wither and die is not an option.\n\nKilling the Senate requires the unanimous consent of all provinces, the court said.\n\nAbolition by stealth may not be an option but that doesn’t mean nothing can be done.\n\nThe question now rests squarely on the prime minister’s desk. Does he want to make the Senate a campaign issue?\n\nTo this point, Stephen Harper has made it sound as if the Senate is a far-away country of which he knows little.\n\n“As you know the Senate is an independent body and the Senate is responsible for its own expenses,” he said, in response to a question in Europe last weekend.\n\nBut the prime minister helped break the Senate by appointing avaricious senators, and now he owns it.\n\nHe could yet resolve to act, if he decides it’s in his own political interests to give Canadians their say. His party, after all, was born from the green shoots of grassroots democracy. How better to display he has retained his populist credentials than by holding a referendum on Senate abolition on the same day as the October general election?\n\nHugh Segal, master of Massey Hall at the University of Toronto, twice proposed such a plebiscite while serving in the Senate in 2005-14.\n\nHe advocates a straight yes or no option that would require 50 per cent plus one support in every province.\n\n“The question should be put honourably to Canadians — we should afford them the chance to have their say. Otherwise, the system rolls on and the general cynicism will spread to other things, which is not a good thing for our democracy,” he said.\n\nFor the Conservatives and NDP, this might even offer the happy coincidence of an energized electorate coming out to the vote.\n\nArmed with an abolition vote from every province, the prime minister would have a mandate that only a brave or foolish provincial premier would block.\n\nA statement by Brad Wall suggests that forces in favour for abolition have been worn down by intransigence in the provinces. The Saskatchewan premier, who introduced a motion for Senate abolition in his own legislature, said the Red Chamber isn’t necessary and isn’t making any contribution.\n\nIt would give the Senate, for the first time ever, the tiniest shred of democratic legitimacy\n\n“(But) I’m not going to campaign for the Senate to be abolished. Everyone knows Saskatchewan’s position. I would like to see other provinces come on board but if they don’t, even in the light of the latest mess, then it’s not really worth the effort to try to change their minds.”\n\nIf an abolition referendum vote fell short, it would kill the abolition debate for a generation and offer a rationale for reform.\n\n“It would give the Senate, for the first time ever, the tiniest shred of democratic legitimacy,” said Segal.\n\nIn the past, the Conservatives have shied away from the idea of a referendum, but its time may have come.\n\nEven recently retired senators are now making the case.\n\nTerry Stratton, the former Conservative senator who was questioned over $5,466 of ineligible expenses, used his response in the AG’s report to campaign for the idea.\n\n“I must implore the prime minister at the time of the next election, in order to limit expense, to have a referendum on the abolition of the Senate,” he wrote.\n\n“This (is) despite the decision of the Supreme Court, who seem to limit their decisions to narrow confines of their interpretation of the law. After all, who governs Canada — the Supreme Court or Parliament?” he wrote.\n\nNational Post\n\n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ",
  "latent_10187": "By Lisa Lambert\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes ruled on Monday that Detroit can continue shutting off water service to non-paying customers, saying his court does not have jurisdiction over the issue and that suspending disconnections for six months could hurt the city's finances.\n\n\"Detroit cannot afford any revenue slippages,\" the judge said, before resuming his ongoing hearing on Detroit's plan to exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy.\n\n\"As it prepares to show the court its plan is feasible... the last thing it needs is this hit to its revenues,\" he said, adding there was a strong correlation between disconnections and the city's collections of delinquent bills.\n\nDetroit's bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 million water affordability fund and a cap on rate increases. It also creates a regional water authority, which Rhodes said could be put in jeopardy by a revenue drop from unpaid bills.\n\nResidents and political activists had asked Rhodes for a six-month restraining order against the shutoffs. Last week, during a break in the bankruptcy hearing, Rhodes heard arguments about the financial and social impacts of cutting off the water of hundreds of homes each day.\n\nThere had been questions over whether or not the judge could issue an order since his role is to decide if Detroit's bankruptcy plan is fair and feasible, not to oversee city operations. On Monday, he said the bankruptcy code does not allow a federal court to \"interfere with the choices a municipality makes in the services it will provide.\"\n\nThis summer Detroit began what some witnesses last week described as an \"aggressive campaign\" to pare down $90 million in overdue bills. After 19,000 homes lost water access, people from across the country sent gallon jugs to the city and residents protested in the streets.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan in August issued a month-long moratorium on shutoffs and implemented a plan to help low-income customers pay their bills that Rhodes called \"bold, commendable and necessarily aggressive.\"\n\nStill, the plaintiffs said current water disconnections, which have run at a rate of around 350 per day since the moratorium ended, put public health at risk, hurt seniors on fixed incomes, and disrupted families with children.\n\nThey also said poor customers needed a more affordable plan than Duggan's, adding that the injunction would fall during freezing-cold winter months when the department already refrains from disconnecting pipes.\n\nWithout collecting on delinquent bill payers, the department would have to increase charges, its chief financial officer testified, adding it relies on monthly billing almost exclusively for revenue. At the same time, the department is currently confronting $42 million in other bad debt.\n\nThe shutoffs accomplished the city's goal of increasing collections, said Darryl Latimer, the customer service chief of Detroit's Department of Water and Sewerage Department.\n\nDuring June and July, the peak months of the shutoffs, the department collected $1.7 million in money owed. In August, during the moratorium, collections were only $200,000. At the peak, the department disconnected around 900 homes a day, Latimer said.\n\n(Editing by Susan Heavey)",

  "latent_10317": "(Photo: Strixcode/Dreamstime)\n\nNick Kristof claims liberals practice the family values that conservatives only preach. The data show otherwise.\n\nEditor’s Note: This piece was originally published by the Institute for Family Studies. It is adapted here with permission.\n\nConservatives are family-values hypocrites, Nick Kristof recently argued at the New York Times. They talk about marriage, family, and traditional values, but, in reality, they have difficulty living up to their professed values. In fact, it’s actually “liberals [who] practice the values that conservatives preach.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly, Kristof is on to something when it comes to members of the political class, such as Newt Gingrich, Roy Moore, and Donald Trump. But the story is rather different when one looks at ordinary families across America. In fact, over at Politico, we take issue with Kristof’s argument. It turns out that Kristof is largely conflating family problems in the South with family problems among conservative families. (This is what scholars call an “ecological fallacy.”)\n\nWhen we look at data from the General Social Survey, we find that Republican families are actually happier and more stably married. For instance, Republicans parents today are more likely to be in their first marriage, compared with independent and Democratic parents, as the figure below indicates.\n\nWe also find that the Republican advantage in family stability is true for college-educated and less-educated Americans, for more- and less-religious Americans, for whites, and for Northerners as well as Southerners. In fact, when it comes to the South, as we note in Politico:\n\nThe relatively fragile state of families in the Republican South does not apply as much to individual Republicans in the South. Indeed, in both the North and the South, Republican parents are at least 9 percentage points more likely to be in their first marriage, compared with Democrats and independents. [This means]: Just because the Republican South has more family fragility does not mean that Republican families are fragile. In fact, Republican parents in the South are more likely to be in their first marriage than Democratic and independent parents in the North.\n\nBut does the Republican advantage in family stability hold up in a multivariate context? Yes, it does. As the table above indicates, even after controlling for region, education, race, ethnicity, religiosity, and age, data from the General Social Survey still indicate that Republican parents are more likely to be in a first marriage.\n\nOur research, then, suggests an “elective affinity” between Republicans and a marriage-centered lifestyle. For a number of reasons — cultural, economic, and psychological — Republicans today appear more likely to have their children in marriage, to remain stably married, and to be happy in their marriages. In other words, most Republicans don’t live their lives like Trump or Gingrich. The question, of course, is whether “this Republican family advantage will persist if Republicans keep anointing leaders who don’t practice the family values the party has preached.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Marriage Matters\n\nThe Only Way to Rebuild the Marriage Culture\n\nWhy Liberal Elites are Strangely Traditional",

A student sample (N = 1,104) reported on their use of physical aggression and controlling behavior, to partners and to same-sex non-intimates. Contrary to the male control theory, women were found to be more physically aggressive to their partners than men were, and the reverse pattern was found for aggression to same-sex non-intimates. Furthermore, there were no substantial sex differences in controlling behavior, which significantly predicted physical aggression in both sexes. IPV was found to be associated with physical aggression to same-sex non-intimates, thereby demonstrating a link with aggression outside the family. Using Johnson's typology, women were more likely than men to be classed as \"intimate terrorists,\" which was counter to earlier findings. Overall, these results do not support the male control theory of IPV. Instead, they fit the view that IPV does not have a special etiology, and is better studied within the context of other forms of aggression.

  "latent_10463": "The coroner in St. Louis has run out of facilities to store dead bodies.\n\nA fire chief in West Virginia is haunted by a child, “staring at us with a blank face,” as she attempted to revive his father.\n\nIn the small New Mexican town of Rio Arriba, one man has lost his brother and much of his social circle to overdose deaths and prison. He blames poverty, hunger and insecure housing ― a constellation of injustices that he sums up as “historical trauma” ― on the high rates of addiction in his majority Native and Latino community.\n\nDuring HuffPost’s Listen to America tour at the end of 2017, reporters encountered stories ― some heartbreaking, some triumphant ― of opioids and their effects. The fearsome impact of this public health crisis weighed heavily on people’s minds in every town HuffPost’s bus visited. It is a truth so universally acknowledged as to seem cliche: Overdoses are sweeping the country.\n\nOpioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2014, and have only continued to rise in recent years. In total, more than 63,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2016, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And that is likely an undercount, due to investigations that delay results.\n\n“This crisis has been brewing for a long time,” said Nancy Campbell, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, who has published several books on drug policy and treatment.\n\n“We have to ask ourselves why it came in the form that it did, when it did,” Campbell said. “Those answers do not lie entirely with the medical profession and with changes in how we treat and think about chronic pain. We have to look at deindustrialization and the changes in our lives in different regions in the country.”\n\nTo that end, HuffPost sent reporters to the front lines of the opioid crisis across the country, to talk with people in the throes of addiction, as well as the men and women trying to pick up the pieces in a landscape devoid of widespread and accessible treatment options.\n\nThere were some reasons to hope things would get better: A nurse who became addicted to Percocet after knee surgery found an outpatient program that has her clean for the first time in 20 years; an east Tennessee native who used to drive several hours a day to North Carolina to get a dose of methadone now has a clinic closer to home, thanks to a relenting local zoning board.\n\nPreviously resistant communities are enacting policies that save lives: equipping local emergency personnel with Narcan, the opioid overdose reversal drug, and enacting “Good Samaritan” laws in which those who report overdoses to the police will not be charged with drug-related offenses.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion provision has made addiction treatment affordable for many people who couldn’t pay for it in the past. And medication-assisted treatment, like methadone and buprenorphine, once rejected by abstinence-only treatment programs, are gaining support among lawmakers in states that have been hit hard by opioids.\n\nStill, Campbell doesn’t think policy has progressed much.\n\n“We’ve evolved all kinds of new strategies, which are actually based on old strategies, like drug courts and diversion,” she said. “We’re trying to meet that problem with slightly more benevolent, but still quite punitive, responses.”\n\nIn the meantime, people keep dying.\n\nHow We Got Here\n\nWhile the opioid crisis has been getting steadily worse for the last several years, many experts identify the 1990s as the inflection point.\n\nThe movement then to treat pain patients more compassionately dovetailed with aggressive opioid marketing from drug companies, which touted the drugs as safe and non-addictive.\n\n“There is a growing literature showing that these drugs can be used for a long time, with few side effects and that addiction and abuse are not a problem,” Dr. Russell Portenoy, then a pain specialist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, told The New York Times in 1993.\n\nThat turned out to be untrue ― and not based on much evidence to begin with.\n\n“Everybody kind of got on that bandwagon before adequate research was done to really understand the long-term consequences of opioid use,” said Dr. Michael Hooten, an anesthesiologist and pain clinic physician at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDoctors across the country increasingly prescribed painkillers to patients, with annual non-cancer prescriptions for OxyContin, a popular opioid, increasing almost tenfold between 1997 and 2002, from 670,000 to 6.2 million prescriptions.\n\nBut in many cases, opioid prescriptions weren’t well suited to the conditions for which they were being prescribed. In long-term studies of opioid use for lower back pain, for example, opioids don’t work very well at relieving pain.\n\nAs opioids became much more prevalent in society, many who took them also noticed and enjoyed the obvious side effects. Opioids have intense effects on the brain, including facilitating sleep and reducing anxiety, leaving many people to feel a sense of well-being after taking them.\n\n“Those may be the people who need the most help,” Hooten said, about those who use opioids for emotional relief or mental health reasons. “Suffering is a part of chronic pain. Opioids are great at treating that suffering component.”\n\nIt’s that relief from suffering that appealed to many Americans, who perhaps didn’t realize they were plagued by more than a physical injury. One man in recovery who spoke to HuffPost described the first time he took a painkiller ― a half dose of Lortab, he said ― as a revelation. “Not only did it make me feel better, it made me feel good,” he said. “I had a lot of energy ― I was walking on clouds, euphoric.”\n\nMedical professionals argue that unaddressed mental health challenges ― from mild depression to schizophrenia ― coupled with a lifetime of poor access to proper health care underlies much of the current crisis.\n\n“Most of the drug users I meet here and everywhere I’ve been, have underlying mental health stuff that’s not being treated,” said Hillary Brown, the founder of Steady Collective, a harm reduction program based in Asheville, North Carolina. “And if they had more money, they would be getting legal versions of the illegal stuff they’re using.”\n\n“We don’t live in a country that sides with the poor,” Brown added. “So we don’t have health care and we don’t have mental health care.”\n\nFinding Treatment That Works\n\nThe punitive social response to the crack-cocaine era of the 1980s favored by politicians and law enforcement casts a shadow on the present-day approach to the opioid epidemic. Back then, fear about crime and drug-addicted babies fueled a series of drug policy changes that targeted city-dwelling black Americans, and filled jails and prisons with drug offenders.\n\nIn addition to the racial injustice of disproportionately incarcerating black Americans, the carceral response to drugs in the 1980s meant that the United States never developed addiction treatment systems to adequately address the current opioid epidemic.\n\nWhat that infrastructure would look like is a tougher question. Integrating addiction treatment into general health care settings, where addiction could be treated like other chronic conditions, would be ideal, but it’s a big lift, explained Tom Hill, vice president of addiction and recovery at the National Council for Behavioral Health.\n\nTreatment is also completely counter to the way the medical system traditionally framed recovery from addiction.\n\n“Initially the treatment systems were designed with addiction as an acute illness,” said Hill, who has been in recovery for 25 years. “You get people in, you fix them up and you get them out.”\n\nToday, the consensus of health care professionals is that’s not a realistic depiction of addiction, which is a chronic, often lifelong, condition.\n\n“There’s no one-size-fits-all approach,” Campbell said. “Oftentimes people don’t know what treatment approach will work for them and they have to try more than one, and more than one time. Very few people find an approach that puts them into long-term recovery the first time.”\n\nGiven that the majority of people with addiction will need to attempt recovery multiple times, accessibility and affordability are key.\n\nThe biggest takeaway from HuffPost reporters during the Listen to America tour was that the story of opioid addiction in America isn’t a monolithic narrative. In some places, like in New Mexico, opioid addiction has been raging for decades, long before doctors started overprescribing pain pills. In other areas, like Montana, opioid addiction is a concern, but not as big of a crisis as meth addiction, which started in the 1990s and never left.\n\nAddressing the unique addiction profiles of different states, cities and among different demographics is something that keeps Campbell up at night.\n\n“Historically most drug crisis situations have been local,” she said. “They’ve been confined to particular areas, particular places, particular populations. Whenever we represent them as national, we probably lose our best chance to understand them.”\n\n― Erin Schumaker and Meredith Melnick\n\nHuffPost is hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears ― and what it means to be American today.\n\n‘Children are the forgotten victims’\n\nDamon Dahlen / HuffPost Fire Chief Jan Rader speaks to reporters about the opioid epidemic in her community while sitting in her office in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nHUNTINGTON, W.Va. ― “I had maybe five years on the job, the first time I noticed a child watching us,” Huntington Fire Chief Jan Rader told HuffPost in September, as she drove through her town. “His father had overdosed on the couch.”\n\n“We started doing CPR, and about 10 minutes in, I look over and his son is in the next room. He was probably four years old, sitting on the floor, staring at us with a blank face.”\n\nRader, featured in the Netflix documentary Heroin(e), is on the front lines of the opioid crisis that has been decimating communities across America.\n\nHer team of firefighters are first responders when 911 is called to the scene of an overdose in Huntington. West Virginia is one of the epicenters for the opioid crisis, with the highest overdose death rate in the country in 2015. Huntington has been hit particularly hard, with one overdose outbreak last year that saw more than a dozen overdoses happen in the area in one five-hour period alone.\n\n“That really bothered me for a long time,” Rader said of the young boy watching his father overdose. “But that’s the norm now.”\n\nAs a firefighter for more than two decades ― and the first woman fire chief in the state, as well as the only woman on her staff of around 90 firefighters ― Rader has seen the opioid epidemic worsen first hand: West Virginia’s overdose death rate has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.\n\nOne of her biggest concerns is for kids. She estimates that 70 percent of the time her team responds to the scene of an overdose, a child is involved.\n\n“Children are the forgotten victims here,” Rader said. “Children who grow up watching mom and dad overdose, they’ve experienced a whole lot of trauma.”\n\nWhen it comes to opioid abuse, children can be affected in any number of ways. Rader said she’s seen kids as young as 12 overdose themselves. And some children have been affected before they were even born: An estimated 21,732 American infants in 2012 were born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, a drug withdrawal syndrome resulting from mothers using opioids during pregnancy.\n\nBut most often, kids are simply silent witnesses to their parents’ drug abuse ― an experience that can have a long-term negative impact on their development.\n\n“They’re growing up in this environment,” Rader said. “Sometimes they’re playing video games in the next room like [parents using is] no big deal. You go into a house [where] there are children, there’s not even a bed, they’re sleeping on the floor, there’s no food in the refrigerator.”\n\nAs firefighters, there is relatively little Rader’s team can do for kids. One local program, Handle With Care, allows law enforcement to send a note to a child’s school if they were present at a police or emergency incident, to let educators know that the child may need some extra support the next day.\n\nBut overall, local groups in Huntington ― from Boys and Girls Clubs and churches, to schools and Child Protective Services ― have been “so overwhelmed,” Rader said, as the drug epidemic has grown so rapidly.\n\nAnother incident from last year continues to haunt Rader. After her team was called in to a gas station for a suspected overdose, they arrived to find a man passed out in the front seat of his car. He had apparently been driving when he overdosed with his three children in the back seat. His eight-year-old son had had to lean into the front to place the car into park, so that it wouldn’t roll away.\n\nAs medics assisted the father, who had awoken belligerent and confused, Rader’s firefighters distracted the kids by taking them into their truck to play.\n\nLong after, Rader couldn’t stop thinking how this would affect the kids down the line.\n\n“What child should have to live like that?” Rader asked. “No kid should have to see that trauma.”\n\n― Sarah Ruiz-Grossman\n\n***\n\n‘You can’t go to no drug house if you’ve got Meta House on your arm’\n\nDamon Dahlen / HuffPost Before her commencement from Meta House, an all-female residential drug and alcohol treatment program, Edna Boykins got a tattoo of the organization’s logo on her right forearm.\n\nMILWAUKEE ― Edna Boykins sits in a room she used to hate and unleashes her characteristic cackle, a loud series of staccato “Ha ha has.” These days the 54-year-old Milwaukee native can’t stop smiling, but less than a year ago the space with stained grey carpets and plastic chairs stacked in a corner would have filled her with anger.\n\nLast November, when Boykins started coming to daily group sessions to fight her opioid addiction, she scowled at the walls decorated with the word “mindfulness” and a poster that says “Stages of Change.”\n\n“I was a very evil, nasty person when I came here,” she said, wearing a baggy navy blue T-shirt and draping one arm casually alongside the top of a couch. “[If a counselor] would tell me they loved me I’d tell ‘em ‘F [you.]’ I was an ‘F ‘em’ person.”\n\nCounselors meet in this room every day with the 35 women enrolled in Meta House’s all-female residential drug and alcohol treatment program. The patients live in two brick houses across the street ― many with their children, who also have access to services ― for an average of 90 days. Meta House, which also offers outpatient treatment, is a lifeline for many in a city that’s been so badly hit by the opioid crisis that heroin deaths have increased by 495 percent since 2005.\n\nBoykins should have been dead by the time she enrolled in the program, she said. After having knee surgery in 2000, the nurse and mother of three became addicted to Percocet. After her month-long prescription ran out, Boykins, who had already battled alcohol addiction for just over two decades, started buying pills on the street. By 2014, she was mixing Percocet with OxyContin, methadone, clonazepam and Xanax. She would often snort 120 pills in three days.\n\nIn 2016, Boykins turned to heroin because it was “cheaper and plentiful.” “It’s everywhere, it’s in this neighborhood,” she said, pointing out the window. She shakes her right leg vigorously and tucks a hand between the thigh slits in her jeans. “I would hear my heart beat real fast like it was going to explode ... I would hit my chest like that was going to stop [it.]”\n\n“The sick was out of this world,” she said, resting her left hand on her head. “I would have the runs and my body would ache. I’d be nauseated and totally depressed, begging God to kill me. I was getting thoughts of trying to sell my body, but I never did that in my life.”\n\nBoykins felt miserable, and though she had heard bad things about Meta House ― women in detox told her “they’ll work you like a slave” ― she liked that the program forced her to wake up at 6:30 a.m. and attend daily group meetings. Once Boykins dropped her bad attitude she began to learn coping mechanisms for her anger and addiction. “If you’re having thoughts of using, count the little circles in the wall and it will distract you,” she said, pointing at the dotted ceiling. “The mind is not going to hold on that long.”\n\nShe recently moved out of the Meta House residence and now lives in an apartment about a mile away, as part of organization’s transitional living program. Before Boykins’ commencement, she got the organization’s logo ― a heart framing the outline of a mother holding a baby ― tattooed on her right forearm.\n\n“[I told myself] If I ever thought about using again I would look at [it] and say, ‘How dare you try to use with that on you? You can’t do that,’” she said, letting out a chuckle. “You can’t go to no drug house if you’ve got Meta House on your arm.”\n\n― Angelina Chapin\n\n***\n\n‘Individuals graduate our program, return back to their community and don’t have their hierarchy of needs met’\n\nRIO ARRIBA, N.M. ― Ambrose Baros is well acquainted with the death that courses through small-town America. In 2011, he lost his brother Bobby to a heroin overdose. Addiction was a fact of life in his community, and at the time it had already taken a heavy toll on his inner circle.\n\n“My brother’s passing was the real tragedy, but I had seen my friends quickly become addicted,” said Baros. “A lot of them passed away from drug overdoses, a lot of them were in and out of jail, struggled with drug use and still struggle with it today.”\n\nBaros was raised in northern New Mexico’s Rio Arriba County, a rugged expanse of craggy mountain peaks, sleepy towns and scenic tribal lands about the size of Connecticut, where the overdose death rate has regularly ranked among the highest in the nation.\n\nRio Arriba has been grappling with an opioid problem for longer than most other rural communities, beginning in the 1970s when Vietnam War veterans returned home addicted to heroin. In the 1990s, the influx of prescription opioids that ripped through the rest of the country only compounded the longstanding problem.\n\nThis devastation has created an intergenerational “ripple effect,” said Barros, as children grow up in a climate where opioid addiction is rampant. There are few people in Rio Arriba today who haven’t been affected by the epidemic in some way.\n\n“Drug use was almost a norm,” said Baros. “It really sent a message that it was accepted.”\n\nIn 2014, Baros took over at Hoy Recovery, where he now serves as executive director. The 40-acre, 48-bed residential addiction treatment facility sits at the end of a dirt road in Velarde, a rustic hamlet with a population of around 500.\n\nAlthough Hoy was initially founded in the 1970s as a 12-step facility for alcoholism, it has changed with the times and now includes a comprehensive inpatient program for people suffering from a variety of substance use disorders.\n\nLargely Hispanic and Native American communities in Rio Arriba once subsisted on agriculture, but Baros believes a systemic lack of opportunitysai has fueled a “historical trauma,” which has led to pervasive drug use and addiction.\n\nThe county’s poverty rate has hovered around 25 percent for the past few years, nearly 10 percent higher than the national average. And although unemployment in the county is only slightly above the national rate, quality, high-paying jobs are few and far between.\n\n“There’s a family despair that comes from that environment image, where even if their loved one does get well, where’s he gonna live? He can’t afford to buy his own home,” said Baros. “Where’s he gonna work in this town? There are no opportunities. The school system is horrific. The dropout rate is so high.”\n\nAll of this has helped create a culture of hopelessness, which makes long-term recovery incredibly difficult, Baros said.\n\n“A lot of times individuals graduate our program, return back to their community and don’t have their hierarchy of needs met. They don’t have secure housing, they don’t have secure employment, and then it’s a stressful environment to begin with, so they don’t have the skills needed to really overcome all of that,” said Baros. “We need to do a more sophisticated system on the outcomes, one that can rate the quality of life, not just remaining abstinent from alcohol or drugs, but what does your recovery look like?”\n\nBaros has developed a holistic treatment program at Hoy, which incorporates a mix of mainstream medical practices, job and skills training and indigenous practices. There are familiar aspects of recovery ― daily group sessions and clinical appointments with counselors or therapists. But there’s also a sheep shearing operation and an egg farm.\n\nBaros believes hands-on work can be therapeutic, and gives some patients a chance to claim a sense of purpose that addiction may have taken. Hoy also has a spiritual care counselor and two on-site temazcal lodges where patients can partake in traditional sweat lodge ceremonies.\n\nWhile these approaches can help patients address some of the root causes of their addiction, Baros says the challenge is making it stick when Hoy’s clients return home.\n\nTo do that, he believes Rio Arriba must invest in a more robust jobs and housing infrastructure, which can give recovering addicts access to a variety of tools to help them resist triggers for drug use.\n\n“If we don’t offer them supportive housing and employment, then that despair sets in and they don’t see any other life,” said Barros. “And if they don’t see any other life, their body can’t really process that and they go to what makes them happy and comfortable, and that’s drugs.”\n\n― Nick Wing\n\n***\n\nGetting methadone ‘is basically another job’\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. ― At 5:30 a.m., street lights illuminate the parking lot of Western Carolina Treatment Center in the morning dark. The place is bustling and packed to capacity. But for the lack of sunlight, it would seem like the middle of the day.\n\nRusted out beaters pull in alongside luxury SUVs. Teenagers with ear spacers amble up the steps into the clinic alongside well-dressed women in their 60s. Everyone is quiet, everything is orderly. The methadone clinic building has a narrow waiting room and a line of windows like a bank or DMV. One by one, patients are called to a counter, where they take their medicine in front of an employee. Once a month, they are drug tested and meet with a counselor for 10 or 15 minutes. If they pass, they can continue.\n\nThose who pass drug tests can apply for “levels” ― a week’s worth of pills to make the visit weekly rather than daily. But for those on methadone who use marijuana, for example, a daily visit is required.\n\nAn older man, who declined to stop for an interview, said there were definitely stories to tell about opioids in the region. “Whether they’re stories you’d want to hear, I can’t say.”\n\nSam, who asked that we withhold his last name, a 36-year-old from a small town in east Tennessee more than an hour from the clinic, has spent a year waking up at 3:30 a.m. every morning. Along with two friends, he makes the trip across state lines. Six days a week, he has picked up his dose of methadone, only to turn around and get back home by 8 a.m. and make it to work on time.\n\n“It’s basically another job,” he said.\n\nHe knows the clinic’s hours and all of their rules. He knows how other area clinics operate ― which ones staff “dick gazers” who go into the bathroom to watch you provide a urinalysis sample, and which ones staff sympathetic people who treat him like a human being.\n\nHe knows, to a penny, how much this ride to North Carolina costs him and his friends ― $20 a day for gas and tolls, six days a week, plus $91 a week each to use the clinic. Add in the four speeding tickets they’d receive every year, and the drive started to get pricey.\n\n“By yourself, it would cost close to $220 to $250 a week,” he said. “But that’s still a lot cheaper than doing drugs.”\n\nHe’s been following the local struggle to get a methadone clinic opened in Gray, Tennessee, not too far from his house. It looks like, despite significant controversy, that might finally happen.\n\n“They’ve been trying to get a clinic here for 7 to 10 years and people have picketed ― even gas station attendants say ‘we don’t want people like that here,’” Sam said. “Not knowing that they already have people like that and if they had a little help, it would keep them from stealing.”\n\n“They hear the word ‘methadone’ and just hear the ‘meth’ part,” he added.\n\nPills have been around for a decade at least, but the past two years have led to a big problem in east Tennessee, and the last six months have been particularly stark.\n\n“Heroin is absolutely killing this area right now,” he said. “People who used to take pills are snorting heroin and now it’s only a matter of time before they’re doing it intravenously.”\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Department of Health, the state ranks second for opioid consumption in the country. And east Tennessee has been hardest hit of any region. Despite the need, there is a dearth of methadone clinics in the area.\n\nIt is little wonder that when HuffPost visited the Asheville clinic in late September, more than half the license plates in the parking lot were from Tennessee, even though the state’s border is an hour away at its closest point. Sam pointed out notecards that are posted inside the waiting room, asking for rides from various towns in Tennessee in exchange for some gas money.\n\nSam had always been a big drinker. He started getting ulcers ― the worst pain he’d ever felt in his life. One of his best friends, a buddy he grew up with, kept offering him pills, but he always said he didn’t want to “be that guy” ― a pillhead, like so many of the kids from his town. His friend offered him half a Lortab ― a mixture of acetaminophen and codeine that is particularly common in the state ― and Sam finally relented, he said. The high was a revelation: It not only relieved his pain, it made him feel better about life. A depression lifted.\n\n“Not only did it make me feel better, it made me feel good,” he said. “I had a lot of energy ― I was walking on clouds, euphoric.”\n\nNext thing he knew, he’d moved up his dose and then moved on to the more powerful Oxycodone. About a year ago, Sam couldn’t take it anymore and turned to methadone and it’s been pretty successful for him, he said. He just wishes he could get it closer to home.\n\nIn early October, Sam got his wish: The Overmountain Recovery Center opened, after much controversy, close to his house in Gray, Tenn. At the time, after a week in the new clinic, Sam reported that it was “a blessing.”\n\nBut in the world of drug recovery, nothing is ever simple.\n\nAfter HuffPost followed with him again recently, Sam said had sworn off Overmountain. He had a falling out with a staff member, who Sam said accused him of dealing drugs because of an incident in which he shared the bathroom with another patient. Sam’s work schedule ― construction jobs that take him out of town ― didn’t work with the clinic’s counseling session requirement.\n\nIn another incident, he claimed the clinic cut his dose in half ― from 150 mg to 70 mg ― without any warning.\n\nDeanna Irick, Overmountain’s clinical director, declined to comment on the details of Sam’s account, citing patient privacy concerns. “I think that’s a disgruntled patient that you’re dealing with,” she said.\n\nIrick noted that Overmountain’s drug testing policies follow state requirements and pointed to the center’s high standards as one of its strengths. “I think we’re one of the best treatment centers out there,” she said. “We’re saving a lot of lives.”\n\nSam had hoped Overmountain would be a lifesaver ― a nearby clinic that could help him stay in recovery ― until it developed what felt like other types of hoops to jump through. Sam didn’t have to face a daily two-hour commute, but monthly drug tests came with a $20 fee if you fail (he’s a regular pot smoker), strict therapy requirements were difficult, and the staff wasn’t willing to work with his unique circumstances, he said.\n\nHe’s been off of methadone for a week now, which he describes as “rough,” but so far successful. He said he’s got to have a strong mind, as he doesn’t know what else he’s supposed to do.\n\n“I’ve got to work,” he said.\n\n― Meredith Melnick\n\n***\n\n‘I’ve done this since 1975. Never seen anything like this’\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Dr. Mary E. Case, the chief medical examiner in St. Louis County, started using a portable refrigerated morgue -- which is designed for natural disasters -- to store the bodies of people killed by opioids.\n\nST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. ― Dr. Mary E. Case is used to handling dead bodies. Just not this many.\n\nAs the chief medical examiner in St. Louis County, her office has a typical indoor refrigeration unit, where they’ve stored bodies for years. It holds 20 bodies, which used to be adequate. But the recent uptick in opioid-related deaths has forced her to look outside that icebox.\n\n“It’s a phenomenon. We’ve always had drugs, but there’s never been anything like what we see today,” Case said in an interview at her office this fall. “I’ve done this since 1975. Never seen anything like this.”\n\nAbout five years ago, St. Louis County obtained a portable refrigerated trailer. It’s a portable morgue, intended to be used for circumstances like natural disasters.\n\nBut it’s come in very handy for the opioid crisis.\n\n“We have people that die in hospitals,” Case said. “We have people that are dumped at hospitals; we have people that are found dead in parking lots; we have people that are found in restaurant restrooms and gas station restrooms; people that are found at home. There’s just lots of different scenarios.”\n\nDuring one month earlier this year, there were just five days in which they stored fewer than 20 bodies, their typical maximum. As a result, they stored multiple bodies on the same cart, which made it much more difficult to perform autopsies.\n\n“It’s just the numbers. We have more bodies, particularly on certain occasions, than we have room to store them in our storage facility, which is a cooler,” Case said. “So if we have too many bodies, we put them into the trailer.”\n\nThe refrigerator, branded with the name of St. Louis County and featuring a license plate indicating its association with the health department, sits out back of the medical examiner’s office, where it takes up a couple of parking spots.\n\nBut even with the additional space offered by the trailer, more bodies are coming in and they’re staying longer, Case said.\n\nSometimes the bodies aren’t picked up by funeral homes, because it’s a death the family wasn’t expecting.\n\n“They might not have any money to get a funeral home. So that body may stay here for a week, and that’s a huge problem. The bodies come in, and they stay,” Case said.\n\nIf they stay too long, she said, there’s a solution. “We contract with a crematorium.”\n\nMany of the people dying of opioid overdoses, Case said, “don’t have jobs, they don’t have any insurance, and they may have families that are stressed by the problems that are created by the drug usage of that member.”\n\nAs a result of the surge in deaths and the budget issues that has caused, Case has had to think hard about the way her office spends money.\n\n“Most medical examiner offices autopsy all these people, and they have literally decimated their budgets with that. They can’t keep up,” she said. “There’s so few forensic pathologists that it’s not like you can hire one whenever you need it ― there’s not enough to go around.”\n\nCase made the decision to not autopsy every body that comes in, especially if it’s pretty clear how they died. She said they just can’t afford it.\n\n“When we have somebody in the bathroom with a needle sticking in their arm, we don’t autopsy that person. Many medical examiners will. They’ll say, ‘Oh, they might have died of something else,’” Case said. “The reality is, no, they probably died of that.”\n\n― Ryan Reilly\n\n***\n\n‘The best part is giving people hope when they feel like there’s not any’\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. ― Terri Williams-Glass offers a warm smile as she enters the common room at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Addiction Recovery Program. She spots Michael Grammas, a former patient of the recovery program who is now sober and working as an advocate for others living with addiction issues.\n\nThey move off to the side near a set of motivational wall art and exchange pleasantries about work and kids. Grammas had stopped by to say hello to the physicians and employees of the program, Williams-Glass included. After a few moments, they part ways: Grammas back to his life ― one where he no longer depends on opioids to get him through each day ― and Williams-Glass back to helping others who are still struggling to get to that point.\n\nShe takes a seat and stares across the oblong wooden table out toward a small group of couches located in the middle of the room. The loungers are empty now, but soon they’ll be filled with current patients as they take a break from their recovery work, which includes detoxing, group therapy sessions and outside meetings and counseling.\n\nTears pool in Williams-Glass’ eyes but don’t leak over the brim as she thinks about the individuals she’s currently working with and those she’s helped in the past.\n\n“The best part is giving people hope when they feel like there’s not any,” she said with a thick voice.\n\nWilliams-Glass has been with UAB for more than two decades, starting with the university’s Treatment Alternatives for Safer Communities (TASC) force, which works through drug courts to help people living with addiction receive job counseling and other resources. She continued her work on TASC as she got her masters. She’s now the clinical director at UAB’s Addiction Recovery Program, where she trains staff and develops programs to help those seeking treatment from the facility.\n\nOn any given day she could interact with patients as they do their recovery work or help train clinicians on best practices. She also heads up UAB’s Addiction Scholars program, which trains hospital staff members on substance use disorders and how to recognize them when patients enter the emergency room.\n\nThe center, Williams-Glass says, is just one small piece of the puzzle when it comes to solving the addiction crisis in Birmingham, where more than 240 people died from overdoses in 2016. She glances back at the bedrooms located behind her, each door pulled tightly closed. There are 20 beds total that serve in-house patients. The center also assists approximately 30 people who once stayed at the facility and are now in an outpatient program.\n\nAnd while those slots are a long way from eradicating the opioid epidemic, Williams-Glass says she’s happy to do her part. Her hopes for the future include greater access to care, so more people can get the help that they need. This includes equality of care, “regardless of whether people have insurance or their financial standing,” she said.\n\n“People keep dying and this crisis is only starting,” she said. “I’m just trying to save as many as I can.”\n\n― Lindsay Holmes\n\n***\n\n‘Sometimes it feels like knives being pushed through my feet up through my hips’\n\nHayley Miller/HuffPost Tami Duncan, 51, is among the chronic pain patients in Montana who say opioid regulations have hurt their quality of life.\n\nGREAT FALLS, Mont. ―Tami Duncan feels like she’s standing in a pot of boiling water.\n\nThe 51-year-old mother of two can barely get out of bed, and she knows the four-hour round trip journey from Havre to Great Falls on the stiff seats of her son’s old pickup truck will only exacerbate her chronic back, leg and hip pain.\n\nHours later, Duncan slid a folder of her medical records across the table at an Applebee’s in Great Falls. She was eager to explain one of the less talked about side effects of the crackdown on opioids: chronic pain patients like herself left stranded by doctors who refuse to prescribe large enough doses of opioids to relieve their pain.\n\nDuncan’s son Taran, a burly 20-year-old in cowboy boots, looked on from the chair next to her.\n\n“Just because we look normal on the outside, it doesn’t match what’s going on inside,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it feels like knives being pushed through my feet up through my hips.”\n\nFor more than two decades, Duncan took opiates to treat pain from degenerative back, leg and hip injuries first brought on by a car accident. After undergoing back surgery in 1997 and dozens of epidural shots in the years since then, the pain not only continued but worsened.\n\nUntil 2007, Duncan had a full-time job delivering mail, but the physical work became too painful to continue. These days, she’s limited to logging a few hours each week as a lunchroom cashier at the local high school.\n\n“There’s a lot of things I don’t do anymore,” said Duncan, wincing as she readjusts in her chair. “Taran cooks, cleans, does laundry, drives me.” Her eyes well up. “He takes really good care of his mom.”\n\nTaran takes a more matter-of-fact approach to caring for his ailing mother.\n\n“If what the doctors are saying is true, she’s going to be in a wheelchair in a couple years,” he said. “I ain’t the type of kid that’s going to put her in a rest home or anything.”\n\nWhile Duncan would prefer to be off medications altogether, opiates offered her rare, much-needed relief, even if that respite only lasted for a few hours each day.\n\nLife changed for Duncan in 2016, when the CDC revised its opioid prescribing guidelines in response to a nationwide spike in drug overdoses. Suddenly, Duncan’s opioid prescription was slashed dramatically, she said.\n\nDuncan ― terrified by the pain she knew would return with less medication ― pleaded with her doctor to return her to her normal opioid dose. Her doctor refused. In response to Duncan’s repeated requests for a higher dosage, she said staff at her doctor’s office accused her of lying about her pain to get more drugs.\n\nFollowing the CDC’s new guidelines, which recommend prescribing the lowest dose of opioids for the shortest timespan, many doctors began weaning their patients off opioids in favor of non-drug treatments such as intensive physical therapy. But Duncan said alternative treatments didn’t work for her. She’s still prescribed her old medication, but at a much lower dose.\n\n“It was awful,” Duncan said about withdrawing from opiates. “I was vomiting. I had diarrhea. At night, I would be ringing wet with sweat. I had fever, chills. I didn’t think it was ever going to stop.”\n\nIn central Montana alone, there are dozens of chronic pain patients struggling to live their lives without opioids. Duncan is grateful to have her husband, children and friends for support, but not everyone is so lucky. For those without support, isolation, coupled with the stigma patients face for relying on opiates, is almost worse than the pain itself.\n\n“A lot of people think we’re just using them to get high,” Duncan said, adding that several of her friends and fellow chronic pain patients have died by suicide in the last few years. “We’re not. We use them to try to have a semblance of a life.”\n\n“You have to get pissed off at your pain,” she added. “Either you’re going to win and take your life back, or you’re going to let your pain win and you’re going to die. I’ve got a 23-year-old daughter who’s getting married in August. By God, I’m going to be there.”\n\nWhen lunch is finished, Duncan and Taran get ready to head back north. As Taran helped her into his truck, Duncan took a deep breath and prepared for the long journey ahead.\n\n― Hayley Miller\n\n***\n\n‘When someone knows who they are, it’s hard to addict them to something’\n\nDamon Dahlen / HuffPost In New Orleans, where Jamilah Muhammed was born and raised, there were more deaths from accidental drug overdoses in 2016 than from murders for the first time in the city's history.\n\nNEW ORLEANS, La. ― Around New Orleans, where she was born and raised, Jamilah Muhammed is known as “Mama.”\n\n“Hey, Mama Jamilah,” a five-year-old girl said as she walked past Muhammed, 68, on a park bench on a cool Sunday evening in October in the city’s historic Congo Square.\n\nThe girl was heading toward a drum circle a few yards away ― a centuries-old weekly tradition that includes both music and a market, honors African music and dance, and helps build ties that still matter in a city Muhammed calls “very clannish.”\n\nMuhammed believes that sense of belonging is what more people around her need in the face of a national public health crisis about addiction.\n\nLast year, there were more deaths from accidental drug overdoses than from murders for the first time in New Orleans history, Orleans Parish coroner Jeffrey Rouse told The New Orleans Advocate in March. He said the uptick includes a striking increase in drug-related deaths among black New Orleanians.\n\n“I work to maintain the culture of my community because when someone knows who they are, it’s hard to addict them to something,” Muhammed said.\n\nShe’s familiar with how people get caught up in the opioid crisis.\n\n“I’ve had physicians offer me opioids for chronic conditions,” she said. “I’m a dancer! My joints hurt! That’s part of being a dancer. When you’ve been dancing for 40 years, stuff hurts! Giving me Vicodin is not going to solve my problem. But I had to know that.”\n\nAddiction in her communities first began to worry her in the 1980s as crack cocaine use surged. Fifteen years ago was the first time she saw prescription painkillers cause comparable devastation to a fellow New Orleanian. “I personally saw how it robbed him of his life, how it robbed him of his livelihood, how it robbed him of his ability to be socially interactive, to make rational decisions, to care for himself, to care for his family,” Muhammed said.\n\nHe quit on his own. But she believes that’s rare and wants more people to receive support to avoid addiction and potentially death.\n\n“People are medicating themselves because they’re sad. They’re not bad, they’re sad. Things have happened to them. They’re hurt,” Muhammed said softly. She noted a particular source of trauma in New Orleans: the government’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina. “We have a whole generation of children that went through a horrific period in their lives when we talk about the federal flood of 2005, and people as they went to other places said to them, “Get over it, you’re alive.’”\n\nShe’s heard “Just Say No” for too long, she said, and watched doctors ― “the real pushers” ― avoid any blame. She’s tired, too, of public interest in addiction growing only as the crisis claims more white victims.\n\n“Until the addiction of black mothers’ sons is as important as the addiction of white mothers’ sons we will not cure this,” Muhammed said. “So I’m asking everyone to realize this is not a black-white issue ... All the mothers have to come together. ’Cause all of our children are important. All of our communities are important to us. I love my children. All of ’em. And I know that other mothers love theirs. We’ve gotta come together.”\n\n― Akbar Ahmed\n\n***\n\n‘I don’t even understand it myself, let alone trying to explain to a child why mommy died’\n\nCONNELLSVILLE, Pa. ― Mary Sampey’s older sister, Angela Phillips, was her best friend. They shared a bed growing up, supported each other during childbirth and raised their children in the same country town where they spent their childhoods.\n\nOne night, just a few months before Phillips died, she confided in her younger sister. Decades earlier, Phillips became pregnant after being raped and had an abortion. Until that moment, the pain and guilt she felt as a deeply Catholic woman weighed on her in secret.\n\n“She thought, ‘I’m going to shut down and get married and have kids and my life will be better,’” Sampey said.\n\nShe thinks that trauma left Phillips vulnerable to the disease that killed her ― the same addiction epidemic that’s wiping out an entire generation in Connellsville, a sleepy former coal town about an hour southeast of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Connellsville’s roaring coke and coal plants sent a steady stream of products to Pittsburgh by rail and barge, and money flowed right back. But Connellsville was hit hard when the region’s steel industry collapsed in the 1970s. Now, median household income sits below $29,000 per year, and nearly 23 percent of the town is below the poverty level.\n\nAnd like in so many parts of the country, opioid addiction has taken root. In a town of fewer than 7,500 residents, opioid overdoses kill at a rate of one to five people per month, according to the local emergency medical service. And those deaths are just a small fraction of the five to six people who call an ambulance for an overdose every day.\n\nIn the midst of this ongoing tragedy, Sampey, 31, has found a higher calling. For nearly four years, she’s worked for Father Bob Lubic, a local priest and chaplain. A little over a year ago, she became the mastermind behind his campaign to combat addiction and the stigma it carries among the faithful, some of whom view the chronic disease as a moral failure.\n\nFor Sampey, this mission is personal.\n\nShortly after she began working for Father Bob, as folks in Connellsville affectionately call him, Sampey’s sister Phillips was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Doctors removed the tumorous gland, but the surgery left Phillips in chronic pain. She started taking painkillers. Pretty soon, she was hooked. Sampey noticed the change as her sister, once a reliable homemaker and mother of two, became less dependable. She isolated herself and wouldn’t answer calls. Sampey began to see her sister less often, and when she did, Phillips’ would go from a perky, peppy version of herself to dozing off.\n\n“Her eyes would roll back in her head, she’d be very tired, then she’d be up again,” Sampey recalled. “It became very clear she was addicted to these prescription pain pills.”\n\nPhillips’ husband had a drinking problem, which didn’t help. After later separating from him, she went to rehab. It’s there that she met the man who would introduce her to heroin. From there began a cycle of relapse and rehab. Leaving her young daughters with her parents, Phillips attempted to get clean by living with her brother in Pittsburgh, distracting herself by working in his florist shop.\n\nShe relapsed there for a final time.\n\nSampey was at home making pepperoni rolls for her church youth group when her stepfather arrived at her door. He was “white as a ghost” when he told her they needed to talk.\n\n“Immediately I knew what he was going to tell me,” Sampey said. “It was a very out of body experience. I was eerily calm. I was not emotional. It was kind of like, this is it.”\n\nSampey’s numbness broke the next day when she had to sit Phillips’ young daughters down to tell them their mother was dead.\n\nOver the past year, Sampey has described the details of her sister’s addiction to packed pews and classrooms full of high school students. On an afternoon in October, she did the same for HuffPost with a matter-of-fact calmness. But when she remembered that moment she sat her 5- and 7-year-old nieces down, her voice became raspy.\n\n“I don’t even understand it myself, let alone trying to explain to a child why mommy died,” she said.\n\n“We told them mommy took too many pills and didn’t wake up, and she didn’t mean to,” she added, sniffling and gingerly wiping away a tear. “Mommy couldn’t help it. Mommy took too much medicine and didn’t wake up.”\n\nIt’s that sort of empathy she now helps Lubic preach.\n\nIn his sermons, Lubic urges his fellow Catholics to love people with addiction, whom he says feel undeserving of God’s love. It’s a strategy Sampey wishes she’d used with Phillips. She recalled her sister once saying she feared God had abandoned her because of her abortion and opioid addiction.\n\nIn both sermons and public assemblies, Lubic encourages those listening to talk about their fears and personal struggles instead of turning to drugs and alcohol for comfort. He and Sampey organize Nar-Anon group sessions and host other support groups in partnership with a local addiction specialist center. Lubic’s appearance helps soothe those wary of a clergyman’s conservative judgment. He sports a mohawk, earrings and a styled beard, and calls himself a “punk rock priest.”\n\nSampey’s official title is director of evangelization, but she calls herself a community activist, and her goal is to help people and their families with addiction. If people they help decide to become Catholic, they’re welcome to seek spiritual guidance, but that’s not the mission.\n\n“I don’t get all Jesus-y with them,” Sampey said. “Anything that I do is not a cover for conversion. I’m not there trying to make them Catholic. As people who are Christians, our job is to love other people.”\n\nIn Lubic, she seems to have found more than a boss and religious teacher, but a colleague who understands and is committed to alleviating social and individual anguish.\n\n“There’s a sense of acceptance and belonging that you get with Father that you don’t typically have,” Sampey said. “You know from the get-go that this person isn’t going to judge you.”\n\nA year after losing her best friend and sister, there’s something sacred in that alone.\n\n― Alexander C. Kaufman\n\n***\n\n‘Even small towns have to be vigilant’\n\nWARNER ROBINS, Ga. ― The first pills were yellow oblong tablets.\n\nThey were sold on the street as Percocet in June, but they were not Percocet. Instead, they were a mix of two deadly synthetic opioids, U-47700 and cyclopropyl fentanyl, making their first appearance in Georgia. They left a swath of users throughout the middle of the state struggling to survive, hospitalized and breathing through ventilators. Five died.\n\nIn late August, the pills were now round and white ― and still contained cyclopropyl fentanyl. The second wave of overdoses that month left seven people aged 25 to 60 hospitalized. They were found all over Warner Robins, a city of more than 70,000 that boasts an Air Force base. One case was found in nearby Centerville.\n\nThe symptoms ― troubled breathing and need of a ventilator ― were similar to the first round. The new pills, however, were much more sophisticated.\n\n“Not to give kudos to whoever is making this, but these are a lot better,” Jennifer Parson, Press Information Officer for the Warner Robins Police Department, said in late August. This batch of white, round pills “looks very real,” the only differentiation being they’re slightly thicker and glossier on the top than actual Percocet, she said.\n\nParson called the overdoses a top priority for the department, saying it was an issue the force was committed to solving. The danger of unregulated opioid pills like these lies in their unknown dosage. People have no idea how much they’re taking, and whether that could lead to a ventilator ― or death.\n\n“We know addiction is an issue and a problem, but this is dangerous and you don’t need to take the risk. You’re taking your life into your own hands.”\n\nAccording to Parson, the big concern in town used to just be heroin.\n\nThe Warner Robins police department started seeing an influx in the drug’s use about two years ago. But these bad pills are something new.\n\nParson, who used to be a reporter, spoke of the fear in the department over the unstable nature of these pills and the threat of other opioids for the greater community. She also described the risk the police were taking when dealing with the influx in overdose calls.\n\nNews reports about officers in other parts of the country overdosing from mere skin contact with an opioid substance is something that’s often on the minds of Warner Robins police officers when they go out, she said.\n\nOfficers in Warner Robins don’t currently carry Narcan (Narloxone), the prescription medicine that reverses an overdose. However, Parson said agencies in northern Georgia, which have seen a higher influx of cases, are considering doing so.\n\nWhile Parson said the opioid problem has typically been considered a northern Georgia problem surrounding the Atlanta area, this latest round of overdoses demonstrated how it’s creeping into the rest of the state.\n\n“It’s a problem across the country,” Parson said. “It just goes to show even small towns have to be vigilant.”\n\n― Lauren Weber",
  "latent_10484": "After a student was sent home from school for a dress code violation, her response to administrators is going viral online.\n\nA teenager in Lawton, Okla., who goes by the name Rose Lynn on Facebook, was sent home from school earlier this month because school officials deemed her outfit inappropriate, she says. Rose wore black leggings, a T-shirt and long cardigan, and boots (pictured above, far left), and she says her outfit was singled out because of her body type. “Today I was sent home from class, after being in school for two hours, for my outfit,” Rose wrote in a Facebook post. “Because I’m developed [more] than the average girl my age, I am required to go home and change. Yet, if I was skin and bones or overweight (not to offend anyone) I would be overlooked and no comment would be made (at my particular school) because ‘they must do that to feel better about themselves and they crave attention.’ But because I look like a curvy woman and may distract young boys, I have to miss class and change my outfit.”\n\nSTORY: School Shames Girls Who Break Dress Code\n\nHer photo, which was posted on Dec. 11 and has gotten more than 15,600 likes and 15,000 shares, accuses the school (which she does not name specifically but is part of the Lawton Public Schools) of sexism, and features the T-shirt Rose was wearing when she eventually returned to school. Quoting the school officials who sent her home, the front of the T-shirt says, “It doesn’t cover your crotch” and the back says, “You’ll distract the boys.” In her photo caption, Rose takes a stand against the school administration: “Once again, society has failed to advocate [for] young ladies, by confining them in a box, where they are stripped from their sense of self-respect and self-expression, rather than teaching young men to respect the boundaries of young ladies. My response: #‎Feminism #‎YoullDistractTheBoys #‎SocietyIsFailing.”\n\nYahoo Parenting was unable to reach the Lawton Public Schools for comment.\n\nIn an update in the photo comments, Rose says that when she was originally sent home, she asked if she could first take her algebra test, which would have taken 20 minutes, but her request was denied. “I was shut down, and had to miss the test to go change,” she writes.\n\nSTORY: School Forces 8-Year-Old With ‘Black Girls Rock’ Shirt to Change\n\nSo Rose returned to school in the featured homemade T-shirt, which she says she wore in “silent protest.” The new shirt adhered to all dress code rules, she says. “I was completely covered crotch, butt, cleavage, etc. (even though the only problem was the crotch). I was sent out of class and talked to by 2 principals and 3 teachers in the middle of the hallway, in front of other staff and pupils. (Which [by the way], another student with a similar outfit, crotch showing, walked by and I was informed that she could wear it because they weren’t concerned about her,)” she writes. “They were upset because I was ‘mocking them’ and they didn’t appreciate it.”\n\nThough her outfit did adhere to dress code regulations, Rose says she got sent home a second time — this time for not wearing her student I.D, which she says was in the classroom that she had been called out of.\n\nRose says she has since adhered to the outfit standards — wearing leggings only with oversize T-shirts — but maintains that another student with a similar outfit and less developed body would have experienced a different reaction from the school. In the comments of her Facebook post, her father, Lance Miles, makes the same claim. “If she was built like a board or as round as a ball she wouldn’t have been sent home but [since] she has a figure she was told she had to change,” he says. “This is 100% on [Lawton Public Schools] because they have left the rule up to interpretation. She has been taught that if you believe in something, do what you must and be prepared for the consequences. She has done that.”\n\n(Top photo: Facebook/Rose Lynn)\n\nPlease follow @YahooParenting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Have an interesting story to share about your family?

  "latent_10587": "The combination of intimacy and broad strokes of bokeh with Grizzly Bear's \"Alligator\" is celestial, a hypnotic warmth spreading down to your toes. This magnificent sequence instills a poignant sense of closure as well as the notion that a firework, a film, a love, or a life are all just sparks in time.\n\nFilm editor and end title designer JIM HELTON details the process for us.\n\nJH: Let me first start off by saying that I have known [director] Derek Cianfrance for a very long time. My friend Steve Hidinger and I actually created the title sequence for his first film, Brother Tied, back in 1998. That title sequence was all done on a dual gate 16mm optical printer at the University of Colorado in a closet inside a condemned archaeology building that no longer exists. We learned from a true master of that machine, experimental filmmaker Phil Solomon. He taught us about combining elemental and abstract images such as fire and water with more representational images through a process that he called “bi-packing” which involves placing two strips of film on top of each other and re-photographing them to create quite a different effect than a standard super-imposition. It is a tedious frame-by-frame process, but it can create pure magic. If you like the Blue Valentine title sequence, everything about it starts with Phil Solomon and his work, so check that out. Solomon’s sound was also a huge influence – nostalgic, distant, reverberating.\n\nOther giant inspirations for me that are a bit more obvious are Saul Bass and Maurice Binder as well as the Goldfinger titles by Robert Brownjohn. I collected their work as a college student and would sit around and watch them with my friends Joey Curtis (co-writer of Blue Valentine) and Derek Cianfrance. That was our idea of a party back then! That and some cheap Paisano wine, wonderful food, and long pink summer sunsets in Boulder.\n\nFireworks frames\n\nThe thing I loved about those filmmakers’ title sequences was their ability to tell an abstract story and embed images within the abstractions. The abstractions seemed to create something less logical and more emotional or even poetic while at the same time leaving space for the titles and even highlighting them. Those qualities are very central to the creation of the Blue Valentine title sequence.\n\nI’ll start with the first layer – the fireworks. I was editing Blue Valentine alongside Ron Patane and we were just trying to get it done for screenings so we were very focused on the narrative flow of the film. However, on a late night or two, I made some room for abstraction and delved into [cinematographer] Andrij Parekh’s beautiful fireworks footage and discovered rhythms in his camera work and the exploding light. He and Derek shot fireworks somewhere near Scranton, PA on July 4th of 2009. They threw images out of focus and sometimes even took the lens off. The film ends with a fireworks scene so it was always going to be fireworks. In the first rough cuts of the film it was just that – an abstract montage of fireworks. My first passes on that footage were all silent because I believe that if you can make something flow without music it will definitely flow with music and then you will actually have two pieces of “music” playing in harmony together.\n\nView 2 images Davi Russo set photography\n\nThe second layer was the music by Grizzly Bear. The only parameters I was given in choosing the song is that it had to be by Grizzly Bear. I chose “Alligator” – what can I say? Everything about it was right, from the tone to the lyrics to the cinematic quality it lends to the sequence. I love it. Of course, I could’ve been overruled by Derek in that choice, but he loved it right away. Ironically, after the last day of shooting on the way back to New York, I rode in a car with Derek, Andrij, and still photographer Davi Russo. They told me that the final song should be a pop remix of “Two Weeks” and proceeded to play it very loudly and to drive very fast. Well, the “Two Weeks” remix is a good song, but to me it wasn’t right for the end of the film. I knew that then, but I bit my tongue because everyone was riding high after wrapping the shoot... sometimes it’s better to show people rather than to argue with them.\n\nDavi Russo set photography - Michelle Williams\n\nDavi Russo set photography - Ryan Gosling\n\nThe third layer was the amazing iconic photography that Davi Russo captured on set. Derek and I have been working with Davi for a long time now – since 2004 – and his still photography played a huge role in the documentary work we made prior to Blue Valentine, so right from the beginning Derek insisted that Davi be involved. I believe this was not only for his photography, but also his presence on set. Derek greatly values Davi’s “bullshit meter” and his eye. For a long time in the edit, Derek and I asked each other, “Where do the photos fit in?” It was not until the second or third rough cut screening that it hit me... I literally saw them inside of those fireworks – like memories. As these things usually happen, the ideas were in the ether because Derek and Cami Delavigne (co-writer of Blue Valentine) both walked up to me at separate times after the screening and said that something was missing in the end titles. I just grinned and said, “I got it.”\n\nView 4 images Davi Russo set photography\n\nThe next night I stayed late and put the images “inside” the fireworks. I knew the images by heart and it happened very quickly because we had it narrowed down to our favorites. I wanted to create a sort of ode to the film: a story of togetherness, apartness, and love, ending with the wedding and ultimately, Frankie alone in the field. I looked for images that fit within the firework explosions, re-framed images, and at times even cut them up into details. I also looked for the proper amount of negative space within the images to make the titles really pop out so the image and the title could share time together without conflict. This was all done in Final Cut Pro. Of course, we kicked it up a notch in the color correct stage with the help of Technicolor ace colorist Tim Stipan, but the original was all created in Final Cut Pro using the composite feature and a lot of tweaking. I honestly can’t tell you exactly what I did but I discovered these techniques by trying to mimic some of the things I had learned while using the optical printer in film school. You can see examples of this discovery and exploration in my own films.\n\nFireworks frames\n\nThe fourth layer was the typeface created by artist and designer Chris Rubino, an amazing artist. Of course, I’m biased because Chris and I have collaborated on a film series called Love Kills Demons. We went through a serious exploration of typefaces, both curated and created by Chris. His interpretation of words is inspiring. A variation of the typeface that Derek, Chris, and I settled on is also used in the screen-printed limited edition pink Blue Valentine posters that Chris created for the Sundance Film Festival in 2010. Derek loved what he called the “like a Russian film” character of the small and large fonts. I love the boldness of the main title. Incorporating them into the picture was pretty simple... short fade in and long fade out, like exploding and disappearing light. The only title that cuts straight in is the main title, super bold with a long, long fade out.\n\nCustom typeface by Chris Rubino\n\nThe fifth and final layer was the sound design created by Dan Flosdorf and mixed by Corey Melious over at Sound Lounge. Fireworks streaking into the sky and crackling in the distance, muted booms, children laughing, shouting, and screaming... they all help tie the title sequence to the last shot of the film and, in effect, create an interplay between the nostalgic past and the present that reflects the structure of the film itself.\n\nDan recorded his own fireworks and what he calls “the air of the night” in surround sound and we layered them in so that they worked with the rhythm of the images and tone of the song – echoing and abstract, lost in nostalgia, sometimes slightly out of sync, sometimes absent and allowing the music to completely take over.\n\nThere you have it! A great collaboration between Derek, Andrij, Davi, Chris, Dan, Tim, Corey, and myself as well as some sources of inspiration. That’s what this whole filmmaking thing is all about.\n\nLimited edition pink Blue Valentine posters for Sundance\n\nView the credits for this sequence",
  "latent_10589": "The Walking Dead: the consequences of living with a legacy PHP framework\n\nAt our company, our main web app is based on Symfony 1.0, a PHP framework released in 2008. It was developped by a company called Sensio and open-sourced shortly after. It was a great framework when it came out, with all the good ideas from Ruby On Rails, CakePHP, etc. as well as great documentation, tutorials and a growing community. It is completely MVC, lets you write clean code, and does a lot of things a modern framework is supposed to let you do. But version 1.0 is clearly obsolete, and it is still our main framework.\n\nSince that framework came out, its subsequent versions, Symfony 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 came out and died out. The 1.4 version came with a 3 year long term support promise from Sensio which ended in 2012. All the 1.X versions are based on the same overall architecture, and same principles. Sensio also released Symfony 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and very recently, 2.3. which have a whole new architecture. This means a migration to those versions would all but require a complete rewrite\n\nWe still develop on Symfony 1.0. There are a number of reasons why no migration was done:\n\nearly migrations were deemed somewhat unnecessary\n\nmigrations are inherently risky\n\nthe product became our main product only later on, it wasn’t the company’s focus in the beginning\n\nthe company lacked a CTO able to articulate the use of spending money to upgrade a product that worked (i.e. politics)\n\nnew “visible” features were deemed more important than technical upgrades.\n\ndebugging was a full-time job at some point, leaving no time for an upgrade\n\nThree years into the product’s life an effort was done to do a complete rewrite of the product using Symfony 2.X. It was to be done by a consulting company, and preliminary research was already finished when I joined the company. This project was stopped for several reasons, including cost (well into the six figures, a lot for a small company) and an estimated 6-month “no new feature” period (which in my opinion would have evolved into a 9-month to one year period). The biggest issue was that our existing client base would not have benefited from the migration. As we are a SaaS company with a recurring business model, keeping existing clients is as important to us as acquiring new clients. Other issues that didn’t play a role in the decision to stop the rewrite but would have been problems if we had kept going were : new software isn’t as reliable as production software. New software requires new training. It was not possible to be feature equivalent in that short period, so our new application would have been behind what our competition is able to do.\n\nSo what is it like developing on a legacy framework ?\n\nYou can no longer rely on the community. What that means in my day to day job is that some problems I encounter which could be solved by Googling the issue if I was using a new framework can’t be solved that way, and time is lost finding my own solution. Symfony has a great and large community, even for the 1.X versions. However, 1.0 was one of the shortest lived versions, so the main sources for tech answers (Stack Overflow, Google Groups) mainly have answers for 1.4 and 2.X. Which of course are partially or completely incompatible.\n\nDocumentation can be hard to find now. Sensio has done a tremendous job keeping its legacy documentation online and easy to find. However, due to link rot and time passing older blog posts, tips, hints and walkthroughs are often no longer available, or harder to search for. Also, training new employees and interns is much harder as tutorials and documentation haven’t been updated for newer versions of PHP/Apache/MySQL.\n\nThe big one in terms of productivity: I can effectively no longer use plugins. Symfony had and still has a great plugin system, somewhat similar to Ruby On Rails gems, that enabled you to add functionnality easily. Most plugins were written for version 1.2+, no new plugins for 1.X are being written (the community for Symfony 2.X bundles however is impressive). That means I often have to develop from scratch what could have been done by just installing a plugin. I recently had to add a small CMS to our app, and had to write it from the ground up. Symfony CMSs exist of course but none are compatible with my version.\n\nSomewhat more annoying, Symfony 1.0 used Prototype (scriptaculous) as its Javascript framework, and used it somewhat extensively. This led to all our client dside code using this library instead of today’s de-facto standard, jQuery. UX advances which could require just a simple jQuery plugin have to be written from scratch. (we did solve that problem - more on that in a later post).\n\nThis framework is not compatible with newer versions of PHP. It was written for PHP 5.2, and is compatible with PHP 5.3 but no longer works on PHP 5.4. I haven’t even tried 5.5 yet. This prevents us from using the language’s new features, and we can’t use new some of the new libraries.\n\nBasically I’m one third less productive when programming than I could be.\n\nThere are of course consequences for our users. While the code is quite maintainable, features and bug fixes aren’t rolled out as fast as we’d like. Users have to live with the defficiencies just a bit longer than we would like them to. Speed is an other issue. Compared to Symfony 2.X, 1.X is slow. Framework overhead is really much higher than it could be. Using 2.X would probably speed execution by a factor of 2.\n\nApart from that though, our users don’t feel the age of the framework that much. And that’s why it’s still more cost-efficient to keep this framework than to migrate everything. That doesn’t mean I’m not making life easier for myself as we go on. More on that in later posts.\n\nCould this have been avoided ?\n\nSomewhat. While it was impossible to predict at the time of the release of 1.0 that Sensio would break backward compatibility with 2.X, regular upgrades to 1.1 all the way to 1.4 would have helped. The release of 2.X however would have required the complete rewrite we were unable/unwilling to finish.\n\nFurther discussion\n\nReddit discussion on /r/php: link\n\nDiscussion on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6295509\n\nHi, my name is Yannick Mahe, and I'm the CTO at Alveos.

  "latent_10649": "Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is in a rare spot in the political landscape: one of only three Democratic governors in a rural state.\n\nHELENA, Mont. — For a time, Democrats ruled over the vast terrain that stretched from the Great Plains, across the Rocky Mountains and along the Pacific. From Texas and North Dakota, and from Oklahoma to Hawaii, a Democrat occupied all but two governors’ mansions in the 19 most-western states in the late 1970s.\n\nBut those states that once had long successions of Democratic governors — including Wyoming, Idaho and Utah — are now solidly Republican territory.\n\nThe shift puts Montana Gov. Steve Bullock in a rare spot in the political landscape: one of only three Democratic governors in a rural state. Across the United States, only 18 Democrats hold governorships — with eight of those seats among the 12 before voters this year.\n\nThere is a lot riding on Bullock’s re-election campaign against political newcomer Republican Greg Gianforte.\n\nSome say the Democratic Party cannot afford to lose the governor’s race in Montana — not just to defend its dwindling number of governorships but to also prove that it can still engage with rural America. The party is also trying to hold on to two other rural states, Vermont and West Virginia.\n\n“Politically, it’s important for Democrats to demonstrate that they can win in rural places,” said Dave Parker, a political-science professor at Montana State University.\n\n“They need to show that they can attract the allegiance of voters in rural areas to make them competitive, and demonstrate that they are not just reflective of the coasts and urban interests,” Parker said. “So Bullock is very symbolic because he is one of the few remaining Democrats representing a largely rural state.”\n\nIn 1978, all but two of the 19 states extending from the Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean had Democratic governors. Today, only a third are headed by a Democrat. And among rural states in the Rockies and Great Plains, Bullock is the only remaining Democrat.\n\nMontanans have had a long and deep affinity with the Democratic Party. Its first governor was a Democrat — and so were 15 of the state’s 24 governors since statehood. They also pride themselves for bucking expectations. While states around it have grown staunchly conservative, Montana’s streak of independence is alive and well.\n\n“Montana is a fascinating state, not just for the gubernatorial race,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. “There’s an interesting dynamic, and it will be interesting to see how much cultural and social issues matter.”\n\nThe separation between federal and local partisanship used to be stronger, Gonzales said, allowing Democrats to win in culturally conservative states and Republicans in socially liberal ones.\n\nBut that line is blurring.\n\nAs a result, he said, “it could make it more difficult for a Democrat running in a rural state to build their own identity that is separate from the national party. It can be done, but it’s just becoming more difficult unless you have a strong profile.”\n\nWhile Democrats have been able to count on voters of color — many concentrated in urbanized states — significant numbers of white rural voters have fled the party, said Tim Marema, vice president of the Kentucky-based Center for Rural Strategies.\n\n“In places where there is a lot of land and few people, many white, rural voters have moved over time toward the Republican Party. Nationally, the Democratic Party thinks it doesn’t need rural voters as much as it used to, so they tend to ignore them,” Marema said.\n\nBut he warned that Republicans shouldn’t take the rural vote for granted.\n\nFor now, some handicappers say Democrats are likely to hold Montana — but much of that is because Gianforte is an unknown. The Bozeman businessman, a millionaire who made a fortune in the high-tech industry, is making his first run at public office.\n\nDemocrats have fared well in Montana mainly because of a strong labor history, growing urban areas and the independent streak among Montanans. It’s hard to find a Democrat in Montana who doesn’t believe in the right to own guns — Bullock among them.\n\nAnd until last year, Bullock led the Democratic Governors Association, which has supported him with financial donations, fundraising and campaign strategy.\n\n“There might be some national Democrats who are writing off these rural areas,” said Joe Lamson, a longtime Democratic operative in Montana. “But in the final analysis, there are still some folks in these areas in a pitch battle … and they’ve been in a pitch battle for a long, long time.”\n\nIf more states turn red, he said, it will get harder for Democrats to win nationally.\n\nDavid Hunter, whose history with Montana Democrats spans five decades, cautions against putting too much meaning on the outcome of the governor’s race.\n\n“Is it a bellwether for how Democrats will do in rural states? I don’t think so,” he said. “I don’t think a Bullock victory or loss says anything about our ability as a party to connect (with rural voters) nationwide or even in Montana. I really think the governor’s race in Montana is a local race.”",

He was searching for answers as to why Detroit is struggling up front.

Also of note, the most athletic line in the NFL belongs to our beloved rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThat seems odd, but the article explained that this number was much better at predicting failure than success. That seems fairly clear in the case of the Cowboys. While Tyron Smith, Doug Free, and Zack Martin all had very good scores, La'el Collins was just a little better than average. And Travis Frederick had a very poor number.\n\nThis is something of a cautionary case about measureables. As Fredbeard illustrates, there is a lot more to playing in the NFL than just how you stack up against others when running set drills. Frederick has a reputation as being a superb technician more than any kind of athletic freak. His low score is not a big surprise (although just how low it is was a bit unexpected). This may have had something to do with how everyone else in the league and just about all the draft gurus sorely underestimated his worth when he was drafted. The numbers alone can't gauge skill, or the nasty attitude that he brings to the middle of the line. And things like speed and agility play a bigger role for almost all positions other than center. He is not going to be running pass patterns or even be expected to pull and lead a running back. That very low RAS in the middle of the line has not kept it from being regarded as the class of the NFL.\n\nThe fact the Eagles' line has the best composite score in the league also demonstrates that there is much more to success than looking good at the combine. You would think such a talented group, when paired with the previous year's rushing champion, would produce quite the formidable ground game. But they were just middle of the pack, and DeMarco Murray was turned into a compete non-factor in another example of how the towering genius of Chip Kelly totally ruined that team.\n\nOkay, that was a bit of a cheap shot (not that it results in even a scintilla of regret), but the basic principle holds true. The fact the Cleveland Brows have the second most athletic line also supports how this stat is unreliable in predicting any kind of success. Athleticism is not the be all and end all, especially in a position that is so dependent on technique and teamwork. One of the ironies of football is that members of the offensive line are not considered \"skill positions\", but there may be more need for technique and precision there than anywhere else on the field. And those are things that are not going to be evident at the so-called \"Underwear Olympics\".\n\nFortunately, they are very much so on the Dallas offensive line.\n\nFollow me @TomRyleBTB",
  "latent_10708": "For the past few years, I've been trying to understand how to make graphs using RRDtool (Round-Robin Database tool) after failing miserably to understand MRTG (Multi-Router Traffic Grapher) before that. The thing I like about RRDtool is that it's newer and supports a wider variety of data sources. It's still incredibly complicated though, and I've given up on learning how to use it on multiple occasions. That's when I discovered Cacti.\n\nCacti is not a new program. It's been around for a long time, and in its own way, it's a complicated beast itself. I finally really took the time to figure it out, however, and I realized that it's not too difficult to use. The cool part is that Cacti makes RRDtool manipulation incredibly convenient. It did take me the better part of a day to understand Cacti fully, so hopefully this article will save you some time.\n\nThe Goal\n\nI want to create a graph that graphs something automatically and does it using a bash script as the input as opposed to SNMP or anything like that. I've been using bash for years, and I'm comfortable using the command line to procure data. In fact, for this project, I'm going to adapt a script I use for BirdTopia (my continual birdcam project for the past few years) that will pull a temperature from the command line. I want to pull the temperature from two different cities and graph them together. For this example, I use Petoskey, Michigan (where I live), and Houston, Texas (where Linux Journal headquarters are located).\n\nHere's the script:\n\n#!/bin/bash curl -s \"http://api.wunderground.com/weatherstation/ ↪WXCurrentObXML.asp?ID=$1\" \\ | grep temp_f | sed 's/.//' | sed 's/.//' | sed ↪'s/<temp_f>//' | sed 's/<\\/temp_f>//'\n\nIt looks complex, but really it just downloads the API information from Weather Underground for the weather station given as an argument, and then uses sed (stream editor) to pare down the information to a simple number—specifically, the numerical degrees in Fahrenheit. If you prefer Celsius, I applaud your country for adopting the metric system, but sadly, my brain just can't relate Celsius to how warm the outdoor temperature feels.\n\nOne tricky part is figuring out what the proper weather station ID is for your city. I wish you could just use a ZIP code, but I've been unable to find a command-line weather API that will take a ZIP code. So if you're following along, just head over to Wunderground and load the page for your locale. Once there, click on the link shown in Figure 1 (your text will be different, but the location on the page should match). The next page will show the name of your local weather station. You can see mine in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 1. I assumed this was my weather station, but it's not. You need to click through to find the code.\n\nFigure 2. Here is the code for my local weather station. Be sure to try your script on the command line to see if you have the correct code.\n\nTo get the local temperature using the script, just type the name of the script (I named my \"gettemp\" and saved it as an executable in /usr/local/bin/) with the name of the weather station as an argument:\n\nspowers@cacti:~$ gettemp MAS614 48.0 spowers@cacti:~$\n\nThe same script will work for Houston's weather too. I looked up a weather station name in Houston and found \"KTXGALEN6\" as a name. Using that as the argument, I can get the current temp for Houston. And, those will be my two points of data.\n\nHow Cacti Works\n\nThis is honestly the most frustrating part of the process. There are so many different pieces to the Cacti puzzle, that it's easy to give up. Go ahead and install Cacti on your system (it should be in the repository), and log in. The default login is usually \"admin\" for both login and password. You should change it immediately.\n\nOnce there, look along the left-hand side of the \"console\" page (Figure 3), which should load by default. The confusing part is that names like \"devices\", \"data sources\", \"data queries\" and such all sound like what you want to configure to get data. I'm listing the definitions below, so hopefully it's less confusing:\n\nData Queries: this generally refers to SNMP queries used to get data. I'm not using this here, even though it sounds like something I'd need to configure for doing data queries to a bash script.\n\nData Input Methods: this is where you'll configure your bash script if you're following along. Cacti sees the script as a way to get data, not the data itself. This means you can use the script (or Data Input Method) for multiple data sources. In my case, I use the same Data Input Method for both Petoskey temps and Houston temps.\n\nDevices: Cacti allows you to categorize data by device. This makes sense if you're going to monitor server data from a bunch of different servers. In this case, I'm not graphing different devices, so I won't use the device categorization at all (I'll use \"none\" as the device).\n\nData Sources: a data source uses a \"Data Input Method\" to create a graphable piece of data. For this example, I have two data sources: the Petoskey temp and the Houston temp.\n\nData Templates: this is a template that instructs Cacti on how to use a Data Input Method to create a Data Source. Basically, you set up a Data Template so Cacti knows what questions to ask when creating a Data Source. It's possible to do without a Data Template, but if you don't set one up, Cacti will give errors when creating a Data Source that you'll need to go back and fix later. It's a real pain, but the step to create a Data Template makes the process far less painful.\n\nFigure 3. Don't be overwhelmed; it's not nearly as scary as it looks.\n\nHopefully, that clears up some of the strange terminology. Graphing is actually separate, so first you need to get your Data Sources configured. (You'll make the graphs from your data sources, once they're storing periodic data.)\n\nPart I: Data Input Method\n\nFor this example, even though I have two data sources, I have only one Data Input Method. That means I need to configure the script in Cacti so that it will accept an argument (the weather station code) for each data source. So to do this, first click on \"Data Input Methods\" on the left, and then click \"add\" on the upper-right corner of the Data Input Methods page. Look at Figure 4 to see where the \"add\" link is, because it took me a long time to find it at first!\n\nFigure 4. It took me forever to figure out how to add something. I felt very silly.\n\nThis is where you create the criteria for Cacti to \"call\" your script. Figure 5 shows how to set up the information. Note that you must use the \"Script/Command\" Input Type and that the placeholder for the argument goes in < > brackets. The name of the Data Input Method is just a friendly name, and the command-line argument in brackets gets a friendly name too. (Also note that Cacti refers to the command-line argument as an \"input source\", which isn't terribly descriptive in the case of a bash script.) Once filled in, click Create at the bottom.\n\nFigure 5. Be sure to select Script/Command!\n\nThe next page (Figure 6) looks similar, but you'll see that there are now two more sections you need to complete. The first is the Input Fields section. Click Add in the upper-right corner of that section, and then tell the system what the script expects as input. In Figure 7, you can see the Input Field from the last step is already selected. My example script has only one argument, so it's the only option to choose. (Notice the name is the same that I put in <brackets> in the last step.)\n\nFigure 6. You need to configure an Input Field and an Output Field.\n\nFigure 7. These error-checking features will come in handy for some scripts.\n\nI added a friendly name for the Input Field, so when I'm configuring the Data Sources later, it's clear what Cacti is looking for. If you want to get fancy, you can use regex to sanitize the input, but I'm leaving that blank. Also, since the script won't work without the weather station code, I made sure the check box to allow empty input is not checked. The last field also doesn't apply in this case, so I left it blank. Once you've chosen a friendly name, click Create.\n\nNext, click the Add link in the upper-right corner of the \"Output Fields\" box. You'll be taken to a screen that looks like Figure 8. Here, you're basically applying a label to the output from your bash script. For this example, I know I'll be getting a number, so in the first field, I just called it \"degrees\", and then I added a friendly name that described the output. The \"Update RRD File\" is checked by default, and make sure to leave it checked. That's how Cacti knows this will be a graphable point of data! Once complete, click Create.\n\nFigure 8. Just use a name that makes sense.\n\nYour Data Input Method screen should now look like Figure 9. Be sure to press Save at the bottom right of the window; otherwise, you'll lose all of your work. If you click on \"Data Input Methods\" on the left column, you should see your script added as a new Script/Command. Next, you can use that Data Input Method to create your two data sources.\n\nFigure 9. Be sure to save!\n\nPart II: Data Templates\n\nIf you head over to \"Data Templates\" in the left column and click Add in the upper-right corner, you'll be presented with a screen that looks similar to Figure 10. The idea behind a template is to answer as many questions as possible, while leaving blanks for those items that will be specific to each Data Source configured with the template. Looking at Figure 10, note that I gave the template a friendly name at the top. The next field, under Data Source, I left blank, but I checked the box that says \"Use Per-Data Source Value\", because I want the two data sources to have different names. (It wouldn't be very useful if they both had the same name.) Checking the box tells Cacti that when people use the data template, you want them to come up with their own name. The \"Data Input Method\" is the one you created if you were following along in Part I—just find it in the drop-down list. \"Associated RRAs\" tells Cacti which sets of data it should track. Be sure to select all of these, because you want to be able to create multiple graphs for historical data. Then, \"Step\" refers to how often it should poll the script for the temperature. The default is five minutes (300 seconds), and I recommend leaving it. Finally in that section, be sure \"Data Source Active\" is checked so that it actually stores the data. Note that the last two fields in that section are not checked to use \"Per-User Data Source\", because I want those values to be the same for any data sources created with this template.\n\nFigure 10. Data Templates make it so much easier to create Data Sources.\n\nThe next section refers to the data items inside the RRD (round-robin database) file. Since I'm tracking the temperature, I just decided to call the field \"temp\" inside the file. I also don't want a maximum or minimum value, so I put \"U\" in each of those fields. The \"Data Source Type\" field refers to the kind of data stored. In this case, it's a value that fluctuates, and I want to compare the difference between them on a graph, so the \"GAUGE\" type is what I want. Feel free to explore the other data types, but for monitoring and graphing something like temperature, GAUGE is what you should use. Finally, the \"Heartbeat\" field tells Cacti how long it can go between data entries before it needs to fill in data points with \"unknown\" (this defaults to ten minutes, and I suggest leaving it). Also note that none of the \"Use Per-Data Source\" check boxes are marked, because these values will be the same for any data source using my script. Click Create, and you should see Cacti provide another field to fill in (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11. Remember to fill in as much as you can, and check those boxes that should be unique to each data source.\n\nThe \"Custom Data\" section that appears at the bottom comes from the Data Input Method that requires an input (the weather station code). Since I want each data source to use its own code, I check the box to use \"Per-Data Source\" and leave the field blank. Click Save, and the data source should be configured and ready to use.\n\nPart III: Data Sources\n\nNow that you have the Data Input Method and a Data Template to tell Cacti how to use it, you need to create your two data sources. Head over to \"Data Sources\" on the left, and then click \"Add\" in the upper right in order to add your first source. The first page asks you to select a Data Template and Host. This data source isn't related to a specific server, so leave Host as \"none\", but you want to select your freshly created Data Template (Figure 12) and click Create.\n\nFigure 12. Cool, the data template!\n\nSince the Data Template already answers most of the questions about the new data source, you're asked only a few details. In Figure 13, you can see that I need to name this data source, choose a data source path and give it the weather station code. I just used the default Data Source Path that Cacti created. Once you enter the name and weather station code, click Save.\n\nFigure 13. See? It's much easier to create a data source when you have only two things to enter!\n\nIf you're following along and want to do something similar to me, repeat the process for your second weather station. Since the Data Template is already in place, adding a second Data Source is very simple. I added Houston exactly the same way as I added Petoskey.\n\nPart IV: the Graphs\n\nCreating the Data Sources is really the hardest part of creating graphs with Cacti. Once they're created, the data will be polled every five minutes, and data will be added to the RRD files. You can't create a graph until you have a Data Source created, because graphs simply show the data inside the Data Sources graphically. So, now that you have Data Sources, you can create graphs to display them.\n\nIt's possible to set up Graph Templates, but unlike Data Templates, they're not really required. In my case, since I created only one graph, it would take longer to set up a template than simply to create a graph from scratch, so I'll just do it from scratch. In order to start, click on \"Manage Graphs\" on the left-hand side of the screen. (Note: don't click \"New Graphs\", because for some reason, Cacti will try to use a host and not give you the option for selecting a Data Source that doesn't have an associated host. Thankfully that isn't a problem in the \"Graph Management\" section.)\n\nOnce in Graph Management, click \"Add\" in the upper-right corner. Select \"None\" for both host and template (Figure 14), because you're not going to use a template for this graph. Then click Create.\n\nFigure 14. Graph Templates won't save you any time, but if you're doing lots of similar graphs, check them out.\n\nThe next page (Figure 15) looks overwhelming, but you're going to leave almost everything at its default. The only things I added were the Title of the graph (Petoskey & Houston) and, at the bottom, the Vertical Label (degrees Fahrenheit). For your first graph, I recommend leaving everything else at its default. Click Create.\n\nFigure 15. Thankfully, you want mostly all defaults.\n\nThe next page (Figure 16) looks similar, but notice the section I circled in red titled \"Graph Items\". You need to click \"Add\" on the right in that section, and add the Data Sources. You'll see I chose \"Houston Temperature\" as the Data Source to graph (Figure 17).\n\nFigure 16. I missed this section at first and was confused why I didn't get any graphs.\n\nFigure 17. Why on earth does the drop-down box show only HEX?\n\nThe second field is to choose a color for the graph. Irritatingly, the drop-down menu shows only HEX codes for colors, but after you select one, it displays the color for you. Houston is generally hot, so it seemed appropriate for it to be red. Next is opacity, and I chose 100%. The \"Graph Item Type\" does not default to \"AREA\", so be sure to select that for a traditional graph that looks like a rolling hill of data. It's safe to leave \"Consolidation Function\" to AVERAGE, and everything else the default. I did add \"Houston Temp\" to the Text Format field, so it shows which color is which Data Source on my graph. Once you're happy with the data, click Create. Do the same thing with your second Data Source. You'll notice in mine (Figure 18) that I chose blue for Petoskey, and instead of AREA, I chose LINE1. It's a different type of graph, so that instead of filling the page, it will draw a line with the temperature. I did that so Houston would fill the background, and Petoskey would draw a line over the top of it, so you can see both. Figure 19 shows the preview of what the graph will look like. Be sure to click Save at the bottom!\n\nFigure 18. Blue seemed appropriate for Petoskey.\n\nFigure 19. Looks like the graph is configured. (Don't forget to click Save.)\n\nThat's It!\n\nThe only thing left to do is wait. Every five minutes, there should be a data point added, and the graphs will update with a graphical representation of that data. Cacti allows you to export the graphs to a local path (like /var/www/html) or to a remote FTP server. If you don't have it export the graphs, you'll have to log in to see them. I won't go through the process for exporting the graphs, but click on the \"settings\" link on the left column, and then the \"Graph Export\" tab across the top. The setup is fairly self-explanatory. To see the graphs you've just created, wait 10–15 minutes, then follow the arrows as shown in Figure 20 to find the graphs. You should see your new graphs starting to populate themselves with data!\n\nFigure 20. These are frustrating to find; hopefully the arrows help you.\n\nCacti has lots of other features, and it allows you to customize your graphs with min/max values displayed on the graphic, along with different types of graphs, data sources and so on. Once you become familiar with using it, Cacti is a very nice tool for automating the graphing process. I hope you have as much fun with it as I did!",
  "latent_10789": "Eighty-six current and former members of a fraternity at Yale University are being sued over a deadly tailgating crash at the 2011 Yale-Harvard football game in New Haven.\n\nA U-Haul truck carrying beer kegs heading to the Sigma Phi Epsilon tailgating area outside the Yale Bowl fatally struck 30-year-old Nancy Barry, of Salem, Mass., and injured two other women. Brendan Ross, a Yale student and fraternity member who was driving the truck, entered a probation program that erased the criminal charges against him.\n\nBarry's family and one of the injured women, Yale student Sarah Short, first sued Ross, the national chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, Yale, U-Haul and others, seeking damages for Barry's death and Short's injuries. Those lawsuits remain pending.\n\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers said they filed new lawsuits Dec. 30 against the former and current members of the Yale chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon after the national chapter of the fraternity, based in Richmond, Va., and its insurer disclosed part of their defense -- that the national chapter wasn't responsible for the Yale chapter's actions, didn't sanction the tailgating event at the game and its insurance company doesn't cover non-fraternity events.\n\nThe Yale chapter is a voluntary association, is not incorporated or organized in any legal way and is not insured itself, said Paul Edwards, the lawyer for Barry's estate. He said those facts prompted the lawsuits against former fraternity members, who belonged at the time of the crash, and current members.\n\nEdwards said filing the new lawsuits was \"a move that we were forced to take by the defense and the posturing of the national fraternity's lawyers.\"\n\n\"They are effectively cutting off its local chapter and members,\" Edwards said. \"I think that defense is bogus. It's our claim that what happened at Yale two years ago was very clearly, definitively and obviously a Sigma Phi Epsilon-sponsored fraternity event.\"\n\nJeremy Platek, a White Plains, N.Y., lawyer representing nearly all the past and current Yale chapter members, declined to comment on the lawsuit Wednesday.\n\nJoel Faxon, Short's attorney, said he planned to comment later Wednesday.\n\nAn attorney for the national chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon didn't immediately return a message.\n\nState prosecutors said the accident happened outside the Yale Bowl on Nov. 19, 2011, when Ross was driving a truck carrying beer kegs in a parking lot crowded with pedestrians while on the way to the fraternity's tailgating area. The truck turned a corner and sped up, striking the three women, authorities said.\n\nRoss, of O'Fallon, Mo., had revved the truck's engine in an effort to get pedestrians to move, but the vehicle took off, prosecutors said. Ross told police he tried to hit the brake but hit the gas pedal instead. Ross passed a field sobriety test after the accident and was charged with negligent homicide and reckless driving.\n\nLast February, he was granted accelerated rehabilitation, which allows the charges to be erased after a probation period, and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.\n\nAfter the accident, Yale tightened its tailgating rules. It now bans kegs at university athletic events and other functions. Also, oversized vehicles, such as box trucks and large commercial vehicles, are barred from university lots at athletic events unless they are driven by a preapproved authorized vendor.",
  "latent_10821": "Southwest Airlines is solidifying its position as San Diego’s dominant air carrier with the announcement Monday that it is adding year-round nonstop flights to Puerto Vallarta, Newark and El Paso.\n\nJust a few months after debuting its nonstop service to Cabo San Lucas, Southwest said Monday it will now add a twice weekly flight to Puerto Vallarta on Saturdays and Sundays, starting March 10 of next year. The decision was driven by strong interest expressed by its customers, said Southwest officials.\n\n“The international service we are providing has really resonated with our customers, and Cabo was the most popular destination our customers requested, and Puerto Vallarta was next,” said Leah Koontz, Vice President Controller for the airline. “San Diego is our fourth international gateway out of California.”\n\nThe only other air carrier flying nonstop between San Diego and Puerto Vallarta is Alaska Airlines.\n\nDomestically, Southwest is also adding a Sunday-only flight to El Paso, which is not served by any other airline out of San Diego International Airport, and it will start offering a daily nonstop to Newark. After trying out a daily nonstop in June and July, Southwest saw there was enough demand to convert it to year-round service.\n\nThe El Paso flight will debut March 11, and Newark will go into effect April 8.\n\n“When we flew seasonal service to Newark in the summer we liked the response we got from customers,” said Southwest Airlines Managing Director of Network Planning Adam Decaire. “People were ecstatic we got a nonstop on that flight for the summer, so we’re bringing it back next year. It’s the 15th largest market for all customers leaving San Diego on any airline.”\n\nAlaska and United Airlines currently offer nonstop service to Newark.\n\nIn addition to the three new nonstops, Southwest is also expanding its existing Austin, Texas, nonstop flight from two days a week to three and its Dallas service from three days to four.\n\nSouthwest had planned to announce sale fares to accompany the new routes, but those are temporarily postponed because of the current turmoil surrounding Tropical Storm Harvey in Texas.\n\nThe San Diego flights were among nearly 20 new nonstop routes and increased frequency to 27 existing routes that Southwest announced Monday. It also is planning to add more service to Cancun and Cabo San Lucas from the U.S.\n\nWhile acknowledging the heightened competition for air travel, Southwest executives believe California is just as competitive as it always has been, even as Alaska Airlines has moved aggressively to gain a stronger toehold in San Diego.\n\n“I’ve been here 24 years and there’s always been a whole lot of competition in the state of California, so this really is no different,” said Koontz. “Southwest Airlines never backs down from a challenge and we intend to maintain our competitive lead in California.”\n\nFor flights within California, Southwest accounts for nearly 64 percent of the passenger volume, said Decaire. For all domestic flights, Southwest’s market share at Lindbergh is 37.5 percent, he added.\n\nCAPTION Hundreds of San Diego hotel workers marched in downtown San Diego to pressure Marriott hotels to improve pay and working conditions for low wage workers.

  "latent_10899": "The Obama Administration sent young Latin Americans to Cuba to “provoke political change”\n\nThe workers received little to no training before beginning covert operations\n\nUSAID refused to end operations after warning\n\nAugust 4, 2014\n\nIf there’s one word we can use to describe the Obama administration, it’s “ineffectual.” That is to say, it’s not that the current POTUS and staff are sitting around twiddling their thumbs… they do plenty. But when it comes to execution the plenty that they do fails over and over again.\n\nThe latest scandal coming out of the White House shows just that. The Obama administration is currently under fire as they formed a task squad of young Latin Americans to occupy Cuba under the guise as public health and civic program workers. These young foreigners were, in fact, placed there to provoke political change funded by the US government. They now find themselves in grave danger after the US contractor in charged was thrown in Cuban jail.\n\nIn 2009 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) began overseeing the program. The Associated Press reports If the investigation by the Associated Press is accurate, the young people were told to pose as tourists while they traveled the Communist country “scouting for people” who could possibly be turned into “political activists.”\n\nUsing “public health” efforts as a smokescreen could have unintended consequences. An HIV-prevention workshop organized by the USAID spy squad was noted in memos as “the perfect excuse” for their political goals. This type of deceit has the potential to undermine actual American efforts in the global health community.\n\nThe workers were given little to no training before the program began. One informant says he received a scant 30 minute seminar on avoiding Cuban intelligence. “Trust that the authorities will not try to harm you physically,” a memo obtained by the AP said. “Remember that the Cuban government prefers to avoid negative media reports abroad, so a beaten foreigner is not convenient for them.”\n\nThe young people were caught after Cuban authorities became suspicious of how the “tourists” were able to afford their stay. Nearly a dozen Latin Americans served in the Cuban program. It is reported that they were paid as little as $5.41 an hour for the dangerous covert operations.\n\nUSAID and its contractor Creative Associates International were warned to end any projects in Cuba after Alan Gross was jailed for allegedly smuggling “sensitive technology” into the country. They failed to put a stop to the operation and Gross remains imprisoned to this day.\n\nWhy Obama thought he needed to put young, impressionable foreigners in danger isn’t really in question– the man has proven time and time again he’ll do despicable things to push his own political agenda. What I want to know is why we’re sending amateur squads into an impoverished country where Communism is proving to destroy itself. Meanwhile there are actual crises happening at home. If we want to put these young Spanish-speakers to work for our government why don’t we use them to tell the illegals crossing the borders to go home?",

  "latent_11702": "The job of the newspaper is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\n\nReportedly first uttered by an Irish bartender named Mr. Dooley, I first heard the phrase as a middle school student while “interning” at The Atlanta Daily World, one of this country’s oldest black newspapers. At the time, it was told to me by the then-publisher Cornelius “C. A.” Scott. Mr. Scott gave me my first taste of journalism; it’s been in my blood ever since. I was too young to know what these words meant back then, but they’ve been echoing in my head continuously all morning.\n\nWhat would C. A. Scott do?\n\nThe Atlanta Daily World, founded by Morehouse graduate, William Alexander “W. A.” Scott in 1928, ran photos of lynchings on its front page on an almost daily basis to bring attention to racial discrimination, white supremacy, and police brutality. It became one of the most influential, and successful, newspapers of its time. By the time I arrived in the 1980s, the Daily World, was a mere shell of itself having been disrupted by integration and mainstream media outlets with deeper pockets, but less commitment to covering black news as starkly and passionately as the Scotts did.\n\nMany are angry over The New York Daily News‘ front cover. Editors at The New York Daily News warned potential readers by trumpeting on its Twitter time line that today’s edition would feature a full-display of a dying Alton Sterling, the black man killed by Baton Rouge police on Wednesday. Some are describing his murder as an execution.\n\nI believe C. A. Scott and his contemporaries would approve.\n\nAlton Sterling is a human being. Was a human being. He was a father. He had a voice. And like everybody, he had a past. Whatever his past was is irrelevant. Less than a day after police killed Sterling, Minnesota police killed another black man, Philando Castile, after stopping him for having a broken tail light. His girlfriend and four-year-old daughter were in the car with Castile.\n\nThe role of police officers is to serve and protect, not to judge.\n\nAll of this needs to be taken into account when considering The New York Daily News‘ front page.\n\nI understand that tabloids often produce startling covers in order to sell newspapers. I understand that tabloids, by their very nature, are provocative. But I also know that pictures are worth more than 1,000 words. I know that sometimes you have to get into people’s faces in order to make them understand. I know how easy is to ignore a block of text, but much harder to tune out a picture. I know that sometimes you need visuals to make people pause and force them into a much needed conversation.\n\nAnd I know that the role of journalists, our very mission, is to give voice to the voiceless, hold power to account, and to afflict the comfortable. A journalist’s job is to tell the truth.\n\nAlton Sterling and Philando Castile no longer have their voices. The New York Daily News cover, as frighteningly disgusting as it is, needs to be seen. It’s Alton Sterling’s voice. It also needs to be a rallying cry to everyone from Hillary Rodham Clinton to police chiefs from Oakland to Chicago that enough is enough. It needs to be a tipping point for systemic change, from federal law to county courthouses across this country.\n\nNo more district attorneys urging grand juries to no bill cases where police kill black men and women with impunity. No more U.S. Justice Department investigating these cases without consequences. No more police taking black lives for granted. No more do nothing U.S. congress. No more hash-tag activism without real change. No more news media looking for reasons to excuse the inexcusable. No more people walking around like sheep, asleep to the perils faced by those people on a daily basis. No more all lives mattering without black lives mattering.\n\nNo more. Enough is enough.\n\nThis image is a tipping point. Or it should be.\n\nDid The New York Daily News publish this cover to make money? I don’t know, but I don’t think so. Single copy sales are collapsing, dropping in double digits for the last three years. If the Daily News wanted to simply use the image to sell newspapers, they wouldn’t have posted the picture on Twitter last night; they wouldn’t have scooped themselves. I’ll call them later, but I bet editors at the Daily News argued for hours about whether to publish this image.\n\nBy publishing the image, The New York Daily News is fulfilling an obligation to be a truth teller.\n\nBlack newspaper trailblazers of the 1920s through the 1960s – those heroes who risked their reputations, heck their very lives, to raise awareness about public lynchings – helped bring an end to such widespread practices.\n\nThey had to.\n\nA newspaper’s job is to afflict the comfortable.

  "latent_11754": "Texas wrestling star Justin Wren to spend a year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to live and fight for the Pygmies people. (Published Monday, April 15, 2013)\n\nHe’s a former he's a former Texas state high school wrestling champion who made a name for himself as an Ultimate Fighter. He was actually the youngest ever to appear on a reality show for the organization. But that's not close to the most interesting thing about Justin Wren.\n\nA video of Justin Wren recently went viral. It shows a group of Congan children petting the blonde hair on his arms. They’d never seen a man with blonde hair, and they’ve never seen hair on a man’s arm! The video is enchanting. But to really appreciate the video and how Justin Wren wound up in the Congo, you first have to know where he came from.\n\nWren was a ten time state champion wrestler in Texas, a five time all-American and a two time national champion. But after high school, Justin didn't take the conventional route. He went straight to the Olympic training center.\n\nAnd his career was off and running, but Justin knew something wasn't right.\n\n“Wrestling and fighting didn't fulfill me,\" Wren said. \"So at 23-years-old, even though I had fought in the UFC, and been a national champion wrestler, and I wrestled in Moscow. I kick boxed in Amsterdam. I was the main event at the hard rock in Las Vegas.\"\n\n\"I was depressed, so I was drinking and drugging, I even attempted suicide. I hit rock bottom at 23.”\n\nAnd in the process he let a lot of people down. He missed his best friend’s wedding. Made worse by the fact that he was the best man! “After you miss your best friend’s wedding. Being the best man, and after you hurt everyone around you, and you’re just a hurt person that hurts people, you want to hurt yourself. So that's where I got.”\n\nBut a childhood friend got through to Justin and convinced him to go on a retreat. Justin found religion, and friends, and meaning to his life.\n\nJustin’s decision to give up drugs coincided with a conscious decision to give back. Now he's decided to give up first world comfort to live in a hut for a year in a third world country. His emptied a home in Colorado, sold most of his belongings and what’s left is on a houseboat in North Texas.\n\n“About a year into me breaking free from all of the drugs and the drinking, I just wanted to go from always fighting against people to finally fighting for people,\" Wren said. \"And when I did that it changed everything for me.”\n\nAfter some research, this Texas sized man, with his new Texas sized heart, decided to help the smallest of people. He became a voice for the enslaved pygmies in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n“Everyone else calls them the forest people,\" Wren said. \"They called themselves the forest people, now they call themselves the forgotten people, because they've even been forgotten as humans.”\n\nThe Pygmies have been called half man half animal by many of their fellow countrymen. They have suffered cannibalism, and they’ve been slaves for years. And the DRC is arguably the most dangerous place on Earth. Still Justin spent a month there on two different occasions.\n\n“I woke up sleeping in a twiggy leaf hut, literally this tall, I’m having to crawl into it, and then it's the rain forest, so it's raining, so literally I woke up, several times sinking in mud!,\" Justin recalled.\n\nBut he had made a connection. “They said ‘can you help us have a voice, we have none.’ And I said I can absolutely help you with that.“\n\nAlthough after his first trip, Justin wasn't so sure. “If there was one place on this planet I never wanted to go to again, it was Congo. Then I thought, ‘what if nobody's fighting for these people, what if I’m supposed to fight for them.’”\n\nThe second time he went, he became family. Justin is still awed at the connection.\n\n“I’m 6'3\" 285 pounds with blonde hair and blue eyes,\" Wren said. \"The average Pygmy man is 4'7”. We’re just complete opposites. But our hearts are connected and we're family. They gave me the name Efeosa. And Efeosa means the man who loves us. And that was my goal. Was to go there and just love them well.”\n\nThe hard part was seeing the people he now loved, hurt. The stories are endless and each one more unbelievable than the last.\n\nJustin smiles when he talks of his buddy Harry.\n\n\"He's family, he gets paid after 10-12 hours of work, and he might get one or two minnows,\" Wren said. \"I saw him get minnows. His wife was home sick, but you don't work you don't eat. So he had to share his two minnows with his sick wife.”\n\n“Another woman was carrying a 120 pound bag of charcoal,\" Wren said. \"Her slave masters tied a rope around her head, two men put charcoal on her back and she walked 4 to 5 kilometers through the jungle. And she got paid literally a mouse pad sized piece of goat fur, and that was what she was paid to eat.”\n\nAnd Justin’s tone drops as he talks about a young family member, Andi Bo.\n\n“One of the toughest things I saw was Andi Bo, an innocent infant denied hospital treatment and dying,\" Wren said. \"When I went to pick him up that's when he started bleeding out of his ears. And the next day I buried him. And while I was digging his grave they told me to go ahead and dig his mom's grave.”\n\nThe family knew Andi Bo’s mom had the same parasite that took her son’s life. They figured it wouldn’t be long. But Justin wouldn’t have any of it. “I was like no it's not over yet, and their like it's about to be, because she'll get denied hospital treatment too.” Justin got Andi Bo's mom to the hospital and made sure she got treatment.\n\nNow he's headed back to the DRC. This time for a year. He’ll live in a hut barely bigger than his enormous frame. And he’ll do everything he can to help. Working with Shalom University, they'll barter with the slave masters, offering things like money and water wells for the freedom of Pygmies.\n\nIn a year, Justin thinks he might be able to see 1000 of his friends and his new family finally free.\n\nJustin dreams of seeing this goal become a reality.\n\n“More important to me than my UFC fighting or anything here is seeing that my actual family,\" Wren said. \"They've brought me in as family, to see that they have their freedom. My goal is to see them loved. to fight for the forgotten, to see they know that they're not forgotten, that people care about them, that their life is worth living, and that they're loved. So I’m going over there to love the unloved.”\n\nTo be clear, Justin isn't doing this on his own. He’s working, as he said, with Shalom University in the Congo. They’ve been working on this same effort for seven years. Justin calls his part of the program \"fight for the forgotten\".\n\nClick on this sentence to help Justin Wren and his mission.",

I am one of the millions of women around the world who has been inspired by your courage. When I face swaths of criticism for standing up for what I believe in (as I regularly do), your face is one of the ones I call to my mind to give me perspective. Others include Alice Paul and Miley Cyrus—but that’s another story.\n\nI have been following your worldwide book tour with much interest. I watched in awe as you spoke of peace to Jon Stewart. I rejoiced when you used your celebrity power to try and discourage President Obama’s drone policy. I want you to know that you are not alone in wanting that to change.\n\nI also caught your interview with CNN in which you said you hoped to be a prime minister of Pakistan someday. As someone who values peace, who values women’s betterment, and who knows you want what’s best for your country, I implore you to reconsider.\n\nWhen I was your age (almost nine years ago, if you can believe it), I too considered entering government. I knew I was on Earth to make a difference in people’s lives, and what better way to do that than through government—it makes the rules, after all? When I discovered that legislatures weren’t for me, I switched my ambitions to practicing law. Perhaps if I could bring down bad laws, or make sure that laws were applied correctly, I could make a difference.\n\nBut I was wrong. By acting to make my worldview codified in law, I would be no different than the people who were imposing their beliefs on me.\n\nIn your interview with Jon Stewart, you wowed everyone when you said:\n\n…But then I said, ‘If you hit the Talib with your shoe, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib. You must not treat others with cruelty and that much [harshness]. You must fight others, but through peace and through dialogue and through education.’\n\nAsk yourself: If you get to be Prime Minister, and you want to bring education to everyone in your country, what happens then to the Talib? What if he opposes that education plan? If he demonstrates, pickets, or passes laws against you? What if local leaders refuse to let women and girls into school doors, much in the way that local leaders in the Southern United States refused to let black people into schools? Even worse, what happens if so many in your country disagreed with you that they would be willing to go to war to keep their ways. You could, and, in many ways would be obligated to, ultimately, use force to uphold the law.\n\nYou see, governments are not about peace, Miss Yousafzai. They are about force and violence. You cannot be a government official and promote peace.\n\nIf you want to help your country adopt your ideas peacefully, I would suggest becoming an entrepreneur.\n\nYou are brilliant, resourceful, and determined—all good things to make a business work. You can make an impact on the lives of women by hiring those who have perhaps lost their husbands and have no means to support themselves or who wish to break away from traditional families. You could even educate these women if you saw fit. Perhaps these women themselves will go on to start businesses and be successful. If you and women like you can make the lives of your fellows better with products or services, your fellow Pakistanis may become more receptive to offering education to women as a matter of course. And the more receptive they are to that idea, the laws will change to reflect that—all without the threat of violence.\n\nDo not mistake me: My way might be a little slower than becoming Prime Minister. It is always easier and deceptively quicker to force your idea of what is right on people than it is to persuade them—just ask the Taliban. I do not presume to know what is best for you or your country. However, I do believe, as I think you do too, that peaceful, cooperative solutions are both more ethical and more effective than forceful ones, and I hope you will remember that as you age and remain consistent to that principle and stay out of government.\n\nAll the best in your endeavors,\n\nGina Luttrell\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nThoughts on Liberty\n\nP.S.

  "latent_12445": "Watch us turn the Samus amiibo into Fusion Suit Samus!\n\nNintendo, we love you, but you’ve given us plenty of stress this holiday season. First it was a lack of GameCube controller adapters for Super Smash Bros. Wii U, and now it’s amiibo. You see, we didn’t know the holy trinity - Marth, Villager and Wii Fit Trainer - would be so difficult to find; in fact, we’ve never seen Marth in stores. Now wave 2a just released, and we spent countless hours driving to Targets and Toys R Us stores in search of Diddy Kong and Little Mac. Quite frankly, the anticipation for wave 2b (Luigi, Pit and Captain Falcon) is so incredibly high we can barely stand it, and forget about store exclusives Shulk (GameStop), Lucario (Toys R Us) and Rosalina (Target). Our bodies are not ready.\n\nThere’s a good chance you, the reader, feel our pain. Sure, you could pick up Marth, Villager and Wii Fit Trainer on eBay, but who wants to spend $150 for three figures? If you raised your hand, proceed. It’s cool. No judgment.\n\nIf you’ve lost all hope, there’s a decent chance you’ll be able to complete your amiibo collection by following these tips. We can’t guarantee anything, but at the end of the day, it’s all about having the best shot possible without wasting resources, and who knows? After the holidays, Nintendo may restock all of the amiibo. Well, at least until wave 3 comes along.\n\nFirst tip, visit Nintendo World in New York City. Nintendo’s flagship store, located at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, benefits from a different set of rules that don’t apply to Toys R Us and Walmart. In fact, Marth and Villager were in stock as early as December 5, and Little Mac, Zelda and Diddy Kong are available now.\n\nIt’s OK to randomly stop by, but your best bet is to call the store (646-459-0800) to check on release dates and current inventory. Employees also do a great job updating the store’s Twitter feed. Check it on a daily basis to find out when characters release. Keep in mind that due to NYC being the tourist mecca of the universe, you’ll have plenty of Nintendo fans on the hunt.\n\nOf course, not everyone has easy access to the Big Apple, and this information doesn’t help if you live in Kansas. To be fair, this limits your chances somewhat, but we found the amiibo subreddit (r/amiibo) to be a great online resource. The amiibo community constantly posts information on release dates (these vary per store) and someone created a helpful spreadsheet that lists all of the current amiibo and their scarcity; the creator seems to update it regularly. You’ll even discover AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) with Target and Toys R Us employees, who will clue you into shipment arrivals and sell dates.\n\nYou can also call stores in your area, but considering many retailers hire part time help for the holidays, the person on the other end of the phone may not know what an amiibo is. Besides, driving to stores and making exciting discoveries is part of the fun… and also a surefire way to experience heartbreaking disappointment. Such is life for frenzied toy collectors.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, consider buying amiibo overseas. Amazon Germany and import video game site Play-Asia have hard-to-find amiibo in stock. You will pay more (Captain Falcon costs $19.99 through Play-Asia, minus shipping costs), but it’s cheaper than eBay, and you can make the purchase from home instead of dealing with holiday crowds. Personally, we love the Japanese writing on the package.\n\nThat said, a word of warning. When it comes to ordering via Amazon outside the U.S., you won’t have access to Prime. Furthermore, you roll the virtual dice buying amiibo online when it comes to mint condition. There’s always the possibility of receiving boxes with bent corners, and considering some of the packaging issues seen in stores (characters upside down, average paint jobs), there’s no telling what you’ll find inside the shipping box.\n\nFinally, look for Nintendo fans interested in swapping amiibo. Popular online message board NeoGaf is full of avid amiibo collectors hoping to trade a Wii Fit Trainer for a Villager, or a Captain Falcon for a Pit; the last two are already available in different countries. That’s where having an extra Little Mac may come in handy.\n\nLet us know which amiibo is your favorite, and don’t stress out too much. There are plenty of Nintendo fans (us included) who are just as eager to get their hands on the rarest characters.\n\nOur advice? If you see an amiibo you want, buy or reserve it. You never know when figures like Fox and Samus will disappear, and Amazon U.S. stil accepts pre-orders for select Wave 3 figures.\n\nReturn to Prima's amiibo Buying Guide.",
  "latent_12457": "Federal employes will be given at least six weeks of paid leave to care for new children under plans unveiled by the White House to kick-start legislative efforts to close the gap in family benefits offered by the US and other wealthy countries.\n\nDemocrats have been pushing for better maternity and sick leave rights for over a decade in Congress with little success, but plans by Barack Obama to back the passage of a Healthy Families Act with the executive action for government workers and $2.2bn of new funding for state efforts would be the first time the president has acted on the issue.\n\nThe long-stalled legislation would also allow workers in the private sector to earn up to seven days a year of paid sick time and although it is still opposed by most Republicans, Obama’s intervention ahead of the State of Union address next week suggests Democrats hope to make the policy an issue for emerging 2016 presidential candidates.\n\nIn a briefing for reporters, White House officials said its plan to grant six weeks of paid leave to workers at federal agencies would be “an advance” on their future leave entitlements aimed specifically at new parents rather than an additional grant, which would be difficult to provide without legislation.\n\nAnnouncing the plan separately in a blog on LinkedIn, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the US remained “the only developed country in the world that does not offer paid maternity leave”.\n\n“At a time when all parents are working in more than 60% of households with children, and 63% of women with children under the age of five participate in the labour force, one fact is resoundingly clear: the fundamental structure of our workplaces has simply not kept pace with the changing American family,” added Jarrett, who is also chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls.\n\nThe White House estimates 43 million private sector workers currently do have any paid sick leave and a survey of 185 countries by the International Labour Organisation suggests the US and Papua New Guinea are the only ones not to offer paid maternity leave.\n\nBut US business groups argue that small businesses in particular should be allowed to determine the benefits they offer to workers. “Our members are opposed to it because of real costs — and in a philosophical sense, they’re opposed to it because they don’t want the government telling them what to do,” a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Businesses recently told The Hill magazine.\n\nA breakthrough, however, will probably depend on whether the issue is embraced by a new generation of Republican leaders.\n\nThe Democratic congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, sponsor of the current legislation backed by Obama, has introduced a version of the Healthy Families Act in every Congress since 2004 with little effect even when Democrats controlled both chambers.\n\nBut the White House points to three states – California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island – that have launched programmes offering paid family and medical leave that it claims have not had any negative impact on employers and are helping shift the national debate.\n\n“Two years after passage of a law requiring workers to earn paid sick days in Connecticut, more than three-quarters of employers responding to a survey indicated that they supported the new law, and employers reported that there were little or no negative effects of the new law on their bottom line,” added a fact sheet issued by the White House.",
  "latent_12465": "If there is one genre of gaming I have always been drawn to it has to be those grand space adventure games we saw so much of back in the 90’s. For years I thought we would never see another great game like FreeSpace, Wing Commander or Freelancer come along but VR is changing all of that. Now it seems as if every other month a new space based game is being announced and this time around it is Space Rift.\n\nSpace Rift is a story-driven space adventure that is specifically designed and optimized for VR headsets such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. Space Rift features a cinematic story paired with gameplay and level design choices that make it a unique yet still somewhat familiar experience. The game provides players with a cinema style presentation that combines scripted missions and tons of dialogue played out by detailed characters. Unlike other VR mini-games and tech-demos, Space Rift is a complete game experience.\n\nSpace Rift’s game play is set against an epic story where Earth has been devastated entirely by a destructive meteor shower, thus forcing humanity to emigrate to Mars. At the heart of the story humans have been enslaved by the WEYSS and PANDORA corporations and forced to carve out a miserable existence on the distant red planet. Players will slip into the role of the veteran pilot Casey, who dares to take on the hostile organizations in order to liberate humankind from their suffering on Mars. Throughout the game radio transmissions, newscasts and interactions with the non-player characters on the base station add new and thrilling details about the on-going conflict as well as revealing pieces of background information.\n\nI must say, I really liked playing this one! The flight mechanics are butter smooth, and the story is not half bad either. The game does have a few minor issues with scale in some of the cinematic sequences, but overall that was easy to overlook. The graphics were clean and the lighting was good as well. Space Rift also features good sound design with lots of voice overs to make the player feel like they are a part of the story that unfolds as the game progresses. Although the game is mostly set in the cockpit of your ship, it does also have a station environment where players will upgrade their ship, talk to various NPC’s and take on missions. Once getting to the station players are forced into teleport locomotion in order to move. This is obviously a design choice to help alleviate the motion sickness that some players could experience. I do however wish that the developers would have included the option for traditional locomotion to accommodate those of us with strong VR legs, but the point and click style of the station environment is not a deal breaker. Overall I really liked playing Space Rift and I can’t wait to see more of the game. So, If your like me and love space based combat as well as story driven gameplay then I highly recommend heading to the link below to pick up a copy of this one.\n\nSpace Rift will be available for PC and all major VR headsets on August 2, 2016 at a price of USD/ EUR 19.99 (GBP 14.99):\n\nThanks for reading my latest article!

  "latent_12556": "Rudy Giuliani is campaigning more fiercely and ubiquitously for Donald Trump than he has for any recent Republican nominee. People wonder why, but as a former privatization advisor to the mayor and current economic advisor to the nominee, I see many reasons why their alliance was inevitable.\n\nBoth are outspoken, highly competitive, larger-than-life figures. More importantly, both are spiritual godchildren of Ronald Reagan. Trump’s plans for deregulating the overbearing federal government and breathing life into our moribund economy are strikingly similar to ideas Rudy introduced as mayor.\n\nRudy's policies helped hundreds of thousands of people move from welfare rolls to work. Similarly, Trump's child-care tax credits and strategy to return jobs from abroad will help the poor climb those critical first few rungs of the economic ladder towards the middle class.\n\nBoth Rudy and Donald know that intelligent tax cuts, sound fiscal policies, and governmental reform will result in more net tax revenues, not less. To boost New York City's lagging tourist industry, Rudy cut the hotel room rent tax and created matching grants to help cultural institutions expand their offerings to the public. Within a year, tourism was growing again.\n\nFollowing that playbook, Trump’s trade policies, reduced corporate repatriation tax and deregulation will stimulate growth nationwide. This contrasts sharply with Hillary Clinton's embrace of the dismal “new normal” as the best we can do. Her adherence to Obamacare and other job-killing regulations, higher taxes and, consequent, trade deficits mean another four (or eight!) more years of stagnation.\n\nDonald and Rudy know we can do better.\n\nDuring his tenure as Mayor, I helped Rudy sell off money-losing TV and radio stations and privatize moribund programs. The hundreds of millions of dollars we raised helped fund the early retirement of thousands of civil servants. Trump’s pledge to reduce non-defense discretionary spending by 1% per year would work similar wonders for the federal budget.\n\nBoth Rudy and Donald are also law-and-order hawks. They understand that government's most fundamental obligation is to maintain civil order. They know that a strong but principled stop-and-frisk policy is not a form of harassment, but an effective tool for removing illegal guns from the streets.\n\nI saw this first-hand, having participated as \"police commissioner for a day\" in a raid on a group of low-lifes who had converted a row of public phone booths into a drug-trading floor. Frisking one especially disreputable-looking man revealed $20,000 in cash and a Syracuse driver’s license. When asked why he was in New York with so much cash, he replied he was clothes shopping … 2:30 am. We then found a gun strapped to his ankle. This is just one of the thousands of stories underlying the historic crime reduction under the Giuliani Administration — landmark achievement that dramatically improved the daily life of minority communities across New York City.\n\nOf course, the main reason why one-sixth of our population ages 18 to 35 is either in jail or on unemployment is the lack of decent-paying jobs — a fact both Trump and Giuliani understand innately. When employment dries up, crime is often the alternative. It’s the tragic reality of so many inner-city communities that have languished under Democratic Party rule. Trump, meanwhile, has spent a lifetime hiring thousands of people of color to work at his construction projects, hotels, clubs and resorts. As his children say, their Dad has spent his career signing the fronts of checks, not the backs of them.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt famously said, “Speak softly but carry a big stick.\" Reagan famously pursued “peace through strength.” These are the dicta Trump will live by. Like his friend, Giuliani, Trump knows the best way to maintain global peace and stability is through the projection of U.S. power. While the Obama-Clinton regime has hollowed out America’s military (our naval fleet has been reduced to 1917 levels), Trump would reconstitute our national defense, much as Giuliani reconstituted New York’s police.\n\nAs for negotiating skills, Trump and Giuliani are cut from the same cloth. Rudy toughed it out with the unions and Albany to get far better deals that accrued to the city’s bottom line.\n\nSimilarly, Trump knows that America’s $500 billion annual trade deficit is unsustainable. He’ll apply his unique business skills to renegotiate our trade deals. And as a good businessman, he understands that free trade is a two-way street. He will only impose tariffs on other nations when they persist in maintaining unfair barriers to American exports or try to dump their products on the U.S.\n\nNeither Donald nor Rudy have enjoyed much support from the Republican Brahmins. The base for both has been ordinary rank-and-file citizens. While Manhattan’s limousine liberals assailed Rudy, working class people in outer boroughs like Staten Island voted for him overwhelmingly.\n\nIt’s not unlike how the GOP elite initially ignored Trump’s candidacy and tried to deny him the nomination, only to be outvoted by Donald’s core support among heartland Americans who have struggled economically for decades and will no longer accept being left behind. Democrats are guilty of the same, with the Clinton camp conspiring to deny Bernie Sanders a fair chance to be their party's nominee. These actions will haunt both parties' leadership for years to come. Regardless of what happens in November, the Trump and Sanders contingents are not going away. The millions of small donors who have earnestly contributed to Donald have consciously rejected traditional party leadership. Trump is now their undisputed champion.\n\nOne of the major themes of this crucial campaign year is how completely leaders of both parties have lost touch with their constituents to whom they are ultimately beholden. They also forget that party loyalty is a lot like virginity, which is so easy to lose and impossible to regain. The bottom line is that we may be witnessing the demise of the two-party system as we have known it. Heaven help the country if we disintegrate into the dysfunctional morass of multiple parties and coalition governments that has long plagued Europe and Japan.\n\nIf we take that plunge, it will be because the party elites have lost touch with their voters. Meanwhile, come what may for the major parties, Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani will continue on as two happy warriors, kindred souls in the tradition of Ronald Reagan.\n\nWilbur Ross is a private equity investor and a senior policy advisor to the Trump campaign.",

Photo: Zoopy\n\nA South Korean dog meat festival has been cancelled following growls of protest from animal rights activists, one of the would-be organisers said Tuesday. The Korea Dog Farmers' Association had scheduled for Friday a festival aimed at promoting traditional dog meat consumption, said Ann Yong-Geun, an adviser to the association.\n\n“We couldn't possibly go on with the plan due to endless phone calls of complaint... now there are few willing to rent us a place for the event,” Ann, a professor of nutrition at Chung Cheong University, told AFP.\n\nThe association had said the festival, to be held in a traditional open-air market in the city of Seongnam just south of Seoul, would showcase various canine delicacies including barbecued dog, sausages and steamed paws.\n\nThe event at the market, well known for selling dogs for meat, would also have featured products such as cosmetics and spirits with canine ingredients.\n\nAnn said the festival would have displayed video clips and pictures of farms raising dogs under sanitary conditions, contrary to public perceptions.\n\nHe said there are about 600 farms raising dogs for meat in South Korea, where their meat has long been eaten and dog soup, or Boshintang, is a summer delicacy.\n\nBut growing numbers of Koreans oppose the practice and consider it an international embarrassment.\n\nThe planned festival stirred fury from South Korean animal rights groups and many Internet users.\n\n“This is making our country an international laughing stock, and making the whole world mistakenly believe that all South Koreans eat dogs,” said Park So-Youn, head of Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth.\n\nThe group led online campaigns to force cancellation of the festival.\n\n“Canines are the animals emotionally closest to humans.

It used the December attacks on San Bernardino, Calif., to stoke fear of terrorists sneaking into the country illegally, and cited the immigration deal Mr. Rubio pushed for in Congress in 2013 as evidence he worked to “allow sanctuary cities.”\n\n“We had our legal folks review it, and it was decided that this needed to be pulled and substituted,” Randy Ingram, the general manager of WBTW in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said, although he couldn’t recall the specifics of the legal team’s decision.\n\nHe said other stations in the Media General umbrella, which includes WCBD in Charleston and WSPA in Greenville/Spartanburg, also pulled the ad.\n\nThe decision was made on Friday, and the ad was pulled from rotation on Saturday.\n\n“The Sanctuary ad aired statewide on both television and digital in Iowa with no objection, receiving hundreds of thousands of views on digital,” Eric Lycan, an attorney for the group, said in a statement.

  "latent_13031": "He's a dove now: John McCain's shameless new hypocrisy The Arizona senator is blanching at a request for military assistance after beating the Iraq war drum for years\n\nLast week, John McCain, the senior U.S. Senator from the state of Arizona and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, somewhat surprisingly, called for restraint in response to an Iraqi request for military assistance to deal with a new wave of instability. Instead, he argued for a political response.\n\nRare is the potential military conflict where Senator McCain does not immediately call on the U.S. military to get involved.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nA poorly conceived 2007 joke he made on the campaign trail with regards to Iran – “Bomb, bomb, bomb!” – seems to have evolved into his lifetime motto.\n\nThat is definitely not the behavior pattern generally associated with a former P.O.W. And by his standards, in Vietnam, the theater where he got entangled, as well as elsewhere in Asia, Senator McCain has shown more reserve and sense of judgment.\n\nThe trigger-happy Senator\n\nNot so in the Middle East and Africa. In 2013, it has been a drumbeat for strikes in Syria. In 2011, he was anxious to bomb Libya. That country is now in a mess that makes Iraq look stable by comparison, hard though it may be to believe.\n\nIn 2007, it was imperative to Senator McCain that the United States strike Iran.\n\nSo it comes as a bit of a shock that Senator McCain’s seemingly relentless interventionism has morphed into gentle counseling of the White House to show great restraint with regard to Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki’s request for more U.S. military support.\n\nMr. Disingenuity\n\nIn the contemporary context, the argument that the senator eagerly presents in TV interviews does have clear merit. Maliki would indeed serve his presumed cause of wanting to stabilize Iraq much better if he truly pursued a more inclusive government in Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAfter all, Iraq’s Sunnis, formerly the country’s ruling class under Saddam Hussein, feel deeply frustrated at their lack of political rights in the new Shia-dominated Iraq.\n\nHowever, for Senator McCain to make that case is genuinely hypocritical. Lest we forget, Senator McCain bears personal responsibility for the de facto Iranization of Iraq.\n\nAs a staunch supporter of the 2002 invasion, Mr. McCain bought into and sold every pretense of the prior Administration for this blood-stained bag of goods.\n\nThese range from false claims of WMDs, to outlandish suggestions of al-Qaeda presence, to the truth that Saddam Hussein was just an evil man without ever considering the obvious consequences of removing him. Hence, his wisdom is a little late in coming.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAfter a decade of the United States pouring oil into the Iraqi fire, with the likes of McCain acting as cheerleaders, Iraq is badly traumatized.\n\nIraq’s politics, a very complex affair even under the best of circumstances, are completely out of kilter, thanks to the high-handed and completely ill-advised American intervention. Its present crop of elected officials has been completely discredited.\n\nWhy McCain is lucky\n\nMr. McCain, though, is very fortunate to live in the United States and serve in the U.S. Congress. In virtually any other country, the general population would have long considered him as discredited a politician as Iraq’s leadership.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut in the increasingly short-term collective memory of the United States, he is essentially safe, aided and abetted by forever subservient mainstream media. They are, quite perversely, always eager to give failure a positive platform.\n\nIn false deference, they lack the courage to confront Mr. McCain with his own culpability in the Iraq affair.\n\nBut maybe it’s less deference than commercial fear that such bluntness would lose them “access” to senior politicians. Is it worth, they wonder, reminding the American public of historic truths when the “risks” are that high?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nEvidently not. Let’s leave that to Jon Stewart, the thinking goes. After all, he is a comedian. The jester can safely mock the court without losing his head.\n\nLeave it Jon Stewart! Really?\n\nOf course, for us mere mortals that raises the question of journalism’s raison d’être if it just acts as an accomplice to those who have deceived us before.\n\nFor Senator McCain, all of that good fortune is not enough. What he likes the most is to go on offense – and, if at all possible, turn every twist in world affairs into an opportunity to berate the man who beat him out for the job five years ago. So count on him to turn the current set of regional events against the still youngish President.\n\nWith Syria teetering on the brink, al Qaeda forces have benefitted from a much freer rein roaming throughout Iraq. In Senator McCain’s eyes, forever focused solely on the present, it presents a perfect opportunity to argue that if President Obama had only intervened on the side of the rebels in Syria, Iraq would be more stable.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIraq? Syria? It’s the Democrats’ fault!\n\nThis is no idle matter strategically. Soon, Senator McCain and his fellow interventionists will argue that the conceivable collapse of Iraq was all President Obama’s and the Democrats’ fault.\n\nAfter all, they have been in power long enough by now, haven’t they? So, to McCain, it’s they who now “own it all” in Iraq, to use the phrase that Colin Powell once employed to warn the previous president.\n\nTo the mainstream media, it doesn’t really matter that former officials of the George W. Bush administration, as well as the Arizona Senator, have left their fingerprints and DNA all over the bloodshed in the Middle East and the region’s growing instability.\n\nThat, mind you, is widely seen as yesteryear’s story. And staying with that (truthful) storyline, if you can believe the twisted ways in which America works these days, would expose the mainstream media to having an “agenda.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAmerican news journalists, unlike sports commentators or Jon Stewart, are loathe to “go back to the tape” to show folks what really happened, even though it is in their job description.\n\nThat would be perceived as over-stressing the willingness of the American people to deal with the historical record. And any such effort would risk losing further segments of the audience.\n\nNo wonder that with such a meek media, politicians like Senator McCain get away with reinterpreting history at their convenience, without being ever held accountable.",

While exit polls had Republican operatives privately despairing about his chances, he proved them wrong, as he long said he would.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe scored wins in Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania, with Wisconsin putting him over the top just after 2:30 a.m.\n\nWhile Trump has accrued more than 270 electoral votes, it's possible that Clinton could still win the popular vote, though it's too early to tell for sure.\n\nClinton conceded the race in a phone call with Trump, according to an aide.\n\nTrump has so far been projected the winner of 26 states. Clinton has been projected to take 18 states, including the swing states of Virginia and Colorado, but saw much of her blue-state firewall fall to pieces.\n\nThe Republican's victory has left the political world in a state of shock, with the outcome heralding a seismic shift in the nation's politics.\n\nRepublicans are projected to hold their majorities in the House and Senate, which means they will have unified control of Washington for the first time since 2005. That frees them up to roll back much of President Obama's legacy and pursue a dramatically different agenda.\n\nTrump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said earlier in the evening that the campaign was feeling \"really good\" about where the race stood — and that turned out to be an understatement.\n\n\"The movement that Donald Trump has built has been able to grow the party in a very different way — be more pro-worker, a little less elitist,\" Conway said on MSNBC.\n\nEven senior Trump aides admitted being shocked by the results, with their own internal polls showing the businessman behind in the race.\n\nAs the night has progressed, the mood has changed dramatically in the two campaigns, with a deep gloom falling over Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn and the mood rising in Trump Tower. Amid tears and silence, a reporter for The Hill spotted people leaving the Clinton event early.\n\nPolls ahead of Tuesday had given the Clinton camp confidence, with most showing her leading the race by at least 4 points.\n\nBut those polls dramatically underestimated support for Trump, who appears to be outperforming Mitt Romney by big margins among white, working class voters, changing the electoral map in ways few thought possible.\n\nWhile Trump called in for several radio and TV interviews Tuesday, Clinton mostly kept out of the spotlight, save for casting her vote in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Tuesday morning. She called the experience “humbling.”\n\n“I know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and will do the very best if I am fortunate enough to win today,” she said.\n\nThe public has not heard from either candidate since the first results were released at around 7 p.m.\n\nIt appears unlikely that Clinton will make public comments until Wednesday.\n\nHer campaign chairman, John Podesta, made an appearance in New York just after 2 a.m., declaring that the race isn’t over.\n\n\"They are still counting votes and every vote should count,\" Podesta said at the Javitz Center, the site of the Clinton campaign election party.\n\n\"Several states are too close to call, so we are not going to have more to say tonight.\"",

Learn more here.\n\nDesigning and critiquing logos for web-based companies and startups is a pursuit of endless fascination for many of us. Over the years, we've seen enough startups come and go (and rebrand and merge) to fill a volume with how and how not to develop and execute a logo for a web company.\n\nWe've also picked up some knowledge about trends in this field. Some of the trends are good; others, regrettable. Others still are simply overused, which is the saddest scenario of them all. We hate to see a good design trick or typeface grow hackneyed over the course of a few months, but it happens all the time, unfortunately.\n\nIn this article, we've identified 11 trends in web company logo design. Hopefully, you'll see a few here that apply to the startups and web apps we write about every day. And of course, we've included some handy illustrations as a sort of field guide to the logos of the web.\n\nTake a look, and let us know what you think of these trends — and what trends we should have included — in the comments.\n\n1. Badges and Buttons\n\nWe've moved away from the once-ubiquitious BETA! button, but location-esque badges, app-like icons, and \"play\" buttons are still showing up all over the web. These logos tend to be quite \"shiny,\" thanks to a few carefully-blended white gradient layers. The square logos have rounded corners. Some appear to glow as if lit from within, which is a compelling and trendy effect in itself. All in all, the badge-and-button set look quite touchable.\n\nStill, this trend's days may be numbered, if only due to overuse and association-bordering-on-marriage with the Apple/iPhone brand. See also: Wet floor effect. Unless you're designing for a pure-play iPhone app shop, sail these seas with caution.\n\n2. Speech Bubbles and Megaphones\n\nIf social web apps are all about communication, then it stands to reason that many social web company logos are all about talking. We see fewer logos that revolve around listening (if you happen to see a giant ear logo in the wild, do let us know), but megaphones and speech bubbles abound.\n\n3. Fun With Opacity!\n\nRemember the first time you discovered Multiply and Overlay blend modes in Photoshop? If that moment changed your life forever, then you probably understand the beauty of a simple, elegant logo that delicately plays with opacity.\n\nWhile this logo treatment won't work for every web app, it's a versatile and timeless way to present classic shapes in a new light. We're seeing this basic effect used simply in MasterCard-reminiscent designs, and we're seeing much more complex opacity effects used in logos for HTML5 and Microsoft Silverlight, for example.\n\nPlaying with blending modes, opacity and overlapping shapes can also be a fun way to experiment with analogous color schemes.\n\n4. Kawaii Illustration\n\nCalling all woodland creatures: You're wanted on the Internet. In fact, the only time you've been in greater demand than you are now was when Disney was making those saccharine \"princess\" films.\n\nWhy are these wide-eyed, adorable critters making their way into logo design? Apps are for adults, right? Especially apps such as Seesmic, a powerful web app dashboard for power users and the enterprise, and GitHub, an industry standard for source code hosting.\n\nWe don't know exactly how, when or why kawaii made a comeback into serious-business logo design, but with logos this cute, who are we to complain?\n\n5. Scripts, Slabs and Other Cool Fonts\n\nSay it with me: \"I will not use Archer for a web company's logo design.\"\n\nArcher and its ilk were used to great effect over the past couple years on a number of memorable web company logos. That being said, the Year of the Slab is definitely not over. In fact, it's more of an epoch than a traditional Gregorian year at this point. Slab serif fonts — if they're unique fonts — are still a viable alternative to been-there-done-that sans serifs in logos, and the web community still enjoys them.\n\nThat being said, a good, juicy script can be one of the liveliest, most unexpected logo choices yet, particularly if your logo is solely typographic. Rephoria uses my personal favorite, Candy Script, a swash-heavy number that's almost too voluptuous for work but which still makes the cut for a single-word logo.\n\nJust remember: When using more unusual fonts for logo design, restraint and legibility are key.\n\n6. Verdant and Plant-Inspired\n\nPlants and leaves aren't just for green tech companies, folks. When you're trying to project growth, one of the most obvious logo choices is flora. A shy set of leaves, a furling bud, a sprouting seed — what could better convey your company's fresh problem solving and rapid expansion?\n\n7. Quadrangles\n\nIt's not a rectangle, it's not a square, but whatever it is, it's popping up everywhere. Quadrangles are, if the web is to be believed, the new dots. From rhombuses to parallelograms to indescribable yet angular blobs, these shapes strive for post-modern and consumer-friendly.\n\n8. Retro Game References\n\nPerhaps it's because the newer crop of web designers are also children of the late eighties, but we've been seeing a lot of pseudo-retro, video game-inspired logo work lately. While these designs are definitely quirky, geeky and cool, beware using them for a general audience; not everyone feels the same nostalgia we do for an 8-bit, pixelated graphic of a mushroom.\n\n9. Color-Coordinated Compound Words\n\nWeb startup names and logos are inextricably linked. We're a couple years past the compound word phase (which was most virulent right before the tragic \"missing vowel\" phase that gave birth to web companies with names like \"Packg\" and \"Clevrr\"), but we haven't left behind our love for merged-word logos in two snappy, coordinating colors.\n\nThis trick is one of the oldest in the book. It was notably used for Vignelli Associates' 1967 rebranding of American Airlines, whose two-word name became a one-word logo in red and blue.\n\n10. Logotypes\n\nThe big boys of the web, sites such as Google and Facebook, have inspired the logo design of a generation with their utter simplicity. In many cases, those initial logotypes were less legitimate logo design and more \"put our startup's name in a simple font and stick it up on the web, we'll deal with branding later.\"\n\nThe name-in-a-sans-serif look says your company has nothing to prove and that you focus on product over promotion. If it's well-executed, it's a powerful statement to make. However, if poorly executed, it looks hasty, sloppy, juvenile and amateurish.\n\nLogotypes can also be a great excuse to play with exciting typefaces and trendy treatments, such as the embossed or letterpress look that's getting so much play these days, thanks to CSS3.\n\n11. Nodes, Spokes and Hubs\n\nBetween concepts such as linked data and the synaptic web, you had to see these designs coming. They remind us of molecular structure and K'nex, an updated take on the crop of mid-century modern Sputnik-inspired designs of the 1950s. These logos are usually intended to represent the interconnectedness of people and content on the web, or, in a more literal interpretation, computer hardware circuitry.\n\nAn excellent study of this concept is Bernard Barry's designs for the 2010 f8 conference.\n\nWhat Trends Are You Spotting?\n\nWhat trends are you seeing in web company logos these days? What are you already sick of, and what do you want to see more?

  "latent_13386": "Two taxpayer-funded college presidents and the president of America’s largest university-based climate alliance traveled a combined 8,426 miles this week to meet for slightly over an hour to discuss strategies for carbon reduction.\n\nThe “climate leadership meeting” occurred on Monday at Agnes Scott College, a private, all-female bastion of about 1,000 students in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur.\n\nThe meeting lasted one hour, seven minutes and 21 seconds, according to the YouTube video which captured it for posterity.\n\nSpeakers at the meeting included Ball State University president Paul Ferguson, Portland State University president Wim Wiewel and Tim Carter, the president of Second Nature, a Boston, Mass.-based coalition of colleges dedicated to fighting climate change.\n\nWiewel’s visit to the Agnes Scott campus all the way from the Portland State campus involved a lengthy round-trip journey of 5,192 miles.\n\nFerguson’s visit to suburban Atlanta from Ball State’s campus back in Muncie, Ind. took him on a round trip of 1,066 miles (assuming a direct flight from Indianapolis to Atlanta). The distance does not include the 132-mile round trip from Muncie to Indianapolis.\n\nCarter’s expedition from Boston to Atlanta covered 2,168 miles.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, a 5,810-mile round-trip flight from San Francisco to New York generates a warming effect equal to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per passenger.\n\nCollectively, then, the two college presidents and the president of the carbon-reduction group created about 4 tons of carbon dioxide with their 8,426 miles of travel.\n\nBy way of comparison, a typical American generates approximately 19 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Thus, in a single day, the three carbon-fighting academics produced as much carbon dioxide as a single American normally takes 11 weeks to produce.\n\nBesides Ferguson, Wiewel and Carter, it’s not clear if any carbon-fighting luminaries who traveled great distance were present.\n\nAgnes Scott College president Elizabeth Kiss was also present at Monday’s climate leadership meeting on the Agnes Scott campus.\n\nAccording to the Second Nature website, the group seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campuses and “to deal with a constantly changing climate and resulting extremes.”\n\nThe weather in Decatur, Ga. on Monday was pleasant. The temperature was in the 60s most of the day, according to Weather Underground. There was no rain.\n\nSecond Nature recently expanded its efforts to include an “integrated Climate Commitment,” according to a press release Second Nature sent to The Daily Caller.\n\nA “vanguard” of 45 university presidents have committed their schools to this new commitment. (RELATED: Jet-Setting Students Decry Brown University Decision Not To Divest From Coal Companies)\n\n“We have worked closely with our presidential leadership to ensure this expansion would empower the network to continue to push what is possible in climate leadership,” Carter the Second Nature president, said.\n\n“Our institutions continue to be committed to carbon reduction, but we recognize that the effects of climate change are with us now,” Wiewel, the Portland State president who traveled 5,192 round-trip miles for the one-hour meeting, added. “Individually and collectively, we have to increase our resilience in dealing with the effects of climate change, whether it’s drought, fires, storms, or other events.”\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter.

My name is Roger Kolikas and I am an avid gamer (Mostly RPG style games, I'm a compulsive grinder). I also happen to love kids (My own, and even most others....except the bratty ones, those, I love...oh wait, mine are the bratty ones!)\n\nI digress (Have always wanted to say that).\n\nI'm also a retired Marine with a background in construction and woodworking. As I've aged (Currently level 39 and doing my best to Benjamin Button this life)... I've realized that construction won't work forever. So I took my savings and bought all the tools needed to run a woodworking shop. (CNC Router & Table, CNC laser engraver/cutter, hand tools, etc...)\n\nThen, I was off! Going full bore towards anything and everything I could think of that could be made in my shop, furniture, knick knacks, glassware, etc. This is when I decided to try my hand at making deck boxes and ended up designing the \"King Commander Box\".\n\nKing Commander Box\n\nFeatures of the King Commander Box\n\nHardwood construction\n\nBaltic Birch Interior for additional protection\n\n8 Neodymium magnets make sure the lid stays on during transit\n\nHand Rubbed Tung Oil Finish\n\nExtra Large Capacity (Holds over 100 double sleeved cards.....Way over! I store my 100DB sleeved Kemba deck, plus Kemba in an Ultra Pro \"Mini-Snap\" case, AND a stack of 20ish Unsleeved Tokens with a little room left over)\n\nEngraved King Commander in Red Oak. Images supplied by a client\n\nWenge King Commander Box\n\nI happened to stumble onto a story about edge lighting (It's neat, you should look it up)... the coolness factor hit the geek in me and I had an idea. LED's in everything! Picture frame? light it up! Kids bed? Light it up! Gaming accessories? Light it....wait, oh man, I had an idea! So I went to work designing and figuring out how to make a Deck Box that could light up and make every person who saw it get super jealous. (Yeh, I play a little Magic, does it show?)\n\nI own a small game store, (Don't pity me, it isn't that bad!) so I already had a group of people who could tell me the pro's and con's with each iteration of my boxes. That is how the Illumination Series of boxes was born.\n\nCurrently there are 4 models in the series, and in my mind they tell the story of a young adventurer just starting out.\n\nThe Torch\n\nThis is the first box in our Illumination Series. This series tells the story of a brave adventurer. The story begins here, as a 13 year old boy he leaves home with dreams of being the greatest Warrior the world has ever known. But, as with all young adventurers he begins his journey with only a cheap set of armor, a rusty sword, and a bag filled with the most basic of tools. He loves the dark and enjoys traveling at night. The quiet calm of the midnight hours allow him time to think about how he wishes to achieve his dreams. With only his torch to light his way, he travels far from his homeland. As the days turn to weeks and the weeks to months, he gains experience by taking odd jobs in the towns he passes through. Today, he has taken the job of executioner for a group of beasts terrorizing this small village. This will be only his third time in physical combat, but he isn't worried. As he enters the cave of the beasts, he lights his trusty torch and soldiers on.\n\nFeatures of the Torch model\n\nHardwood construction\n\nInterior box made from Baltic Birch, with black felt on the front to contrast and make your image POP.

As you stealthily make your way further in, you find a group of 3 people that appear to be sneaking as well. Among them is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. You come to learn her name is Lidia and she travels the world with this group of adventurers. You all agree to team up for this battle and split the bounty. A bit further into the cave you locate your targets. What the townsfolk call beasts are wild boars. The battle is short and when it's over you all have a laugh and a drink while eating roasted pig. The hunter jokingly states that he will make more from the skins of these boars than his cut of the payment from the town. Once you have collected your reward, they leave and you are left alone. A few weeks later, in a larger city you hear a familiar voice. You turn to see Lidia standing there. You ask her to the tavern to catch up and find out that her group took another job shortly after they left you...during that job one of the members was killed. After that, the party split up. You like Lidia, so you invite her to come with you on your next journey. She happily accepts and states that finding a decent group is difficult for a girl of only 15, most men laughed at her or made crude remarks. You stop by the shops on your way out of town, where you pickup a nice new sword, some chainmail, and a new lantern...since \"the oil inside can be used as a weapon if need be\". And you continue on your journey with a new friend.\n\nFeatures of the Lantern\n\nHardwood construction\n\n2 Interior boxes made from Baltic Birch, with black felt on the front to contrast and make your image POP. The interior boxes can be swapped back and forth between the Torch, Lantern & Hearth.

In a small town called Habbyworthe you take a job to clear monster, demons, beasts or whatever else you find from an old castle to get it ready for renovations by the town's Mayor. Apparently he wants to use it as a house for his Mistress and her children. The castle is overrun with large rats and wild beasts, but nothing that the two of you can't handle easily. Upon final inspection, in the furthest corner of the dungeon below the castle you notice a cobblestone that looks a slightly different color than the rest. Beneath it you find a map drawn on an animal's hide. You take it but think nothing more about it for weeks. As if by fate, you find the map in your bag while looking for something to eat and you decide to take a look....just as you are passing a large stone that is indicated on the map! Curiosity gets the better of you, and Lidia decided it may be fun to \"Hunt the treasure\". It leads you into a beautiful forest and straight to a large tree. \"It can't be this easy\", says Lidia....but it is! After digging for only a few hours you find a cache of gold, silver and jewels. You both quickly make it back to the main road, and at the next town you hire a respected escort to take your newfound riches home to your mother for safe keeping.\n\nFeatures of the 10k\n\nHardwood construction\n\n2 Interior boxes made from Baltic Birch, with black felt on the front to contrast and make your image POP. The first interior box capacity is the same as the King Commander box, only it is a side-loader.

Lidia is still your travelling companion and you continue to travel the world. Here, today, in this bright and bustling city you see a flyer at the tavern. (Heroes wanted, large amounts of gold await the right people). You both look at each other and simultaneously say \"Wanna go see what this is about?\" As it happens, it is a request to join the Royal army (There is a war going on currently, but then again, there always seems to be a war going on). The gold they speak of will be paid to returning warriors and will accumulate during your time of service. After a long conversation with Lidia back in your room at the inn, you both agree that it could be fun. After all, work is slim lately and a steady source of mead and meat would be nice. So you both join and are immediately sent to fight on the line with the forward company. It makes no difference, the front line is where all the Heroes seem to come from anyways. The days and nights seem to blend together so you request to be a scout in the dark and are permitted. Lidia grows weary of combat and requests a move to the kitchen (she always did love to cook). A few weeks later you stumble upon a sentry digging trenches and silently take him out with a blade between the ribs and up into his heart. He falls silently and you escape back into the shadows.

  "latent_13934": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWhile there are two full years before the 2016 US presidential race, the parade of possible candidates to Israel began Monday afternoon in Jerusalem with a meeting between Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWarren, whose name has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, arrived Saturday in Tel Aviv, and is set to also visit Ramallah and Amman. This is the first trip abroad for the senator, elected in 2012, who has so far concentrated largely on US domestic issues.\n\nIn addition to meeting Netanyahu on Monday, Warren went to the Knesset, where she witnessed an especially raucous session that featured Balad MK Jamal Zahalka being taken off the podium after calling presiding Deputy Knesset Speaker Moshe Feiglin (Likud) a fascist.Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who was among the government officials and Knesset members who met Warren, addressed the chaos from the podium, and then extended a welcome to Warren, standing in the balcony and accompanied by US Ambassador Dan Shapiro. The Knesset, which just a moment ago seemed gripped by bedlam, politely applauded her presence.According to The Boston Globe, Warren has been among only a handful of senators who have not traveled abroad. The paper wrote that while the trip may “reignite speculation of a 2016 presidential run, Warren has been planning to travel to Israel for months.”According to the Globe, “Warren’s foreign policy views seem to be anti-interventionist, with a skeptical eye to any US military action. In February, delivering her only major speech on foreign policy since she took office, she warned of using military might without considering the implications.”During an August meeting with constituents, Warren was pressed on her support of Israel and her votes to send money to support its fight against Hamas, and said that Israel was being attacked “indiscriminately” and had a right to fight back even though civilian casualties were the “last thing Israel wants,” the Globe said.“But when Hamas puts its rocket launchers next to hospitals, next to schools, they’re using their civilian population to protect their military assets,” Warren was quoted as saying. “And I believe Israel has a right, at that point, to defend itself.”A plank on Israel that appeared on her website when she ran for senate in 2012 said that she believed Israel “must maintain a qualitative military edge and defensible borders.”“The United States must continue to ensure that Israel can defend itself from terrorist organizations and hostile states, including Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and others,” she said. “I also believe firmly that a two-state solution is in the interest of Israel and the United States.“Lasting peace, however, requires negotiations between the parties themselves, and although the United States can and should aid in this process, we cannot dictate the terms. Unilateral actions, such as the Palestinians’ membership efforts before the United Nations, are unhelpful, and I would support vetoing a membership application,” she said.Other possible US presidential candidates are scheduled to visit Israel in the coming months.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

USA!” more often than not they are war-mongers):\n\nBut how on earth could those Primitive Muslim Barbarians get so angry when the Quran is burned or the image of the Prophet Muhammad is depicted in an offensive way?\n\nThis angry mob of American “partriots” lost its mind over a 5 by 8 foot piece of cloth. That certainly sounds stupider than being upset at someone from a “rival” religion for burning one’s holy book.\n\nBeing the uber-liberal that I am, I naturally support the right to burn a flag, a holy book, or a blunt. (However, my belief in tolerance and good manners would prevent me from supporting a person who burned a flag or holy book. There is a difference between supporting a person’s right to do something offensive on the one hand, and supporting the offensive act itself on the other.)\n\nThis video should explain to incredulous Americans why Muslims in the Islamic world get so riled up when they hear about Americans burning the Quran or disparaging the image of their prophet. The U.S. flag is not just worth its material value (a piece of cloth) but rather has far greater symbolic value: burning it is a symbolic assault on one’s American identity. It’s a purposeful provocation. Likewise, the images of Muhammad were not “just cartoons”; they were a symbolic affront to their Islamic identity, a purposeful provocation and incitement. It seems to confirm what the Muslims already suspect: they are being attacked, occupied, and killed for their religion.\n\nThe burning of the U.S. flag occurred in a certain context: it happened around the emotional time of Osama Bin Laden’s assassination. Had this flag burning taken place twenty years ago, it would likely not have evoked much reaction. But in the context of the War on Terror, the flag burning serves to affect Americans on a deeper level. (Considering that I think the U.S. is waging a War of Terror, I don’t get my panties in a bunch by flag burning. That is, after all, the same flag that is so proudly planted on the ground of those whose lands we illegally occupy–so, while I certainly don’t condone it, I could understand why people would want to burn it.)\n\nLikewise, the violence in the East sparked by symbolic offenses against Islam in the West come in a certain context: they occur in a time in which the United States is waging multiple illegal wars against several Muslim countries, occupying their lands, and killing hundreds of thousands of Muslims. If Bin Laden, who has killed three thousand Americans (and that too over ten years ago), could evoke such a visceral reaction from Americans at LSU, just imagine the reaction if Muslims had committed a yearly or monthly 9/11 since 2001? How do you think Americans would react to flag burning if Muslim terrorists had killed not 3,000 but 300,000 U.S. citizens? This is the level of death and destruction that our military afflicts in the lands of the Saracen barbarians.\n\nNo doubt the Islamophobes will react by arguing that one simply can’t compare the LSU mob with what happens in the Islamic world (actual violence and death, not just water balloons and chest thumping). But to this, I say: the angry mob would most likely have hurt Haas had the police not been there–and he did receive numerous death threats. But beyond that, our country is not being militarily occupied by an enemy, nor are hundreds of thousands of Americans being slaughtered. If Americans had blood lust in their eyes after 9/11 (the nation reacted by waging multiple illegal wars that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents), one can only imagine the hypertrophied reaction that angry mob would have had if we had been at the losing end of a war against us.\n\nLastly, I’d like to comment on what the belligerent U.S. soldier said to Benjamin Haas: “My brother died for you!” , a phrase he repeated multiple times. This of course is a common refrain used by U.S. “patriots”: whenever uber-liberals like myself are protesting America’s wars and the military complex, they will say, “you should thank us for defending your right to do so.” That’s a load of hog-wash, of pure propaganda. By invading and occupying Muslim lands, the military has done absolutely nothing to protect my own freedom and liberty. Had the U.S. not invaded or attacked Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, etc., does anyone here think I wouldn’t be free any more?\n\nIf anything, our wars abroad have served only to curtail our civil liberties (refer to Glenn Greenwald’s excellent column on Salon.com). Furthermore, these wars of ours take away from the Muslim populations their right to self-determination, of liberty and the right to be free from military occupation. How is my right to freedom being supported by taking away the freedom of Muslims abroad?\n\nThe sad truth is that America’s young men are dying not “for you”, or for me, or for Benjamin Haas–but for nothing. For worse than nothing. That’s one of the reasons our chicken-hawk leaders who order these wars (but don’t fight them) should be stopped from doing so and held accountable.\n\nAs the great Muhammad Ali put it: “I ain’t got no quarrel with the Vietcong.”",

December's figure brings the total number of new jobs in 2015 to 158,000.\n\nBeneath the surface, however, things look less rosy.\n\n\"The breakdown continued to reveal disturbing trends in higher-paying prime age employment [which is] a more accurate signal of economic conditions,\" economist David Madani at Capital Economics said in a note to clients after the numbers came out.\n\nFewer full-time jobs\n\nIn addition to being concentrated almost entirely in one province, all the new jobs in December were of the self-employed or part-time variety.

  "latent_14110": "layout title description date author index-image-url index-image-alt keywords categories post Deployment Pipelines in Snap CI In Snap CI, the deployment pipeline can be modeled as a series of custom build stages. Each stage consists of a set of commands which are run to accomplish a specific purpose. 2015-07-23 Vishal Naik screenshots/multi-stage-builds/manual_trigger.png Multi Stage Pipeline continuous delivery, continuous deployment, continuous integration, multi stage pipeline, multi stage builds article\n\nThe Continuous Delivery book talks about the concept of the Deployment Pipeline being central to CD. The deployment pipeline is essentially the path to deploy your code to production reliably.\n\nIn Snap CI, the deployment pipeline can be modeled as a series of custom build stages. Each stage consists of a set of commands that are run to accomplish a specific purpose.\n\nIn this article, we will look at the value of multi-stage builds and how you can leverage them in Snap CI.\n\nFor this, we will look at a sample setup of a Java web application on Snap CI:\n\n![multi stage build example]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/multi_stage_pipeline.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nThe Build stage compiles and executes unit tests. Smoke Tests stage starts up the web application in the build environment and runs WebDriver tests against it. Package stage bundles the application into an archive file. Pre-Prod stage is configured to automatically deploy the artifact to a staging environment which is used for manual QA. Prod stage is configured to deploy to Production using a manual trigger.\n\nThere are many advantages of dividing the build process up like this.\n\nStages provide high-resolution visibility into the pipeline\n\nIf your deployment pipeline is a single monolithic script, assessing severity of build failures can be time consuming and requires developers to analyze logs to know where and why something failed.\n\nStages provide a logical organization of the deployment pipeline.\n\nFor instance, in the example below, the Pre-Prod step has failed and is highlighted as such. Clicking on the failed stage takes me directly to the console logs of that stage without having to wade through logs from previous successful stages.\n\n![better visibility]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/better_visibility.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nModel too few stages and you do not get enough visibility: too many stages will dilute it. Instead, model stages around logical groups that give the most valuable feedback to your team.\n\nFor example, if you have categorized your functional tests into a fast feedback “Smoke Test Suite” and an exhaustive but slow “Regression Test Suite”, then having separate stages for each can be a good idea.\n\nWith Stages, you only need to build the artifact once.\n\nIn our example, we build an artifact in the Package stage and the same artifact is used in Pre-Prod and Prod stages. This is important not only for efficient pipelines but also because changes in environments--like a compiler version, dependencies etc.--can result in different artifacts getting deployed into Pre-Prod and Prod, thus reducing confidence in the pipeline.\n\nSnap CI allows you to export artifacts after every stage.\n\n![artifact propagation]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/artifacts.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nNotice the path mentioned in the “Artifacts” section above. The artifact will be available for all subsequent stages out of the same location.\n\n![artifact download]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/download_artifacts.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nAdditionally, the artifacts can also be downloaded either from UI console or using an API\n\n![artifact download]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/download_artifacts2.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nStages can be re-run independently\n\nWe can re-run a specific stage instead of re-triggering the entire build. This can be valuable when the root cause of the build failure was due to a flaky test or an external dependency like the deployment environment not being available. Re-runs can also be used on a previous build to rollback to an older version.\n\n![re-runs]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/rerun.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nStages can be configured to run on a manual trigger\n\nSometimes, you don't want every commit to be deployed to Production immediately. This is useful when you want to review changes, typically after deploying to a Pre-Prod/Staging environment but before deploying to Prod.\n\nIndeed, the ability to decide when to release to Production versus always deploying is the simple difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.\n\nIn this example, we have the PROD stage configured with a manual trigger.\n\n![manual trigger]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/manual_trigger.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nBetter visibility through stage history\n\nStage History allows you to see what features will get deployed when you execute the manual trigger on the Prod stage. This view can additionally help to identify when a particular feature was deployed so that you can answer questions like 'There is a spike in errors after 11 AM. Did we deploy any change that could have caused this?'\n\nThe Stage History view can help you determine just that and help you to immediately roll back deployments to a stable version using the 'rerun' Stage feature.\n\n![stage history]({% asset_path screenshots/multi-stage-builds/stage_history.png %}){: .screenshot .big}\n\nI hope you now that you've read this you have a better picture of how to leverage stages in your Snap CI pipelines.

  "latent_14392": "Dawn is sometimes considered the beginning of morning twilight (as depicted here), sometimes the period of twilight, and sometimes the time of sunrise.\n\nSkyline of Prague at dawn\n\nDawn, from an Old English verb dagian: \"to become day\", is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise. It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in the atmosphere, when the centre of the Sun's disc reaches 18° below the horizon.[1] This dawn twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), as the diffused light becomes direct sunlight.\n\n[2] Civil, nautical, and astronomical dawn, when defined as the beginning time of the corresponding twilight\n\nTypes of dawn [ edit ]\n\nDawn begins with the first sight of lightness in the morning, and continues until the sun breaks the horizon. This morning twilight before sunrise, is divided into three categories depending on the amount of sunlight that is present in the sky, which is determined by the angular distance of the centre of the Sun (degrees below the horizon) in the morning. The categories are named: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn.\n\nAstronomical dawn [ edit ]\n\nAstronomical twilight begins when the sky is no longer completely dark after astronomical dawn. This occurs when the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning.[3] At this point a very small portion of the sun's rays illuminate the sky and the fainter stars begin to disappear. Astronomical dawn is often indistinguishable from night, especially in areas with light pollution. Astronomical dawn marks the beginning of astronomical twilight, which lasts until nautical dawn.\n\nNautical dawn [ edit ]\n\nNautical twilight begins when there is enough illumination for sailors to distinguish the horizon at sea but the sky is too dark to perform outdoor activities (except with artificial light). Formally, nautical twilight begins when the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. The sky becomes light enough to clearly distinguish it from land and water. Nautical dawn marks the start of nautical twilight, which lasts until civil dawn.[3]\n\nCivil dawn [ edit ]\n\nCivil twilight begins when there is enough light for most objects to be distinguishable, so that some outdoor activities, but not all, can commence. Formally, civil dawn occurs when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning.[3]\n\nIf the sky is clear, it is blue colored, and if there is some cloud or haze, there can be bronze, orange and yellow colours. Some bright stars and planets such as Venus and Jupiter are visible to the naked eye at civil dawn. This moment marks the start of civil twilight, which lasts until sunrise.\n\nEffects of latitude [ edit ]\n\nThe duration of the twilight period (e.g. between astronomical dawn and sunrise) varies greatly depending on the observer's latitude: from a little over 70 minutes at the Equator, to many hours in the polar regions.\n\nEquator [ edit ]\n\nThe period of twilight is shortest at the Equator, where the equinox Sun rises due east and sets due west, at a right angle to the horizon. Each stage of twilight (civil, nautical, and astronomical) lasts only 24 minutes. From anywhere on Earth, the twilight period is shortest around the equinoxes and longest on the solstices.\n\nPolar regions [ edit ]\n\nDaytime becomes longer as the summer solstice approaches, while nighttime gets longer as the winter solstice approaches. This can have a potential impact on the times and durations of dawn and dusk. This effect is more pronounced closer to the poles, where the Sun rises at the vernal equinox and sets at the autumn equinox, with a long period of twilight, lasting for a few weeks.\n\nThe polar circle (at 66°34′ north or south) is defined as the lowest latitude at which the Sun does not set at the summer solstice. Therefore, the angular radius of the polar circle is equal to the angle between Earth's equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane. This period of time with no sunset lengthens closer to the pole.\n\nNear the summer solstice, latitudes higher than 54°34′ get no darker than nautical twilight; the \"darkness of the night\" varies greatly at these latitudes.\n\nAt latitudes higher than about 60°34, summer nights get no darker than civil twilight. This period of \"bright nights\" is longer at higher latitudes.\n\nExample [ edit ]\n\nAround the summer solstice, Glasgow, Scotland at 55°51′ N, and Copenhagen, Denmark at 55°40′ N, get a few hours of \"night feeling\". Oslo, Norway at 59°56′ N, and Stockholm, Sweden at 59°19′ N, seem very bright when the Sun is below the horizon. When the sun gets 9.0 to 9.5 degrees below the horizon (at summer solstice this is at latitudes 57°30′–57°00′), the zenith gets dark even on cloud-free nights (if there is no full moon), and even the brightest stars are clearly visible in a large majority of the sky.\n\nMythology and religion [ edit ]\n\nMany Indo-European mythologies have a dawn goddess, separate from the male Solar deity, her name deriving from PIE *h 2 ausos-, derivations of which include Greek Eos, Roman Aurora and Indian Ushas. Also related is Lithuanian Aušrinė, and possibly a Germanic *Austrōn- (whence the term Easter). In Sioux mythology, Anpao is an entity with two faces.\n\nThe Hindu dawn deity Ushas is female, whereas Surya, the Sun, and Aruṇa, the Sun's charioteer, are male. Ushas is one of the most prominent Rigvedic deities. The time of dawn is also referred to as the Brahmamuhurtham (Brahma is god of creation and muhurtham is a Hindu unit of time), and is considered an ideal time to perform spiritual activities, including meditation and yoga. In some parts of India, both Usha and Pratyusha (dusk) are worshiped along with the Sun during the festival of Chhath.\n\nPrime is the fixed time of prayer of the traditional Divine Office (Canonical Hours) in Christian liturgy, said at the first hour of daylight.\n\nIn Islam, astronomical dawn (Arabic fajr) is the time of the first prayer of the day, and the beginning of the daily fast during Ramadan.\n\nIn Judaism, the question of how to calculate dawn (Hebrew Alos/Alot HaShachar, or Alos/Alot) is posed by the Talmud,[6] as it has many ramifications for Jewish law (such as the possible start time for certain daytime commandments, like prayer). The simple reading of the Talmud is that dawn takes place 72 minutes before sunrise. Others, including the Vilna Gaon, have the understanding that the Talmud's timeframe for dawn was referring specifically to an equinox day in Mesopotamia, and is therefore teaching that dawn should be calculated daily as commencing when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon. The longstanding practice among most Sephardic Jews is to follow the first opinion, while many Ashkenazi Jews follow the latter view.\n\nDawn in art [ edit ]\n\nLiterature [ edit ]\n\nAn angel, robed in spotless white,\n\nBent down and kissed the sleeping Night.\n\nNight woke to blush; the sprite was gone.\n\nMen saw the blush and called it Dawn. -Dawn by Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_14577": "Trump has called on NFL owners to fire players who don’t stand for the anthem and urged fans to boycott games in a series of tweets after he first criticized the demonstrations during a Sept. 22 rally in Alabama. White House officials have viewed it as a winning issue for the president, who has sought to remain closely connected to his working-class base of Midwestern voters who helped elect him.\n\nAfter Pence’s walkout, Trump tweeted: “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.” The tweet raised the question of whether Pence’s actions had been planned in advance.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid said Pence’s departure looked like “a PR stunt.”\n\n“He knew our team has had the most players protest, he knew that we were probably going to do it again,” Reid said. “This is what systemic oppression looks like: man with power comes to the game, tweets a couple things out and leaves the game in an attempt to thwart our efforts.”\n\nNFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy declined to comment on Pence’s walkout. The Colts also had no comment, and after their 26-23 overtime victory, Indianapolis coach Chuck Pagano steered clear of the issue.\n\n“No,” Pagano said when asked if he had any reaction to what Pence did.\n\nOn Sunday night, Dallas owner Jerry Jones said the NFL can’t leave the impression that it tolerates players disrespecting the flag and that any of his Cowboys making such displays won’t play.\n\nResponding to a question about Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis, Jones said after the Cowboys’ 35-31 home loss to Green Bay that the league can’t “in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.” Of his own players, the Hall of Famer said, “If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won’t play. Period.”\n\nThe Cowboys knelt arm-in-arm before the national anthem when they played at Arizona two weeks ago. Players, coaches and others, including Jones and his family, were among those in the line. All of them stood during the anthem, with arms still locked.\n\nThe NFL players’ union said in a statement Sunday night that discussions about issues by the league’s players should not be stifled.\n\n“NFL players are union members and part of the labour movement that has woven the fabric of America for generations,” the NFLPA’s statement read. “Our men and their families are also conscientious Americans who continue to be forces for good through our communities and some have decided to use their platform to peacefully raise awareness to issues that deserve attention. It is a source of enormous pride that some of the best conversations about these issues have taken place in our locker rooms in a respectful, civil and thoughtful way that should serve as a model for how all of us can communicate with each other.\n\n“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects. That is what makes us the land of the free and home of the brave.”\n\nColts players stood in unison, locking arms but standing throughout the anthem.\n\nBut the 49ers have been among the most visible protesters in the league. Last year, former quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the movement to kneel or sit during the anthem, and Reid and other teammates backed him up on and off the field.\n\nRetired announcer Brent Musburger joined the fray on Twitter on Sunday night.\n\n“Yo #49ers Since you instigated protest, 2 wins and 19 losses. How about taking your next knee in the other team’s end zone?” Musburger posted.\n\nPence flew in Saturday after a statue of Manning was unveiled, an event attended by a number of luminaries including NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Oklahoma City needs to look for opportunities to get shooters open, and if they can, knock shots down.\n\nArticle written by Zack Low.

  "latent_14628": "Introduction\n\nChoose one word to describe the Samsung Galaxy S6. Gorgeous. Powerful. Special. Different. Thank you. That will do. Galaxy S5 has only one of these under its belt and hint... it starts with a P.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 is not the next big thing. It's \"project zero\". The reboot. But was there really anything wrong with the S-line - the standard-setter, the home of the super droids? OK, design needed looking at for sure. But hey, other brands do facelifts - Samsung goes for a complete overhaul.\n\nThis must've been the message they wanted to send.\n\nAnd if it means giving up the memory card slot, the removable battery and the waterproofing, so be it. That's part of the message too.\n\nAnyway, the Galaxy S6 was redone from scratch and bids farewell to plastic. Glass and metal is a critically acclaimed combination. Another way of saying it is - depending on how upset you are with the missing card slot and sealed battery - they're copying Apple and Sony. Alright, memory, battery and waterproofing are easy things to get upset about, so let's see what the Samsung Galaxy S6 offers in exchange.\n\nThe new look is impressive and exciting and Samsung's trademark AMOLED is the perfect match. It's an immersive 5.1 incher of QHD resolution, for the amazing 577ppi - though \"amazing\" doesn't work for Samsung. They'll call it \"the best ever\" - and will be right. And that's just the beginning.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 official pictures: black sapphire, blue topaz, gold platinum, white pearl\n\nFor the first time in a couple of generations, Samsung is relying solely on its own Exynos platform. This seemed like of nick-of-time decision amid rumors of cooling issues and thermal throttling plaguing the Snapdragon 810 chipset but the fact is the Exynos 7420 (7 Octa) is simply better. The only reason Qualcomm were in the story at all was the uncertainty whether Samsung would be ready for mass production with its own chipset.\n\nBuilt on a 14nm process, Samsung's chipset allows similar or higher clockspeeds (hence performance) with less power consumption, which by the way means it's easier to cool as well. In the end, the Galaxy S6 is powered by a beastly octa-core processor with four Cortex-A57 cores ticking at 2.1GHz and four Cortex-A53 \"efficiency\" cores at 1.5GHz. An octa-core Mali-T760 GPU and 3GB of RAM complete the tally.\n\nSamsung worked on the camera department too, equipping the Galaxy S6 with a 16MP rear camera with optical image stabilization and a wide f/1.9 aperture. The 5MP selfie cam also got a f/1.9 aperture for superior low-light capabilities.\n\nThe connectivity package is better than ever with dual-standard wireless charging support out of the box, Samsung Pay, a better and faster fingerprint scanner and LTE Cat.6 connectivity. Let's get into the details, shall we?\n\nKey features\n\nThin (6.8mm) profile, premium dual-glass design reinforced by a metal frame\n\n5.1\" Super AMOLED of QHD (1440 x 2560) resolution, class-leading ~577ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 4\n\nExynos 7420 64-bit chipset, octa core processor with four 2.1GHz Cortex-A57's and four 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 cores, Mali-T760 MP8 GPU, 3GB of RAM\n\nAndroid 5.0.2 Lollipop with TouchWiz and Samsung Pay\n\n16MP camera, f/1.9 aperture, 4K video recording, LED flash, optical image stabilization\n\n5MP front-facing camera, f/1.9 aperture, QHD video, HDR\n\n32/64/128 GB of built-in storage\n\nActive noise cancellation via dedicated mic\n\nFingerprint scanner\n\nLTE Cat.6, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, GPS/GLONASS/Beidou, NFC, IR port, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+\n\nHeart-rate sensor, barometer, SpO2\n\nWireless charging (Qi/PMA)\n\n2,550mAh battery\n\nMain disadvantages\n\nNo water or dust protection\n\nRather pricey at launch, including really steep memory upgrade premiums\n\nNo user-replaceable battery\n\nNo microSD slot\n\nNo FM radio\n\nNo stereo speakers\n\nLast season, the water and dust protection was a direct response to Sony's Xperia Z line. The Galaxy S6 gives it up, defying a natural Samsung instinct to match and beat every feature a potential rival may have. A Galaxy S6 Active will likely quell some of the disappointment.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 live pictures\n\nBut will there be an S6 version with a removable battery and one with a microSD card slot? Of course, Samsung will tell you the Galaxy S6 has the new UFS 2.0 storage, with the \"Command Queue\" tech used in SSDs. The end-result is 2.7x faster response than that memory found in the previous crop of flagships. A microSD card, regardless of specs, would have compromised the user experience. Plus, the base model starts at 32GB, the other options being 64GB and 128GB.\n\nSo, Samsung gave up features that used to give them a competitive edge and decided not to necessarily compete for every spec. Over-confidence or lack thereof? New deal or a knee jerk reaction? There are so many things to discover about the new Galaxy S6 and we are done teasing.\n\nUpdate, March 16: You've probably already checked out our Samsung Galaxy S6 review over the weekend. By popular request, we've updated a number of section in the review today. Most notably, we've added more daylight camera samples and numerous low-light samples; we've tested how the new UFS 2.0 storage performs; we've revised our Galaxy S6 screen brightness measurement and our loudspeaker loudness measurement. There is more where all that came from, stay tuned for a detailed camera comparison against the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 later this week.\n\nUpdate, April 3: We received a retail unit and retested it. We've updated the battery life and the performance benchmarks (both improved). Our tests showed that the camera, loudspeaker and audio quality are essentially the same as on the pre-release unit we had initially.\n\nUpdate, April 28: Don't miss the companion video for this review. In case you don't feel like reading this 11-page review, it should get you through the most important points about the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge in under 6 minutes.",
  "latent_14725": "HOUSTON - There's a new twist in the investigation into a CenterPoint worker who was seen on video hitting a homeowner's dog with a wrench.\n\nThe homeowner has now released new video that he says proves he, his wife and their dogs were all caught by surprise when the contractor showed up at their home.\n\nThe contractor's boss says his employee was defending himself, that the dogs were unleashed on him following an earlier confrontation.\n\nMike Willcox says he's angry after hearing the claims that he turned his two dogs on the contractor as he was going to shut off the family's gas for non-payment.\n\nIn the new video, you see a pickup roll up, the contractor get out and immediately walk toward the fence through the empty yard holding a yellow disconnect notice.\n\nHe walks past a 'Beware of Dog' sign and through the fence that Willcox says he left open for landscapers. The video's timecode shows the contractor first swinging his wrench less than 20 seconds later.\n\nWillcox says the worker handed his wife the disconnect notice and wouldn't give his name. He also says the only time he became combative was when he watched the contractor swing his wrench at his dog again.\n\nCenterPoint officials told us this afternoon their employees and contractors all receive animal training are taught to retreat instead of engage the animals.\n\nWillcox says someone from the company reached out to him yesterday but says he's still facing at least $2,000 in vet bills and still waiting to hear from Star Corp.\n\nCenterPoint tells KHOU 11 News it train employees and contractors disconnecting for nonpayment to get in and out as quickly as possible because they're regularly threatened, sometimes even with guns. They've put out a notice to their employees to be extra cautious given all of the emotion this story has generated.",

A sorceress supposed to be dead in a fantastic battle at Sodden Hill, where rises a monolit with the names of the heroes fallen in battle. She comes back from the shadows to fight the creatures of darkness, full of enchant and magic.I wanted this drawing to be a christmas present for my girlfriend, so I chose her face as inspiration in secret (it was too dificult to keep this secret during a long month!!).

  "latent_14935": "Suppose you’re writing a script to spin up servers for your web application.\n\ndef deploy ( ip ): copy ( 'code/' , ip + ':~/code' , recursive = True ) write_template ( 'conf/config.py' , ip + ':~/config.py' ) write_template ( 'conf/crontab' , ip + ':~/.crontab' ) write_template ( 'conf/crontab' , ip + ':/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' ) run_as_root ( 'service cron restart' ) run_as_root ( 'service apache restart' ) post ( 'https://pingdom.com/api/2.0/checks' , { 'name' : ip , 'host' : ip , 'type' : 'ping' })\n\nEverything is going well until you decide to split up your machines into ones that run tasks and ones that answer requests. Since you’re not sure which deploy logic you want to be shared and which you want to keep separate, you decide to start out by copy-pasting the logic:\n\ndef deploy_taskrunner ( ip ): # Warning: don't forget to edit deploy_webserver as well copy ( 'code/' , ip + ':~/code' , recursive = True ) write_template ( 'conf/task_config.py' , ip ) write_template ( 'conf/crontab' , ip + ':~/.crontab' ) run_as_root ( 'service cron restart' ) post ( 'https://pingdom.com/api/2.0/checks' , { 'name' : ip , 'host' : ip , 'type' : 'ping' }) def deploy_webserver ( ip ): # Warning: don't forget to edit deploy_taskrunner as well copy ( 'code/' , ip + ':~/code' , recursive = True ) write_template ( 'conf/web_config.py' , ip ) write_template ( 'conf/httpd.conf' , ip + ':/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' ) run_as_root ( 'service apache restart' ) post ( 'https://pingdom.com/api/2.0/checks' , { 'name' : ip , 'host' : ip , 'type' : 'ping' })\n\nYour application hums along for a while, and everything is fine. When you need to manually deploy something, you can read the list of steps from the relevant function. When you need to tweak some config files to improve performance, you just add the code to both locations (and put up with some nagging from your coworkers).\n\nSuddenly, disaster strikes! You release an API! This means you need to have a third type of machine in your cluster.\n\nSince your coworkers have been nagging you about the copy-pasted code in the deploy scripts, you decide to factor out the common logic into functions.\n\ndef predeploy_common ( ip ): copy_code_to ( ip ) tweak_config_files ( ip ) def postdeploy_common ( ip ): run_tests_on ( ip ) setup_pingdom ( ip ) def deploy_taskrunner ( ip ): predeploy_common ( ip ) write_template ( 'conf/task_config.py' , ip ) write_template ( 'conf/crontab' , ip + ':~/.crontab' ) run_as_root ( 'service cron restart' ) postdeploy_common ( ip ) def deploy_webserver ( ip ): predeploy_common ( ip ) write_template ( 'conf/web_config.py' , ip ) write_template ( 'conf/httpd_web.conf' , ip + ':/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' ) run_as_root ( 'service apache restart' ) postdeploy_common ( ip ) def deploy_apiserver ( ip ): predeploy_common ( ip ) write_template ( 'conf/api_config.py' , ip ) write_template ( 'conf/httpd_api.conf' , ip + ':/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' ) run_as_root ( 'service apache restart' ) postdeploy_common ( ip )\n\nEverything is glorious again. Your machines are fruitful and multiply. Adding more new machine types is a cinch. Your application hums along for a while.\n\nSuddenly, disaster strikes! While adding support for BSD machines in addition to Linux, you realize that you have to change a function three levels deep inside tweak_config_files .\n\nYou snottily point out to your coworkers that if they had let you keep the copy-paste code, you could have just added an if...then block and been done with it. Your coworkers tell you to stop being ridiculous.\n\nYou briefly consider threading a bsd=True parameter through three levels of function calls before deciding that you’ve taken enough beatings in code review. Instead, you realize that you just need to think of your machines as objects with behaviors instead of passive IP address strings that just have stuff done to them. So you refactor your code to be object-oriented:\n\nclass Machine ( object ): # abstract class __metaclass__ = abc . ABCMeta def __init__ ( self , ip ): self . ip = ip def copy_files ( self , files ): ... @abc.abstractmethod def tweak_ram_config ( self ): pass @abc.abstractmethod def tweak_fs_config ( self ): pass @abc.abstractmethod def tweak_network_config ( self ): pass def tweak_config_files ( self ): self . tweak_ram_config () self . tweak_fs_config () self . tweak_network_config () ... class LinuxMachine ( Machine ): ... class BSDMachine ( Machine ): ... class DeploymentPlan ( object ): __metaclass__ = abc . ABCMeta @abc.abstractmethod def deploy ( machine ): pass ... class APIDeploymentPlan ( DeploymentPlan ): ... class WebDeploymentPlan ( DeploymentPlan ): ... class TaskDeploymentPlan ( DeploymentPlan ): ... ...\n\nEverything is glorious again. Your machines are fruitful and multiply. When you add more different hardware types, you can just add more subclasses. Your application hums along for a while.\n\nSuddenly, disaster strikes! A botched deploy causes your machines to run amok, losing your app hundreds of millions of dollars before anyone figures out how to turn it off off. Just kidding–it’s not that hard to turn off a computer. But it was a near thing.\n\nShaken, you drag yourself to the incident post-mortem. “What happened here?” your boss asks.\n\nWell, you say, the deploy script started by constructing a Machine subclass for each machine in the cluster, and a DeploymentPlan instance to manage deploying to it… After a couple hours of jumping between files and trying to do vtable lookups in your head, you eventually trace the bug to a bad assumption in a DeploymentPlan subclass method–the author was confused about which subtype of Machine they were operating on.\n\nYour boss groans. “Didn’t this stuff used to be, like, a function in a one-file script?”\n\nThis is a circle I often find myself going around. I start out with the equivalent of copy-paste code (or a single script with if-then statements). It’s not abstract or DRY, but you can read it from beginning to end and you can change whatever part of it you want.\n\nAs the code gets more complex, I’ll decide that to keep it manageable I need to split it up into a hierarchy of functions. It always feels refreshing to abstract away a hairball of code–until I try to modify part of the internals, and realize I have to thread an argument through too many layers of functions.\n\nAt that point, I might decide to take the state that gets threaded through functions, and encapsulate it in an object. But now each method has access to a huge amount of hidden state (in the form of instance variables), and each method call could mean one of many different things depending on the runtime class of the object it’s being called on. That makes it much harder to look at code and know what path will be executed, so the code becomes much harder to keep in my head.\n\nCopy-paste code is readably and hackable but poorly-abstracted. Large trees of functions are readable and abstract, but hard to hack. Stateful objects and virtual dispatch are both hackable and abstract, but difficult to understand. I haven’t found any pattern that accomplishes all three at once.\n\nIn fact, I wonder if it’s even possible to get all three of readability, hackability and abstraction. When I cycle through these three patterns, it feels like I’m playing code complexity whack-a-mole. As soon as I simplify one part of the program, another one gets hairier.\n\nThis might just mean the problem I’m trying to solve is inherently complex. If I’m trying to run five different deploy recipes across four different hardware/OS configurations, that’s 20 different potential interactions to take care of. At that point, unless I explicitly take stock and notice that my problem has a certain amount of inherent complexity, I’m likely to oscillate several times between different ways of expressing the same thing.\n\nAt the same time, I still hold out hope. Someday, I tell myself, I’ll write a nontrivial program that’s readable, hackable and abstract. Hopefully before I blow anyone up with a botched deploy.",
  "latent_15003": "Manchester United face off against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday afternoon; the game kicks off at 4pm and is sure to be a good one – Swansea have never rolled over for United and will be hoping to be the first side to score past Argentinian goalkeeper Sergio Romero in the Premier League this season.\n\nBafetimbi Gomis will lead the line for the Swans with Wayne Rooney having the same task as captain of the Red Devils. So how will the game pan out? Some of our writers have given their thoughts here…\n\nJames Browning\n\nI’m yet to get a scoreline correct this season but I’ve predicted the end result correctly 2/3 times in the Premier League, so hopefully I’ll be right about this one too. Trips to the Liberty Stadium always make me nervous as Swansea always come out fighting but we should supreme class and control against Club Brugge in midweek and whilst Swansea are perhaps better than the Belgian side, I’m expecting us to take that performance to Wales with us and pick up the three points.\n\nRooney is on his way back to his very best and I’ve never doubted him – I expect him to score. Our attack will be more fluent than it has been so far in the league as Januzaj’s injury will most probably see Herrera start the game in attacking midfield. His combination play with Juan Mata is always lovely to watch and I think it’ll be too much for the Swansea defence.\n\nScore Prediction: Swansea 0-2 Manchester United (Rooney, Herrera)\n\nChris Cherry\n\nWith Swansea beating Manchester United both home and away for the first time in the league ever, United will be wanting to dish out some payback, especially seeing as it will be Louis van Gaal’s 50th match in charge. So far United have faced a below-par Tottenham, Villa, Newcastle and Brugge so I think this will be their toughest game of the season so far.\n\nSwansea may be lacking in defence a bit these days but their front line looks slick and fresh, with Gomis and new signing Ayew scoring all five goals so far between them. Add in the creativity of Sigurdsson, the pace of Montero and the strength of Shelvey, Swansea can cause some real damage.\n\nHowever, United have been solid in defence in all five games they’ve played so far, conceding only one unlucky own goal. Wayne Rooney will also have regained some confidence after his mid week hat trick and Memphis will be eager to cause more damage with his runs down the left-hand side.\n\nThis game could also see the return of Marouane Fellani who has finished serving his suspension for his last day red card and will be ready to get back out there and fight for a first team place.\n\nScore Prediction: Swansea 2 (Gomis, Ayew) – 3 Manchester United (Rooney, Memphis, Fellaini)\n\nMatt Brown\n\nI think Swansea will prove to be United’s most difficult opponent so far this season on Sunday afternoon. Players like J Ayew, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis have the ability to break down our defence, whilst I’m sure Garry Monk will have his team set up well defensively, too.\n\nTherefore, this will be a big test for United. As good as our defence has been, the way Swansea play will pose a different challenge. Not only that, but Louis van Gaal was beaten twice by Garry Monk last season, and I think the Swans’ boss will have another tactical plan up his sleeve.\n\nHaving said that, United played well against Club Brugge on Wednesday, and the performance showed that they are well set up to play away from home. If United get a couple of chances on the counter-attack, which Swansea’s style of play may allow, then I believe we could edge a win.\n\nI’m not sure United will be as clinical in the Premier League as they were against lower quality opposition in Bruges on Wednesday though, so I think this will end as a draw.\n\nScore Prediction: Swansea 1 (Sigurdsson) – 1 Manchester United (Memphis)",

  "latent_15247": "Last year, Time magazine published a cover story featuring the black transgender actor Laverne Cox. America, the magazine declared, had reached a “transgender tipping point.” But for most of our country’s transgender teens, life remains dangerous, anonymous, and too often, short. The truth is, there’s a suicide problem among transgender youths, and it’s happening mostly in silence.\n\nYou’ve probably heard about Leelah Alcorn, the 17-year-old transgender girl from Ohio who committed suicide after being rejected by her religious family. But you may not know about Blake Brockington, the 18-year-old black transgender activist and prom king from North Carolina who killed himself earlier this year. In the last six months, at least seven transgender teens have killed themselves. Most have been youths of color. Those are just the young people we know about: The kids who were out, the ones who left notes. It’s impossible to know how many transgender people take their lives each year. One study found that nearly 25 percent of transgender youths surveyed reported attempting suicide. In 2011, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 41 percent of respondents had attempted suicide.\n\nGiven the crisis, I wanted to find out what services exist for transgender youths dealing with mental health issues and considering suicide. Here’s what I found.\n\n---\n\nWhen “Johnny,” a young transgender man considering suicide, contacted the Web-based Lifeline Crisis Chat, one of his first questions for the volunteer counselor was “What is your understanding of transgender?”\n\nThe volunteer responded, “A male believing they are female, and wanting to get corrective surgery.”\n\nJohnny quickly disconnected. He wasn’t really a teen. He was Morty Diamond, a graduate student in San Francisco State University’s social work program. For his thesis, Diamond is writing about digital technologies for transgender mental health. The chat quoted above was part of his research.\n\nDiamond is concerned that even in times of personal crisis, transgender people are forced to lead “teachable moments”—educating people who are charged with helping them. For those in crisis, this can be yet another signal that they are abnormal or beyond help.\n\nThe chat line quoted above is a project of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of 160 call centers under the management of Link2Health Solutions. Its website states: “National public health leaders look to L2HS to apply state-of-the-art best practices in crisis intervention to promote broad-scale community mental health and safety.” One wonders what kind of training these NSPL call center volunteers undergo to handle diverse populations, particularly transgender people. By email, an NSPL spokesperson referred me to the Trevor Project, which describes itself as the nation’s leading crisis and suicide prevention group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youths.\n\nPerhaps this explains why Diamond didn’t have a single positive interaction with a counselor who seemed educated on transgender issues. On one recorded call that he played for me, he told the NSPL counselor that he was contemplating suicide. The counselor threated to end the call and repeatedly urged Diamond to call the Trevor Project.\n\nThe Trevor Project’s website provides links to nuanced educational resources for teens dealing with various sexuality and gender issues. But it’s hard to discern the depth of the Trevor Project’s initiatives that deal specifically with transgender issues. The group never made executives available for an interview.\n\nThe only suicide crisis line that would talk to me in-depth was The Samaritans of New York, which describes itself as “the only community-based organization devoted to suicide prevention” in metropolitan New York City. Last year the group answered 80,000 calls. Its website lists various identity-based crisis initiatives—for Latinas, tourists, and the elderly, for example. Nothing, however, is listed for LGBT people. If all you knew about suicide came from this website, you would have no idea that there was a suicide crisis among LGBT youths generally and transgender youths specifically.\n\nThe Samaritans’ executive director, Alan Ross, talked about the difficulties of funding suicide prevention programs. He talked about the need to educate volunteers on how to handle crisis among people generally—not among specific populations. He consistently talked about lesbians and gays when I asked about transgender callers. When I repeated that my interest was specifically in transgender people, he told me: “The community has done a wonderful job of staying focused, so I don’t know if you need more services. I don’t know if there needs to be a better job.”\n\nHelping to fill the void is Trans Life Line. It was launched by Greta Martela late last year after her own negative interactions with a crisis counselor on an NSPL hotline and hospital emergency room staff. “Trying to give someone a Transgender 101 while you’re suicidal is not something most people can handle,” she told me.\n\nThe hotline averages about 60 calls a day—more than its volunteer staff can handle. Some of those calls are referrals from the Trevor Project, the NSPL, and other hotlines. It’s raised about $43,000 to cover expenses. Martela has left her job as a software engineer to work on TLL full-time. Recently, she attended an American Association of Suicidology conference and was sad to find transgender issues were rarely discussed.\n\nWe know transgender people are significantly more likely to attempt suicide, so why don’t the people tasked with preventing suicide seem more concerned?

But for some people, it's exactly the subject to help kick-start a move to reduce the stubborn income gap between men and women.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Norway tried something that was a first in Europe: Four weeks of mandatory paternity leave for its workers. In addition to changing the country’s cultural attitudes toward child-rearing (fathers taking several months off to care for their children is now commonplace) the now-10 weeks of “daddy leave” has had an economic side effect as well. The country’s gender wage gap has shrunk by more than half.\n\nIn 1991, working women in Norway made about 20 percent less than men, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). By 2010, it was down to 8.3 percent.\n\nHolding up any policy from Norway as a panacea for social issues in the US is problematic. Norway is smaller, more socially progressive (with a heavily subsidized national day-care system), and has a more centralized government. But as the US observes Equal Pay Day on April 12, advocates for gender equality in both the public and private realms are giving credence to the idea that supporting women at home is inextricably linked to supporting them in the workplace.\n\nSpecifically, they’re making the case that more investment in child care could help shrink the pay gap – with the added bonus of growing the economy. According to an analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute released earlier this month, access to affordable child care would help increase the participation of women in the labor force, thereby growing the economy by an estimated $210 billion each year.\n\n“The gender wage gap is definitely driven in part by the wage penalty faced by women because they are more likely to have an extended period out of the workforce while caring for sick relatives,” Josh Bivens, research and policy director of EPI, writes via e-mail. “By giving parents greater access to high-quality, affordable child care and early childhood education, you make it easier for those who want to work to participate in the labor force…. This increases the size of the labor force, which in turn boosts GDP.”\n\nSome businesses and business groups agree.\n\n“Subsidized child care can encourage low-skilled parents to maintain their connection to the labor force or to upgrade their skills through education, thereby contributing to economic growth and productivity over the longer term,” reads a 2015 analysis of state child-care costs from the Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit business-led public policy organization in Arlington, Va. It recommends expanding certain child-care credits for both workers and employers.\n\nEqual Pay Day in the United States is observed every year on the day that women catch up financially to the annual pay of their male counterparts. This year’s observance falls on April 12, meaning it took American women one year and 103 days to earn what American men earned during 2015.\n\nThe day got plenty of political attention, too. President Obama dedicated a monument to women’s equality Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton took part in a panel on pay transparency that included Megan Rapinoe, one of the US women’s soccer stars who filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the US Soccer Federation over unfair pay practices last month.\n\nPer Census Bureau data, women in the American workforce make 79 cents for every dollar a white man makes, and it’s worse for women of color (60 cents for black women; 55 cents for Latino women). That shortfall costs American women a combined $500 billion annually, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\nIf that gap were eliminated, on average, “a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately: 83 more weeks of food for her family; seven more months of mortgage and utilities payments; 11 more months of rent; or nine more years of birth control,” the report reads.\n\nThe wage disparity between men and women has barely changed over the past two decades, says National Partnership vice president Vicki Shabo. In 2006, women made 77 cents for every dollar earned by white males, she says.\n\nOn family leave, at least, there has been small but promising movement on several fronts. A January poll found that 80 percent of likely voters, including 94 percent of Democrats, 80 percent of Independents, and 65 percent of Republicans characterized things like equal pay, paid time off, and affordable child care as “good for our nation.\" The issue has become a talking point for presidential candidates and politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThree states, Rhode Island, California, and New York, as well as cities like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, have introduced their own paid-leave rules. Major tech companies, from Twitter to Netflix to Etsy, in recent months have been all but falling over themselves to introduce increasingly competitive and inclusive paid-leave allowances for employees.\n\nThere are still obstacles, Ms. Shabo says. Just 13 percent of US workers have access to any paid leave at all, and “if you look at the states with the populations most in need, against those that have taken action, there’s a pretty substantial mismatch,” she says. “The states that need it are not inclined to make their own laws and that’s why federal action is needed.”\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nThings are more challenging on the child-care front. In 33 states, outside infant care costs more than in-state college tuition. Paying for care for two children costs more than rent in most of the country, and it’s a cost that even the highly competitive tech industry has yet to address. But Shabo says that while investments in those areas are important in addressing equality, there’s a long-term benefit for businesses as well.\n\n“It contributes to workplace retention and helps women stay employed,” she says. “Turnover is costly. Replacing a worker can be 200 percent of a salary.”",

What do you think is the key to your longevity?\n\nWe are proud to provide a unique dining experience when compared to other restaurants. It starts with our all-inclusive meals that come included with bread, soup/salad, coffee/tea and ice cream. We have always been proud of the prices that we provide for our guests, especially now in a tougher economy. There aren’t many places in Vancouver where you can feed an entire family, with freshly produced food, at such a reasonable price.\n\nThe most imperative reason behind our longevity is the significance we place in our guest’s feedback. The restaurant industry is extremely fickle and ensuring our customers happiness is paramount. We know that every single person who walks into our restaurant has hundreds of other dining options and it is our job to wow them. The adage we use in our restaurants is “The answer is yes, now what is your question.”\n\nCan you tell us about the origins of The Old Spaghetti Factory, where did the concept originate?\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory concept was actually a knock off of a restaurant in San Francisco. The Dussin family began the expansion of the Old Spaghetti Factory in the US, opening the first restaurant in Portland, Oregon in 1969. The Pulos family was responsible for Canadian expansion and opened the first restaurant in Gastown in 1970.\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory is renowned for its antique furnishings & artifacts, which come from all over the world. What are some of the unique pieces found inside the Gastown location?\n\nThe most unique antique is definitely the trolley car that sits in the front of the restaurant. It was built by the BC Electric Railway Company in 1904. The trolley travelled between Main and Cambie until 1950 before being moved to the P.N.E grounds where it stayed for 20 years. Mr. Ernie Les Plant saved the car from destruction and later loaned it to The Old Spaghetti Factory where it has remained for the last 44 years.\n\nThere is also a piece of stained glass, which was originally from the Queens Carriage.\n\nThe famous trolley car being moved into Gastown’s Old Spaghetti Factory | Images courtesy of The City of Vancouver Archives\n\nTell us about the “lingering spirits” or ghosts that have been spotted inside Gastown’s Old Spaghetti Factory?\n\nThere are a ton of stories that have kicked out over the years from staff, managers and patrons. There are two characters that have been specifically referenced numerous times. One is a trolley conductor who hangs out in and around the train. The other is a young boy who is clad in clothing from the turn of the century. Apparently Water Front station used to be the main train hub in Vancouver and there was an accident that claimed some lives in the early 1900’s and that is thought to be the root of the lingering spirits.\n\nThe most recent incident was with a staff member who was closing down the back area of the restaurant at the end of the night. She saw a little boy run through the section and hide under a table. Thinking nothing of it, she went to speak with the boy and noticed that he was wearing very old clothing. She became unsettled and left to get a manager. The manager informed her that there was no families left in the restaurant and went back to look for the boy. He was no longer there.\n\nAntique stained glass found at Gastown’s Old Spaghetti Factory\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory is a very memorable place to take your family for a night out and for many locals it has become a family tradition. Can you share a favorite memory or two from regulars?\n\nThe greatest stories are always from the people who grew up going to the Old Spaghetti Factory with their parents and are now returning with their own kids. You can see how excited the parents are when their child starts playing on the trolley just like they used to.\n\nThere is also an amazing amount of spag families (people who met while working and started a family together). We even have a couple of employees whose parents met while working at the Old Spaghetti Factory.\n\nDo you have a favourite menu item?\n\nManagers Favorite with Spicy Meat Sauce and Mizithra Cheese. It is one of the oldest and most basic dishes on our menu but the Mizithra cheese is such a distinctive flavor. There was a period of time where you could not find Mizithra cheese anywhere in Vancouver except at The Old Spaghetti Factory. It has become more readily available and we like to pretend that we have had an influence.\n\nWhat has changed over the years?\n\nThe menu has changed drastically. We started as a scoop and serve concept over 40 years ago. The competition has raised the bar with respects to options and taste profiles and we have done the same.

  "latent_15642": "As global warming progresses, sea levels are steadily rising. And sometimes, a new study finds, they surge.\n\nIn just a two-year period between 2009 and 2010, say scientists at the University of Arizona and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sea levels north of New York City temporarily spiked by 128 mm -- some 5 inches, or 40 percent of the total sea level rise in New York City since 1900. The phenomenon lead to a wave of high tides and floods that occurred in the absence of a major storm; the study, finally providing an explanation, points to a significantly slowed-down Gulf Stream combined with an atmospheric pressure pattern in the North Atlantic, with global warming playing a contributing role.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Communications, call the surge \"extreme\" and \"unprecedented\" -- a \"one-in-850 year event,\" based on past records.\n\nBut the same may not be true in the future, as Mashable's Andrew Freedman explains:\n\nThe new research...provides more evidence that, set against the backdrop of thelong-term increase in global sea levels from melting polar ice caps and warming oceans, there exist sharp and even damaging shorter-term variability in sea levels at the local and regional level, driven by mercurial ocean currents and weather cycles. As global warming-related sea level rise continues, these smaller-scale sea level fluctuations are likely to be more frequent and damaging, climate scientists told Mashable. \"When superimposed on long-term and gradual sea level rise, 2009-10 type extreme sea level events will pose an even higher coastal flooding risk,\" said Jianjun Yin, a coauthor of the study and climate researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson, in an email interview withMashable. \"Extreme sea level rise events on inter-annual time scales can cause coastal flooding even without apparent weather processes,\" Yin said.\n\nIn other words, places like New York, which is already girding itself against a faster-than-average rate of sea level rise -- and a projected 6 feet increase possible by the end of the century -- now have more to worry about.",
  "latent_15692": "A map of the Asian/Pacific Islander population of L.A. County, by census tract. | Photo: Asian Americans Advancing Justice - LA\n\nEarlier this week, the nonprofit organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles released its demographic research report, \"A Community Of Contrasts: Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in Los Angeles County.\" The document quantifies the growth and issues facing L.A. County's 1,497,960 Asian Americans (15 percent of the county's population) and 54,169 Pacific Islanders -- including the non-immigrant Native Hawaiian sub-demographic -- (the largest number in the continental U.S.) between 2000 and 2010.\n\nAccording to the report, in the last decade, the Asian American population of L.A. County grew 20 percent, and the Pacific Islander population grew nine percent, even though the total county population grew only three percent. In contrast, the growth rate for the Latino population was 11 percent, and both the white and African American populations shrank, with decreases of eight and five percent, respectively.\n\nThe report also confirms Los Angeles County as the capital of Asian America, with the largest number of Asian immigrants of any county in the nation, and the home of the largest Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian, Korean, Sri Lankan, Taiwanese, and Thai populations outside their respective home countries. Chinese and Filipinos comprise the two largest Asian American groups both nationwide and in the county.\n\nBangladeshi Americans are the Asian ethnic group with the highest rate of growth, with a 122 percent increase in population in the past decade. Other South Asian ethnic groups, such as Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and Indian Americans experienced high growth rates in L.A. County as well. Japanese Americans had the least highest growth rate (one percent), but also the highest domestic-born population (70 percent) and the highest percentage of senior citizens (19 percent). The fastest-growing Pacific Islander ethnic group are Fijian Americans, with a growth rate of 68 percent.\n\nThe L.A. County city with the largest number of Asian Americans is Los Angeles, with a little under half a million. Monterey Park boasts the largest percentage of Asians per capita at 68 percent, while the city of Arcadia experienced the highest percentage of Asian American population growth at 38 percent. Of the 88 cities in L.A. County, 13 have majority Asian populations.\n\nFor Pacific Islanders, Los Angeles has the largest number at 15,000, Carson boasts the largest per capita, and the city with the highest growth rate of Pacific Islanders is Glendale, with a 74 percent increase.\n\nThe report from AAAJ-LA (formerly known as the Asian Pacific American Legal Center) is largely based on on 2010 U.S. Census data, as well as findings gathered from USC's Center for the Study of Immigration Integration, the California Department of Education, the California Department of Public Health, and the California Health Interview Survey.\n\nSurely such an aggregation of demographic data can reveal trends and indications in community-wide issues such as immigration, economics, employment, housing, education, health, and civic engagement.\n\nThe large growth rate of the Asian/Pacific Islander population as revealed in AAAJ-LA's report reflects the change in the image of the American immigrant through the years: From the huddled masses of Europeans arriving via Ellis Island by boat to Spanish-speaking inmigrantes coming from Latin America, it will inevitably shift to Asians and Pacific Islanders flying by airplane across the great ocean, arriving at emotional gateways such as LAX. Only this time, with American entertainment and popular culture easily downloadable, cultural integration and assimilation might be somewhat faster -- although the cultural influence can originate from the other side of the Pacific as well.\n\nMuch more importantly, the image of Asian Americans in the American mainstream as a \"Model Minority,\" consistently blessed with a comfortable income and higher education couldn't be more shattered through the findings of the AAAJ-LA report. Though groups such as Indian, Japanese, and Taiwanese Americans made an annual per-capita income of over $30,000 -- well above the total L.A. County average of $27,344 -- Cambodian Americans fared the lowest of all the Asian groups at $14,276. They also registered with 53 percent of their population as low-income and a a quarter living in poverty. The Bangladeshi population in L.A. County has 57 percent of them considered low-income (The Latino population, by comparison, is 51 percent low-income and 21 percent living in poverty). And although many Asian ethnic groups have at least 90 percent of their population possessing a high school degree or higher education level, Cambodian Americans fared at just 58 percent; Vietnamese Americans had 67 percent. And although Korean Americans fared slightly above the average annual per-capita income level, they rank among the lowest in home ownership and are the highest in terms of the lack of health insurance. The \"Model Minority\" label is meaningless in today's world; Asian Americans are instead seeking models for equity, empowerment, and change. For the next 10 years, there's a lot of work to be done in the community.\n\nThe complete report, \"A Community Of Contrasts: Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in Los Angeles County\" can be downloaded here from the AAAJ-LA's website.",

  "latent_15925": "On January 16, 1895, Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii’s last monarch, was arrested and imprisoned in a bedroom on the second floor of the Iolani Palace, the kingdom’s historic seat of government. She was charged with treason for alleged involvement in an abortive counter-revolution attempted by royalist supporters several days prior. These conspirators hoped to restore Liliuokalani to the throne from which she had been deposed two years earlier, in a coup conducted by a group of mostly American citizens whose ultimate goal was the annexation of the Hawaiian islands to the United States.\n\nApart from a humiliating trial, the queen was confined to that forlorn room for eight months. Although she was initially not permitted to have newspapers, Liliuokalani must have suspected fairly quickly that her people’s struggle for political sovereignty was irretrievably lost. Three years later, in a decisive victory for American political and business interests, Hawaii was formally annexed to the U.S. over the objections of a majority of the native population.\n\nTo soften the sting of solitude, the queen turned to musical composition, her “usual solace in either happy or sad moments.” She recalled that “hours which I might have found long and lonely passed quickly and cheerfully by, occupied and soothed by the expression of my thoughts in music.” Like many of her royal ancestors, Liliuokalani loved music. It was during her house arrest that she transcribed what was to become her most popular song, “Aloha Oe” (Farewell to Thee). In the languor of her captivity, the tune, originally inspired by an affectionate farewell between lovers, became a lament of dispossession.\n\nConfronted by imperial aggression and commercial hegemony, future generations of Hawaiian musicians were able to offer their erstwhile queen at least some degree of consolation.\n\nThe primary weapon of the Hawaiian invasion was the steel guitar. Many have taken credit for its invention, and it is possible that the technique of noiselessly sliding a piece of glass, steel, or bone across the strings of a guitar developed independently, multiple times: a convergence in music technology. Nevertheless, the story of the native Hawaiian Joseph Kekuku has emerged from music history’s apocrypha as the best documented and accredited case. After a teenage Kekuku’s alleged seven years of privately perfecting his method in the 1880s and 1890s, it swept the islands and then worked its way to the mainland.\n\nIn the early years of the 1900s, the seductive, evocative sound of the steel guitar drifted over the ocean and astonished American audiences. The first generation of Hawaiian players, including Kekuku, Ernest Kaai, Ben Hokea, and Pale K. Lua, toured the States and Europe, buoyed by their virtuosity. They established reputations so strong that some of them never returned to Hawaii. The “foreign” musical import began to gain a major foothold in the U.S. and interact with contemporary currents in American music like ragtime and early blues.\n\nAlthough the new Hawaiian sound was circulating on vaudeville tours and a limited number of recordings before the early 1910s, it was the 1911 theatrical production of a Broadway play, The Bird of Paradise, that truly piqued national interest and catapulted players like Kekuku into international fame. The show, an otherwise hackneyed love story between an American military man and a Hawaiian lass, highlighted a quintet of Hawaiian musicians playing steel guitar and ukulele. A New York Times review was not alone in lauding its “introduction of the weirdly sensuous music of the island people.” Imitation plays sprang up and companies released recordings and sheet music of Hawaiian songs to capitalize on its immense success.\n\nUniversal expositions and world fairs in the first two decades of the twentieth century also served as important vehicles for the presentation and popularization of Hawaiian music. The most extravagant and well attended of these was the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915 in San Francisco, which escalated the Hawaiian sound into a bona fide national obsession. A member of the Hawaii Promotion Committee said that the islands’ pavilion at that exposition was intended to render them “the tourist mecca of the travel world.” He boasted that it was “the best-known building” at the exposition and a “colossus in popularity, for the strum of ukuleles and the tinkle of guitars gently touching passers-by, compelled entrance to the building.”\n\nThe exposition did elevate Hawaii’s touristic cachet. But it also allowed native performers to tour the mainland. As curious visitors to the exposition were “lured by the ear-haunting melodies of the Hawaiian musicians,” increasing numbers of native performers were likewise drawn into the commercial riptide and deposited far from home in American studios and stages.\n\nBy the 1920s, the channels through which Americans accessed new music were expanding. The plaintive call of the steel guitar permeated the country through records, movies and radio transmissions as well as live performances and traveling shows. Many of the nation’s leading country and blues musicians drew inspiration from Hawaiian steel. A young and ambitious Jimmie Rodgers, before he had earned his title as the “Father of Country Music,” pooled his cash earned from performances on a traveling show to create his own “Jimmie Rodgers Hawaiian Tent Show.” Country player Bob Dunn, later a pathbreaker in electrical amplification, watched a Hawaiian stage show in Eastern Oklahoma at age nine and took up the steel guitar soon afterward. Jerry Byrd, renowned pioneer of the Nashville sound, had a similar epiphany at thirteen when he witnessed a Hawaiian troupe touring during the Depression. Influential bluesman Oscar “Buddy” Woods imitated the Hawaiian guitar style that he observed during a show in the early 1920s. Troman Eason, early innovator of the “sacred steel” gospel tradition, became hooked after hearing a Hawaiian play it over the radio in Philadelphia in the mid-1930s.\n\nOne could speculate that the vocal-like quality of the slide technique was attractive to early country musicians who had previously used instruments like the fiddle and harmonica to imitate the human voice. The first country performer believed to have recorded a steel guitar on his lap in the established Hawaiian style was a West Virginian coal miner named Frank Hutchison, who cut two songs, “Worried Blues” and “Train that Carried the Girl from Town” in 1926. Jimmie Rodgers would record thirty-one songs featuring the steel guitar during his career (and play ukulele on one). Maybelle Carter of the celebrated Carter Family converted her guitar to a “Hawaiian setup” in 1928. The first ensemble to be labeled on a record as “hillbillies,” a collection of string musicians from North Carolinian and Virginian counties, made early use of the steel.\n\nThe instrument’s Pacific origins found acknowledgement in the names of 1920s Southern string bands like the North Carolina Hawaiians. Some of these early roots groups performed renditions of traditional Hawaiian tunes in a prefigurement of the modern “cover version.” Examples include the Scottsdale String Band’s version of “My Own Iona” and the Shamrock String Band’s rendition of “High Low March,” most likely a simultaneous adaptation and mispronunciation of the earlier Hawaiian recording, “Hilo March.” Early cowboy bands would assume different identities for consecutive gigs, performing one night under a name like Hawaiian Troubadours and the next as Barn Dance Troubadours. The distinguished country songwriter Ted Daffan only needed one steel guitar to play in a Hawaiian-themed group called the Blue Islanders in 1933 and a country ensemble called the Blue Ridge Playboys the next year. Eminent steel guitarist Herb Remington moved with ease in the other direction, from the Texas Playboys to his Hawaiian group, the Beachcombers. This sonic shapeshifting was both an effect and cause of the blurred lines between distinctly Hawaiian music and the nascent folk forms ripening in the U.S. during this time.\n\nThe Hawaiian influence upon African-American blues musicians is evident as well, although it demands more careful historical scrutiny as some sort of sliding technique on guitar may have been invented independently by black players. W. C. Handy, the “Father of the Blues,” recalled the “unforgettable” effect of seeing a man in 1903 pressing “a knife on the strings of [a] guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars.” Some scholars have argued that the early blues technique of sliding a knife or broken neck of a bottle against guitar strings may have roots in an African instrument, a single-stringed musical bow. Significantly, most blues players of the era held their guitars in the upright position, in contrast to the Hawaiian style in which the instrument is rested on the performer’s lap.\n\nNevertheless, the seminal bluesman Charlie Patton played in both styles. A set of blues guitarists in the 1930s, including Kokomo Arnold, Casey Bill Weldon, Oscar Woods, Tampa Red, and Black Ace adopted the Hawaiian style and incorporated the Hawaiian practice of playing long melodic lines, as opposed to a blues style defined by short, staccato riffs. Casey Bill Weldon was advertised on some of his recordings as the “Hawaiian Guitar Wizard.” B. B. King has credited Hawaiian steel guitar as an influence, particularly Bukka White, who played in the Hawaiian style. Legend has it that White gave B. B. his first guitar. When Elmore James recorded his composition “Hawaiian Boogie” in the early 1950s, he concurrently paid homage to the music that had inspired the previous generation of bluesmen and illustrated how far the blues had come from its humble origins.\n\nFor the historian tracing the genealogy of the American roots idiom in the first few decades of the twentieth century, these examples reveal some part of the dense web of influence spun by Hawaiian sounds. Quantifying this influence appears to be difficult, if not impossible. The historian could perhaps content herself with the impressionistic conclusion that some of the many ears that heard Hawaiian songs on the mainland were inspired, consciously or unconsciously, to appropriate stylistic or instrumental elements into their own music.\n\nIn reality, the narrative of the Hawaiian invasion is not simply one of abstract inspiration via radio waves and traveling circuses. It is equally a story of personal interaction and musical communion between Hawaiian immigrants to the mainland and American performers.\n\nSome of the best-known first-wave Hawaiian guitarists would never return to the islands, instead settling down in major mainland cities to open music studios and teach. Kekuku did so in Chicago and then Detroit, Walter Kolomoku in New York, and Ben Hokea in Toronto and Ottawa. Ernest Kaai moved to Miami to establish a music store and studio, where a small colony of Hawaiians had sprung up as a result of its tropical climate and setting. American companies seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the steel guitar and ukulele made sure to advertise that their lessons were offered by “native” Hawaiians. Even during tours and expositions when their services were in high demand, these musicians would give lessons to inquiring Americans. Kekuku remained in Seattle for some time after the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 to teach steel guitar, and some of his students there went on to become musicians and music teachers themselves. George E. K. Awai, the leader of the Hawaiian troupe that performed at the Pan-Pacific Exposition, stayed behind in San Francisco afterwards to teach ukulele and steel guitar, and to publish instructional manuals for the instruments.\n\nJenks “Tex” Carman, the “Dixie Cowboy,” was mentored by Frank Plada, one of the first Hawaiian musicians to come to the States. Carman’s song “Hillbilly Hula” provides an alliterative example of the cross-cultural fusion that defined much of nascent country music. Hawaiian virtuoso Bennie Nawahi’s curiously-named band in the 1930s, King Nawahi and the International Cowboys, featured a young Roy Rogers before he became a cowboy phenomenon. Bob Dunn took steel guitar lessons for several years through correspondence with Walter Kolomoku, who had first gained fame on a Bird of Paradise tour. Renowned Nashville steel player Buddy Emmons enrolled in the Hawaiian Conservatory of Music in South Bend, Illinois, as a teenager. Troman Eason was so enamored of the steel sounds emanating from his radio that he arranged for lessons with their source, one of two brothers who came to the States to teach at the Honolulu Conservatory of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nIn addition to these pedagogical associations, professional and collaborative partnerships arose between these musicians. Vernon Dalhart, a major influence on the development of country music, produced his first recording of the style with the accompaniment of native Frank Ferera’s steel guitar. Rodeo star and actor Hoot Gibson brought the guitar maestro Sol Hoopii from the islands to Hollywood in the early 1920s to play in a cowboy band. Rodgers recorded sessions on separate occasions with three Hawaiian guitarists. Nawahi played with a group of black musicians, the Georgia Jumpers.\n\nJimmie Rodgers’s 1929 cut of “Everybody Does It In Hawaii” offers an illustrative example of the genre-bending ethos of this period. The lyrics, indulging a miscegenational fantasy with the islands, are not particularly noteworthy. However, the music, which superimposes Rodgers’s famous country yodel over the Hawaiian Joe Kaipo’s steel guitar, seamlessly blends Honolulu and Dallas (where the song was recorded). Rodgers’s partnership with Kaipo extended to several other classics as well. The Hawaiian steel’s yearning chime feels right at home underneath Rodgers’ lonesome crooning. Soon after, Rodgers would record with Lani McIntire, who headed one of the most famous Hawaiian ensembles at the time.\n\nHawaiian fingerprints extended even to the technical development of the guitar. The steel guitar models of famed luthier Chris Knutsen were inspired by his contact with Hawaiian musicians and their home-made instruments at the 1909 Exposition in Seattle. George Beauchamp, an early guitar innovator taken in by the Hawaiian sound, entrusted his tri-cone prototype to the trusty fingers of Sol Hoopii, who cut a series of 1926 recordings that propelled the model into the national spotlight almost overnight. Advertisements for Beauchamp’s guitars frequently featured the endorsements of renowned Hawaiian guitarists such as Hoopii and Sam Ku West.\n\nThe guitar demanded amplification as audiences grew in the 1930s, and the quest for volume naturally bore marks of Hawaiian inspiration. Beauchamp’s “Frying Pan,” the first electric guitar ever produced, was a Hawaiian steel model. Leo Fender, inventor of his eponymous guitar and a major influence on the subsequent development of electronic instrumentation, was also an avowed appreciator of the Hawaiian sound. During the planning stages for the Stratocaster model, he recruited Hawaiian prodigy Freddie Tavares as an assistant and design collaborator. Tavares would later innovate pedals for the electrified steel guitar, enabling the extensive volume and pitch control that now define modern country music.\n\nThe national obsession with the Hawaiian sound could even be credited with reorienting the landscape of popular music around the guitar and launching its career as the quintessential instrument of twentieth-century American music. Naturally, guitars were played on the mainland prior to Hawaii’s annexation, but they served primarily to provide rhythmic and chordal backing. The Hawaiian groups of the early twentieth century transformed the guitar into a lead instrument, placing it front and center as the iconic focus of the ensemble. One scholar’s examination of guitar magazines in this period shows shifting perceptions of the instrument during this era, as musical communities found themselves divided between the older, “sophisticated” tradition of classical guitar and the new phenomenon of steel guitar. The latter’s mellifluous sounds popularized (or vulgarized, depending on one’s point of view) the guitar and advanced its availability, accessibility, and acceptability in the American musical imagination.",
  "latent_16009": "KARNES COUNTY, Texas—After 23 years living on the South Texas prairie, Lynn and Shelby Buehring are looking for a new home, far from the fumes, traffic and noise of the Eagle Ford Shale boom.\n\nIt will mean leaving the white house beneath the oak trees where they expected to live out their retirement. The decision, said Lynn, 58, was a measure of last resort, dictated by her deteriorating health and failed attempts to get help from state regulators.\n\n\"We're not anti-drilling at all,\" she said. \"My complaint is they need to do it in a responsible way... It's just causing me a lot of medical issues, and I can't have it.\"\n\nBuehring's symptoms began when the drilling rigs arrived in late 2011. Her asthma worsened from a seasonal nuisance to the point where she needed two rescue inhalers and made frequent use of a breathing machine. She also developed chest pains, dizziness, constant fatigue and extreme sensitivity to smells.\n\nToday there are at least 57 oil and gas wells and nine processing plants within 2.5 miles of the Buehrings' house. These facilities have the state's permission to emit hundreds of tons of air pollutants per year, including volatile organic compounds like benzene and formaldehyde and toxic hydrogen sulfide, which aggravate respiratory conditions.\n\nLynn Buehring now covers her nose and mouth whenever she's outside. On a windy day in early May when this reporter arrived at her house, she wore a mesh cloth mask while walking from the front door to the driveway. She kept it on as she petted the cats—Prissy and Hemorrhoid (\"a pain in the butt\" who noses his way into everything)—and as she showed off Shelby's \"man cave,\" a barn with a homemade jukebox and decorative beer bottles.\n\nNext to the man cave is a red barn where Buehring runs her tax accounting business. \"There's been many a time when my customers will say, 'What is that terrible smell outside?'\" she said. The fumes range from a rotten-egg odor (characteristic of hydrogen sulfide, a naturally occurring and sometimes-lethal gas) to an indeterminate chemical smell and something she describes as a combination of petroleum, baby poop and sulfur.\n\nLynn Buehring on her property/Credit: Lisa Song\n\n\"Sometimes there's a yellow haze or mist out there, and my tax customers have to walk through that,\" she said. \"How dangerous is that?\"\n\nWithout health studies it's impossible to know whether the emissions are causing Buehring's symptoms. A recent eight-month investigation by InsideClimate News, the Center for Public Integrity and The Weather Channel revealed that despite hundreds of complaints from local residents, Texas regulators know little about air quality in the 26-county Eagle Ford region, which has nearly 9,000 wells and another 5,500 permitted. As many as 23,000 more wells may be drilled by 2018, according to some projections.\n\nCeleste Monforton, a public health researcher and a lecturer at George Washington University, said at least some of Buehring's symptoms are consistent with known health problems that can be caused by the types of pollutants emitted from oil and gas facilities. \"You're talking about volatile organic compounds, particulate pollution, hydrogen sulfide—we know a lot about how those compounds affect the body.\"\n\nIf public health officials in the Eagle Ford want to know how the emissions are impacting people, they can study the health of local residents and analyze the information for patterns, she said. \"Their burden of proof in terms of taking action should not be on each individual person demonstrating that this was the cause of their illness. Their mission and responsibility is to look at what happens to the population.\"\n\nThe Buehrings began to seriously consider relocation three months ago, when Lynn's symptoms took a turn for the worse. She developed balance issues and would fall over sideways \"for absolutely no reason,\" she said. Her hands trembled so much she feared she had Parkinson's disease, though a doctor later ruled that out.\n\nBoth she and Shelby had trouble sleeping at night due to the industry-driven truck traffic, which tended to peak between 1 and 4 a.m, Buehring said. Soundproof boards they installed over the bedroom windows proved ineffective.\n\n\"I told [Shelby], I can't live this way and I can't work this way. Enough is enough.\" And Shelby agreed \"we've got to get out of here.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, they went house-hunting in Tivoli, a small town in Refugio County near the Texas Gulf Coast. It was the first time in two months that Lynn could breathe outdoors without wearing a mask.\n\n\"We went fishing, and just relaxing,\" she said. \"I felt 90 percent better.\"\n\n'Nobody's There to Help'\n\nBuehring's experiences over the past three years have changed how she feels about her country. \"I thought we had people in place that were going to help the small man,\" she said. \"And then I find out that the rug's been totally pulled out from underneath me. I feel like I'm one person out there all by myself...and there's nothing I can do. Nobody's there to help.\"\n\nBuehring has filed numerous complaints with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which oversees air quality within the state. One of her first complaints, in January 2012, described \"a terrible odor accompanied by a wet mist that burned the eyes and nasal areas, and caused tightening in the chest.\"\n\nTCEQ investigator Carol McGrath visited the Buehrings several days later and encouraged Lynn to keep an odor log. McGrath also surveyed seven nearby oil and gas facilities and noted two flares trailing black smoke but no odors. Like many of the facilities near the Buehrings, these sites were owned by Marathon Oil, a Houston-based company worth nearly $25 billion as of 2013.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Buehring kept detailed notes on the air quality near her home:\n\nFeb.18, 2012, 2:30 Strong South Wind. Didn't notice an odor at first but it gave me an awful migraine headache. The smell was a sulfur sweet smell and my ears plugged up when I went out to take something to the can barrel. I had to do a shot for the migraine and 2 breathing treatments.\n\nFeb. 19 1:00 p.m. Oily smell in the air. Couldn't tell where it was coming from. Wind direction was changing constantly. 2 breathing treatments.\n\nFeb. 20 no smells noticed 1 breathing treatment\n\nIn March, McGrath returned with other TCEQ staff and air monitoring equipment. According to their report, the investigators noted such high concentrations of volatile organic compounds at one Marathon site that they \"evacuated the area quickly to prevent exposure.\" Marathon repaired the leak that same day and no fines were issued. McGrath later collected Buehring's odor log before giving it back, saying it couldn't be used as part of the investigation.\n\nBuehring said that led her to give up on the TCEQ. For most of 2013, she relied on the assistance of Keith Mingus, a local Marathon supervisor. The Buehrings said Mingus introduced himself to them, gave them his phone number and often arrived five or ten minutes after they called with a complaint.\n\n\"He was wonderful,\" Buehring said. \"He would try to get to the bottom of it. He didn't push us off—he really sounded concerned.\"\n\nShe said Mingus was transferred out of the region in late 2013. The Buehrings haven't met his successor and don't know who to call at Marathon when there's a problem.\n\nIn an email, company spokeswoman Lee Warren said Marathon places \"a high value on being a responsible operator and a good neighbor.\"\n\nShe said the company has hosted five community meetings in the Eagle Ford within the last two years, three of which were in Karnes County.\n\nCharlie Malik, chief of Karnes City's volunteer fire department, said Eagle Ford companies have provided his department with additional equipment, including a trailer for fire-fighting foam, hydrogen sulfide monitors and a water truck. \"Marathon and all the oil companies around here have been very good to us. All you have to do is ask.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, 15 firefighters from Malik's department responded to a fire at a Marathon well site where workers were pumping oil and other flammable liquids into a tank. Malik said it was a \"contained fire\" that would have burned itself out in time.\n\n\"No injuries were reported and no loss of containment occurred,\" Warren said in an email.\n\nDesperate for Information\n\nBuehring started a new odor log in 2014 after Mingus left Karnes County. She's called the TCEQ eight times since March 19, but only one of those complaints appears in the agency's online database. Buehring said she left numerous voice mails that were not returned.\n\nTCEQ investigator Jeff Seiler visited the Buehrings in mid-April. Buehring said she asked if he could help her obtain a wind sock—a simple device that indicates the wind direction—from Marathon. She hoped to place the sock in her yard to help determine when it would be safe for her to go outside. She said Seiler told her to contact Marathon directly, but did not provide a phone number.\n\n\"They don't care,\" she said, referring to the TCEQ. \"They say they're going to talk to Marathon, they're going to do this and that, and it's fallen on deaf ears, over and over and over.\"\n\nInsideClimate News called the TCEQ for comment, but agency spokesman Terry Clawson would not discuss anything on the phone. \"The TCEQ follows up on citizen complaints aggressively and in a timely manner, and has proactively conducted reconnaissance activities to identify emission sources,\" Clawson wrote in an email. \"To date, the TCEQ has found no indication that authorized air emissions from oil & gas operations are causing adverse health effects in the Eagle Ford Shale or any other area in Texas.\"\n\nBuehring said she wants the agency to \"fine Marathon more, where it hurts them, so some of this would be stopped. And if there's something dangerous around us, inform us so I know [when] I need to stay in.\"\n\nBuehring has reached out to the office of state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Democrat who represents much of the Eagle Ford region, including Karnes County. In a phone interview Thursday, Zaffirini said she would like to know whether stricter air permitting rules used in the Barnett Shale in North Texas should apply in the Eagle Ford, and whether rules could be established to limit how close to schools and homes wells could be drilled.\n\nOn Friday, Zaffirini's staff is to meet with the TCEQ to discuss air quality in Karnes County, and whether the state can set up a permanent air monitor in the county.\n\nThe Buehrings, meanwhile, are continuing their search for a new home. Lynn hopes to find a house near San Antonio so she has easy access to her doctors.\n\nThis story is part of a project by InsideClimate News, the Center for Public Integrity and The Weather Channel.\n\nRead more: Fracking the Eagle Ford Shale: Big Oil & Bad Air on the Texas Prairie",

  "latent_16049": "The study: Ben Vermaercke and his colleagues at KU Leuven gave two cognitive-learning tasks to lab rats and students. With both tasks, the subjects were trained to distinguish between “good” and “bad” patterns and then tested on their ability to apply that know-how to new types of patterns. In the first task, the patterns varied on only one dimension—either orientation or spacing—and rats and humans performed it equally well. In the second, the patterns varied on both dimensions, and the rats did better than the humans.\n\nThe challenge: Are rodents more intelligent than we give them credit for? Are they, in some cases, our cognitive superiors? Mr. Vermaercke, defend your research.\n\nA more complex brain isn’t always a better one. In information integration tasks, rats applied what they learned more quickly.\n\nVermaercke: The “in some cases” caveat is key here. The rats did outperform the humans in the second task. They needed more practice with the initial set of patterns to figure out how to discriminate between “good” and “bad,” but when given the next set, they were able to apply what they’d learned more quickly. They had to swim to show us their choices, while the student subjects used computers. But otherwise we tried to make the conditions as equal as possible.\n\nHBR: How do you explain the rats’ better performance?\n\nThe first task involved rules. The second focused on information integration. Humans learn in both ways. Our rule-based system was an evolutionary development: How do you tell if a berry is good for eating? You learn that this small red one is good, and then you save energy by bypassing the ones of a different shape or color. So our brains have been conditioned to look for rules. We’re taught them in school, at work, and by our parents, and we can make many good decisions by applying the ones we’ve learned. But in other situations there’s too much going on for simple rules to work, and that’s when information integration learning has to kick in. Think of a radiologist evaluating an X-ray. If you ask him what rules he uses to determine whether a spot is cancer, he’d probably have a hard time verbalizing them. He’s learned from labeled examples in medical school and his own experience, and then developed an instinct for identifying cancerous spots based on what he’s seen before. Another example that comes to mind is a manager interviewing a job candidate. There aren’t any hard-and-fast rules about who will be a good hire. You have to consider many factors and rely on your judgment or on a gut feeling based on your experience with people in the workplace. Unfortunately, there’s a great deal of evidence showing that humans have a harder time learning how to integrate information in this way, because they seek rules even when there are none.\n\nBut rats don’t have the same problem?\n\nRight. A more complex brain isn’t always a better one. Our theory is that instead of considering the specific data points and trying to find and apply a rule, our rat subjects employed what we call a similarity-based categorization strategy: Does this pattern look like the “good” targets we saw in training?\n\nAre rats really that discerning?\n\nSince my PhD thesis I’ve been studying how far we can push these animals in terms of task complexity, and the answer is, quite far. People used to think rats were practically blind; now we know that their visual abilities are pretty advanced. We’ve done research showing they can tell the difference between a movie that features a rat and one that doesn’t. David Cox and his colleagues at Harvard have reported that rats can recognize a 3-D object even if its size changes or it’s been rotated. These and other findings show that the rat is a valuable animal model for the study of complex visual processes.\n\nWhy should we care what rats can do?\n\nEven though the rat brain is smaller and less complex than the human brain, research has shown that the two are remarkably similar in structure and function. Both consist of a vast amount of highly connected neurons that are constantly talking to each other. But we still have a very limited understanding of the main principles underlying this communication. So we start by investigating less complicated mammalian systems. You wouldn’t begin to learn the English language by reading Shakespeare, right? Also, with rats we can obviously study things that we just couldn’t in people. Take my current work as a research fellow at Harvard. It involves removing a small part of the skull of a living rat and replacing it with a coverslip, so we literally have a window into its brain and can see how its neural circuits change as it learns tasks. We can do this with dozens of animals.\n\nWhat does PETA think about that?\n\nWe always follow institutional guidelines for humane housing and testing. And one benefit to proving that rats are intelligent creatures and using them for these sorts of experiments is that we take the weight off the shoulders of monkeys. I’m not saying you can replace primates with rats for all research. But it is feasible to use them in some cases. You can train many more of them, and there are fewer ethical and financial restraints.\n\nWhat other types of animals are proving useful to brain research?\n\nQuite a lot of animal models are used in neuroscience, and each has specific advantages. For example, the larvae of the zebra fish are completely transparent. This allows researchers to capture images of developing brain cells to answer questions about which molecules are important at which stage—knowledge that’s relevant to human embryo development. Another nice example is the male songbird, which develops a stereotypical song during adolescence. Researchers have studied the neural processing at work there to better understand how motor patterns develop through variable behavior and gradual refinement—something you also see in young children when they’re learning through trial and error to walk, eat, and speak.\n\nLet’s get back to your experiment. Did you expect the humans to lose to the rats?\n\nNo. At first the study was on rats only. We simply wanted to know how they would handle the two types of learning tasks. However, when we saw that the pattern of results did not match those found in similar human studies, we decided to add people to our study and create as direct a comparison as possible. We were really surprised by the results.\n\nWhat can humans do to overcome our bias toward rule seeking and get better at integrating information? How do we beat the rats?\n\nOne specific strategy might be to occupy your brain’s rule-based learning system with another task so that it doesn’t dominate your information integration learning system. In an experiment led by J. Vincent Filoteo of the University of California, San Diego, people did much better on an exercise very similar to the one we gave our subjects if they performed a number memory task—that is, one that occupied their rule-based system—between the training and the testing. There’s still room and need for more research, though. We’ve known about these two systems for about 15 years, but when it comes to the implications they hold for improving learning in our schools or organizations, I don’t think we’ve reached the answers.",

  "latent_16246": "We’ve all heard it: Millennials are more narcissistic, entitled, and self-indulgent than generations past. Whether that makes you nod your head or roll your eyes — the evidence, after all, remains controversial and polarizing — the idea that narcissism has increased among college students over the last 25 years is worrisome from an organizational perspective. Millennials are the next generation of leaders. And while we know narcissism can be useful at times, research has linked narcissists’ sense of entitlement and belief that the rules don’t always apply to them to a range of counterproductive work behaviors, such as embezzlement, workplace incivility, bullying, and white-collar crime.\n\nSo in 2011, Jim Westerman, a professor at Appalachian State University’s Walker College of Business, conducted a study of 16 professors and 536 undergraduate students in business and psychology. He wanted to see whether Millennial students were more narcissistic than their predecessors (they were) and, more specifically, whether business students displayed higher levels of narcissism than psychology students (they did). The logical next question, according to Westerman, was to understand the potential role of college faculty in these findings.\n\nWesterman and his colleagues recently published their results in The International Journal of Management Education. Their latest study, of 267 undergraduate business students and nine professors at a U.S. university, found that “narcissism fit,” or how well a student’s level of narcissism matched his or her professor’s, was significantly related to the student’s final grade in the class. Students who were as narcissistic as their professors got higher grades than students who were either more or less narcissistic than their professors — and this effect seemed to be partially driven by students’ perceptions of class difficulty and professor status.\n\nIt’s essentially a case of personality fit, something that factors into student outcomes.\n\nThe researchers had students complete the Narcissistic Personality Inventory — a questionnaire that was developed in the 1980s and is commonly used in social psychological research to measure narcissism — midway through the semester. (The faculty members completed it at the end of the semester, when submitting the students’ grades.) Respondents chose between two statements, a narcissistic response and a nonnarcissistic response. For example, they’d choose either “Modesty doesn’t become me” or “I am essentially a modest person,” and either “I can usually talk my way out of anything” or “I try to accept the consequences of my behavior.”\n\nTo understand why mismatched personalities might affect student grades, the researchers also surveyed students about how difficult the class seemed and how esteemed the professor was. The idea here was that “narcissism fit” would affect how students felt about the class and the professor, which would in turn affect their grades. The researchers controlled for age, gender, GPA, class level, and class attendance.\n\nThe results showed that harmonious personalities were beneficial for students. Less-narcissistic students flourished with less-narcissistic professors: they got higher grades, felt the class to be less difficult, and thought more highly of the professor. The same was true of more-narcissistic students under more-narcissistic professors.\n\nStudents who were either more or less narcissistic than their professors fared worse. Less-narcissistic students struggled in classes with more-narcissistic faculty, getting lower grades, perceiving the class to be more difficult, and respecting the professor less. More-narcissistic students being taught by less-narcissistic professors had similar results.\n\nIt’s important to note that this was a correlational study, and its primary weakness seems to be the relatively small sample of professors. However, the researchers say that the findings point to an implication of having narcissistic business school professors: in effect, they discourage less-narcissistic students but reward (in terms of grades and career placement opportunities) and possibly even provide a model of future behavior for more-narcissistic students. So figuring out ways to reduce narcissism among faculty, they argue, may be a linchpin in any strategy to reduce narcissism among students, and consequently in the workforce.\n\nWhile the aim of the study was to understand narcissism among undergraduate business students and professors, it’s not hard to imagine how this idea of “narcissism fit” might play out in the workplace. I wondered whether narcissistic managers and narcissistic employees might have better working relationships than those with differing personalities. If you’re as narcissistic as your manager, for instance, does that make you more likely to get promoted, land important projects, or earn higher pay?\n\nThat’s all speculative, of course, and Westerman cautioned against generalizing his findings to other contexts. The workplace is very different from the classroom, he explained: the relationships are longer-term, and the power differential is often greater and more salient. For example, while most people have only one boss who can make life-changing decisions, students have multiple professors, though it’s difficult to determine how much individual grades matter to one’s career.\n\n“All things considered, I would be surprised to find that fit on narcissism would relate to positive outcomes in the workplace,” Westerman said. “Narcissists come across as charming, bright, etc., in short-term interactions, but over the long term (like in a work relationship), the narcissist’s true nature comes across.”\n\nAnd yet despite narcissists’ flaws, there’s lots of evidence that people are drawn to them, not least because they tend to be very charismatic. Seeing how matching personalities might factor into this magnetism could help us resist it.",
  "latent_16263": "Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Cincinnati in October. (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was paid millions under a contract arranged by a Mexican politician who is likely to run for president of Mexico in 2018 on an anti-Trump, Mexico-first platform. That could be a conflict of interest if Giuliani is named secretary of state and tasked with renegotiating NAFTA and trying to get Mexico to pay for a border wall.\n\nGiuliani’s many foreign business entanglements as a private citizen are often cited as the primary reason President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is wary of him being appointed the nation’s top diplomat. Giuliani’s contracts with the government of Qatar and the Venezuelan-owned state oil company Citgo and his paid speeches for a shady Iranian dissident group that was listed as a foreign terrorist organization have all received attention.\n\nBut Giuliani’s first foreign contract could be the most relevant if he were in charge of the State Department because that contract involved Mexico’s leading leftist, populist and anti-Trump politician.\n\nIn 2002, shortly after he stepped down as New York’s mayor, Giuliani scored a $4.3 million contract to consult for the government and police force of Mexico City, then led by up-and-coming politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The contract was the first big international consulting haul for Giuliani Partners, which at the time included former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik.\n\nGiuliani worked personally on the contract, visiting Mexico and meeting regularly with López Obrador and Mexico City Police Chief Marcelo Ebrard, who later succeeded López Obrador as the head of Mexico City’s government. The idea was to replicate Giuliani’s success in reducing New York City’s crime rates in Mexico City. He recommended policies such as “zero tolerance” for petty crimes and applying “broken windows” policing, which focuses on disorder and vandalism to establish a sense of law and order that, in theory, would reduce the number of more serious crimes.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is considering nominating former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as his secretary of state. Here's why that could present challenges. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nNow that Giuliani might be Trump’s secretary of state, critics of the effort are demanding more information about the contract and the work Giuliani was paid for.\n\n“Mexico City wasted the money,” said Sergio Aguayo, a professor at El Colegio de México and a leading activist. “If Giuliani is secretary of state, of course we will look very carefully at the contract. What did he charge, and what did he deliver?”\n\nReports at the time noted that the Giuliani-López Orbrador alliance was odd, considering that López Obrador was a left-wing populist and Giuliani a right-wing conservative. Aguayo said López Obrador was looking to draw on Giuliani’s star power and Giuliani was looking to get paid.\n\nMany reports said that at least part of the contract likely was paid by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. During the campaign, Trump publicly accused Slim of conspiring with the Clinton campaign without offering any evidence.\n\n“They hired a name, they wanted the Guiliani name to guarantee success. They didn’t get it,” Aguayo said. “He came, he posed for pictures, and everybody was happy for a time. Then reality came back. There is no warranty in consulting.”\n\nThere is still an ongoing debate in Mexico as to whether Giuliani’s recommended reforms helped or hurt the situation. While some petty-crime numbers went down after the Mexico City government implemented 137 of the 146 recommendations Giuliani’s firm outlined in its consulting report, violent crimes over the following five years in Mexico largely remained the same or went up slightly, according to Mexican government statistics.\n\nPolicies that worked against New York organized crime did not always apply to Mexico City, where kidnapping was and remains a huge problem. Mexico City increased arrests by the thousands, but that led to prison overcrowding and what some human rights groups called the criminalization of the city’s homeless population.\n\nRegardless, Giuliani returned to Mexico City in 2013 and declared success. Speaking to a convention of insurers there, he said the city was “much more pleasant” and “progressing considerably.” He could not have known then that he and López Obrador’s paths were set to cross again.\n\nIn 2006, López Obrador lost the Mexican presidency to Felipe Calderon by less than 1 percent of the vote, after which organized large protests against the election. He called the results a fraud and demanded a recount. After losing his appeal, his supporters held an inauguration ceremony anointing him the “Legitimate President” and forming an alternate shadow government.\n\nLópez Obrador ran again in 2012 and lost by seven points to Enrique Peña Nieto, the current president of Mexico, who met with Trump just before the election. López Obrador again alleged fraud and sought unsuccessfully to invalidate the election results. He then formed a new party called the Movement for National Regeneration.\n\nDuncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, said that López Obrador is likely to run for president again in 2018 and is indicating he would run on an anti-Trump platform. At times, López Obrador acts like a pragmatist and may see benefit is working with Washington, but overall he is seen as less U.S.-friendly than the other candidates.\n\n“The public perception is that he is anti-Yankee, that he would stand up to the United States, that in particular he would stand up to a Donald Trump presidency,” said Wood. “That’s because he is the most nationalistic of the projected candidates, and he talks a lot about defending Mexico’s interests for Mexicans.”\n\nIronically, Trump’s election may bolster López Obrador’s chances because there is broad opposition in Mexico to Trump’s proposed policies, such as making Mexico pay for a border wall, renegotiating NAFTA and punishing Mexicans in the United States who want to send remittances back home.\n\n“If Trump were to win the U.S. elections, Lopez Obrador would have a field day,” Miami Herald columnist Andrés Oppenheimer wrote in June. “Lopez Obrador’s fiery speeches against Trump’s Mexico-bashing would rally many Mexicans behind him.”\n\nWould Giuliani as secretary of state be seen in Mexico as an impartial actor when López Obrador runs for president in 2018? Would their prior financial dealings give Giuliani a stake in the outcome? Would his past relationship with López Obrador color his judgment when dealing with the Mexican government on the Trump agenda?\n\nThese are the questions that the Trump transition team is asking itself as Trump hones in on a secretary of state selection — and they are only one part of a web of relationships senators will examine if Giuliani ever makes it to a confirmation hearing.",
  "latent_16295": "March 10, 2010\n\nThe truth is that pretty much every Washington politician takes bribes--but in their legal form as campaign contributions from corporate lobbyists.\n\nTHE SLEAZE just keeps emerging from the corridors of power in the \"world's greatest democracy\"--and it's thoroughly bipartisan.\n\nLast week, Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) was forced to surrender his chairmanship of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee--\"temporarily,\" he claimed--after the House Ethics Committee found that he had taken a number of trips to the Caribbean, basking in the sun on corporate money.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"The ethics panel is still investigating more serious accusations regarding Mr. Rangel's fund-raising, his failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic and his use of four rent-stabilized apartments provided by a Manhattan real estate developer.\"\n\nMeanwhile, New York Gov. David Paterson--himself a replacement for Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in disgrace--announced he wouldn't seek re-election after the publication of a New York Times report detailing how Paterson's office, including staff members, the governor's state police detail and Paterson himself, pressured a woman to drop domestic violence charges against his top aide David Johnson.\n\nThen there's Rep. Eric Massa, another New York Democrat, who announced his retirement last week, citing \"health\" reasons--but as it turns out, he's being investigated by the House Ethics Committee, too, for allegedly making inappropriate sexual comments to a male staffer.\n\nPolitical scandals are hardly surprising in a political system that rewards those who do the bidding of the wealthy and powerful--and who think they're above the law. Such scandals are an indication of the politicians' arrogance, and the massive disconnect of those who run our political system from the rest of us.\n\nBut there's a deeper scandal here--one that the media won't pay attention to. The scandal is that a political party that controls the White House and Congress with the largest majority in decades could fail to deliver on any of the issues that working people need.\n\nFROM HEALTH care \"reform\" that has devolved into a blatant giveaway to the insurance industry, to a \"peace plan\" that involves a dramatic escalation of the war in Afghanistan, to defending the biggest financial giveaway in history to the very banks and corporations that caused the financial meltdown of 2008, the idea that the Democrats could still claim to represent the interests of working people seems a farce. The hope for change that millions of people felt in the run-up to Barack Obama's election is vanishing.\n\nNow, Democrats are seeing their fortunes turn as growing numbers of people grow disenchanted with a party that was never committed to challenging the system in the first place.\n\nCertainly, the Republicans have no coherent alternative. But they don't have to. They can criticize Obama's $787 billion stimulus package as ineffective--which is true--and then propose budget cuts that would make the suffering of working people much worse.\n\nAfter decades of trying to slash Medicare, the Republicans are getting away with posing as its defenders because Obama's health care plan would take $500 billion away from the program. And although the Republicans are shills for the big banks, they can score points by painting Obama as being too cozy with Wall Street--because he is.\n\nIf some Republicans are able to pursue this strategy by casting themselves as \"outsiders,\" it's only because the Democrats have given them the opening. People are rightly frustrated and angered at the failure of the Democrats to deliver--and that leaves the political initiative open to the Republicans to pass themselves off as caring about working people.\n\nTake, for example, the news that Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd may be in the process of de-fanging even the limited financial system reforms proposed by Democrats following the Wall Street meltdown.\n\nIn his role as the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Dodd is reportedly attempting to put a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency under the direction of the Federal Reserve--which would be like letting the foxes guard the henhouse. As Zach Carter wrote in the Nation, Dodd is also attempting \"to block the new agency from enforcing the rules it writes, leaving enforcement up to the same regulators who ignored rampant predation and outright fraud throughout the housing bubble.\"\n\nDodd is set to retire at the end of this legislative session, so he no longer has to pretend to have the interests of working people at heart. Instead, he can act openly on behalf of his largest campaign donors--securities and investment firms, law firms and the insurance industry.\n\nActions like these are leading millions of people to grow cynical again about the motives of Washington--after the brief interlude when the 2008 campaign of Barack Obama created a climate of hope and enthusiasm that gave the Democrats their biggest majority in more than a generation.\n\nTHEY'RE ALSO another sign that the oft-repeated claim that the U.S. is the \"world's greatest democracy\" is a fraud.\n\nThose who get heard in the halls of Congress aren't the ordinary people whose unemployment benefits are running out, but rich loudmouths like Republican Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky, who got the bulk of his campaign money in the past five years from the insurance industry, health professional lobbying groups, and securities and investments groups.\n\nBunning recently used a filibuster to hold up a $10 billion bill designed to pay for, among other things, extended unemployment benefits and Medicare payments to doctors. Bunning claimed that he was taking a principled stand against spending. \"Enough,\" the red-faced Republican yelled on the floor of the Senate. Until he finally relented, Bunning's filibuster threatened jobless benefits for millions.\n\nAnd who did Bunning get support from but the newest member of the Senate and the GOP's new golden boy, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown. \"The perception in Massachusetts and other parts of the country is that Washington is broken,\" Brown told the Washington Post. \"And if it takes one guy to get up and make a stand...I think that speaks for itself.\"\n\nSo much for Brown's ordinary-guy-in-a-truck act.\n\nFor an even clearer illustration of what the Republicans think about ordinary people, consider the comments of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who praised Bunning as \"brave,\" and went on to say that unemployment benefits actually keep \"people from going and finding jobs.\"\n\nSo if you're out of work, Tom DeLay thinks it's your own fault for being too lazy to find a job. Maybe he didn't get the memo that says that Republicans are supposed to be embracing \"populism\" to turn around their discredited party's fortunes.\n\nDeLay, of course, set the pace for scandal in Washington several years ago, when Texas prosecutors charged him with running a vast, crooked campaign finance scheme. Now, Rangel, one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress, has been caught sunning himself in the Caribbean on the corporate dime.\n\nBut the truth is that Jim Bunning and Chris Dodd and pretty much every other Washington politician take bribes as well--just in their legal form as campaign contributions from corporate lobbyists.\n\nFor all the mainstream media moaning about how \"Washington doesn't work,\" they never ask why someone like Bunning--or any politician--should be able to hold up the entire legislative process with a filibuster or other procedural red tape. Or why senators from states with a fraction of the population of the country's biggest cities should have equal say about critical legislation.\n\nThe problem isn't that Washington is \"dysfunctional,\" but that it's designed, by its nature, to put the brakes on any proposals to improve the system for working people. In that sense, the U.S. political system works perfectly well--for the rich and powerful.",

  "latent_16693": "The idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west. One would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the man-o-sphere, and to a great degree it is. But truly, the root of feminism’s death was in Man, capital M, from the very beginning. One look at Conan is all a man needs to know this truth.\n\nFeminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. The women’s movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There’s no room for dissent. It’s just like Mean Girls. If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminism—the pro-sex wing—was silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Susan Faludi is still saying I’m not a feminist. Who made her pope? Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You can’t talk to them about anything. ~ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture for MacLeans.ca\n\nNeurotic women indeed.\n\nPaul Joseph Watson of Infowars/Prison Planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of 2014. But he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion.\n\nFeminists did not just lose the debate, they lost the war.\n\nThe feminist attempt to demonize normal male/female behaviour in public—men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation—backfired in less than a month.\n\nWhen you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as Princess Leia, the QUEEN of 70’s patriarchal sexist ‘misogyny’, to ridicule feminists, you have lost the war for hearts and minds.\n\nAnd when I say hearts and minds…\n\nI mean the silent majority of young women who want NOTHING to do with feminism.\n\nLeia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys. So too will jawas, Darth Vader and even Yoda apparently, that sly dude. Who knew?\n\nAnd that’s a good thing! Men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship. Feminists may hate this, but the vast majority of women still prefer, and expect, the man to take the initiative to get the girl. This is how men and women were created and evolved, you can’t fight Darwin and God and come out on top.\n\nThis video shows that the majority of NORMAL women LOVE male attention. They WANT men to look at them. They WANT men to notice them. Why?\n\nTHEY WANT A MAN!!!\n\nI realized this is the case when I decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism.\n\nThis image from the Women Against Feminism Tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism. This woman was raped. She is not running around spreading lies like the UVA RAPE HOAX story that Rolling Stone ran and had to retract. She justs wants to go back to living a normal life. She does not want to be angry at ALL men for the crime of ONE of them. She does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge. She does not want to be a victim.\n\nFeminists have lost the female youth of Millenials, the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the 21st century.\n\nI understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that Millenial men have become vocal, blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of ‘women’ it has reared. The problem with this type of knee-jerk reaction is just that—you’re being a jerk. Yes, far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore. But, that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them.\n\nYoung women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence (an illusion) easier for them to choose, but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society.\n\nCase in point.\n\nI met a wonderful young Russian blonde a little while back. Twenty-three. Tight. Feminine. So freaking perfect. We hit it off immediately on first contact. Having myself only traveled outside the west twice, I still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time I do, I am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls. As I conversed with this well educated and refined young Russian lady, she told me she was attending university and so naturally, I asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home.\n\nHer answer was revealing…\n\nBoys? They completely ignore the girls. Don’t even look at them. Just walk on by.\n\nThis really surprised her. Being a feminine Russian girl who expects men to look at women, this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her.\n\nMen, young boys, in their prime 20s, completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, women against feminism started on Tumblr in 2013. I see #WomenAgainstFeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society. It is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage. All you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship, one with love and respect.\n\nI don’t think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is.\n\nAs men, we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting, but offensive opinions. The very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism, and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate, is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into ape-shit, mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left. Here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a ‘generational’ adjustment.\n\nLoading...\n\nWith all the knowledge men have now on the nature of women, we still have women who are speaking out against feminism. The nature of women with respect to speaking out and taking an unpopular position socially is pretty clear, even to women themselves.\n\nWhat women strive for most in their lives is non-confrontation and avoidance of conflict.\n\nWomen (ok, normal women) want harmony, peace, love and happy relationships.\n\nComing out against feminism is not easy for a lot of girls. You may think it is, but you must put yourself in the soul of a woman and remember how important relationships and being liked and connected is to them. Women don’t want to rock the boat. They don’t want to make enemies. They don’t want to create bad feelings among family, peers and co-workers. This is female nature and sounds odd to men because it is odd… it is not how we are wired.\n\nAs 2014 came to a close, something I think began to become very clear for a lot of Millenial women.\n\nA growing number of Millenial women are beginning to notice that young men, the ones they want to date and marry one day, are now so alienated from Western society that they are writing off women entirely.\n\nThis fully explains the rise of MGTOW and women are taking notice. It also explains why Red Pill knowledge and Game has completely changed the natural pairing dynamic between men and women by reducing the female to the most crude and rudimentary of male wants and needs—pure sexual objects. Again, women are taking notice. No, there is no massive sea change in the attitude of western women toward the men around them… yet, but make no mistake—women are not stupid. The vast majority of them still know where there happiness lies (with a man and marriage/family), even if they deny it intellectually and emotionally to their detriment.\n\nUp In The Air was a film that played for months in theaters. It resonated with audiences because it addressed the two biggest elephants in the room of western society—the complete marginalization of men in the man-cession of 08/09, and the underlying recognition, slowly bubbling to the surface of mental awareness, that Millenial women were sold a raw deal on how to pursue and find ‘happiness.’\n\nUp In The Air was released in 2009, when Clooney was still very much a bachelor for life, and Millenial women were just coming of age—20 to 25—that Anna Kendrick played to perfection. I think any young western woman who saw this film walked out of the theater in quiet, petrified fear for her soul. She was finally presented with her ideological and philosophical reflection, both older (Vera Farminga) and younger (Anna Kendrick) and, far from inspiring this young woman at the ‘advancement’ feminism has elevated her to, IT SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF HER.\n\nIt’s been down hill for feminism ever since.\n\nThat Twitter feed from ELLE magazine trying to shame a woman who has come out against feminism has reduced the feminist movement to imbecility . This article on Elle.com—The Internet Wins With ‘Confused Cats Against Feminism’ Meme-–about as mainstream and $$$ as one can get, tried to ridicule the #WomenAgainstFeminism Tumblr meme with CATS!!! No, I am not joking.\n\nWe might not have predicted that #WomenAgainstFeminism would be a hashtag that was surging in popularity in 2014, but watching dozens of women stand up against a movement that’s in their own self-interest is a sobering reminder that feminism’s image problem runs deep with the millennial generation. Luckily, the evil geniuses behind feminist website We Hunted The Mammoth have come up with the greatest response Tumblr of all time: Confused Cats Against Feminism. ~ Kate Winick for ELLE.com\n\nWhen your ideological political movement to free all humanity from, literally, Hitler inspired hated and violence of the evil male patriarchy, is reduced to using cats to disparage opponents, your ‘movement’ is dead… period.\n\nThe only reason feminism gained any ground at all in the past was because Boomer blue-pill men wanted to get laid, so they became feminists or leaned toward manginahood. Today, young Millenial men want nothing to do with the current generation of feminist indoctrinated, western women. I think it is safe to say, with Red Pill knowledge increasingly penetrating the cranium’s of young men in the 21st century, pussy is losing its halo and thus all power over the minds of men to keep them in submission to the goddess.\n\nSo it was in the beginning, so it will be anew. But, unlike the first patriarchal revolution, women will be on men’s side now as well for a return to patriarchy.\n\nThis is not to say we let up and begin to ignore feminism. All we need to do is simply keep reporting the truth of the feminist movement. It is imploding under its own idiocy and going forward, I can only see feminist attempts to shame both young men and women to get back into line getting even more desperate, and more hilarious. When the emerging pro-masculine and renewed patriarchal transformation of society is complete, feminism will go down in the history books as one of the most screwed up episodes in man’s history.\n\nI find it hilariously ironic that the ONLY reason feminism gained any ground, any success, any cultural dominance, was when men gave their assent and granted feminism power over them.\n\nMen take away their assent, feminist “independence” and “girl power” goes POOOOF!\n\nMan, capital M.\n\nNo more reason is needed for why feminism is dead.\n\nBy Crom!!!

  "latent_17300": "[Edited version originally published in the New York Jewish Week]\n\nDuring nearly two decades working on issues of Jewish intermarriage, I’d sometimes hear the lament that Jews who marry non-Jews are “lost to the Jewish people.” A few years back the Israel study program Masa aired a television commercial — roundly-criticized and thankfully yanked — showing lost-and-found posters for “missing” intermarried Jews.\n\nI always thought it was an odd suggestion, that I was lost because I intermarried. It was odd not only because I’m still here, working in the organized Jewish community, but because if the Jewish community lost me at all, it wasn’t when I finally married at age 36. It was a full quarter-century earlier when — at Jewish summer camp of all places — I realized I’m an atheist.\n\nBy 11, the liturgy about a God who punishes the wicked and rewards the good had become unbearable, primarily because I knew my grandmother. I knew what she experienced during the Holocaust, that she lost her parents, her siblings, her children. I knew she couldn’t possibly have done anything wicked enough to deserve such suffering. And certainly, nothing her infants could’ve done merited their own divine retribution.\n\nI’m aware of the nuance in the Jewish understanding of reward and punishment; the writers of the Bible themselves struggled with it. It’s part of a wonderful 3,000-year-old conversation that continues to this day and provides meaning to those who want to grapple with it on deep philosophical levels, myself included.\n\nNevertheless, synagogues represent the largest segment of the organized Jewish community. And what almost all synagogues ask of us is to come together and read statements we know to be untrue, aloud, as a group, with little to no acknowledgement that most of us simply don’t buy it.\n\nYes, most of us don’t buy it. The Pew Survey of American Jewry in 2013 found that 66% of Jews do not believe in God with “absolutely certainty,” compared to only 32% of our fellow Americans. Almost a quarter of Jews surveyed were willing to declare they do not believe in God at all, compared to only 7% of Americans in general.\n\nThis is a crisis of faith. It’s been happening for decades. Why isn’t it on the Jewish communal agenda?\n\nInstead, intermarriage is the bogeyman. Fear of the 52% intermarriage rate identified by the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) launched a billion dollars of “continuity crisis” initiatives. Most of that programming hoped to encourage young Jews to meet and marry other Jews. But after a decade of frenzied activity, the 2001 NJPS showed nary a dent in the intermarriage rate.\n\nBy 2013, the Pew survey found many more intermarried than in-married households in the United States. My estimate based on Pew percentages is 1,166,000 intermarried households to 742,000 in-married households, with the gap widening ever-faster.\n\nThere’s no question that the way Jews participate in Jewish life is changing. The mistake is to blame intermarriage itself as a cause for the change. Intermarriage is a result — a result of the same sweeping societal forces that are affecting many other aspects of American life, including secularization; multiculturalism; increased school/work/neighborhood options; and, for American Jews, acceptance, equality, and admiration. (It wasn’t Jewish piety that kept intermarriage rates so low until the 1960s; widespread anti-Semitism helped.)\n\nNevertheless, segments of the organized Jewish community today continue to base their approach on a dishonest sociology that claims an intermarriage cause-and-effect, promulgated by a handful of academicians who’ve been at it for decades — most recently last month, courtesy of Israeli taxpayer shekels. Shmuel Rosner, a reporter who contributed to this latest effort, displays this confusion when he writes, “interfaith marriage leads to eventual assimilation.”\n\nSuch purposeful oversimplification is not sociology, it’s smear. “Assimilation” is not the story we’ve seen for huge swaths of intermarried households. Intermarried Jews are involved in all Jewish denominations and most organizations. There are literally hundreds of thousands of exceptions to the supposed rule.\n\nSo why do the naysayers still have a platform? Marginalizing the intermarried while simultaneously blaming them for not participating is certainly easier than looking inward at how effective our communal responses have been to the actual underlying trends.\n\nAs with all difficult challenges facing the Jewish community, the answers can be found with television star Mayim Bialik.\n\nAdmired as an Emmy-nominated actress, neuroscience Ph.D., and a self-described “aspiring Modern Orthodox” Jew, Bialik has spoken and written extensively about her Jewish observance. That’s why I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke on video last year about her actual belief in God:\n\n“I don’t believe God is an old man with a beard in the sky who grants you magic fairy wishes if you recite the right words or feel guilty enough. I don’t believe that God can grant you a parking space if you pray hard enough. And I don’t believe that God set up some ‘code of behavior’ and if I don’t live by it I won’t be granted my place in heaven among the angels…. The God I believe in is the force in the universe that drives all of the phenomena that we experience as human beings. God is gravity and God is centrifugal force, and God is the answer to why everything is the way it is in the natural world….”\n\nI appreciate Bialik’s bravery for putting this out there, because it certainly doesn’t describe the God of most of organized Judaism. If anything, it nails how I’ve been describing the approach to God of folks within my movement, Secular Humanistic Judaism, as either, “Not believing in God or not believing in a God that answers personal prayers.”\n\nPerhaps her description finally gets at what it means when so many Jews, particularly young people, claim they are “spiritual not religious.” Where’s the sociological survey on what that means? That study would certainly be a better use of communal resources than the repetitive obsessing about intermarriage.\n\nIf Bialik doesn’t believe that the Jewish “code of behavior” was dictated from on high, why does she still keep kosher or observe Shabbat? What benefits does she derive? How does Judaism make the world a better place? The Jewish community should take note of the thoughtful reasons she gives in her video. Because providing more explicit answers to “Why be Jewish” or “Why do Jewish” is the way forward — as is being more open and honest about what Jews actually believe.\n\nSecular Humanistic Judaism dropped the God liturgy 50 years ago, so as not to have to say what we don’t believe. We replaced lyrics to some traditional songs and added human-centered poetry and inspirational quotes, and we continued our connection to Jewish history, wisdom, and celebrations of Jewish holidays and lifecycle events. I’ve seen hints of organizations in other movements addressing the God barrier as well. A liberal congregation in Brooklyn describes itself as a place “where doubt can be an act of faith,” and one in Manhattan claims it is “God-optional.” Still, all denominations must do a better job explaining the value of ritual and community, so more people might experience its benefits.\n\nAnd ultimately, the way for liberal Judaism to accommodate rising secularization is by undoing the marginalization of atheists in the Jewish community. And by “atheists” I mean everyone who doesn’t believe in God the way we’re “supposed to,” the way much of the organized Jewish community pretends Jews still do when we really don’t.\n\nAs with most marginalization, those who are privileged don’t notice it and those who are marginalized are usually long gone. In so many ways, our community is geared toward the 34% who believe “with certainty,” who would reply to an atheist asking for inclusion or acknowledgement with the all-too-regular accusation, “How can you be Jewish if you don’t believe in God?!”\n\nThose in leadership might also claim that because there are so many non-theistic Jews already participating in organized life, we don’t need to better accommodate them. Sure, to be included many atheist Jews sit through discomforting moment of religiosity, the same way intermarried couples accept second-class citizenry in many synagogues, LGBTQ Jews push through the heteronormality, and Jews of color endure white Jewish racism. But most Jews in all those categories affiliate less often.\n\nThat Judaism is so much more than a religion is not enough of a compelling pull back into organized Jewish life when the main alternative expression is ethno-nationalism. Most of us who’ve move past a because-God-is-watching rationale for Jewish activities have also moved toward a universalism of mankind that is post-ethnic and post-tribal. When there’s no magical “Jewish gene” to perpetuate, Judaism must be about meaning and benefit. And if Judaism is meaningful and beneficial, why would we limit it to just Jews?\n\nI was never “lost” to the Jewish community because I still derived meaning from being connected and involved, despite not believing and despite not hearing that it was okay for me not to believe. But for every one of me, there are three or more who walked away.

Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced Friday he is committed to working with his provincial counterparts to implement the Expression of Interest (EOI) system, whereby employers could screen and assess a pool of applicants for immigration consideration.\n\nImmigration Minister Jason Kenney said discussions with the provinces about the future of immigration in Canada were \"very fruitful.\" ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\n“We’ve had very fruitful discussions about the future of immigration in Canada,” Kenney said after the annual federal-provincial immigration conference in Toronto. All the provincial government representatives — except Quebec’s immigration minister, who was absent from the meeting — agreed the immigration system has to be fast and responsive to regional economic needs. However, Kenney was lukewarm to Ontario’s own immigration plan, unveiled earlier this month, that called for vastly increasing the number of skilled immigrants the province can hand-pick under the provincial nominee program — to 2,000 next year, and to 5,000 in 2014.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nCurrently, Ontario receives only a 5 per cent share of the 20,000 provincial nominees accepted across Canada each year. “The concern for Ontario is that the number of immigrants coming to Canada is going down ... Moving forward, we do have to find a way to co-operate and collaborate to rectify the situation,” said Ontario Immigration Minister Michael Chan. “All provinces want their provincial nominee programs expanded because immigrants coming in are successful in getting jobs that match their skills.” To reduce backlogs in the federal skilled worker program, Ottawa allowed provinces to “mine” applicants in the queue earlier this year, and Ontario is expected to nominate as many as 700 candidates above its 1,000 annual quota. A source from Kenney’s office said the minister cannot commit to Ontario’s request to boost that quota because he has to balance all the 60-plus immigration programs, and any additional quota for the province has to come from somewhere else.\n\nDetails of the EOI system, based on a system used in New Zealand and Australia, are not available. But Kenney said a formula will be developed to decide the “distribution of skilled immigrants across the country.” A recent provincial report found that Ontario has seen its share of immigrants to Canada drop by one-third, from 148,640 in 2001 to 99,000 in 2011. While 70 per cent of immigrants settling in other provinces belong to the “economic” class — skilled workers and investors, as opposed to refugees and people reuniting with family members — economic immigrants account for only 52 per cent of newcomers to Ontario.\n\nRead more about:",
  "latent_17335": "30 Pages Posted: 8 Aug 2013\n\nDate Written: 2013\n\nAbstract\n\nMust principles of justice be practical? Some political philosophers, the “implementers,” say yes. Others, the “idealists,” say no. Despite this disagreement, the implementers and idealists tend to agree that what it means for principles to be practical is that they are successfully implementable with fairly predictable results. In this paper I argue that both sides in this dispute are mistaken, each guilty of epistemic overconfidence. By accepting the demand that principles of justice be implementable, the implementers have too much confidence in our ability to determine, in advance, the limits of what is practically possible. By rejecting the idea that principles of justice need to be implementable, the idealists have too much confidence in our ability to determine, in advance, what is normatively desirable. I argue that we should adopt an alternative conception of practicality, one which speaks to the core concerns of both implementers and idealists, reconceives the roles of ideal and non-ideal theory, recognizes our epistemic limitations, and identifies experimentation as a methodological approach for addressing these limitations.",

We don’t know enough about his injuries yet.\"\n\nIn a later statement, the worried mom said Wells was undergoing an operation to repair damage to his foot.\n\nThis was not Wells' first brush with terror. He was in Boston to watch his mother run the marathon in 2013 when two Chechen immigrant brothers set off shrapnel-filled bombs that killed three and wounded scores more, his family said.\n\nWells was also in Paris this past November when the French capital was attacked by Belgium-based terrorists, the family said.\n\nEmpey's mother was relieved after she was able to speak with her son. \"He is doing great,\" Amber Empey said.\n\nThe young missionary underwent surgery for shrapnel wounds to his legs and was treated for second degree burns to his hands, face and head, the Empey family said in a statement.\n\nWounded in the leg, Norby was able to call his wife in Brussels and let her know he was alive, his son-in-law told NBC News.\n\nThree Mormon missionaries were seriously injured at the Brussels Airport attack on March 22.

I have a bad vibe.

  "latent_17397": "Obamacare and You The Rollout of the Affordable Care Act\n\nD-Day for HealthCare.gov is upon us.\n\nThe federal health insurance marketplace for 36 states has undergone round-the-clock fixes during the past eight weeks after what could only be characterized as a disastrous launch. Obama administration officials have promised that it will work better by month’s end (read: now) for the “vast majority of users.”\n\nThere’s little doubt the site is working better today. Users report that it’s faster and has fewer errors. Practically every day, the Obama administration reports progress.\n\nBut it’s unclear whether the improvements are enough to salvage the Affordable Care Act’s central element and ensure consumers can get coverage before Dec. 23, the deadline to sign up for benefits that begin on New Year’s Day.\n\nHere are six big questions:\n\nCan the website handle the expected crush of traffic? Media reports about problems with HealthCare.gov surely kept some consumers away. But as the deadline for signing up for coverage looms, they are likely to come back. The New York Times reported today that administration officials “have urged their allies to hold back enrollment efforts so the insurance marketplace does not collapse under a crush of new users. At the same time, administration officials said Tuesday that they had decided not to inaugurate a big health care marketing campaign planned for December out of concern that it might drive too many people to the still-fragile HealthCare.gov.” The trepidation is well-founded, and a dose of it could have gone a long way on Oct. 1, when the site debuted. Are the site’s back-end problems fixed? One of the biggest issues — out of public view — is that information being transmitted from the administration to insurance companies has been riddled with errors, hampering the smooth enrollment of consumers. Sarah Kliff at The Washington Post drew attention to this major problem last month, and while the administration has made fixing the problem a top priority, the error rate remains too high, experts say. Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner reports, “Insurers still haven’t reached the point where they can feel confident that the data is reliable. As a result, though they have been able to process some payments from individuals, they’ve only been able to do so on a piecemeal basis in cases where they are fully confident in the data, often because it’s been verified by hand.” Can individuals verify their identities so that they can enroll in plans? The New York Times reported Monday that some consumers are getting stuck in “no man’s land” in which they sign up for accounts on HealthCare.gov but are prevented from selecting plans because their identities cannot be verified by an outside contractor. “Many users of the website have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of documents like driver’s licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards, or sent them to the office of the federal insurance marketplace in London, Ky. Administration officials said the government had established strict procedures to verify that people applying for insurance were who they said they were, in order to prevent fraud and identity theft. But a breakdown in the process instead is causing concern among some consumers about the handling of their personal information.” Will the delayed Spanish language sign-up site work? CuidadoDeSalud.gov has been repeatedly delayed because of the issues plaguing its sister site, HealthCare.gov. The administration initially said it would be ready by mid-October, then the end of November. Now Talking Points Memo says it will have a soft launch in early December. That doesn’t give much time at all for Spanish speakers to sign up online before the Dec. 23 deadline for coverage that begins on Jan. 1. Of course, those consumers can fill out paper applications or call the toll-free number for assistance, but the online option cuts it very close. “The administration projects 10.2 million uninsured Latinos will be eligible to sign up for coverage. Federal call centers have so far fielded about 107,000 Spanish-language calls, according to the official, three percent of their total volume. Though national Latino advocacy groups have been generally supportive of the health care reform law, they have begun to voice frustration about the delays to the Spanish-language website,” Dylan Scott reports for TPM. Will enough people sign up for coverage—and are they the right people? Ultimately the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces will be judged by how many people enroll in coverage. The Congressional Budget Office projected 7 million people would sign up in 2014 (in the federal and state-run exchanges), but best I can tell that doesn’t really take into account the millions of people canceled by their existing insurance plans who may replace their coverage on the exchange. Beyond that, insurance companies need a balance of old and young, healthy and sick to balance their costs and avoid a “death spiral” in which costs keep going up and only the old and sick who must have coverage choose to stay in. Ezra Klein at The Washington Post says Obamacare enrollment won’t hit 7 million, but that will be OK if the mix of consumers is acceptable. “No one will ever look back on Obamacare’s launch and call it a success. The question is whether they’ll look back and say that Obamacare subsequently became a success. And that’s why the bottom-line goal for the White House is still the ratio of people who sign up for 2014 rather than the raw number of who sign up for 2014,” he writes. Will all the state-run exchanges get it together? While some states, including California, Kentucky and Washington state, have won praise for a relatively smooth rollout of their marketplaces, other states are still having more trouble. Covered Oregon has been plagued by so many problems that its online sign-up isn’t working yet. Maryland likewise is struggling. And the head of Hawaii’s exchange stepped down last week amid problems there. Even if HealthCare.gov is up and running, residents of these states have to rely on the pathways set up where they live.\n\nEditor’s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein’s “Healthy buzz” blog.

  "latent_17407": "Peter Bart and Mike Fleming Jr. worked together for two decades at Daily Variety. In this weekly column, two old friends get together and grind their axes, mostly on the movie business.\n\nFLEMING: I am back after a post-Cannes Festival European holiday and was intrigued by another startling spec package deal that went down while I was away. This was Skyscraper, a Die Hard in China concept that was noteworthy on several fronts. Just like the David Ayer-directed Will Smith-Joel Edgerton package Bright that Netflix committed $90 million for based on the Max Landis script, or the Landis-scripted Beneath that Kornel Mundruczo will direct with Bradley Cooper starring at MGM, Skyscraper reinforced the notion that smart, timely material with the right elements can bring a writer-director far more money than studios usually pay willingly. It also stamps Dwayne Johnson as the biggest action star since Arnold Schwarzenegger left for the governor’s mansion. Skyscraper proved irresistible for Legendary, whose new owner Wanda is both the biggest exhibitor and holder of commercial real estate and wants event films that can flourish in China. So Rawson Thurber, best known for writing and directing the clever comedy Dodgeball and who just worked with Johnson and Kevin Hart in Central Intelligence, came up with a pretty clever idea. And boy, will it pay him a lot of money. Sources tell me that Thurber will receive $2.5 million to write the script; on top of that he will be paid $5 million to direct and produce. This is reminiscent of the career-best payday Ayer just got for Bright from Netflix, and the seven-figure sums Landis got each for Bright and Deeper. Johnson, meanwhile, could reach the $20 million mark here by the time his deal closes, matching a milestone I’ve heard he’ll hit on the Jumani reboot at Sony. It’s not as much as Smith will earn from Bright, because Netflix bought out his back end. It’s a big investment, but Legendary gets a coveted China-set tentpole that could launch a franchise, and Johnson’s new affiliation with Wanda positions him to further build his brand in an elusive but vast marketplace.\n\nEven though Johnson’s back-end participation comes in cash break deals (studios don’t pay until they recoup) and not the first-dollar gross pacts Schwarzenegger signed, he’s the first action hero to reach the Arnie stratosphere. Days after that Skyscraper coup, Johnson announced he’ll do Doc Savage with The Nice Guys director Shane Black. Johnson will have to be careful about the prolific pace of deals – he’s announcing movie and TV projects often enough now to risk wearing that “he’s got more attachments than a vacuum cleaner” moniker. But if you look at his dance card, he’s got a shot at presiding over more franchises than any Hollywood star with Fast & Furious, San Andreas, Baywatch, Central Intelligence, Jungle Cruise, Rampage, Jumanji and Journey 3.\n\nI spent time with Johnson for several magazine pieces at different points in his career, the first of which came late one night when he sat for makeup to play the small role of The Scorpion King in one of The Mummy movies, at the start of his transformation from the wrestling ring. I recall him being very aware that Hollywood didn’t take him seriously as an actor, and very determined to prove everyone wrong. He was eager and amiable, even as he told these great stories like how, as an intense Miami Hurricanes defensive lineman, he once got so angry at a teammate in practice that he tried to pull the man’s tongue right out of his head (this was a teammate). Johnson had almost as unlikely a rags-to-riches progression as Schwarzenegger. He didn’t make the NFL, and the salary from football in Canada was so paltry he and teammates had to forage Salvation Army centers for old mattresses he said were pissed stained and wreaked of the Lysol they sprayed to kill whatever was growing on them. When he was finally cut, Johnson had about seven bucks to his name (now his company’s moniker). He made a little money when in desperation he took the pro wrestling route like his father and grandfather, and only began making real money when he honed his cocky hero persona The Rock. He then worked hard to learn acting, and now, is there a bigger star in Hollywood right now not named Leo? I can’t think of one.\n\nBART: It is nice things are going so well for The Rock, but I’ve learned that is the time you have to be careful. That shrewd old producer Ray Stark once chastised me for wearing a “worried look,” saying “the only time you should look worried is when things are going great.” News events this week reminded me of his admonition. Everything has been going perfectly for Disney of late, so why should Bob Iger be worried? Whoops! Alice Through the Looking Glass is a mega flop. On the ESPN front, Wall Street skeptics keep sending up warning flags. And then there’s China: With Iger’s $5.5 billion Shanghai theme park only days from opening, the chairman of China’s biggest conglomerate publicly predicted it will be a failure and promises to make that happen. In a pugnacious, Trump-like move, the chief of Dalian Wanda Group last week opened a rival theme park and hired actors dressed as Captain America, Snow White and other Disney characters to attend the event. To Wang Jianlin, the Wanda CEO, Iger’s venture will be defeated by Wang’s 15 new parks offering lower prices and “constant innovation.” Note: Iger still doesn’t look worried.\n\nFLEMING: Unless it’s the ongoing Viacom situation, where your CEO gets a massive raise as stock value plummets, I’m not sure you can panic over any of the things you just cited. On Alice Through The Looking Glass, you have to try a sequel, even if Tim Burton doesn’t want to come back. Of all the films that cracked $1 billion in global box office like Alice In Wonderland did, only Titanic didn’t go the sequel route and that was only because the ship went down. You launch these things to make sequels and you keep making them until the audience tells you you’ve worn out your welcome. That happened here and likely with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2. The real concern here is Johnny Depp, whose personal issue headlines certainly didn’t help. Considering he’s starring in Universal’s classic movie monster film The Invisible Man, you hope that Depp can pull his personal stuff together and stay out of the tabloids if he expects studios to feel comfortable building global franchises around him, like the next Pirates Of The Caribbean film Disney has coming. As for Disney’s China theme park, it seems a good long-term bet. A rival ripping off some costumed characters and parading them around a China theme park sounds as unimpressive as those costumed Elmos and superheroes hustling tourists on Broadway. I’ve never been in a Disney park that wasn’t top quality. That always wins, even if it takes time.\n\nBART: In the same vein, one executive who on the surface would have little to worry about lost his gig last week. Steve Mosko, the boss of hugely profitable Sony Television, had been at Sony for 24 years. He was perfect casting for his job, possessing the swagger, the charm and the growly voice to dominate whichever meeting he descended upon. Some suggest tensions between Mosko and his boss, Michael Lynton, were exacerbated by the famously leaked emails of a year ago. In any case, since Mosko seemed to have no reason to worry about his job, Ray Stark would have told him to start worrying. For that matter, another Sony executive, Doug Belgrad, the film president, also found himself out of a job this week at a moment when his services would seem most valued. Sony’s new slate of films representing the Tom Rothman era are about to roll out but there have been no casualties as yet. Surely this is the time when Sony most needs its executive staff, so why worry? Unless the ghost of Ray Stark hovers over you.\n\nFLEMING: Belgrad’s transition out of the executive suite to raise money for a Sony-based production company had been coming for months, even though neither the studio nor Belgrad would admit it. The fact Rothman tapped Sanford Panitch so quickly showed none of this was sudden. Panitch left Fox last year to rejoin Rothman and make local-language films for Sony. His international acumen shows me that Rothman is serious in building slates designed to play around the world, compatible to his overhaul effort to make Sony’s global distribution operations more like the one he helped architect at Fox. You knew there was a personality clash between Lynton and Mosko, when the studio didn’t quickly sign him to a new deal even though he was the biggest driver of profits and revenues for years and years at that place. Mosko’s level of consistency was such that people at the studio were freaked when he exited. He leaves big shoes to fill, and he is the type of guy who inspired loyalty, and if he set up shop elsewhere quickly, he could well bring most of his team with him. That could cause Sony grief down the line.\n\nBART: The ghost of Stark was omnipresent this week. Bela Bajaria abruptly exited her presidency of Universal Television. And hundreds of employees at 21st Century Fox accepted buyouts as part of that cost-saving campaign, one of them being head of consumer products Jeffrey Godsick, and Fox Searchlight production head Claudia Lewis. This was definitely a good week to be on vacation. By the way, the one time Stark actually told me to worry was when I was a young executive at Paramount and the studio’s slate of films were all blazing successes. Stark not only told me to start worrying, he even offered me a very good job. Alas, I turned it down. Because working for Stark was always a worry. Next topic. Talking to distributors, I detect a growing concern about Sequel Sag. And that doesn’t bode well for the already controversial Ghostbusters. Thus far Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 has under-performed, as has X-Men: Apocalypse and Neighbors 2, not to mention Zoolander 2 in February. Then there’s the biggest summer write-off, Alice Through The Looking Glass. So that raises a disturbing question: Does Marvel alone hold the key to the sequels business – Captain America: Civil War? And what will that mean for the strategy of the majors?\n\nFLEMING: Not every sequel is going to work. I thought the Ghostbusters trailers were funny, and see no reason why that film won’t draw audiences. The preoccupation over gender is becoming a distressing distraction. Who cares, ultimately? If it’s funny and proves chauvinistic skeptics wrong, it will be a hit and hatch a sequel. X-Men: Apocalypse has so far grossed more than $400 million globally, which isn’t Deadpool, but enough to keep the gears oiled as future installments of Wolverine and Gambit are readied. You mentioned Captain America: Civil War, and there is your answer. Sequels give you brand identity, but Civil War wasn’t just spectacle, it was good storytelling. That is your real protection. Too many sequels are lazy carbon copies. That was why the off-the-wall X-Men spinoff Deadpool became the biggest R-rated film ever, and why I’m excited about a sequel to Sicario, which just got Italian Gomorra miniseries helmer Stefano Sollima to direct a Taylor Sheridan script that plays up Benicio Del Toro’s Man On Fire-style antihero, with Josh Brolin also back. They battle the Mexican cartels, but it’s about the tunnels and possible importing of terrorists. There’s a chance this might be better than the first one. It’s a movie I sure want to see.",

Along the same lines, old words can be driven to extinction when cultural and technological factors limit the use of a word, in analogy to the environmental factors that can change the survival capacity of a living species by altering its ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nWe define the birth year y 0,i as the year t corresponding to the first instance of , where is median word use of a given word over its recorded lifetime in the Google database. Similarly, we define the death year y f,i as the last year t during which the word use satisfies . We use the relative word use threshold in order to avoid anomalies arising from extreme fluctuations in f i (t) over the lifetime of the word. The results obtained using threshold did not show a significant qualitative difference.\n\nThe significance of word births Δ b (t) and word deaths Δ d (t) for each year t is related to the vocabulary size N w (t) of a given language. We define the birth rate γ b and death rate γ d by normalizing the number of births Δ b (t) and deaths Δ d (t) in a given year t to the total number of distinct words N w (t) recorded in the same year t, so that This definition yields a proxy for the rate of emergence and disappearance of words. We restrict our analysis to words with birth-death duration y f,i − y 0,i + 1 ≥ 2 years and to words with first recorded use t 0,i ≥ 1700, which selects for relatively new words in the history of a language.\n\nThe γ b (t) and γ d (t) time series plotted in Fig. 2 for the 200-year period 1800–2000 show trends that intensifies after the 1950s. The modern era of publishing, which is characterized by more strict editing procedures at publishing houses, computerized word editing and automatic spell-checking technology, shows a drastic increase in the death rate of words. Using visual inspection we verify most changes to the vocabulary in the last 10–20 years are due to the extinction of misspelled words and nonsensical print errors, and to the decreased birth rate of new misspelled variations and genuinely new words. This phenomenon reflects the decreasing marginal need for new words, consistent with the sub-linear Heaps' law observed for all Google 1-gram corpora in24. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows that γ b (t) is largely comprised of words with relatively large f while γ d (t) is almost entirely comprised of words with relatively small f (see also Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information (SI) text). Thus, the new words of tomorrow are likely be core words that are widely used.\n\nFigure 2: Dramatic shift in the birth rate and death rate of words. The word birth rate γ b (t) and the word death rate γ d (t) show marked underlying changes in word use competition which affects the entry rate and the sustainability of existing words. The modern print era shows a marked increase in the death rate of words which likely correspond to low fitness, misspelled and (technologically) outdated words. A simultaneous decrease in the birth rate of new words is consistent with the decreasing marginal need for new words indicated by the sub-linear allometric scaling between vocabulary size and total corpus size (Heaps' law)24. Interestingly, we quantitatively observe the impact of the Balfour Declaration in 1917, the circumstances surrounding which effectively rejuvenated Hebrew as a national language, resulting in a 5-fold increase in the birth rate of words in the Hebrew corpus. Full size image\n\nFigure 3: Survival of the fittest in the entry process of words. Trends in the relative uses of words that either were born or died in a given year show that the entry-exit forces largely depend on the relative use of the word. For the English corpus, we calculate the average of the median lifetime relative use, 〈Med(f i )〉, for all words born in year t (top panel) and for all words that died in year t (bottom panel), which shows a 5-year moving average (dashed black line). There is a dramatic increase in the relative use (“utility”) of newborn words over the last 20–30 years, likely corresponding to new technical terms, which are necessary for the communication of core modern technology and ideas. Conversely, with higher editorial standards and the recent use of word processors which include spelling standardization technology, the words that are dying are those words with low relative use. We confirm by visual inspection that the lists of dying words contain mostly misspelled and nonsensical words. Full size image\n\nWe note that the main source of error in the calculation of birth and death rates are OCR (optical character recognition) errors in the digitization process, which could be responsible for a significant fraction of misspelled and nonsensical words existing in the data. An additional source of error is the variety of orthographic properties of language that can make very subtle variations of words, for example through the use of hyphens and capitalization, appear as distinct words when applying OCR. The digitization of many books in the computer era does not require OCR transfer, since the manuscripts are themselves digital, and so there may be a bias resulting from this recent paradigm shift. We confirm that the statistical patterns found using post 2000- data are consistent with the patterns that extend back several hundred years24.\n\nComplementary to the death of old words is the birth of new words, which are commonly associated with new social and technological trends. Topical words in media can display long-term persistence patterns analogous to earthquake shocks25,26, and can result in a new word having larger fitness than related “out-of-date” words (e.g. blog vs. log, email vs. memo). Here we show that a comparison of the growth dynamics between different languages can also illustrate the local cultural factors that influence different regions of the world. Fig. 4 shows how international crisis can lead to globalization of language through common media attention and increased lexical diffusion. Notably, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a), we find that international conflict only perturbed the participating languages, while minimally affecting the languages of the nonparticipating regions, e.g. the Spanish speaking countries during WWII.\n\nFigure 4: The significance of historical events on the evolution of language. The standard deviation σ(t) of growth rates demonstrates the sensitivity of language to international events (e.g. World War II). For all languages there is an overall decreasing trend in σ(t) over the period 1850–2000. However, the increase in σ(t) during WWII represents a“globalization” effect, whereby societies are brought together by a common event and a unified media. Such contact between relatively isolated systems necessarily leads to information flow, much as in the case of thermodynamic heat flow between two systems, initially at different temperatures, which are then brought into contact. (a) σ(t) calculated for the relatively new words with T i ≥ 100 years. The Spanish corpus does not show an increase in σ(t) during World War II, indicative of the relative isolation of South America and Spain from the European conflict. (b) σ(t) for 4 sets of relatively new words that meet the criteria T i ≥ T c and t i ,0 ≥ 1800. The oldest “new” words (T c = 200) demonstrate the most significant increase in σ(t) during World War II, with a peak around 1945. (c) The standard deviation σ(t) for the most common words is decreasing with time, suggesting that they have saturated and are being “crowded out” by new competitors. This set of words meets the criterion that the average relative use exceeds a threshold, 〈f i 〉 ≥ f c , which we define for each corpus. (d) We compare the variation σ(t) for relatively new English words, using T i ≥ 100, with the 20-year moving average over the time period 1820–1988. The deviations show that σ(t) increases abruptly during times of conflict, such as the American CivilWar (1861–1865), World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945), and also during the 1980s and 1990s, possibly as a result of new digital media (e.g. the internet) which offer new environments for the evolutionary dynamics of word use. D(t) is the difference between the moving average and σ(t). Full size image\n\nThe lifetime trajectory of words\n\nBetween birth and death, one contends with the interesting question of how the use of words evolve when they are “alive.” We focus our efforts toward quantifying the relative change in word use over time, both over the word lifetime and throughout the course of history. In order to analyze separately these two time frames, we select two sets of words: (i) relatively new words with “birth year” t 0,i later than 1800, so that the relative age τ ≡ t − t 0,i of word i is the number of years after the word's first occurrence in the database, and (ii) relatively common words, typically with t 0,i < 1800.\n\nWe analyze dataset (i) words (summary statistics in Table S1) so that we can control for properties of the growth dynamics that are related to the various stages of a word's life trajectory (e.g. an “infant” phase, an “adolescent” phase, and a “mature” phase). For comparison with the young words, we also analyze the growth rates of dataset (ii) words in the next section (summary statistics in Table S2). These words are presumably old enough that they are in a stable mature phase. We select dataset (ii) words using the criterion 〈f i 〉 ≥ f c , where is the average relative use of the word i over the word's lifetime T i = t 0,f − t 0,i + 1, and f c is a cutoff threshold derived form the Zipf rank-frequency distribution1 calculated for each corpus24. In Table S3 we summarize the entire data for the 209-year period 1800–2008 for each of the four Google language sets analyzed.\n\nModern words typically are born in relation to technological or cultural events, e.g. “Antibiotics.” We ask if there exists a characteristic time for a word's general acceptance. In order to search for patterns in the growth rates as a function of relative word age, for each new word i at its age τ , we analyze the “use trajectory” f i (τ) and the “growth rate trajectory” r i (τ). So that we may combine the individual trajectories of words of varying prevalence, we normalize each f i (τ) by its average 〈f i 〉, obtaining a normalized use trajectory . We perform an analogous normalization procedure for each r i (τ), normalizing instead by the growth rate standard deviation σ[r i ], so that (see the Methods section for further detailed description).\n\nSince some words will die and other words will increase in use as a result of the standardization of language, we hypothesize that the average growth rate trajectory will show large fluctuations around the time scale for the transition of a word into regular use. In order to quantify this transition time scale, we create a subset {i |T c } of word trajectories i by combining words that meets an age criteria T i ≥ T c . Thus, T c is a threshold to distinguish words that were born in different historical eras and which have varying longevity. For the values T c = 25, 50, 100, and 200 years, we select all words that have a lifetime longer than T c and calculate the average and standard deviation for each set of growth rate trajectories as a function of word age τ.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot for the English corpus, which shows a broad peak around τ c ≈ 30–50 years for each T c subset before the fluctuations saturate after the word enters a stable growth phase. A similar peak is observed for each corpus analyzed (Figs. S4–S7). This single-peak growth trajectory is consistent with theoretical models for logistic spreading and the fixation of words in a population of learners27. Also, since we weight the average according to 〈f i 〉, the time scale τ c is likely associated with the characteristic time for a new word to reach sufficiently wide acceptance that the word is included in a typical dictionary. We note that this time scale is close to the generational time scale for humans, corroborating evidence that languages require only one generation to drastically evolve27.\n\nFigure 5: Quantifying the tipping point for word use. (a) The maximum in the standard deviation σ of growth rates during the “adolescent” period τ ≈ 30–50 indicates the characteristic time scale for words being incorporated into the standard lexicon, i.e. inclusion in popular dictionaries. In Fig. S4 we plot the average growth rate trajectory 〈r′(τ|T c )〉 which shows relatively large positive growth rates during approximately the same 20-year period. (b) The first passage time τ 1 53 is defined as the number years for the relative use of a new word i to exceed a given f-value for the first time, f i (τ 1 ) ≥ f. For relatively new words with T i ≥ 100 years we calculate the average first-passage time 〈τ 1 (f)〉 for a large range of f. We estimate for each language the f c representing the threshold for a word belonging to the standard “kernel” lexicon4. This method demonstrates that the English corpus threshold f c ≡ 5 × 10–8 maps to the first passage time corresponding to the peak period τ ≈ 30 – 50 years in σ(τ) shown in panel (a). Full size image\n\nEmpirical laws quantifying the growth rate distribution\n\nHow much do the growth rates vary from word to word? The answer to this question can help distinguish between candidate models for the evolution of word utility. Hence, we calculate the probability density function (pdf) of . Using this quantity accounts for the fact that we are aggregating growth rates of words of varying ages. The empirical pdf P(R) shown in Fig. 6 is leptokurtic and remarkably symmetric around R ≈ 0. These empirical facts are also observed in studies of the growth rates of economic institutions28,29,30,31. Since the R values are normalized and detrended according to the age-dependent standard deviation σ[r′(τ|T c )], the standard deviation is σ(R) = 1 by construction.\n\nFigure 6: Common leptokurtic growth distribution for new words and common words. (a) Independent of language, the growth rates of relatively new words are distributed according to the Laplace distribution centered around R ≈ 0 defined in Eq. (4). The the growth rate R defined in Eq. (11) is measured in units of standard deviation, and accounts for age-dependent and word-dependent factors. Yet, even with these normalizations, we still observe an excess number of |R| ≥ 3σ events. This fact is demonstrated by the leptokurtic form of each P(R), which exhibit the excess tail frequencies when compared with a unit-variance Gaussian distribution (dashed blue curve). The Gaussian distribution is the predicted distribution for the Gibrat proportional growth model, which is a candidate neutral null-model for the growth dynamics of word use29. The prevalence of large growth rates illustrate the possibility that words can have large variations in use even over the course of a year. The growth variations are intrinsically related to the dynamics of everyday life and reflect the cultural and technological shocks in society. We analyze word use data over the time period 1800–2008 for new words i with lifetimes T i ≥ T c , where we show data calculated for T c = 100 years. (b) PDF P(r′) of the annual relative growth rate r′ for all words which satisfy 〈f i 〉 ≥ f c (dataset #ii words which are relatively common words). In order to select relatively frequently used words, we use the following criteria: T i ≥ 10 years, 1800 ≤ t ≤ 2008, and 〈f i 〉 ≥ f c . The growth rate r′ does not account for age-dependent factors since the common words are likely in the mature phase of their lifetime trajectory. In each panel, we plot a Laplace distribution with unit variance (solid black lines) and the Gaussian distribution with unit variance (dashed blue curve) for reference. Full size image\n\nA candidate model for the growth rates of word use is the Gibrat proportional growth process29,30, which predicts a Gaussian distribution for P(R). However, we observe the “tent-shaped” pdf P(R) which is well-approximated by a Laplace (double-exponential) distribution, defined as Here the average growth rate 〈R〉 has two properties: (a) 〈R〉 ≈ 0 and (b) 〈R〉 ≪ σ(R). Property (a) arises from the fact that the growth rate of distinct words is quite small on the annual basis (the growth rate of books in the Google English database is γ w ≈ 0.01124) and property (b) arises from the fact that R is defined in units of standard deviation. Being leptokurtic, the Laplace distribution predicts an excess number of events > 3σ as compared to the Gaussian distribution. For example, comparing the likelihood of events above the 3σ event threshold, the Laplace distribution displays a five-fold excess in the probability P(|R − 〈R〉| > 3σ), where for the Laplace distribution, whereas for the Gaussian distribution. The large R values correspond to periods of rapid growth and decline in the use of words during the crucial “infant” and “adolescent” lifetime phases. In Fig. 6(b) we also show that the growth rate distribution P(r′) for the relatively common words comprising dataset (ii) is also well-described by the Laplace distribution.\n\nFor hierarchical systems consisting of units each with complex internal structure32 (e.g. a given country consists of industries, each of which consists of companies, each of which consists of internal subunits), a non-trivial scaling relation between the standard deviation of growth rates σ(r|S) and the system size S has the form The theoretical prediction in32,33 that β ∈ [0, 1/2] has been verified for several economic systems, with empirical β values typically in the range 0.1 < β < 0.333.\n\nSince different words have varying lifetime trajectories as well as varying relative utilities, we now quantify how the standard deviation σ(r|S i ) of growth rates r depends on the cumulative word frequency of each word. We choose this definition for proxy of “word size” since a writer can learn and recall a given word through any of its historical uses. Hence, S i is also proportional to the number of books in which word i appears. This is significantly different than the assumptions of replication null models (e.g. the Moran process) which use the concurrent frequency f i (t) as the sole factor determining the likelihood of future replication10,18.\n\nWe estimate Eq. (5) by grouping words according to S i and then calculating the growth rate standard deviation σ(r|S i ) for each group. Fig. 7(b) shows scaling behavior consistent with Eq. (5) for large S i , with β ≈ 0.10 – 0.21 depending on the corpus. A positive β value means that words with larger cumulative word frequency have smaller annual growth rate fluctuations. We conjecture that this statistical pattern emerges from the hierarchical organization of written language12,13,14,15,16 and the social properties of the speakers who use the words8,17,34. As such, we calculate β values that are consistent with nontrivial correlations in word use, likely related to the basic fact that books are topical3 and that book topics are correlated with cultural trends.\n\nFigure 7: Scaling in the growth rate fluctuations of words. We show the dependence of growth rates on the cumulative word frequency using words satisfy the criteria T i ≥ 10 years. We verify similar results for threshold values T c = 50, 100, and 200 years. (a) Average growth rate 〈r〉 saturates at relatively constant values for large S. (b) Scaling in the standard deviation of growth rates σ(r|S) ∼ S–β for words with large S. This scaling relation is also observed for the growth rates of large economic institutions, ranging in size from companies to entire countries31,33. Here this size-variance relation corresponds to scaling exponent values 0.10 < β < 0.21, which are related to the non-trivial bursting patterns and non-trivial correlation patterns in literature topicality as indicated by the quantitative relation to the Hurst exponent, H = 1 – β shown in35. We calculate β Eng. ≈ 0.16 ± 0.01, β Eng.fict ≈ 0.21 ± 0.01, β Spa. ≈ 0.10 ± 0.01 and β Heb. ≈ 0.17 ± 0.01. Full size image\n\nQuantifying the long-term cultural memory\n\nRecent theoretical work35 shows that there is a fundamental relation between the size-variance exponent β and the Hurst exponent H quantifying the auto-correlations in a stochastic time series. The novel relation H = 1 − β indicates that the temporal long-term persistence is intrinsically related to the capability of the underlying mechanism to absorb stochastic shocks. Hence, positive correlations (H > 1/2) are predicted for non-trivial β values (i.e. 0 ≤ β ≤ 0.5). Note that the Gibrat proportional growth model predicts β = 0 and that a Yule-Simon urn model predicts β = 0.533. Thus, f i (τ) belonging to words with large S i are predicted to show significant positive correlations, H i > 1/2.",

  "latent_17546": "This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nAmid a global conversation about sexual assault, a group of men complaining about their \"involuntary celibacy\" have lost their central platform.\n\nIn the r/incels subreddit, young men wrote about how they couldn’t find women to have sex with. The subreddit, which had 40,000 users a week ago, was a casually misogynist forum that compared women to Nazis and so-called Incels to Jews, posited that rape is “just sex” and argued that we need to include “reverse rape”—not having sex with someone—in the #MeToo conversation.\n\nShortly after a young man turned to the forum to talk about his roommate, who he called “suicide fuel,” the sub was banned for its violent content. The user said it was painful to see his roommate, a “better human being,” have a girlfriend and talk about his close-knit family. Other members jumped in to offer advice to this man about his attractive roommate, a so-called Chad in incel speak. They encouraged and instructed the poster to castrate his roommate.\n\nLike other anti-women subreddits, r/incels has been catching heat for a while. It even spawned its own watchdog community r/inceltears, which remains to chronicle incel extremism. Reddit has not said what the exact comment was that led to their banning the subreddit for inciting violence.\n\n\"Communities focused on this content and users who post such content will be banned from the site,” their statement said. “As of November 7, r/Incels has been banned for violating this policy.”\n\nImage via r/incels\n\nReddit recently announced that it plan to retool its policy regarding violent content on the heels of an additional $200 million in venture capital funding. It began by cracking down on Nazi and white supremacist subreddits including r/Nazi, r/DylannRoofInnocent, and r/farright. However, many misogynist subreddits, like r/MensRights, are still thriving.\n\nThis isn’t Reddit’s first attempt to clean house: Its first round started after CEO Yishan Wong’s resignation in 2014 after a flurry caused by a Gawker expose on a Redditor heavily involved in subreddits like r/jailbait and r/creepshots. Interim CEO Ellen Pao, famous for suing Kleiner Perkins for sexism, instigated the first major cleanup, to user revolt: Many Redditors didn’t want to give up any subreddits, including those devoted to hating fat people or leaking celebrity nudes. Pao, squarely vilified during her tenure, did not last the full year as interim, leaving after eight months. (Pao later went on to describe how exclusion is entrenched in tech.)\n\nThe glue of communities like r/incels is obvious: Men feel held back by the women who “have it easy.” And as with most online communities open to anyone with Internet connectivity, indoctrination is easy for an outsider to spot. (Though under special circumstances, open subreddits go underground: r/incels went private recently after a member posed as a woman in r/legaladvice for tips on getting away with rape.)\n\nIf cults have taught us anything, it’s that the first rule of indoctrination is you try to get them while they’re young. Most Redditors are young men, and Reddit offers them unfettered ability to form and engage with “misogyny clusters”—anti-women communities that share DNA, but have distinct personalities and creeds. R/incels is a cousin of many other misogyny clusters on Reddit, including r/MensRights, r/MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way—those who opt out of the “mating dance”), and r/TheRedPill.\n\nImage via r/IncelTears\n\nIdeology functions by creating a monolithic enemy: In the case of misogyny clusters, the enemy is the woman. Women can’t be incels—they are reduced to “femoids,” or “robot-like androids who only crave sex with Chads.” The enemy is often described as feminism itself, which these clusters view as a “doctrine of class, hatred, and violence”—that is to say, women use feminism to play victim and extort economic gain.\n\nLanguage is another aspect of indoctrination. To that end, these misogyny clusters have created glossaries for their acronyms, offer cheat sheets, and have their own language patterns. The jargon of misogyny includes “hamster” (a “female” who jumps through mental hoops to avoid cognitive dissonance), \"AWALT\" (all women are like that), “roastie” (a repulsive word comparing roast beef to female genitalia), “pussy pass” (women are let off for illegal behavior), alpha/beta distinctions in attractiveness, and so on. The indoctrination is further enforced by the positive reinforcement and punishment of up-votes and down-votes.\n\nImage via r/incels\n\nObviously, the real issue with ideology is that it’s not all talk, and it doesn’t stay behind a computer screen, like mass shooter Elliot Rodger who killed six people and identified as an incel in his notorious manifesto. The link between violence and misogyny is strong—mass shooters tend to be young white men who have a track record of sexual violence and entitlement. The Virginia Tech shooter harassed women on campus. Adam Lanza, who wrote about why women were “inherently selfish,” killed his mother before he murdered children in Sandy Hook. The Texas church shooter was dishonorably discharged from the military for severely abusing his wife and son. In general, 40 percent of women murdered were killed by their partners. When people jump to blame mental illness instead of misogyny for this demonstrable pattern, they underestimate and undercut the violence of misogyny and undermine the safety of women. There is no diagnosis that all mass shooters share. Sexual entitlement is not in the DSM—but it’s chock full of unchecked online communities.\n\nThe radicalization of young men online is something that can be reduced: By pushing these clusters deeper into the web, they’re less accessible and harder to stumble upon. Similarly, radicalization can be reversed by breaking those silos—one Redditor claims that reading different perspectives in the watchdog/parody community r/inceltears made him stop “prescribing [himself] to such horseshit.” Reddit, as it implements new content policies, needs to do more than just crack down on objectionable content—it needs to find a way to de-radicalize the young men it’s responsible for.\n\nFollow Aditi Natasha Kini on Twitter.",

  "latent_17848": "All sorts of counterintuitive behavior happens with regularity in the quantum realm, but very little of that bleeds over into the world of classical mechanics that the human senses occupy. We can register the effects of the quantum behavior of electrons and atoms, but the actual objects that undergo tunneling and entanglement are invisible to the naked eye. In the last couple of years, however, researchers have started working with mechanical oscillators that can display quantum behavior in some circumstances. A paper that will be released by Nature now provides pretty unambiguous evidence for quantum interactions between a standard qubit and a piezoelectric device that's roughly 50µm long—large enough to be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis isn't the first paper to describe quantum behavior in a mechanical device, but it seems to be one of the cleanest. For the most part, the work has focused on microscopic levers, where the vibrational modes can be characterized in terms of a quantum mechanical unit called a phonon. The number of modes accessible increases rapidly as temperature goes up, which is why vibrations never appear to be quantum mechanical in our day-to-day experience.\n\nTo study a system like this at the quantum level, you need to ensure that very few of these vibrational modes are accessible—ideally, you want to be able to bring the system to its ground state, and excite it with the lowest-energy phonon possible. Unfortunately, the ground state temperature is related to the vibrational frequency. To reach it, you either need to reach temperatures below those possible with current refrigeration methods, or have something that can vibrate incredibly quickly.\n\nInstead of opting for the reinvention of refrigeration technology, the authors of the new paper, based at the University of Santa Barbara, chose the alternative: they designed a mechanical device that oscillates at a frequency of roughly 6GHz. The device involves a pair of aluminum electrodes that sandwich a layer of aluminum nitride, which is a strong piezoelectric material (it can convert physical strain to current and vice versa). The oscillator can be pushed out of its ground state either by adding current or by absorbing microwaves of the appropriate frequency. All together, the device is over 50µm, which the authors state is visible to the naked eye.\n\nWhen chilled down to its ground state at 25 milliKelvin, the piezoelectric device can start oscillating when it receives energy via either microwaves or current. The challenge then was determining that these oscillations reflected the presence of phonons.\n\nThe layout of the device, with the Josephson flux qubit on top, the piezoelectric oscillator at bottom, and a capacitor linking the two (middle).\n\nImage Courtesy of Andrew Cleland\n\nTo perform that test, the authors linked the oscillator to a standard quantum electrical circuit called a Josephson phase qubit, which contains (surprise!) a Josephson junction—two superconducting layers that flank a thin layer of non-superconducting material. The Josephson junction, when linked with a capacitor and inductor, can form a qubit, and store quantum information via a ground and excited state. The frequency of transitions between these states is adjustable, and covers the range between five and 10GHz, which nicely overlaps the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric oscillator. This frequency is adjustable on the fly, meaning the authors could switch the interactions between the two devices on and off at will.\n\nThe experimental device linked the two systems through a capacitor. When the two were linked, the authors could demonstrate that the behavior of the Josephson qubit was strongly sensitive to the microwave resonant frequency of the oscillator—in fact, as shown at top, their measurements were an almost perfect match for the predictions. In short, the classical mechanical resonance was creating a feature that could be detected with a quantum device.\n\nThe authors were able to demonstrate that the average time before a quantum of energy was lost was in the neighborhood of 17 nanoseconds. Fortunately, the typical energy exchange between the two systems only took about four nanoseconds, so they were able to excite the Josephson qubit and watch the excited state hop to the oscillator (where it appeared as a phonon) and back several times. Again, the observed behavior was an excellent match to the calculated predictions.\n\nFor those who got lost in the details, the short version: the device can convert a quantum state to mechanical oscillations and back. And (in the grand scheme of things), it's big.\n\nThe short, 17ns period before the energy is lost from the system means that there's not enough time for a careful study of the entanglement between the two systems. The qubits are normally stable for 500ns, though, which leads the authors to suggest that the energy is lost through the aluminum nitride layer. That gives them an obvious next step, namely getting the system to survive long enough for some detailed studies.\n\nAn accompanying News & Views article by Markus Aspelmeyer also suggests that it might be possible to use the principles behind this device to either bring the frequencies needed down, or to increase the physical motion involved in the mechanical resonator. If we can manage both, Aspelmeyer suggests, then it might be possible to determine whether a quantum state could actually involve having a physical device appear in two places at once.\n\nAspelmeyer's article is also worth reading because he describes how the physics community first became aware of the potential for this work: Andrew Cleland, the last author of the paper, dropped it into the last slide of a talk he gave last July. There was apparently dead silence as the implications sunk in, and then a round of roaring applause from the audience.\n\nNature, 2010. DOI: 10.1038/nature08967\n\nNature, 2010.

  "latent_18024": "December 23, 2014\n\nBy Bruce Anderson & David Coletto\n\nThe year 2014 ends with a tightly competitive race between the federal Liberals and the Conservative Party of Canada. The two parties are within a point of each other, (CPC 34%; LPC 33%).\n\nThe trend lines we see over the period since March should provide some seasonal cheer for Conservatives, who have gained six points over the last ten months. Liberal and NDP support is roughly the same in December as it was in March of this year.\n\nStrengthening Conservative support is a steady improvement in the view that the country is heading in the “right direction” from 39% in March to 50% in December (we ask this question at the beginning of the survey before any political questions).\n\nThere has also been a gradual improvement in public feelings towards Stephen Harper. In March 28% had a positive feeling about the PM, while 46% had a negative feeling. Today, 34% are positive and 38% negative, a sizeable shift.\n\nThomas Mulcair ends the year with 28% positive and 20% negative opinion. Justin Trudeau ends the year with the best personal ratings, (35% positive/29% negative), slightly better than in March. Since September there has been a drop in positive impressions and a growth in neutral opinions towards the Liberal leader.\n\nOur latest poll also shows that voters are becoming more inclined to think the Conservatives might win the next election. While 34% predict a Liberal victory, 39% thought this in August. Belief that the Conservatives will win has risen from 25% to 30% during the same period of time. A small (6%) and consistent number of people believe the NDP is likely to win.\n\nRegional Findings\n\nIn Atlantic Canada we see a strong lead for the Liberals, who have 41% compared to 29% for the NDP and 24% for the Conservatives.\n\nIn Quebec our data shows the Liberals ahead with 35%, compared to 28% for the NDP, 19% for the BQ and 14% for the Conservatives.\n\nIn Ontario the new data show the Conservatives ahead with 40%, followed by the Liberals at 32%, and the NDP at 20%.\n\nAcross Saskatchewan and Manitoba we see the Conservatives with 49%, followed by the Liberals at 28% and the NDP at 17%.\n\nIn Alberta, the Conservatives show 46%, followed by the Liberals at 27% and the NDP at 21%.\n\nIn BC, the Conservatives have 36% in this latest poll, followed by the Liberals at 33% and the NDP at 21%.\n\nLooking at the perceptions of Stephen Harper, we note that improvements have been seen in all three provinces with the largest numbers of seats: Quebec, Ontario and BC.\n\nBruce Anderson, Chairman of Abacus Data:\n\n2015 promises to be one of the most interesting years in Canadian politics in a long time, and this year-end data confirms that the Conservatives have become more competitive in recent months.\n\nOur data earlier in the year suggested that for many uncommitted voters the challenge for the Conservatives was in significant measure about tone and style. To my eyes the improving Conservative standing is likely attributable to a combination of factors, including:\n\n• For most people (70%), the economy seems relatively healthy.\n\n• The federal budget is all but balanced once again and the tax cuts and benefit measures announced by the Conservatives will appeal to a fair number of voters.\n\n• The PM and some of his most prominent spokespeople had been seen as preoccupied with narrow partisan interests. Of late, the PM has been more visible on broader, global matters and has a less partisan tone when he intervenes on day-to-day domestic questions. As well, the latter part of 2014 has seen less prominence for some of the most aggressive partisans on the Conservative side of the aisle.\n\n• The government has taken a less strident tone on the intersection of energy and environmental issues compared to the earlier in the mandate.\n\nThese numbers bear signals for Mr. Harper’s opponents as well. For Mr. Trudeau, they are a reminder that while he has a real chance of winning the next election, Mr. Harper is determined and likely to be a very competitive rival.\n\nFor Mr. Mulcair, the numbers signal an ongoing challenge in terms of being seen as the most logical alternative for those voters who want a change in government. As such, the NDP leader can ill afford to focus on only beating the Conservatives; he must also worry about not losing support to the Liberals.\n\nMethodology\n\nOur survey was conducted online with 1,438 Canadians aged 18 and over from December 18 to 20, 2014. A random sample of panelists was invited to complete the survey from a large representative panel of Canadians, recruited and managed by Research Now, one of the world’s leading provider of online research samples.\n\nThe Marketing Research and Intelligence Association policy limits statements about margins of sampling error for most online surveys. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of the same size is +/- 2.6%, 19 times out of 20. The data were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada’s population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region. Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding.\n\nWe offer global research capacity with a strong focus on customer service, attention to detail and value added insight.

  "latent_18217": "Microsoft is going into the weekend with a massive update for those on the Fast Ring for the Windows Insider program. Build 14328 is going out for PC and Mobile users, but it is those on the desktops, tablets and especially Surface type devices which will reap the most benefits. Microsoft just announced the update, and they stress that that this update has a lot of new code in it making it \"rough around the edges.\" That tradeoff, however, is met with what is arguably the largest changelog yet from the software maker! For Surface and devices with active pen support, you will also appreciate the first instance of Windows Ink in this build! Let's get to it! Anything new for Mobile? Before we begin, let's talk about the Mobile update. Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile build 14327 just two days ago and with 14328 being so close you can surmise that there are not too many new features with this build. Indeed, we are likely getting some bug fixes and improvements, but many of those new features for Cortana and PC syncing should now work with build 14328 on your computer. The headline features Microsoft's changelog for this latest Insider update is nearly 13 pages in length, but here are the highlights of what is new and what to look forward to with the release: Windows Ink\n\nUpdated Start experience\n\nCortana and Search improvements such as Cortana on your Lock Screen\n\nImprovements to Action Center and Notifications\n\nUpdates to the Taskbar and Settings app\n\nAbility to switch virtual desktops with your touchpad\n\nLock Screen improvements\n\nUpdated credential and UAC dialog user interface, Skype UWP Preview app, and File Explorer\n\nImproved battery life for Surface and other connected standby PCs\n\nImproved Japanese IME As you can see, Microsoft is unleashing a beast with this update as it brings many of the features announced at Build that is destined for the Anniversary Update due later this summer. There is a bit for everyone here so let's go a bit deeper. Windows Ink\n\nWith this update and a Surface or pen-enabled Windows 10 PC users can try out the all new Windows Ink experience. If you recall, Windows Ink was announced at Build and brings the power of the pen to all of Windows 10 including making sticky notes, whiteboard and general drawing throughout the OS. Developers will also now be able to use enable Ink writing tools within their app for users who would like a pen-first experience. Windows Ink is also built into Maps, Microsoft Edge, and Office. If you have a device with an active pen e.g. Surface Pro 4 you can now access the Windows Ink Workspace button found in the taskbar in apps that support Windows Ink. New Start Menu\n\nWith build 14238 for PC users can try out the updated Start menu that makes some subtle but worthy looking changes, including: Merging of most used apps list and All apps into one\n\nPower, Settings, and File Explorer are all now in the left rail so that they are always visible\n\nRecently added goes from one listing to three entries\n\nAdditional folders added e.g. Documents or Pictures are now always visible instead of hidden beneath the hamburger menu Tablet mode changes – Auto-hide is back!\n\nAlso under the new Start settings is the return of the grid experience for app listings in the Start menu when in tablet mode. This grid is an older feature that was never present in Windows 10 and returns from the Windows 8 days, but with some small changes to match the new UI. The feature is accessed by toggling all apps in the left rail of the Start Menu, and it now matches the UI throughout Windows. There is also now a auto-hide taskbar feature in tablet mode, which is something that many users have been asking for since last year and the debut of Windows 10. The setting is found under System > Tablet Mode. The feature acts a lot like the soft keys on Windows Phone: swiping up hides them and swiping up again will bring it back making the action feel very familiar. Cortana on the lock screen\n\nWith this release, a user can now optionally call Cortana while their PC is still locked. The feature lets Cortana appear on the lock screen with the same immersive experience as when the PC is locked. The feature also works with Windows Hello and it can be found under \"Lock screen options.\" Microsoft is also a few other Cortana features including: Photo reminders – take a picture of something you want to be reminded about and it will show up in Cortana later on\n\n– take a picture of something you want to be reminded about and it will show up in Cortana later on Shared reminders – Use the Universal Share picker to send things to Cortana so that she can remind you to read that news store or email later on\n\n– Use the Universal Share picker to send things to Cortana so that she can remind you to read that news store or email later on Low battery and Find your Phone – Cortana can now tell you when your Windows 10 Mobile device has a low battery, or you can have Cortana ring your phone if you cannot find it\n\n– Cortana can now tell you when your Windows 10 Mobile device has a low battery, or you can have Cortana ring your phone if you cannot find it No login – Use Cortana right away without having to sign in.

That includes the No. 1 earner, Dr. Robert Sticca, the chairman, program director and professor in the department of surgery, who was paid $758,128 during the 12-month period.\n\nThe State Board of Higher Education's recent buyout of North Dakota University System Chancellor Hamid Shirvani's contract may have raised some eyebrows for its $925,377 price tag for the remaining two years of his contract. But Shirvani wasn't close to the highest paid state employee during the 12-month period ending May 31, based on records provided by the state Human Resource Management Service and NDUS in response to an open records request.\n\nAs an article on Deadspin.com pointed out last month, the highest paid state employee in the majority of states is either a football coach or basketball coach. North Dakota was one of only 10 states in which the highest paid employee wasn't a coach -- though it came close.\n\nDave Hakstol, head coach of UND's perennially ranked Division I men's hockey team, skated to the No. 2 spot on the list, with total compensation of $649,618. Dr. Joshua Wynne, the medical school's dean and vice president for health affairs, ranked third at $580,623.\n\nAs UND spokesman Peter Johnson explained, the figures include more than just base salaries.\n\nHakstol's base salary is $300,000. Much of his other compensation was earned through meeting some of the 16 performance goals spelled out in his contract, Johnson said. For instance, if the team earned a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher, Hakstol received a 2 percent salary increase. There was a potential 8 percent bonus for a Frozen Four appearance and a 20 percent bump worth $60,000 for winning a national title.\n\nOther pay also is factored into the compensation of medical school employees.\n\nAbout one-fifth of Wynne's pay comes from clinical income earned through contracts the medical school has with outside health care systems, Johnson said. That pay isn't appropriated by the state but is tallied as part of Wynne's overall compensation because the money does flow through state coffers, he said.\n\nFigures provided by the University System -- which maintains its own salary records for employees of the system office and the state's 11 public colleges and universities -- encompassed base salary plus other types of compensation, including incentive payments based on performance goals and medical service payments, but not fringe benefits, according to Laura Glatt, the system's vice chancellor for administrative affairs.\n\nCraig Bohl, head coach of the North Dakota State University football program that's coming off back-to-back national titles in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision, was the first non-UND employee to land on the top 20 list, earning the No. 5 spot with $367,843.\n\nHe was followed by the first employee on the list not associated with higher education, Dr. Eduardo Yabut, a psychiatrist and medical director at the State Hospital in Jamestown, part of the Department of Human Services.\n\nOf the top 20 highest paid employees in state government, not including the University System, 16 of them work for Human Services, nearly all of them psychiatrists at regional human service centers.\n\nState Hospital Superintendent Alex Schweitzer, whose $194,371 in gross pay put him at 20th place on the non-University System list, said Yabut is responsible for the hospital's medical and clinical programs. Dr. William Pryatel, who ranked 13th on the overall list at $311,774, serves as interim medical director when Yabut is away.\n\nBecause psychiatrists are medical doctors, \"They're paid like doctors are paid,\" Schweitzer said.\n\nHe said psychiatry is an area with \"big demand\" right now, and the State Hospital must offer competitive salaries to attract and keep good psychiatrists.\n\n\"We don't just compete in North Dakota.

The draft plan will look at conservation strategies and include specific criteria for development such as the need for a one-kilometer buffer zone around greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) leks.\n\nOne the biggest factors affecting the sagebrush habitat that grouse live in are invasive species. Currently, species like medusahead rye (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) make sagebrush habitat more fire prone and dangerous for grouse, and the plan looks to put money towards controlling this issue.\n\nThe plan also explores ways in which the state agency can collaborate with other regulatory commissions in the state to develop provisions that consider sage-grouse habitat when evaluating development proposals.\n\nThe FWS is legally bound to make a decision on the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) this September but many western states are pushing back against a potential listing of the species as it could impact energy development, ranching and other human activities.\n\n“That decision is coming, we know that,” Schultz said. In Idaho, he said 10.5 million acres — both private and public — have been identified as sage-grouse habitat. If the bird is listed on the ESA, the development of this land could be affected by new regulations.\n\nThe comment period for the first draft plan closed on Monday, and Schultz said that the IDL will review the plan and stakeholder comments before releasing another draft.\n\n“Initial indications have been positive that they are willing to work with us,” he said of stakeholders.\n\nOnce that’s done, another comment round will likely open up and the plan will be finalized.\n\n“We fully expect to get our plan out there by [the listing decision],” Schultz said.\n\nIdaho is working to produce a conservation plan for the greater sage-grouse in order to counter the need for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the species on the federal Endangered Species Act when they make a decision come September.",

Photo courtesy of Clarence E.\n\nThe National Bike Summit in Washington DC is a golden opportunity for bike activists to meet with lawmakers. Usually the pitch is for more funding, but in these times of growing austerity, this has been downgraded to simply asking for no cuts in funding for bike infrastructure. There was also a ride in honor of Gabrielle Giffords (see video below).Check out this video about the 2011 congressional bike ride. This year's edition was in honor of Gabrielle Giffords:\n\nAccording to SB, the League of American Bicyclists and America Bikes focused on three aspects in their defense of bike funding:\n\nThe business aspect . America Bikes put together fact sheets for each individual district showing how much money that district has received for \"transportation enhancements\" (TE) like biking and walking, how much they've invested in Safe Routes to Schools, how many bike retailers are in the district, and how much money those retailers bring in. In most cases, the numbers show that retailers earn in one year about one-half to one-third of the amount spent on TE in the past 17 years - a pretty good return on investment, they'd argue. (Those district data sheets, which also include local legislation and advocacy groups, will be online soon at www.americabikes.org.)\n\n.

In their 400 meetings with Congress members' offices, advocates made the case that bicycling is important to constituents by talking in detail about the popular trails and busy commuter routes in each district, as well as the bike stores and local business. They invited lawmakers to join them for a bike ride, an event, or a ribbon-cutting for a trail as a way to get the member to have a personal connection with biking in the district. Their motto was \"don't cut what you haven't seen.\"\n\n.

They'll go on at length about how many miles they put in each week, how they ride to their district office in spandex, how they've taught their kids to ride bikes. But do they support continued dedicated funding for bicycling and walking programs like transportation enhancements, Safe Routes to School, and the Recreational Trails Program? That's what advocates were trying to pin the offices down on. \"If they say they support biking but they don't support funding for these programs, they don't support biking,\" said one movement leader.\n\nIndeed, investments into biking are very cost-effective and they can actually gain in value once a certain threshold is met; the more miles of interconnected safe bike lanes you have, the more useful that network is to cyclists (so they use it more) and the more attractive it is to potential riders. It all snowballs from there.\n\nIf the government wants to save money, nothing's more frugal than the bicycle.

  "latent_18465": "Ben Schreckinger is a reporter at Politico.\n\nEast Lansing, Michigan—Lounging at the back of his tour bus in a parking lot behind the Springhill Suites, Milo Yiannopoulos, the flamboyant right-wing British provocateur known for his bleach-blond frosted tips and relentless campaign against Islam, munched on a whole cucumber protruding from a paper bowl of raw vegetables and made plans for a party. He had just been asked to host “DeploraBall,” an unofficial celebration planned for the presidential inauguration weekend. Yiannopoulos described his vision for the event: As guests entered the National Press Club, shirtless Mexican laborers would be building a physical wall around them. Instead of doves, Yiannopoulos would release 500 live frogs in honor of Pepe, the cartoon mascot of pro-Donald Trump internet trolls. The room would be lined with oil portraits in gilt frames, each depicting a celebrity who had vowed to leave the country in the event of Trump’s election. At the end of the night, the portraits would be thrown into a bonfire and burned. Yiannopoulos would send a bill for the party to the Mexican Embassy.\n\nThe party is unlikely to proceed in exactly that way, or really anything like it. But the ball is real—a month ahead of the inauguration, the organizers had already booked the room and sold all 1,000 tickets—and it marks a kind of gala debut of a new clique in Washington.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKnown until recently as the “alt-right,” it is a dispersed movement that encompasses a range of right-wing figures who are mostly young, mostly addicted to provocation and mostly have made their names on the internet. On the less extreme end, they include economic nationalists and “Western chauvinists” like Yiannopoulos, who wants to purge Islam from the United States and Europe; the movement also encompasses overt white nationalists, committed fascists and proponents of a host of other ideologies that were thought to have died out in American politics not long after World War II. Over the course of Trump’s campaign, these ideas came back to life in chat rooms, on Twitter and on the fringes of the internet—driven by supporters united by their loathing of progressives and their feeling of alienation from the free market Republican Party as it defined itself before Trump’s takeover.\n\nThis “new right” is now enjoying something of a moment. It’s not clear whether the movement helped fuel Trump’s rise or just rode its coattails. But energized by his success, this loose confederacy of meme-generating internet trolls, provocateurs and self-appointed custodians of Trumpism has begun making plans to move into Washington’s corridors of power, or at least shoulder their way into the general vicinity. When they look at Washington—a besuited city that moves to the rhythm of lobbying and legislative calendars and carefully worded statements—they see an opportunity for total disruption, the kind of overthrow the movement already takes credit for visiting on American politics.\n\nSo what, exactly, is the capital in for? In the weeks after the election, I tracked down the movement’s standard-bearers in Washington, New York, California and Michigan to find out what they had in mind for changing the culture of D.C., and from there the rest of the Western world. They don’t lack for grandiose ambition: Disdaining the traditional Washington think tanks as passé, they’re taking aim straight at America’s sense of its own identity, with plans for “culture tanks” to produce movies that make anti-immigrant conservatism look cool, and advocacy arms that resemble BuzzFeed more than The Heritage Foundation. They talk elliptically about internet memes replacing white papers as the currency of the policy realm, pushed out by “social media strike forces” trained in the ways of fourth-generation, insurgency-style warfare. There’s the idea of taking over the Republican Party with a wave of Tea Party-style primary challenges in 2018 that will rely on novel campaign tactics like flash mobs and 24/7 streaming video of candidates’ lives. There’s even a new right-wing hipster fraternal organization started by Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys (motto: “The West Is the Best”), which promises to serve as an amateur security force at political events, including the Inauguration.\n\nOf course, coming in from the cold can also bring financial rewards, and some in the movement have a more old-fashioned ambition: that their coziness with the new administration will result in government contracts, and friendly regulators who won’t interfere with planned business ventures like a social media platform for people with high IQs.\n\nFor a movement that feeds on outsider energy, its members already enjoy surprising access to the inside of the incoming White House. Yiannopoulos’ official title is technology editor of Breitbart, the website formerly run by top Trump adviser Steve Bannon, with whom both Yiannopoulos and internet troll Charles Johnson say they keep in touch. Yiannopoulos and Johnson also both say they know Trump’s most influential megadonor, Rebekah Mercer. While I was spending time with another movement figure in California, he took a phone call from the son of Trump’s incoming national security adviser. (A shared spokeswoman for Bannon and Mercer did not respond to requests for comment about their relationships with Johnson and Yiannopoulos.)\n\nAt a conference he organized in Washington in the days after Trump’s election, attendees erupted in Nazi salutes following a toast in which Richard Spencer declared, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” | The Atlantic, via YouTube\n\nBut the new young nationalists also have a problem: They need to re-brand, urgently. In the first theatrical arrival of the alt-right in Washington, days after Trump’s election, Richard Spencer, the originator of the term “alt-right” and an open white nationalist, held a conference at the Ronald Reagan building, a couple of blocks from the White House. After dinner, once most of the national media had departed, Spencer rose to deliver a speech that crescendoed with him raising his glass in a kind of toast. As he held his arm up, he proclaimed, triumphantly, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” In response, several attendees erupted in Nazi salutes, indelibly associating the alt-right with jackbooted white supremacy and provoking an instant schism in the movement. In a video produced from the conference, the Atlantic blurred out attendees’ faces, as if the footage had been smuggled out of a criminal enterprise. Soon, the Associated Press and the New York Times issued memos that officially defined alt-righters as white nationalists.\n\nNow, as its members move on Washington, an already fragmented movement is further split between those who embrace Spencer’s racial politics and those who, for reasons of pragmatism or principle, reject the “alt-right” label for its associations. Said Paul Ray Ramsey, a blogger who flirts with white nationalism but found the Nazi associations a bridge too far, even for him: “You don’t want to tie your brand to something that’s ultimate evil.”\n\n***\n\nSpencer has become the poster boy of the alt-right, appearing on NPR and CNN to defend what he calls “European identitarianism,” and what others call, with less varnish, racism. He sports the alt-right’s signature shaved-side haircut—the “fashy,” as in fascist—and leads the benignly named National Policy Institute, a think tank with an office in Arlington, Virginia, to push his vision for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.”\n\nJared Taylor, at his home in Oakton, Virginia, has been called the “intellectual godfather” of the white nationalist alt-right. | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nHe isn’t the first American figure to put a fresh face on old-school Klan-style racism, but he’s far more open about his ambitions than the generation that preceded him. I also visited Jared Taylor, 65, who is publisher of the white nationalist web outlet American Renaissance and has been called the “intellectual godfather of the alt-right”; although Taylor welcomed me to his home in Oakton, Virginia, he declined to give any hint of his plans. He cited fear of sabotage, comparing himself to a Soviet dissident. “I won’t even talk about them in the vaguest of terms,” he said, surrounded by framed Confederate bond certificates and a bonsai tree. (Taylor, who was born in Japan to Christian missionaries, can’t precisely be classified a white supremacist: He believes Asians are superior to whites.)\n\nSpencer expressed no such hesitation. In mid-December, he announced he was considering running for Ryan Zinke’s House seat in Montana, where he lives part-time in a ski house owned by his mother. And three days before that, he took a break from scouting a new Washington-area headquarters to eat lunch at Café Milano in Georgetown and lay out his vision in detail. The last time Spencer dined at the restaurant, a decade ago, he found himself the odd man out. He recalled that Martina Hingis was playing one of the Williams sisters in a tennis match on the televisions at the bar, and that everyone else in the restaurant was rooting for the African-American player. Spencer’s loyalties, though, were racial. “I was like, ‘I’m on the side of the German,’” he told me. (Hingis, for the record, is a Swiss citizen from what is now Slovakia.)\n\nA month after Trump’s election, Spencer, in a sweater, collared shirt and newsboy cap, was fitting right in at the tony eatery. He had just returned from Texas A&M, where he delivered a speech that had created a predictable uproar, with protests, state police in riot gear and pro-diversity counterprogramming put on by the university’s president at the school’s football stadium. Spencer is planning a national tour of campuses in 2017 and considering calling it the Dangerous White Heterosexual Tour, a nod to Yiannopoulos’ Dangerous Faggot Tour.\n\nSpencer is now looking for a donor to finance his efforts to push white nationalism out of the shadows of the internet. “We need to enter the world,” he said. “We’ve hit our limit in terms of being a virtual institution.” To that end, midway through lunch, he took a call to arrange his next stop, Old Town Alexandria, where he was touring a prospective location for his new headquarters. Like many on the alt-right, his vision of a political movement blurs the line between politics, culture and media: In addition to office space, he was looking for a studio to launch a media operation that could field a daily news show, as well as perhaps a morning show that would be more “fun.”\n\n“If we had a studio,” he asked rhetorically, “could we start to enter the world in the way the Young Turks does stuff? In the way Infowars does stuff?”\n\nAn open white nationalist, Richard Spencer, above at home in Arlington, Virginia, has become a poster boy of the alt-right. | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nSpencer believes the answer is yes, and that the National Policy Institute could occupy a marquee headquarters in downtown Washington within 10 years. “Maybe Cato will go under,” he said, one of many digs at the old free market institutions of the Republican Party. “Maybe we’ll take over that facility.” In the short term, Spencer, 38, plans to capitalize on what he saw as the PR success of the November event with another meeting and news conference in Washington in the first quarter of 2017. If he doesn’t make it to Congress—and if former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke’s 3 percent showing in Louisiana’s December Senate race is any indication of the electorate’s appetite for undisguised racism, he won’t—Spencer believes he can use publicity to maneuver himself closer to influence.\n\nAs he tries, one of his obstacles will be the very movement he helped spawn. Other young figures of the anti-immigrant right have been distancing themselves from Spencer and his hard-core racial ideas; he wasn’t invited to DeploraBall, and the anti-immigration Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who knew Spencer when both were members of the Conservative Union at Duke University a decade ago, has condemned him.\n\nSpencer, for his part, says he still supports the more moderate figures who have disowned him and doesn’t mind that they’re trying to keep their distance. In their popularity, he sees a gateway for new followers to come around to his views, and he doesn’t want his presence to become a distraction. “I want there to be an alt-light,” he said, using a common nickname for the less extreme threads of the new nationalism.\n\nThe feeling does not appear to be mutual. Many figures in the movement now disdain the term “alt-right,” refuse to consider themselves “alt-light” and wish Spencer would just go away. “Not interested in appearing in any piece alongside Spencer et al.,” wrote Yiannopoulos in a text message rebuffing an interview request. “We have nothing in common.”\n\n***\n\nYiannopoulos’ caginess about the interview was not unusual. For a bunch of media-driven provocateurs, members of the new nationalist right can be highly particular about their interactions with the mainstream press. Longtime bloggers Vox Day and Steve Sailer agreed to answer questions for this story only in writing. Charles Johnson agreed to an interview on the condition that he would also record it, a tactic more commonly employed by prominent politicians. He also declined to be photographed, explaining that only one photographer is allowed to take his picture for publication. After asking some pointed questions about the direction of this article, Yiannopoulos’ publicist said he wouldn’t be participating in it.\n\nBut his brand is built on visibility, and Yiannopoulos, who said he was in talks with a number of major production companies about a television project, ultimately yielded when I showed up in Lansing, where he was preparing for an appearance at a lecture hall on the campus of Michigan State University. (Yiannopoulos later canceled a photo shoot for this article after learning that I had called Bannon and Mercer’s spokeswoman to ask if they would like to comment on his work.) I had last seen him at Trump’s election night party at the midtown Hilton, where Yiannopoulos posed for glam shots and paused briefly to harangue a gaggle of reporters about the evils of the mainstream media while they held recording devices up to his face.\n\nIn the past, he had identified as a “fellow traveler” of the alt-right, but by the time I showed up at his tour bus—this was two weeks after Salutegate—things had changed. “The small contingent of distasteful people in the alt-right became so territorial about the expression that they scared off moderate right-wingers,” he said. “And that’s what they did to me.”\n\n“The small contingent of distasteful people in the alt-right became so territorial about the expression that they scared off moderate right-wingers,” Yiannopoulos says.\n\nSporting black nail polish and black sequined pants with a black shawl, Yiannopoulos, 32, huddled at a standing desk with his young roadies, who dressed and looked like college sophomores, to plan the night’s show. On a laptop, the roadies presented to him a split-screen image to project behind his speech: Istanbul’s Blue Mosque on the left and a missile launcher, its warheads aimed away from the mosque, on the right. This was not what Yiannopoulos had in mind. “It looks like Istanbul is shooting us,” he complained. “And there’s no fucking American flag on it.” By the time Yiannopoulos appeared in the lecture hall that night, a revised image was being projected onto a screen at the front of the room: A bomb with an American flag on it had been superimposed to look like it was falling directly on the mosque.\n\nThe atmosphere around the speech reproduced the dynamics of a Trump campaign event in miniature. In the crisp air outside, mostly white attendees in Make America Great Again hats queued up at the door amid a heavy police presence, while mostly nonwhite protesters stood off to the side chanting, “No Trump. No KKK. No racist USA.” Seven arrests were made.\n\nInside, Yiannopoulos stood between plaster Doric columns and sipped Budweiser through a straw. Wearing black lipstick and a crown of faux gold laurels, he stood before a crowd of a couple hundred college students and painted Islam as a totalitarian political ideology and an existential threat to Western freedoms. A Cambridge University dropout who describes himself as a free speech absolutist, Yiannopoulos is doubly hostile to Muslims because of his homosexuality and Greek heritage. “I have family in Cyprus,” he lamented. “They took our fucking orange groves.”\n\nIn front of the crowd, he called Jill Stein a “crazy old cunt” and Lena Dunham a “disgusting fat cunt,” prompting raucous laughter and applause.\n\nThe movement known broadly as the “alt-right” has newfound influence in the Trump era, but it is split: Milo Yiannopoulos, for instance, at center, has distanced himself from a more overtly white nationalist alt-right. | Getty Images\n\nLambasting Islam for the benefit of college students is not new to the Trump era: The Los Angeles-based conservative agitator David Horowitz brought his “Islamo-fascism awareness” talks to campuses a decade ago. But Yiannopoulos is a different creature, a sort of 21st-century Islamophobic Oscar Wilde. His events are well-attended and entertaining. He believes he has the formula to turn the cultural tide of the West away from progressivism, a mix of erudition, flamboyance and charisma that puts an amusing, unthreatening front on a worldview that feeds the America-first, Christian-capitalist prejudices of his largely young male college audiences.\n\nYiannopoulos has retained his title as Breitbart’s tech editor, where his output is reportedly supplemented by the labors of more than 40 interns, and he views social media platforms as the next battlefront in the culture war. In July, he was banned from Twitter after trashing the work of the African-American comedian Leslie Jones, tweeting that she looked like a man and calling her “barely literate,” in response to a tweet she sent him that contained a typo.\n\nYiannopoulos, Johnson and a number of white nationalists have switched to an upstart rival called Gab that promises not to ban users for any speech so long as it is legal. Down the road, Yiannopoulos plans to take on what he sees as the liberal biases of other social media networks, but not yet. “I need to be too big to ban before I can start going for the people who have enabled my popularity,” he said. “I will pick that fight when I know I can win it.”\n\nYiannopoulos has a number of personal ties to the Trump administration: Bannon hired him to work for Breitbart, and his tour bus is Breitbart-branded. He also knows the father-daughter pair of Bob and Rebekah Mercer, Breitbart investors who are Trump’s most influential megadonors and the dominant patrons of the anti-establishment right. He would not reveal who was financing his tour other than to say his funding includes money from Hollywood. When I suggested to Yiannopoulos that the Mercers and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel—another deep-pocketed figure with ties to both Trump and a number of alt-light figures—might be chipping in, he responded only that Thiel would be more inclined to sponsor a highbrow cultural pursuit, like a literary journal, than a vulgar lecture tour. “Peter’s a snob,” he said. “In a good way.”\n\nYiannopoulos said he still talks to Bannon, but he declined to say about what. He disavowed any interest in Washington past the inaugural festivities. “Everybody in politics is a cunt,” he said. “They’re boring, untalented, unattractive people.” The real fight, he thinks, is the culture war he’s waging on college campuses. Yiannopoulos said he will leave Washington after Trump’s inauguration weekend with no desire to return.\n\n“I’m like Cincinnatus,” he said, comparing himself to the 5th century B.C. patrician who was appointed dictator of Rome to repel an invasion and promptly returned to civilian life after the crisis passed. “I want to go do this shit and go back to my fucking farm.”\n\n***\n\nBlogger Mike Cernovich has no such misgivings about D.C. Holed up in the living room of his modest home in Orange County, California, on a Monday afternoon in December, he crossed his legs and laid out his immodest vision for taking over the capital.\n\nA former lawyer, Cernovich began blogging about gender dynamics, among other topics, in 2004. A year earlier, he had been charged with raping a woman he knew, but the charge was dropped and a judge instead sentenced him to community service for battery. Ever since, Cernovich, now 39, has preached the gospel of masculinity, teaching readers how to become “a dominant man” through mindset adjustments and bodybuilding. He once tweeted “date rape does not exist” and advised readers, in a blog post about household finance, that “Hot girls are better to rent than buy.”\n\nHe advocates IQ-testing all immigrants and ending federal funding of universities, and describes himself as an economic nationalist primarily concerned with the welfare of average Americans. He has some economic ideas that veer toward the wonky—he said he would like median GDP to replace GDP growth as the lodestar of economic policy, for instance. As machines displace a greater share of labor, he is intrigued by the possibility of introducing a universal basic income, an idea supported by Martin Luther King Jr., conservative economist Milton Friedman and Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, Robert Reich. Cernovich is also an avid consumer and progenitor of conspiracy theories, such as his claim that there was more than one shooter at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and that the government is covering this up to avoid panic.\n\nThose predilections made him an early Trump supporter, and over the course of the election he shot to internet notoriety by his monomaniacal focus on Hillary Clinton’s allegedly failing health and his online feuds with Trump detractors. He has become huge in the world of pro-Trump Twitter, known as #MAGA Twitter, for Make America Great Again. In October, a Finnish publishing house specializing in science fiction and fantasy released his latest book, MAGA Mindset: Making YOU and America Great Again.\n\nHis new plan is to take his brand of self-help from the home to the House by running the “Big Brother” of congressional bids, renting out a five-bedroom campaign pad, living in it with his staff and streaming the whole thing 24/7 on YouTube. There are other plans for the campaign—flash mobs, loyal readers with Go-Pros confronting and humiliating his opponents live on Periscope. “The savagery that I would bring to a campaign would be like nothing anyone had ever seen in a congressional election,” said Cernovich, the day before the birth of his first child, a girl.\n\nThat vision is contingent on Cernovich’s congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, vacating his seat to, say, join the Trump administration. If that does not happen, Cernovich still plans to recruit acolytes from across the country to deploy those tactics next year in primary challenges to establishment Republicans, a scheme he has dubbed #Revolution2018. If he can pick off just a handful of incumbents next year, Cernovich believes the entire Republican conference will come to fear, and heed, his movement. “That’s what you learn from—” he said, before catching himself. “I’m going to choose my words carefully, because I don’t want to call it ‘terrorism.’”\n\nA blogger in Laguna Niguel, California, Mike Cernovich uses the label “new right” to describe himself. To refute those who lump him in with white nationalists, he points to his wife, Shauna, a secular Muslim of Persian descent. Their newborn daughter, Cyra (with Cernovich above), was named for the Persian emperor Cyrus. | Sandy Huffaker for Politico Magazine\n\nFor a man who until recently was best known for hawking his self-published books and intentionally offending people on the internet, these are grand designs. And Cernovich acknowledges they’ll require some maturation. To that end, Cernovich has condemned Richard Spencer and disassociated himself from the “alt-right” label, even though he believes the Nazi saluters at his conference were leftist plants sent to make the alt-right look bad. (Spencer himself, it should be noted, rejects this conspiracy theory, as well as Cernovich’s claim that the CIA may be propping him up. “He needs to calm down,” Spencer told me.) The hard-core alt-right, in response, has turned on Cernovich and begun calling him “Cuck-ovich,” a play on the movement’s dreaded “cuckservative” insult.\n\nCernovich now uses the label “new right” to describe himself. To refute those who lump him in with white nationalists, he pointed to his second wife, Shauna, a secular Muslim of Persian descent, who lounged behind us on a couch and jumped in and out of our conversation. (The non-European partner, for what it’s worth, has become a frequent defense among the more moderate alt-righters: Charles Johnson points to his Asian wife to counter charges of racism; Gavin McInnes points to his Native American wife; Yiannopoulos says he prefers to date black men.) Cernovich’s newborn daughter is named Cyra, after the Persian emperor Cyrus (a stocking with her name on it already hung over the fireplace). When a question arose about the birthplace of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ sidekick Paul Joseph Watson, Cernovich told his wife “Google it.” Then he backtracked. “Will you please Google it? I don’t just bark orders at you.” (“Northern Britain,” she chimed in later.)\n\nCernovich does not view himself as a “troll” per se, because he views trolling as amoral, but instead refers to himself as a “rhetorician”—a provocateur who doesn’t literally mean what he says. Whatever he calls it, the rhetoric clearly has real-world consequences. He was a chief pusher of the #pizzagate hashtag on Twitter, the wacky conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was part of a child sex trafficking ring being run out of the back of a Washington restaurant called Comet Ping Pong. The scandal began as a rumor on Twitter, jumped to message boards like 4Chan, was pushed by Cernovich and other much higher-profile agitators, and came to be taken quite seriously by some of the internet’s more impressionable users, including the North Carolina man who drove to Washington and fired shots with a real assault rifle at the real pizza joint in a misguided attempt to free the nonexistent sex slaves.\n\n“Right now we’re going from the underdog to the overdog,” Cernovich said. “So I’m still fighting like the underdog. But when I say things, I need to be more careful.”\n\nWhen we sat down in California, it was a day after the incident, and Cernovich conceded that he had learned some lessons from the fiasco. For example, although he does believe there is an active pedophile ring in Washington that needs to be investigated, he never believed it was based out of Comet. He also claimed he did not know “Pizzagate” implied that specifically. “Right now we’re going from the underdog to the overdog,” he said. “So I’m still fighting like the underdog. But when I say things, I need to be more careful. When I say things like ‘Pizzagate,’ I need to be more clear.”\n\nIn the midst of our discussion about Pizzagate, Cernovich’s phone rang, and when he picked it up, the voice on the other end belonged to Mike Flynn Jr., the son of Trump’s pick for national security adviser. Flynn Jr., who had a transition email address and at one point was up for a national security clearance as part of the presidential transition, was also a Pizzagate conpiracy theorist, explicitly endorsing the idea that Comet could plausibly be the center of a Clinton-connected child sex-trafficking operation. Taking the call from Flynn, Cernovich hurried out onto his back patio, shut the sliding door to the living room and paced around for several minutes out back.\n\nThe Flynns, father and son, are also big on #MAGA Twitter, and have become fans of Cernovich’s work there. The elder Flynn, who like his son regularly tweets out links to fake news stories, tweeted an endorsement of Cernovich’s Gorilla Mindset book; he has also called Yiannopoulos “one of the most brave people that I’ve ever met.” Cernovich declined to comment on his relationship with the Flynns, or with almost anyone else. He said he avoids knowing the names of people he communicates with, and tries to forget their names if they tell him, in case he is ever subpoenaed. He consciously models his approach to media and politics on “fourth-generation warfare”—that is, insurgency and counterinsurgency, which includes the use of fluid, ad hoc alliances. “Chuck Johnson doesn’t tell me what to do. Milo doesn’t tell me what to do,” he said. “But we talk, and we’re loosely aligned.” He has become more inclined to believe in conspiracies, he told me, now that he is part of one himself.\n\n***\n\nIf there’s a real alt-right conspiracy in American politics, Charles C. Johnson is an integral part of it. Johnson, a self-described journalist, came up through a series of conservative fellowships and internships as a student at Claremont McKenna College, where he graduated in 2011. From there, he has made a name for himself through a series of controversies as both a debunker and purveyor of false stories.\n\nHe contributed to the Daily Caller’s since-debunked story alleging that New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez consorted with prostitutes, and has falsely reported that a New York Times reporter had posed for Playgirl, mistaking a spoof source article for a genuine one. After striking out with his own website, GotNews, he published the full home addresses of two other Times reporters after they published the name of a street that Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson had once lived on. Later, Johnson was among the most prominent skeptics of Rolling Stone’s since-debunked article about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. In the process of attacking the story, he revealed the supposed identity of the woman who had been the anonymous source for the story. He also published a book, Why Coolidge Matters, in 2013. It received favorable blurbs from Bush administration Justice Department official John Yoo, conservative blogger Michelle Malkin and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nLike a number of alt-righters, Johnson has been banned from Twitter—in this case for soliciting donations to “take out” a Black Lives Matter activist, phrasing he said referred to opposition research but that the platform interpreted as a threat of physical violence.\n\nCharles Johnson, who says he is friendly with members of the new administration, hopes their policies will give him leeway for even more of the internet trolling he has become known for. | Peter Duke\n\nIf other alt-right figures are plotting some kind of outside route to Washington influence, Johnson, at 28 years old, is already there. When I had last seen him in person, it was at Trump’s election night victory party sometime after 3 a.m., and he was standing about 10 yards from the president-elect. “Chris Christie will not be as powerful as he now appears,” Johnson informed me. Two days later, Christie was demoted from chairman to vice-chairman of the transition, and he has drifted further from the center of Trump’s orbit since then.\n\n“It’s no secret that I’m friendly with people who are now in the government,” Johnson said back in Midtown three weeks later, on the second floor of the swanky Lambs Club. Johnson had returned to New York from his home in California to testify in his settlement with Gawker, which he has sued for libel over its exploration of a rumor that he once defecated on a floor in college.\n\nHe told me he had been performing various unspecified tasks for the Trump transition. He took credit for bringing Bill Clinton’s female accusers and Barack Obama’s pro-Trump half-brother Malik to the general election debates. (Malik Obama has referred to Johnson as “my friend” on Twitter.) One person close to Trump’s transition told me that Johnson had participated in some early transition-related meetings and caused headaches when he was accused internally of leaking to the news media. “I haven’t leaked anything without authorization,” Johnson responded. (Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller wrote in an email that Johnson does not have a role on the transition and has not “been tasked with any projects on the team’s behalf.”)\n\nThe Alt-Right Canon The alt-right is a bookish bunch who often cite classics of the Western canon to make their case about race, politics and culture in America—but also their own favored list of more obscure titles. Here are seven of the lesser-known books they see as most integral to their worldview. — Ben Schreckinger Albion’s Seed, by David Hackett Fischer (1989)\n\nFischer, a historian, focuses on four regional cultures in England that sent settlers to the New World and supposedly formed the basis for four corresponding regional cultures of the United States: Puritans in Massachusetts, elites and their indentured servants in Virginia, Quakers in the Delaware Valley and the Scotch-Irish in the Appalachian backcountry.\n\nThe Culture of Critique, by Kevin MacDonald (1998)\n\nThe third in psychologist MacDonald’s series analyzing Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy, this book argues that Jews led a number of intellectual movements, including Marxism, that benefited Jews but resulted in the deaths of millions of people. Several critics have panned the book as a work of intellectual anti-Semitism.\n\nThe Blank Slate, by Steven Pinker (2002)\n\nHarvard University cognitive scientist Pinker argues that the role of genetics in determining human behavior is far greater than is acknowledged in the prevailing social science models, which rely more heavily on the role of culture and environment. The book was a finalist for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction.\n\nA Farewell to Alms, by Gregory Clark (2007)\n\nA late entry in the canon of social Darwinism, this book argues that the Industrial Revolution and accompanying advances in quality of life resulted from the dying off of the poor in Britain and their replacement in society by harder-working and less violent—though downwardly mobile—members of the upper classes. Clark, an economist at the University of California, Davis, received mixed reviews for the book.\n\nThe 10,000 Year Explosion, by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending (2009)\n\nTwo University of Utah anthropologists make the unconventional argument that the onset of civilization has actually accelerated the rate of evolution, rather than arresting it, creating more and more variation across human populations.\n\nA Troublesome Inheritance, by Nicholas Wade (2014)\n\nInspired in part by A Farewell to Alms, former New York Times science reporter Wade argues that Caucasians, Africans and East Asians exhibit genetic variance on the level of separate subspecies, and that Caucasian genetic advantages explain the dominance of the West in recent centuries. The book set off a firestorm and was condemned as a work of poor scholarship by 139 scientists in population genetics and evolutionary biology in a letter to the Times.\n\nThe Devil’s Pleasure Palace, by Michael Walsh (2015)\n\nWalsh, a conservative journalist, argues that the dominance of critical theory and cultural Marxism in post-World War II American universities is responsible for the deterioration of traditional values in society at large. The book received favorable coverage across conservative outlets, including Breitbart and National Review.\n\nAmong his fellow travelers, Johnson is known as a direct line to the donor class. He said he talks to Bannon and knows the Mercers. He knows Thiel. McInnes, the Vice co-founder and an acquaintance of Johnson’s, said Johnson and Thiel coordinated their legal assaults on Gawker. Johnson declined to discuss the tech billionaire other than to describe their relationship as a mere “passing acquaintance,” and a spokesman for Thiel did not respond when asked whether the pair had coordinated.\n\nJohnson said he is concerned now with making sure Trump’s government is stocked with Trumpists rather than establishment Republicans and other “cucks,” and his WeSearchr “information marketplace,” a business he started where people can post bounties for specific pieces of information, provides him with the resources to vet potential appointees independently. In the internal struggle over staffing the administration, this aligns him with Bannon. Johnson told me he is soliciting résumés, recommending job candidates and circulating policy memos, but to whom exactly he wouldn’t say.\n\nJohnson conceded that such tactics would need to evolve. “The trolls in some measure have to grow up,” he said. “Government by meme is kind of a scary idea.”\n\nDespite his proximity to the Trump administration, Johnson is far less squeamish than many of his confederates about Richard Spencer. He makes no bones about knowing him, and offered to give me Spencer’s phone number. He told me he rejects white nationalism as a political philosophy—“I don’t know when something is loving being white and when it’s hating other groups,” he mused—but doesn’t totally reject the idea of applying the alt-right label to himself.\n\nJohnson has personal goals for Washington as well. Some of these have to do with taking revenge on social media platforms that have relegated his ideas to the margins. Johnson said he would like to use his connections to the incoming administration to push for the invocation of antitrust laws to regulate Twitter and Facebook as utilities, in order to prevent what he sees as their unfair treatment of conservatives. And he wants to push the government to ensure federal antidiscrimination rules do not interfere with his plans for a social network restricted to people with IQs above 130. “I just don’t want the government to persecute my businesses,” he said.\n\nMostly, he said, he is interested in making money. So he will want a friendly ear at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when he launches a predictions-market business. He is interested in crowd-sourcing cancer research, which will require a friendly Food and Drug Administration. His plans for a crowd-funding business could depend on his relationship with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nJohnson defends trolling, his preferred mode of political activism, as a tactic that allows a weaker party to force a stronger party to act—and a pedigreed one at that. “Jesus was a troll,” he said. (Cernovich credits the 4th century B.C. philosopher Diogenes the Cynic—who irritated the citizens of Athens and Corinth with stunts like bringing a live, plucked chicken to Plato’s academy to prove a point about taxonomy—as the original troll.) But dissimulation and juvenile humor are not traits that inspire great confidence in leaders, and Johnson conceded that, now that his candidate has won, such tactics would need to evolve. “The trolls in some measure have to grow up,” he said. “Government by meme is kind of a scary idea.”\n\n***\n\nIt’s clear that the alt-right isn’t shy about the sweep of its claims; Yiannopoulos and Spencer, as well as lesser-known figures, tend to talk about their project in world-historical terms, framing it as a civilizational clash, or some kind of new rising tide. What’s far less clear is if the alt-right did make a move on Washington, just how many people would show up.\n\nBefore he was banned from Twitter, Yiannopoulos had 300,000 followers. Spencer had more than 30,000 Twitter followers at publication time, and Cernovich had nearly 190,000. But a social media following isn’t the same as votes, or membership, and the numbers question is now tangled in the new ambiguity about who is or isn’t part of the alt-right, or the alt-light, or new right. There is a noisy online white nationalist alt-right core that amplifies its voice by frenetically posting on Twitter, Reddit and 4Chan, often using multiple accounts to inflate its perceived size. The alt-right subreddit has more than 13,000 registered users. At Spencer’s November conference in Washington, about 200 people showed up. Johnson and others have the ear of people in Trump’s orbit, and their online visibility creates a kind of political cover for slightly more moderate versions of nationalism now represented within the White House. But it’s far less clear what kind of political groundswell they could muster if they tried.\n\nFurther muddying the waters, the alt-light and alt-right are anti-progressive cultural movements as much as political ones. Many of their members knew the late Andrew Breitbart, and they are fond of citing his maxim that “politics is downstream from culture.” The cultural component pops up in odd places: Members of the sketch comedy group Million Dollar Extreme have been called the “court jesters of the alt-right,” and a show created by the group’s leader, Sam Hyde, was canceled in December because Cartoon Network executives deemed it offensive.\n\nIn an increasingly image-driven political culture, the alt-righters are doubling down on image. The movement essentially has an official visual chronicler: Peter Duke, the only photographer Johnson allows to take his picture for publication, also shot Cernovich’s new softer headshots. Duke has photographed Yiannopoulos, former Breitbart columnist Ben Shapiro, Dilbert creator Scott Adams (a Trump admirer who has feuded with feminists on his blog) and George Zimmerman, the man in Florida who was acquitted in the murder of Trayvon Martin. Duke’s aspiration is to create a Vanity Fair for the right, to make it more glamorous. “One of the things that the left is really good at it is making people look good, and I mean that literally,” he said. “The right in general needs re-branding.”\n\nAlready, a new aesthetic is taking hold among the alt-light: gayer and more avant-garde. In July, Yiannopoulos hosted a “Gays for Trump” party at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which included the cognitively dissonant spectacle of anti-Islamic commentator Pamela Geller and far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders railing against the Muslim threat from a podium flanked by erotic photos of scantily clad young men in “Make America Great Again” hats. In October, Yiannopoulos staged a pro-Trump performance art piece in Manhattan in which he bathed himself in pig’s blood to commemorate the victims of Islamic terrorism and crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. At the show, notorious pharma bro Martin Shkreli, an alt-light fellow traveler who is under indictment for alleged securities fraud, exhibited a framed red-and-blue pill. McInnes, who is white, exhibited a photo of himself as an antebellum slave.\n\nJeff Giesea, above, views himself as a moderating force, arguing that trolling should be used as a tactic but “constructively and ethically.” | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine\n\nThis might seem a disorienting new politics and aesthetic for Washington, but the patron behind both events is a figure already in D.C.: Jeff Giesea, a little-known entrepreneur. The 41-year-old Giesea exudes the air of a West Coast investor; on workdays, he haunts the hip environs of Logan Circle, and he asked to meet me at a coffee house off 14th Street that is very much part of blue, Obama-era Washington. Giesea graduated from Stanford in 1997, a year after Rebekah Mercer, though he said he does not know her. He does know fellow Stanford alumnus Thiel, according to a person familiar with their relationship, and Thiel talked him out of attending law school. Instead, Giesea went to work for Thiel Capital Management, the magnate’s pre-PayPal investment venture, and then for Koch Industries’ public affairs office.\n\nIn recent years, Giesea says, he has become less of a libertarian and more concerned with the fortunes of Middle America. He says his travels in Europe and his homosexuality have made him concerned about Islamic incursions in the West. In February, he published a paper titled “It’s Time to Embrace Memetic Warfare” in a NATO-sponsored journal, calling for using the tactics of internet trolls to thwart the Islamic State’s online propaganda; the ISIS tactics he studied have informed his own virtual pro-Trump insurgency, which he conducted in conjunction with the likes of Cernovich and Johnson, supplementing the uncoordinated efforts of thousands of anonymous pro-Trump Internet trolls.\n\nGiesea confers regularly with Cernovich about taking over the Republican Party and remaking it as pro-worker, perhaps with the help of a BuzzFeed-style think tank that distills policy into memes and makes those memes go viral. He views himself as a mentor and moderating force within the Trumpist movement, and acknowledged that it has some growing up to do. “We need to evolve beyond trolling,” he said. The tactic can still be appropriate, but only within certain parameters, he said. “We need to make sure it’s used constructively and ethically.”\n\nThere are other changes in store as well. Giesea is an organizer of DeploraBall, and he invited Yiannopoulos’ involvement in the party. But his young comrade’s vision of shirtless Mexican laborers will not come to pass, and for a very pre-Trump, non-nationalist reason. “I find that offensive,” Giesea said. “My mother is a Mexican citizen.”",
  "latent_18676": "Almost 60 Islamic State defectors have spoken out against the caliphate and Western governments should do more to incentivize former fighters to speak out, according to a new report by the International Center for the Study for Radicalization.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, about 20,000 foreigners have joined jihadist groups in the Middle East over the last two years. About a quarter of those are Europeans, and it is estimated that between 25% and 40% have gone back to Europe.\n\nThe new report says that most of the defectors have gone into hiding to escape reprisal from ISIS but also to avoid imprisonment in the countries to which they are returning. According to the report, 58 defectors from Europe and Australia have now publicly spoken about their experience.\n\nIn the reasons listed as to why they became disenchanted with the jihadist group, most defectors mention the violence toward other Muslims.

  "latent_18694": "Here at Stormpath, we give developers easy access to user management features – including authentication, authorization, and password reset – via our REST API and language-specific SDKs. Our team of experts began with already-significant knowledge about REST+JSON API design. In the process of building the REST API, they learned even more. Our CTO, Les Hazelwood, gave a well-received presentation to a group of Java developers on REST+JSON API design best practices, which you can watch here:\n\nWe’ve also written posts on how best to secure your REST API, as well as linking and resource expansion in REST APIs. This post will give a high level summary of the key points that Les touches on in his talk – specifically the fundamentals of good REST+JSON API design.\n\nSo Why REST?\n\nKeeping the goal of rapid adoption of an API in mind, what makes RESTful APIs so appealing? Per Dr. Roy Fielding’s thesis on the REST paradigm, there are 6 distinct advantages of REST:\n\nScalability – not necessarily its performance, yet rather how easy it is for RESTful APIs to adapt and grow and be plugged into other systems. Use of HTTP – being able to use HTTP methods to manage resources makes RESTful APIs easy to plug into other applications. Independency – with a REST API you can deploy or scale down specific parts of the application, without having to shut down the entire application or an entire web server form. Reduced latency due to caching – REST APIs prioritize caching, which helps to improve latency. So always keep caching top of mind when you’re developing your REST API. Security – HTTP specification lets you spot security via certain HTTP headers, so you can leverage this to make your API secure. Encapsulation – there are parts of the application that don’t need to be exposed to a REST caller, and REST as an architectural style allows you to encapsulate those gritty details and only show things that you need to show.\n\nAnd Why JSON?\n\nUbiquity – over 57 percent of all web-based applications have JSON, are built on JavaScript, or have JavaScript components. Human readable – it uses very simple grammar and language, so a human can easily read it, including folks just starting to get into software development. It’s easy to change or add new fields.\n\nWhat makes REST design difficult?\n\nRESTful APIs are difficult to design because REST is an architectural style, and not a specification. It has no standard governing body and therefore has no hard and fast design rules. What REST does have is an interpretation of how HTTP protocol works, which allows for lots of different approaches for designing a REST API. While use of HTTP methods is a core advantage of the REST approach, it also means that there are lots of different RESTful API designs. We’re going to focus on some of the best guidelines that we’ve come up with in designing our REST API.\n\nREST API Design Guidelines\n\n1. Keep your REST API resources coarse grained, not fine grained\n\nBasically, you don’t know how your user is going to interact with your resources. In the case of Stormpath, resources would be accounts, groups, or directories. There are lots of different actions they might run on those resources and if they are adding in lots of arguments to methods they’ve written for a particular resource, it can be difficult to manage. So we recommend that, for a given resource in your REST API, you write a method that takes the resource itself as an argument, and the method contains all the functionality needed for said resource.\n\nHow else do you keep things coarse grained? You work with collection and instance resources. A collection resource is what it sounds like – basically a folder containing similar resources. An instance resource is a singular instance of its parent resource. This allows you to use HTTP behavior that affects an end point definition (an instance resource), but doesn’t actually create another url for each instance-behavior combination. So don’t add behavior to the actual end point definition.\n\nSince REST APIs run on standard HTTP methods, you can use PUT or POST to either create or update resources. You might think of using PUT to create a resource and POST to update a resource, but you can actually use POST for both, and that’s recommended.\n\nWhy would you want to use POST to both create and update a resource?\n\nBecause with POST you don’t need to send over all fields for that data resource on every call you make, whereas with PUT, you do. This is important because if for every update you make you are also sending over fields that are not updating, then your data plan is consuming more than it needs to. Using POST instead of PUT can be beneficial if your REST API is metered as it limits the quantity of traffic. Furthermore, when you get into millions or hundreds of millions of requests per month, that impacts your REST API’s performance – so use POST to limit the traffic.\n\nAnd why can’t you do the same with PUT?\n\nBecause per HTTP specification, PUT is idempotent, meaning it has to have all its properties included (or the result will not be the same). For example, if you first create an application without specifying a description, and then in a fourth call you send in the description, the state may have been different in between, therefore breaking the idempotency mandate.\n\n3. Have REST API documents link to other documents based on the notion of a media type\n\nA media type is a specification of a data format and a set of parsing rules associated with that specification. With your REST API, if you’re writing as a client, be sure to include your preferred data format you would like returned in the accept-header. Likewise, as the server, return back a content-type header that notes how the data is actually being returned. You can also add additional parsing rules to whatever data type you’re using. For example, you might have media type application/JSON+foo which tells the client not only is this JSON formatted data, but it’s also foo, which tells the client how to parse that data.\n\nSo make sure to send through accept headers specifying what media type you want (if on the client side), send through content-type headers telling the client what data format you are returning (if on server side), and take advantage of customizing your own media types to make your rest API more flexible for your clients.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post we’ve covered the advantages of the RESTful API design approach, as well as the fundamentals for creating a developer-friendly REST API. This is merely a summary of Les’ points, and only the first 30 minutes at that, so be sure to check out the rest of the presentation.\n\nLike what you see? to keep up with the latest releases.",

  "latent_19213": "Sikhism and Smoking\n\nby Bikramjit Singh Dhillon\n\nSmoking and drug taking is banned in Sikhism and using tobacco is listed in the Sikh Rehat Maryada (Code of Conduct ) as one of the four transgression (Kurahits). The Sikh Rehat Maryada was drafted by an expert committee of eminent Sikh scholars. Many western friends of mine are surprised that Sikhism explicitly forbids the use of tobacco and this may be because there is no prohibition of tobacco use in other religions.\n\nTobacco first started being used for smoking around 100 B.C. by native Americans tribes and the Europeans first came into contact with it when Columbus discovered America. During the nest two centuries tobacco use was spread by the Europeans across the entire known world. it is interesting to note that tobacco was paid to the English clergy as wages right upto the 1750's. Tobacco was introduced by the Portuguese into India during the 17th century. It was traded through the Portuguese trading post on the west coast of India. During the time of Guru Gobind Singh tobacco use had become common by the Mughal nobles.\n\nIt may appear strange to people of other religions as to why Sikhism has such a Anti-smoking stance, the reason is that smoking is recorded as being forbidden by all the Sikh writers who were contemporaries of the 10th Guru. According to these writers Guru Gobind Singh was once riding with his Sikhs when he suddenly stopped his horse and after dismounting proceeded to rip out a wild tobacco plant. The Sikhs asked why the Guru had ripped the plant out and the Guru replied that the Sikhs should avoid alcohol as it destroys a generation but tobacco destroys several generations. The Guru then forbade his Sikhs to ever use tobacco. Early European writers who came across the Sikhs in the 1780's were perplexed as to why tobacco was forbidden for the Sikhs as tobacco was being widely used by both the British and the Indians at that time. Of all the Nations that the Europeans came into contact with the Sikhs were the only one who had a religious injection against tobacco.\n\nUntil the 1950's smoking was encouraged by governments as a means to acquire tax. Only in 1950 when Morton Levin published his study into the connection between lung cancer and smoking did any governments take notice. according to the World Health Organization report of 1995 worldwide lung cancer is the biggest single cause of cancer deaths in men. Smoking causes approximately 3 million deaths worldwide and if current trends persist it will kill 10 million a year from 2020. Smoking causes about 20.5% of all deaths in developed countries. These are frightening statistics but the biggest tragedy is that smoking is the single largest preventable factor in premature death, disability and disease. These effects of smoking are not limited to the smokers themselves but to those around them. Family, friends and even complete strangers in the smoker's vacinity suffer. Smoking while pregnant has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome (cot death), bronchitis, pneumonia and higher risk of miscarriage (The Guru had said that tobacco would destroy several generations)\n\nApart from the effects on health , smoking also takes a large chunk of family budgets sometimes as much as 20% if both parents smoke. Smoking is increasing in developing countries amongst people who can ill afford the habit. There are roughly 1.1 billion smokers worldwide about 17 % of the total population and about 6000 billion cigarettes are smoked every year. According to some estimates about 300 million is spent on the habit worldwide with about 100 billion being spent in the developing countries. This sheer wastage is borne by families who live in slum quarters unable to better themselves due to the drain on their resources caused by smoking.\n\nThe Sikhs have escaped from the effects of the 'evil weed' and the absence of smoking amongst Sikhs has been noted by several western writer when they visit India. Today the Sikhs can wonder at the foresight of their Great Guru Gobind Singh that he foresaw the miseries that would stem from the tobacco plant and wisely instructed the Sikhs to keep it at an arms length. Such foresight is indeed befitting a great prophet of Waheguru.\n\nWAHEGURU JI KA KHALSA WAHEGURU JI KI FATEH",
  "latent_19234": "The Trump administration on Tuesday set in motion its plan to repeal virtually all of the U.S. government’s existing net neutrality rules — a move that will soon deliver another major deregulatory win to telecom giants like AT&T, Charter, Comcast* and Verizon.\n\nIn a forthcoming proposal from Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the country’s telecom agency is set to eliminate open internet protections that prevent broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or otherwise interfering with web traffic.\n\nIn doing so, Pai seeks to shift the responsibility for net neutrality to another federal agency — one that arguably has far fewer powers to protect consumers from corporate harm. And he opens the door for AT&T, Verizon and others to begin to strike special deals with web companies for faster delivery of their music, movies or other content — arrangements derided as “online fast lanes” by critics who fear it would break the internet.\n\nFor now, Pai’s proposal is merely a final draft. As is custom at the FCC, he has circulated the order privately among his fellow commissioners today. It sets up the FCC to hold a vote on the future of net neutrality as soon as December — and Republicans, who hold three of the FCC’s five slots, are guaranteed to prevail.\n\n“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet,” Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.”\n\nAlready, Pai’s proposal has generated another intense online backlash. Even before he announced his plans, roughly 21 million web users bombarded the FCC with comments this summer urging the agency to preserve its existing net neutrality rules. Left-leaning public-interest groups like Free Press and Demand Progress helped organize online rallies this summer in defense of net neutrality, and top tech giants — including Amazon, Facebook, Google and others — similarly pleaded with the FCC to keep its existing open internet protections on the books.\n\nSoon, those forces could band together once again to mount a lawsuit, potentially setting up months, if not years, of further legal wrangling over one of the web’s most contentious, unresolved issues. Telecom giants, meanwhile, have said they would invest more in their networks if the U.S. government merely regulated them less.\n\nAdopted in 2015 under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. government’s current approach to net neutrality subjects the likes of AT&T, Comcast, Charter and Verizon to utility-like regulation. That legal foundation prevents them from blocking or throttling web pages, while banning content-delivery deals known as paid prioritization. And it grants the FCC wide legal range to review virtually any online practice it deems harmful to consumers.\n\nSuch strong rules always have been popular in Silicon Valley, where startups in particular fear they could not compete without tough net neutrality safeguards. But they long have drawn sharp opposition from the telecom industry, which sued the FCC in 2015 in a bid to overturn them.\n\nBefore that case could come to its conclusion, however, Trump entered the White House, ushering in a new era of Republican control at the nation’s telecom agency. And Pai, a fervent opponent of utility-like regulation of net neutrality, embarked on his campaign to undo the Obama-era rules almost as soon as he took over the FCC.\n\nTo that end, Pai’s new plan would no long consider telecom giants akin to utilities, a classification under law known as Title 2. It’s a move that has a cascading effect: It means the FCC cannot — and will not, under Pai — outright prohibit practices like blocking, throttling or paid prioritization.\n\nPai’s order does require internet providers to disclose more information to customers about their policies. That would include clear alerts whenever they prioritize their own streaming services over others, for example, or strike special deals with content makers to speed or free up their offerings, FCC officials explained.\n\nAnd Pai’s blueprint — the full text of which he will release tomorrow — appears to shift the thrust of enforcing net neutrality to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission. Generally, the FTC would be empowered to take action against AT&T, Verizon or other telecom giants if they promised consumers to protect the open web but failed to keep such promises.\n\nIt’s an attempt at a compromise that’s sure to infuriate Pai’s critics, including the Internet Association, a Washington, D.C-based group that lobbies on behalf of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter and other web giants. In July, it told the FCC that paid prioritization would harm startups and tech giants alike, putting them “at the mercy of ISPs who would face minimal constraints on their ability to charge [the industry] for prioritized access.”\n\nOtherwise, the FTC is much more limited than its sister agency. Its efforts to ensure companies do not block or interfere with web traffic hinges greatly on whether those telecom giants are being deceptive. And the FTC is handcuffed in some cases from issuing fines for some corporate misdeeds.\n\nEven the FTC’s own commissioners fear it might be too hamstrung to serve as the primary cop on the beat for net neutrality.\n\n“These are very real and significant limits to the effectiveness of the FTC’s tools in policing nondiscrimination on networks and protecting competition,” said Terrell McSweeny, the FTC’s lone Democratic member, during a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, Pai’s order would spare telecom giants from state legislators and regulators who might hate the FCC’s new approach and try on their own to police net neutrality, senior agency leaders said Tuesday. In recent weeks, AT&T, Verizon and their allies specifically lobbied the agency for this prohibition, federal records show.\n\nOnce Pai’s plan is adopted, though, the fight is far from over. Much as the Obama administration faced multiple court challenges, so too will Trump’s FCC, as public-interest groups and tech giants already are signaling they intend to sue.\n\nAmong their criticisms is that Pai ignored millions of comments that urged him to preserve the government’s rules. They also reject Pai’s argument that broadband investment has suffered as a result of his predecessors’ regulation. The FCC, for its part, is likely to contend that many of the comments it received were fake — and that its own numbers show telecom giants truly invested less in recent years.\n\n* Comcast, through its NBCU arm, is an investor in Vox Media, which owns this website.",

Read the full article.\n\nThis name change saw every German reference and title being replaced with something British. The use of “Degrees, Styles, Dignities, Titles and Honours of Dukes and Duchesses of Saxony and Princes and Princesses of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and all other German Degrees, Styles, Dignities, Titles, Honours and Appellations,” was to be discontinued.\n\nThe decision to adopt Windsor as the family name came amid strong anti-German feeling during the first world war. But the turning point was public anger at air raids over London, and in particular the bombing of a school in the East End.\n\nOn 13 June 1917, the Germans began daylight raids on Britain and in one of the first attacks 18 children were killed when a bomb fell directly onto Upper North Street School in Poplar.

  "latent_19445": "World leaders forged a fragile compromise at a summit in Germany that failed to conceal the reality that Donald Trump’s America is increasingly going its own way.\n\nThe G-20 meeting in Hamburg agreed to fight protectionism while tacitly recognizing Trump’s concerns about excess steel capacity and what he says are unfair trade practices. On climate change, the US was again isolated, with all 19 other members agreeing that the Paris accord on cutting emissions was “irreversible.”\n\n“I always said that this wouldn’t be easy and that we shouldn’t hide areas of discord,” Chancellor Angela Merkel, the summit host, told reporters on Saturday at the end of two days of talks. “The communique has to reflect those areas where there is no consensus.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs anti-globalization protesters clashed with police across Hamburg, burning cars and looting shops, G-20 officials struggled to bridge their differences.

Leaders are concerned about a potential trade war over steel as Trump gears up for a decision on whether to impose punitive tariffs amid ongoing complaints about dumping on global markets.\n\nThe final G-20 statement pledged renewed efforts to combat excess capacity in the steel industry, while referring to the use of “trade defense instruments.” So despite some compromises, the US still has a mechanism at hand to declare a trade war over steel at any time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in his closing press conference, said that it’s a “profound mistake” to judge the benefits of trade through the prism of deficits or surpluses. He gave the example of his Apple iPhone, which is designed in the US, made in China with some US parts, and sold in Europe — an argument he first advanced to his fellow G-20 leaders in response to Trump’s assertion that he will always defend American workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Protectionism and dumping are both bad answers to our problems,” Macron said.\n\nThe final statement also underlined Trump’s lone stand on climate change, saying that all G-20 members except for the US “state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible.”\n\nIn the statement, the US announced that “it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution and affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.”",

With this great workforce and solid business environment, Hubbell looks forward to many more years of manufacturing excellence at its Christiansburg location.”\n\nThe Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with Montgomery County, the Town of Christiansburg, and the New River Valley Economic Development Alliance to secure the project for Virginia. Governor McAuliffe approved a $100,000 grant from the Governor’s Opportunity Fund to assist Montgomery County with the project. The company will receive benefits from the Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Zone Grant Program, and will also be eligible for Sales and Use Tax exemptions on manufacturing equipment. Additional funding and services to support the company’s employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program.\n\n“It is with great pride that I, along with the Christiansburg Town Council and Administration, welcome this additional phase of Hubbell Lighting to Christiansburg,” said Christiansburg Mayor D. Michael Barber. “I appreciate the work of the NRV Economic Development Alliance, Montgomery County Administration and Board of Supervisors, Governor McAuliffe and state agencies for their efforts in this venue. Since 1963, Hubbell Lighting has been a valued corporate citizen for Christiansburg and Montgomery County and we are extremely pleased Hubbell has selected us to be the site of their consolidation process. We welcome the new employees of Hubbell and their families to our community and look forward to the company’s continued success.”\n\n“We congratulate Hubbell Lighting on its decision to expand in Montgomery County,” said Montgomery County Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Brown. “We feel fortunate that with its increasing global presence, Hubbell Lighting continues to add positions and expand operations where it has been located for over 52 years. This is great news for our local economy.” “This is a long-term commitment –a reinvestment—in Virginia by a long-time user of The Port of Virginia,” said John F. Reinhart, CEO and executive director of the Virginia Port Authority. “We are pleased to see Hubbell Lighting’s faith in Virginia as a location to expand and create jobs in the process; we look forward to continuing our relationship with Hubbell.”\n\n“This is a long-term commitment –a reinvestment—in Virginia by a long-time user of The Port of Virginia,” said John F.

Knox, FireKing\n\nIntroduction: If you own firearms, you need a gun safe. In some states, such as California, if you don't own a safe, you face potential liability if your firearms are stolen. Purchasing a safe is no easy decision however. There are dozens of safe manufacturers and countless design options. Sorting out the facts from the marketing claims can be difficult.\n\nOur Gun Safe Buyers' Guide is designed to help you select the right safe, with the right features, at the right price, for your needs.\n\nWe identify the most important qualities you should look for in a safe, and help you with the tough decisions, such as \"Should I get a digital lock or a dial lock?\", \"What kind of fire-proofing is most effective?\", \"How big a safe do I really need?\", and \"What interior works best with long-barreled scoped rifles?\" We review many of the better safes on the market, including innovative designs from Browning, and Zanotti. Plus you'll find expert advice on how to install your safe in your home and how to keep the contents free from rust.\n\nEditor's NOTE about Vaults: If you have a very extensive collection of firearms (over 70 rifles), you may want to consider a custom-built vault room in your home. A vault will be more cost-effective than purchasing multiple giant safes, and vaults can be made very secure against both fire and theft risks. Most of the manufacturers listed here can supply vault doors. But engineering the \"ultimate vault\" is another topic altogether, so we haven't addressed vault doors in this article.\n\nSupport Your Site\n\nRecommended Safe Features for Long-Gun Storage\n\nEditor's Recommendation:\n\nBudget $1200-1500 for a safe from a major maker, with external hinges, and an interior at least 58\" high.\n\nThat gives you room for 30\"-barreled rifles with a top shelf for handguns and other valuables. A rotary rack and slide-out drawers are great additions. Keypad or Dial? I favor rotary dial locks. With minimal maintenance they will function flawlessly for decades. But the digital locks offer quick-access and convenience. If you go digital, get a commercial-grade unit. Fire-lining is worth getting, but a thin layer of sheet-rock doesn't make a safe truly \"fire-proof\". Interior at least 58\" High and 30\" wide\n\nOverall Weight 750+ Pounds\n\n8 Gauge or Heavier Wall Thickness\n\nDouble-Wall, Composite Door with Relockers\n\nMinimum UL RSC Rated. TL-15 or TL-30 Rating is Desirable\n\nExternal Hinges\n\nMechanical UL Group II (or better) Lock with Standard Dial\n\nOr UL Type 1 Commercial-Grade Electronic Lock\n\nCustom Interior Suitable for Scoped Guns with Long Barrels\n\nOn-Door Storage System for Non-scoped Long Guns OR\n\nRotary Gun Rack for Scoped Rifles and ARs\n\nInternal (sandwiched) Insulator, Reinforced if Sheet-rock\n\nPalusol? Heat-Activated Expanding Door Seals\n\nSlide-out Drawers for Handguns\n\nFire-lined Inner Safe for Paper and Media\n\nLow Gloss, Rust-resistant External Finish\n\nPre-Drilled holes for Lag Bolts and in Rear for Electric Cord\n\nOverhead Fluorescent Lamp and/or LED Mini-lights on Strings\n\nDOs and DON'Ts of Safe Buying DO purchase a safe that is bigger than you think you need.\n\nYour gun collection is bound to grow over time. A good safe is more than just a gun locker--it becomes a secure storage device for your family's other valuables as well. You'll find you quickly fill up even a large safe. Spend the money for the size, protection, and features you want. Your gun collection may be worth many tens of thousands of dollars. Some people who visit this site wouldn't hesistate to spend $1100 for a custom action or $1400 for a NightForce scope, yet they don't want to spend more than a few hundred dollars on a safe. That's not common sense. If you're on a tight budget, consider a used safe. Unlike many other products, safes don't really wear out over time. When businesses change locations, you can get a very high quality commercial safe for little more than the cost of removing it. DO spend more for a safe that offers fire-resistance.\n\nBut you have to do your homework--you can spend a lot of money for \"fire-proofing\" that actually is not very effective. Make sure if sheet-rock is used that it is properly installed. If you have valuable documents and media files, it's not a bad idea to purchase a smaller, commercial-grade fire safe to put inside the gun safe. This gives you double protection. DO look at many different brands of safes before you buy.\n\nThere ARE significant differences among brands. For example, Browning offers a unique (patent-pending) door-mounted rifle rack. Zanotti offers slide-out drawers and a modular design that is much easier for an owner to move. Ft. Knox uses an advanced method to secure and stabilize its fire-proofing layers within the safe. Brown offers custom exotic wood interior shelving and safes with commercial-grade burglary protection (much thicker steel with heavy composite doors and walls). Amsec offers a proprietary \"DryLight\" poured concrete-type fire insulation with greater structural strength than typical sheet-rock panels. DO investigate the safe's specifications.\n\nJust because a safe is big and heavy doesn't mean it's particularly secure. Heavy-gauge steel is much more resistant to cutting and drilling than light 12- or 14-gauge steel. Some safes on the market have walls so thin they can be penetrated with a fire ax. We recommend 10-gauge steel at a minimum, and 8 gauge is much better. The safe should carry a UL RSC (Underwriters Laboratories \"Residential Security Container\") or better rating. DO ask about the safe's safeguards against tampering.\n\nA quality safe will feature extra armor or devices to defeat drilling. Low-grade safes can be opened in a few minutes with simple, battery-powered hand tools. All safes should have relockers to help ensure the safe remains locked in the case of a burglary. Relockers are hardened pins that are triggered during an attack, and cannot be retracted without hours of drilling. The number of relockers on a safe ranges from 2-10+ depending on the safe's size and burglary grade. DON'T store powder in your safe. A tightly-sealed metal box with a large quantity of powder inside is a bomb. Store powder in a separate, lightly-constructed cabinet or wood box. The main thing for powder is to keep it dry and away from moisture and light. DON'T store large quantities of primers in your safe. If one primer goes off it can detonate others, causing a chain reaction. If you have many thousands of primers, don't store them all in one corner of your reloading area. DON'T leave the wooden pallet on your safe and rely on the safe's mass alone to deter thieves. A 10-year-old kid with a rented pallet jack can move a 1000-pound safe with ease if the pallet is attached and the safe is not bolted down. DON'T locate your safe in plain view, such as the front of your garage, or corner of your living room. This is just an invitation to theft. And be discrete when you load and unload firearms--so you don't advertise to the whole neighborhood that you have a large gun collection. DON'T leave power tools or cutting torches near your safe.\n\nSafe Installation Tips\n\nEvery safe, when possible, should be anchored in place with heavy-duty fasteners. Ideally, use multiple bolts in the bottom of the safe, anchored to concrete or solid foundation. Choose the appropriate lag bolts or anchors for the material below your safe. If you can't mount to the floor, bolt the safe to wall studs. You can locate the position of the studs with an inexpensive electronic \"Stud Sensor\" available at home supply stores.\n\nIf the steel on the bottom of your safe is fairly thin, place a steel backing strip between the bolt heads and the safe bottom. (Large washers will work, but a backing strip is better.) Without such reinforcement, the bolt heads may pull right through thin-gauge steel if the safe is rocked, or levered from the bottom with a pry-bar.\n\nLocate your safe in the corner of a room or in a recess that blocks access to one or more sides of the safe. On many gun safes, the steel on the top, sides, and rear is thinner than on the door. Blocking access to the sides makes it much more difficult to use power tools on the sides, where the safe is most vulnerable. It's also wise to place the safe in a relatively tight space with limited room to manuever. Anything that makes the safe harder to move helps deter would-be thieves.\n\nMany people place their safe in a garage or basement. That's not necessarily a bad idea, but people also tend to store their tools in the same locations. Don't store your power tools next to the safe. One safe-maker told us how a customer's safe was defeated using the owners' own cutting torch which was stored right next to the safe!\n\nInspect the area around the safe. Avoid locations where there are a lot of wood beams, paint cans, or other combustible material nearby. In the event of a serious house-fire, these items will fuel the flames, increasing the likelihood that items inside your safe will be heat-damaged.\n\nChris Luchini, co-author of Rec.Gun's guide to Gun Safes, offers some practical advice: \"1) Get an alarm system. If the burglars hear an alarm go off, they are less likely to stick round to finish the job. Alarms on both the house and the safe area are a good idea. 2) Hide the safe. If the safe is built into a wall, or behind a false wall and they can't find it, they can't break into it. It may help to keep a cheap gun cabinet around with a couple of junker guns in it, [so] that a thief who knows you have guns will find it, break in and leave disappointed, without looking for your real safe.\"\n\nFormer law enforcement officer Ron Godwin, now Manager of El Cajon Gun Exchange, has investigated many buglaries and safe break-ins over the years. He advises: \"Be creative. Stick [your safe] in a closet with a solid core door and a deadbolt (that means the bad guy has to take more time and make more noise getting to your safe). If the closet is in a garage or utility room stick a professional-looking sign on the door such as 'Warning!! High Voltage--No User Serviceable Parts'. Put a smoke detector on the ceiling directly above your safe and run a fake wire so it looks like it is hooked into a security system. Most of the things a bad guy does to break into a safe--drilling into a hard plate, grinding, cutting with a torch--create smoke. If the smoke detector activates there's an alarm and the bad guy doesn't know if someone will respond to it or not. With the possibility of being 'caught in the act', he may just leave.\"\n\nSupport Your Site\n\nIMPORTANT FEATURES of GUN SAFES\n\nSize and Weight\n\nRecommendation: At least 58\" interior vertical clearance; at least 750 lbs loaded weight.\n\nA bolt-action rifle with a 30\" barrel is about 52\" inches long. Therefore, if you want to get a long-barreled gun in your safe, with a bit of room for a top shelf, you'll need an interior 58\" or so high. That's what we recommend as a minimum. As far as width, 36\" and 40\" are common sizes that will give you ample space for a couple dozen rifles. A 36-40\" wide interior will allow you to have a 16-gun rotary rack on one side, plus a normal shelving unit on the other. A nice, wide interior also lets you place shorter rifles (or AR-15 uppers) horizontally on an upper shelf. That is a very handy and efficient storage option.\n\nIn terms of weight, obviously a 2000-lb safe is more secure than a 500-lb safe. But a one-ton safe requires a professional moving crew to install in your home, and will cost a small fortune because of the huge amount of costly steel in its construction. What is a reasonable compromise?\n\nWe asked a number of safe dealers, and most felt that a safe in the 750-lb range offered a good combination of size and security. At this weight, the safe can't be moved with a typical appliance dolly. It will be big enough, with large enough footprint, that it will resist being tipped over. It will be too heavy for a couple of thieves to push up a flight of stairs. Conversely, a 500-lb safe is much easier for a couple men to manhandle, and two strong men can get one into the bed of a pick-up truck using a ramp.\n\nSafe Construction and Wall Thickness\n\nRecommendation: Minimum 10 Gauge steel walls, 5/16\" solid plate door or 1+\" composite door, armor shielding over lock box.\n\nShell Strength\n\nStrength is important in a safe. This is a function of components, design, and construction quality. You want a safe with great exterior strength, because during a fire, the house roof or other structural elements may fall on the safe. If the safe splits a weld or if the door springs lose, your valuables are toast. Chris Luchini, studying the results of the Los Alamos fire, found that one expensive safe failed completely after a heavy beam fell on it, causing the door to spring loose.\n\nWell-constructed safes are built with continuous welds, not \"stitch welds\" linked with body filler. Citadel Safe Company in Utah notes: \"Our safe bodies are welded continuously (no stitch welding). [Some] other safe companies use plastic body filler on their safes in place of welding. This is a very bad practice since plastic body filler is very flammable.\"\n\nIf you want to see how tough a well-built safe can be, check out this Fort Knox Video, showing two Fort Knox safes supporting the full weight of a 25-ton military tank.\n\nWall Thickness\n\nSteel is very expensive. That's why low-end safes have very thin steel wall panels, 12-gauge or even 14 gauge. Thin steel does not offer much of an obstacle to penetration. A concrete saw will zip right through 10-gauge panels, and 12-gauge, single-panel steel can be penetrated by a Fire Ax. Commercial-grade safes, used in banks and jewelry stores, use much thicker-grade steel. A B-Construction-rated commercial jewelers safe would feature at least ?\" thick solid steel door and ?\" solid steel body. That's what it takes to defeat serious safe-crackers.\n\nBut the average attack on a residential gun safe is more of the \"snatch and grab\" variety, by criminals who don't have heavy-duty cutting tools or torches, and who want to get in and out fast. So, it's reasonable to compromise a bit on the exterior shielding of the safe to have a manageable weight and reasonable price. Still, we recommend 10 gauge steel as a minimum, and 8 gauge, or 3/16\", is much preferable. Sturdy Gun Safe builds a lot of safes for Law Enforcement and Prison use. Sturdy's \"Minute Man\" series safes feature 7 or 8-gauge steel walls. You should compare that to the wall thickness on other brands. Thicker steel is definitely harder to cut, and more resistant to break-ins.\n\nUnderwriters Laboratories (UL) have a rating system which measures the ability of a safe to withstand attack. At a minimum, a gunsafe should qualify for the UL \"RSC\" rating (\"Residential Security Container\").You may see the terms \"TL-15\" or \"TL-30\" in sales literature. A TL-15 Rating means the safe door can successfully resist entry for a net assault time of 15 minutes when attacked with common hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or portable electric tools, grinders, drills or pressure devices. TL-30 means the safe door can pass the same test for 30 minutes. Note that this does NOT include attacks on the sides or top. That is a much tougher test, and very few if any, popular gun safes could pass. Click here for a more complete explanation of UL Safe Construction (and burglary resistance) Ratings. The same page explains UL Fire Ratings.\n\nLocking Device--Mechanical Dial vs. Digital Locks\n\nRecommendation: UL Group II mechanical dial lock or commercial-grade electronic.\n\nFor gun safes, we prefer rotary-combination dial locks, although commercial-grade electronic locks are now very good. While less convenient, and slower to open than electronic locks, combination locks are still more durable and trouble-free than the digital locks found on many low- to medium-cost gun safes. Among the combination locks, the Sargent & Greenleaf model 6730 (UL Group II) remains an industry standard. The director of Sturdy Safes noted: \"An S&G 6730 will be working fine when your grandchildren have grandchildren.\" For home use, we also recommend the standard, high-visibility \"front-read\" white on black dial. There are \"Spyproof\" dials which shield the index marks from frontal view. This may be useful for a retail safe placed behind the counter, but at home, it just makes the dial much more difficult to see (you have to look down at an angle).\n\nAvoid the cheap, imported electronic locks. These are known for failing relatively quickly--the keypad internals just wear out. With some of these designs, if the lock fails while the door is closed, you'll have to employ a professional gunsmith to drill your safe and replace the locking assembly and keypad. With any electronic lock, re-program your combination now and then so that keypad wear patterns don't reveal the numbers you push to open the safe. But when you change the combination, be sure to record the new setting.\n\nWith a dial lock, choose a design that meets UL Group II (or better) certification. If you choose a digital lock, we strongly recommend that you select a UL Type I, Commercial Grade lock from LaGard, Sargent & Greenleaf, or Kaba Mas. Commercial-grade locks, such as the S&G Comptronic\" 6120 or LaGard \"SafeGard\" are much more robust and are designed to be used 20 times a day or more in retail and banking environments. A good commercial digital keypad lock should give 10 years or more of continuous use before replacement is required. With any digital lock, however, you should replace the battery at least once a year. Normally this can be done without professional assistance.\n\nWhat do the experts say? We polled a half-dozen safe manufacturers and most of them leaned toward digital locks--but primarily because that's what customers prefer. However, Mark Zanotti of Zanotti Armor tells us \"10% of the safes I sell have digital locks, but they represent 90% of the problems down the road. Anything electronic is prone to failure at some point.\" With digital locks you have to replace the batteries regularly. The keypads can and do fail. Safemakers tell us one common problem with digital locks stems from the ease with which the combination can be re-programmed. Customers reprogram their locks and then forget the combination.\n\nWhat is the major problem with conventional dial locks? User error--owners forget to relock their safe after opening it. When you shut the door on a digitally-equipped safe, the door locks automatically. However, with a manual combination lock, you need to spin the dial after shutting the door and working the handle. Closing the handle moves the locking bolts, but does NOT re-activate the lock. So all a thief needs to do is turn the handle and he's in the safe. So, if you choose a manual lock, be sure to spin the dial every time you close the safe.\n\nBolt Operation and Layout\n\nRecommendation: 1\" (or larger) bolts on all four sides with vault-type cam or relockers.\n\nThe number of locking bolts is not all that critical, so long as there are at least two bolts on each of the doors' four sides, and the bolts themselves are hardened steel and of sufficient diameter. More bolts do add a measure of security though, and can be found in a high-end safe such as the Ft. Knox \"Yeager\", pictured at right. Note the diagonal bolts in the corners. That's a feature normally seen only on high-end bank vault doors. It helps secure the corners of the door more rigidly and bars a prying attack at a location where some doors are vulnerable.\n\nSome companies utilize rounded door corners, or a stepped \"jig-saw\" door-frame, arguably to make it more difficult to try to bend the door. This can make it more difficult to attack the safe door with a pry-bar. But bottom line, if your safe has a multiple-bolt set-up with sufficient engagement, a prying attack will fail. You should be more concerned about a drill attack on the bolts themselves.\n\nBolt linkage design is critical to the safe's resistance to a drill attack. As this Browning Video shows, some safes can be defeated quickly and easily by drilling a 3/16\" or larger hole opposite a bolt and then pushing the bolt inward. This causes all the bolts to retract, opening the safe. And it can be done in a matter of minutes. Click the video frame for a 6 MB video, or Click Here for a high-resolution (21 MB) version. Most higher-grade Browning, Champion, and Heritage safes resist this kind of attack because their bolt linkage systems do not transfer pressure on the bolts directly to the lock. (To divert bolt pressure away from the locking mechanism, Browning uses a locking-bar system with vault-type cams, Champion uses an eccentric cam, while Heritage uses a \"past top dead center\" linkage.)\n\nA locksmith will tell you that, given enough time and the right tools, any residential safe can be cracked. However, a safe equipped with relockers is less vulnerable to an attack with mechanical tools. Brown Safe Mfg., which produces many high-end commercial safes, tells us: \"All safes should have relockers to help ensure the safe remains locked in the case of a burglary. Relockers are hardened pins that are triggered, in a variety of ways during an attack, and cannot be retracted without hours of drilling.\"\n\nFire Protection\n\nRecommendation: Safe UL Rated 350?F for 1 hour or better, with fire cladding on all sides.\n\nOver 380,000 residential fires occur annually. Residential fires account for $4.4 billion of property loss each year. So, getting a fire-resistant safe is a good idea. No question about that--but understanding how much protection you're really buying is the challenge.\n\nFire protection in gun safes is a controversial topic. Many claims are made about the effectiveness of various forms of \"fire-lining\" or \"fire-cladding.\" Ratings suggesting that a safe will stay below a specified temperature for a given length of time may be unrealistic. However, as a general rule, fire-proofing is a good thing, and a safe that incorporates effective fire/heat protection is worth the extra cost.\n\nChris Luchini, co-author of the Rec.Gun's guide to Gun Safes, told us: \"I live in the Los Alamos area. A few years ago we had a massive fire that destroyed many homes. I had the chance to inspect a number of safes in homes that experienced 'total burn-downs', where the building was reduced to a pile of ashes. I noticed three things. First, in nearly all the safes without any fire-proofing, everything was lost. Second, in some safes where there was no structural reinforcing of the sheet-rock insulation, things were lost in the top half of the safe. Third, I saw some safes that had thick, reinforced fire lining, and these came out pretty good, with most of the contents intact. I also saw a fire-lined safe that failed because the door sprung open when a heavy beam fell on it.\"\n\nChris adds: \"Realistically, fire is probably more of a danger to your guns than theft. Spend the extra money and get the fireproofing in any safe you buy, or add it yourself later. Many safe manufacturers use common sheet-rock as fire-lining. This is not the best solution, because when heated, standard sheet-rock will crumble. There is a sheet-rock that has fiberglass embedded in it. These fibers will maintain the physical strength of the panel as it is heated. Also, keep in mind that the top of the safe is the part that [takes] the brunt of the heat in a fire. Store everything as low as possible in your safe.\"\n\nThe two most commonly-used insulators in gun safes are sheet-rock (gypsum board), and ceramic wool blankets. Ceramic wool has a much higher insulation rating than sheet-rock. However, when sandwiched between steel plates, sheet-rock can be quite effective. As the safe heats up, water molecules contained in the sheet-rock vaporize and form steam. This conversion of water to steam absorbs heat energy. It also serves to pressurize the safe, sealing it off front heat and flames. The problem with sheet-rock is that, after it releases its moisture, it tends to disintegrate, and migrate to the bottom of the safe, leaving hot spots at the top. Ft. Knox is one of the safe-makers that employs an extra assembly stage to secure the sheetrock within the safe walls. Ft. Knox bar-tacks the sheet-rock panels in a matrix so the insulating material stays in place.\n\nShould You Believe Safe Makers' Fire Ratings?\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer. Some claimed ratings are unsupported by actual testing. Some companies, such as Cannon and SentrySafe, use Intertek ETL to test their safes. Other companies, such as AmSec and FireKing, employ Underwriters Laboratories to test their safes. At right is a graphic showing various UL rating levels. Liberty Safe, whose safes are tested by Omega Point Laboratories, notes: \"An assumption many people make is that they can compare home security safe fire ratings much like they compare the gas mileage ratings on cars. While there is one test method for estimating fuel economy, there is no single fire test or rating standard for home security safes. Safe manufacturers' fire test methods, standards and facilities vary so widely that a direct comparison is meaningless. Actual house fires get hot real fast1200?F in ten minutes or less. Yet some manufacturers use fire tests where the heat builds to over 1200?F over a much longer time framewell beyond the time it takes a typical house fire to reach 1200?F. The result is a longer fire protection time claim, but it provides an unrealistic expectation of actual fire resistance. In an Omega Point fire test the furnace temperature builds to 1200?F, typical home fire intensity, in ten minutes and is maintained there, exposing the safe to the full heat and intensity of a simulated home fire during the test. The test is over when one of the nine computer monitored temperature probes inside the safe rises 275?F above the ambient temperature--paper chars at 402? F. The results are a rating that is a real measure of a safe's fire endurance under conditions simulating a house fire, not just a factory test.\"\n\nHow is a Commercial-Grade Fire Safe Built?\n\nBrown Safe Mfg., builder of many high-end commercial safes, gives the following advice to its customers: \"Be extremely careful when considering a safe with a 'fire liner', 'ceramic fire layer', 'fireboard' etc. You will never find these fire liners in a commercial or high-end safe, simply because they do not work for any substantial length of time. Many of the manufactures are using the specifications of the building material used. For example 'UL listed fireliner' which just refers to the UL rating of the drywall used and in no way means the safe is UL-rated. Also, many of the manufacturers will test the safes in their own labs rather than having an independent (preferably U.L. labs) test the safe.\n\nA true UL-rated fire only safe is made with two thin skins of sheet metal with a water retaining media (typically a concrete and vermiculite mixture) in between. The door jam is highly convoluted with a heat seal. As the heat hits the outside of the safe the fire retardant gives off the retained water as steam. This expands inside the safe and forces the heat out of the convoluted door jamb forming a heat seal. This steam also saturates the contents to artificially raise its flash point.\n\nIf you are looking for burglary protection in addition to fire protection, the safe needs to be built with at least B-rated safe construction (?\" thick solid steel door and ?\" solid steel body.) Due to the thickness of the steel (which will conduct heat) a 2.5\" thick fire cladding must be used in order to insulate the steel portion of the safe from the heat of the fire.\n\nThis fire cladding is a concrete amalgamate which insulates the solid steel portion of the safe. The fire cladding also has the advantage of adding considerable additional burglary protection (due to being a mix which includes concrete) with added torch, thermic lance and brute force protection.\n\nWhen comparing gun safes it is helpful to compare the weight of similar sized models from different manufacturers. This will let you compare the actual amount of steel in the safe (as opposed to sheet metal wrapped around wood or drywall).\"\n\nDoor Seals\n\nRecommendation: Full-length Palusol? Door Seal\n\nMany low-end gun safes are sold without any door sealing at all. That's bad. Door seals are very important. First, a good door seal will keep out moist air, dramatically reducing the risk of rust forming on your firearms and personal articles. Second, in order to resist the heat, smoke, and flames of a fire, your gunsafe needs to have a tightly sealed door and the absolute minimum of external holes. Ideally, your safe should be fitted with a Palusol? heat-activated sealing strip all the way around the door frame. In a fire, Palusol? will expand to eight times its normal size, blocking smoke and heat from entering the interior. Lastly, a good door seal is vital if the safe is to resist liquid water intrusion during flooding, and as the result of fire-fighting. SentrySafe uses a special, proprietary gasket that Sentry claims will keep both flood waters and high-pressure spray out of your safe: \"Flood Guard's breakthrough polymer seal locking system keeps water out for up to three days, if your gun safe is submerged in up to two feet of water. And Flood Guard protection is spray-resistant for up to 15 minutes, even if your gun safe is drenched with 1,000 gallons of water from a fireman's high-pressure hose.\"\n\nHinges--External vs. Internal\n\nRecommendation: External hinges (provided safe is UL-rated 'RSC' or better.)\n\nWe prefer gun safes with external hinges. These allow the door to open wider, a full 180 degrees--something you will appreciate every time you open the safe. Additionally, external hinges allow the safe door to be removed for easier transport and servicing. Contrary to some marketing claims, internal hinges do not necessarily make the safe more \"secure\". Concealed internal hinges give a safe a sleeker, more modern appearance. But if a safe door has adequate locking bolts, the door will stay in place even if the hinges are cut completely off. And with either internal or external hinge design, it is the locking mechanism that is the real security concern.\n\nBrown Safe Mfg., a highly respected manufacturer of commercial-grade safes (as well as residential safes), explains: \"When shopping for a gun safe be aware of features that are only seen on 'gun safes' such as internal hinges, fire liners, etc., as they are usually marketing features more than safety features. It is often helpful to look at commercial safes to get an idea of how a safe, which is built for extremely high burglary risk, is constructed. For example, external hinges are a standard feature on commercial safes because the average burglar will waste time trying to cut or pry them. In any quality safe the hinges simply swing the door and shouldn't be part of the security of the safe. Internal hinges usually cause the burglar to immediately attack the lock and other vital areas on the safe.\"\n\nInterior Layout\n\nRecommendation: 18-gun minimum stated capacity, with good access. Consider Rotary Rack for rifles and drawers for handguns.\n\nSafe-makers like to boast about how many guns they can squeeze into their safes. Marketing dictates ultra-high-capacity interiors. Unfortunately this has lead to racking designs that jam rifles way too close together--designs that aren't suited at all for rifles with long barrels, wide fore-ends, or deep pistol grips.\n\nA \"24-gun safe\" might fit two dozen skinny Marlin lever guns with 22\" barrels, but they'll be crammed in there like sardines. This makes it difficult to access the rifle you want without tediously removing others first. And don't even think of trying to \"max out\" your interior if your collection includes a 32\" Palma Rifle, a couple AR15s, or a few 1000-yard BR guns with 3\"-wide fore-ends and big scopes.\n\nIf you look at safe advertisements, the safes are chock full of small shotguns and un-scoped rifles. You'll never see an MBR Tooley with a long barrel and a big scope. And you'll rarely even see an AR15 because its magwell and extended pistol grip demand extra clearance when stored in a gun safe. In the real world, then, you won't be able to fill a gun safe to its claimed capacity. One of our readers had this comment: \"If you think you need a 20-gun safe, buy a 40-gun or larger. If not it will be too small.\"\n\nSo, as a practical reality, most safes don't deliver a user-friendly interior for owners of scoped rifles. What can be done about that? Here are some ideas.\n\nBuy a Rotary Rack--These things are great. Check out this Rotary Rack Video to see how they function. You can access any of your rifles in a matter of seconds, and you only have to move the gun you want. Yes you do give up some storage space. But a Rotary Rack with a 22\" base will hold 16 rifles, even ARs and rifles with huge scopes such as the Nightforce 10-42x. On a Rotary Rack, you place the rifle with the scope facing inwards, so you won't be bashing your expensive optics on the sides of the safe anymore. Gun-Racks.com produces high-quality Rotary Racks in 10, 12, 16, and 22-gun configurations, starting at $119.00. We recommend the 12-gun Rotary Rack ($144.00) with a 36\" center shaft. That is tall enough to clear the fore-end of an MBR or Tracker stock, and there is enough clearance from edge to center for nearly all scopes. If your scopes have extended turrets, however, it's a good idea to alternate scoped with non-scoped rifles.\n\nRack your Unscoped Guns on the Door-- If you place your shotguns and unscoped rifles on the door, that will free up a huge amount of space on the inside of the safe for guns that need more clearance. How's that done? Browning Safes has a patent-pending door-mounted rack as part of its \"Duo-Plus\" interior. It has a carpeted rack with barrel holes at the top, and a short platform at the base of the door, complete with individual slots for rifle butts. This works extremely well for shotguns and iron-sighted rifles. Study the design--you could probably easily build something similar in your own safe.\n\nBuild Your Own Rack Shelving--Most gun safe racking units are nothing more than a piece of carpeted particle board or pine. You can easily build a replacement that fits the guns you own, not the guns some marketing director thinks you have. For scoped guns, you need to increase clearance from the sidewalls 3\" or more (assuming scope-side faces the safe wall). To ease access, you should also increase the spacing between guns. If you have a number of benchrest rifles with square, 3\"-wide fore-ends, consider building a shelf with 3.5\" rectangular slots instead of the typical tight half-circle cutouts. This will give you a rock-solid mounting point that won't allow the rifle to bang into its neighbor.\n\nIf you have a variety of AR-type rifles, some long and some short, you can build a simple stepped box that sits on the safe's floor. Place your 20+\" ARs on the bottom step and the short-barreled ARs on the upper step. This will allow the barrel heights to be uniform where they contact the rack/shelving system. Extra uppers can be stored horizontally on the top shelf (see below).\n\nInstall Sliding Drawers--Once you've come up with a long-gun racking solution, the next question is where does all the other stuff go? Slide-out drawers are an excellent solution. If you have an extensive handgun collection, you can store your pistols and revolvers very efficiently inside sliding drawers. A 3\" high drawer will have enough clearance to lay the largest handgun on its side, inside a bore-store gun sock. Separate drawers can be used to hold scopes, laser rangefinders, binoculars, and other accessories that don't require a lot of vertical clearance. Another drawer might be used to store jewelry, or a collection of watches. Sliding drawers (which can have individual security locks) will keep these expensive items out of plain view. It's a good idea to place a rubber pad or carpeting inside the drawer.\n\nZanotti Armor makes an excellent modular safe that offers three or five full-width roll-out drawers in the bottom half of the safe. Brown Safe and Citadel offer optional interiors with custom drawer configurations. And many other companies offer a separate \"Safe in a Safe\" locking box for jewelry, cash, and other valuables that you don't want sitting out in the open on your safe's shelves.\n\nWater and Flood Protection\n\nRecommendation: Mount safe above ground level, use premium door seals, and seal all external holes.\n\nOne much overlooked aspect of gun safe performance is the ability to protect the contents from water damage (due to floods, plumbing leaks, or water from fire-fighting). In the aftermath of the flooding in New Orleans, more people are thinking how they can keep water out of their safes. The first thing you can do is create a raised concrete platform. This will also make it easier to access items in the bottom of the safe.\n\nThen, you should ensure that all holes in the safe base or sides are sealed with heat-resistant silicone or similar caulking material. This will also help safeguard the contents from fire damage--you want to eliminate any entry points for extreme heat.\n\nOne safe maker, SentrySafe, recently introduced its ProStaff line of safes with \"FloodGuard\", a proprietary door sealing system using an advanced polymer gasket. Sentry claims its \"polymer seal locking system keeps water out for up to three days, if your gun safe is submerged in up to two feet of water. And FloodGuard protection is spray-resistant for up to 15 minutes, even if your gun safe is drenched with 1,000 gallons of water from a fireman's high-pressure hose.\" The FloodGuard models have been tested and certified by independent laborator ETL Semko to meet SentrySafe's specifications. We haven't immersed a FloodGuard safe to test SentrySafe's claims ourselves, but we are glad that at least one manufacture is looking at this issue. In some house fire situations, the contents of basement-located safes have actually suffered more from flood damage (from the water used to fight the fire), than from the fire itself.\n\nInterior Lighting\n\nRecommendation: Fluorescent lamp supplemented by LED string or rope lighting.\n\nInterior illumination in a safe is not a luxury, it's a practical necessity. If you've ever prowled around in a dark safe in a dimly-lit garage, you'll agree. Thankfully, there are very simple, inexpensive ways to light up a safe. A combination of an overhead fluorescent bulb and small LED lamps on the shelves and sidewalls will provide all the illumination you could want.\n\nUsing the same 120v power cord servicing your dehumidifier, you can attach a low-wattage bulb or fluorescent tube near the top of the safe. The \"long-life\" fluorescent bulbs will run continuously for months with very low power drain. It's easy to rig a contact switch so the light turns on when the door opens, as with a refrigerator. However, if you leave the light running, it will act like a second GoldenRod, warming the safe and helping it to remain moisture-free.\n\nOn the shelves and sidewalls, the best system we've seen employs inexpensive strings of LED mini-lights. These cost $8-$15 per string and are available in the Christmas Supply section of department stores, or you can order them online from Brite-Lite.com. A 70-light LED string draws just 3.6 watts of power. Many safe dealers also sell \"Rope Lighting\" kits, which have LEDs inside a flexible tube. These kits provide good illumination but rope lighting is more expensive than LED string lighting and is more difficult to bend around corners or drape inside shelving units.\n\nThe Zanotti Take-Down Safe\n\nZanotti Armor offers unique take-down safes that are ideal for gun owners who need to move frequently or who live in a location where it is difficult, if not impossible, to position a heavy, conventional one-piece safe. Zanotti safes are very popular with police, military personnel, and other gun owners whose jobs force them to re-locate often. All you need is a hand dolly to move any of the safe's components. Solid steel 3/8\" pins hold the safes together, and the safe can be assembled in about 20 minutes with no tools other than a hammer.\n\nZanotti safes arrive in three or four discrete shipping boxes. For all the neighbors know, you simply received some do-it-yourself furniture. The safe is assembled by the owner, on site, in six simple steps. The heaviest component is the door, weighing 110 pounds in the 16-gun ZAI safe, and 175 pounds in the largest 52-gun ZAIII model. A total of five safe models are offered, ranging from 350 to 925 pounds assembled weight, without interior.\n\nMake no mistake, these are not flimsy gun lockers. Guns Magazine reports: \"The panels are interlocked by 3/8 inch, nickel-plated steel \"L\" shaped pins that slip into steel tubing sections welded to the interior surfaces of the panels. The slip fit is held to a tolerance of .003 inch, and the safes are completely assembled and hand fitted at the factory to insure the panels will align properly when delivered. The body is made from 1/8 inch and 3/16 inch steel; the door from 3/16 inch steel; the locking bolts are 3/4 inch steel; and there is a triple relocking system if the combination lock is tampered with.\" This is heavier gauge steel than you'll find on most conventional gun safes.\n\nZanotti offers many deluxe interiors including a system of roll-out sliding drawers in the bottom of the safe. We think the sliding drawers are ideal for storing handguns and expensive items such as cameras and binoculars that you want to keep out of plain view. Mark Zanotti, the innovative creator of these modular safes, wanted us to know that he can also customize any interior to suit the customer's particular needs. If you want an internal \"safe in a safe\" for added security he can install that. Likewise, he can customize the rifle racks to suit long-barreled rifles with big scopes.\n\nZanotti safes do not employ a separate layer of sheet-rock or ceramic fire lining. However, with their thick steel walls and tight construction, the safes \"do a good job for about 20 minutes in a 1200-degree fire\" according to Mark, who added, \"consumers need to realize that all safes, no matter what brand, are 'fire-resistant', not 'fire-proof'.\"\n\nThe Battle against Rust and Corrosion With any safe, you must take measures to protect the contents from rust and corrosion. A sage once said \"rust never sleeps\". It's kind of pointless to have a big, expensive safe if your valuable firearms are rusting away inside.\n\nThe first thing you should do is attach seals around the door if your safe doesn't have any. This will block the introduction of moist, humid air from the outside. Any rubber-type seal is better than nothing, but the preferred sealing material is Palusol?, in full-length strips. Palusol? expands to provide a very tight seal in the event of fire.\n\nNext, you should coat your firearms with a proven rust preventative. The three best products we've found are BoeShield T-9, CorrosionX, and Eezox. All provide outstanding, long-term protection against rust without leaving a greasy coating on your guns. Eezox goes on wet, but after the carrier evaporates, it leaves a thin, glossy dry-film barrier that doesn't have to be removed before using your firearms. Eezox is our preferred product for high-polish, blued handguns and rifles. CorrosionX and BoeShield leave a dry, wax-like finish on the metal.\n\nWe strongly recommend all firearms be stowed inside Bore-Store gun socks. Bore-Stores are made from a thick, synthetic fleece treated with silicon and rust preventatives. The heavy fleece wicks away moisture from the surfaces of your firearms, while providing very effective protection against nicks and dings. Bore-Stores are relatively inexpensive, and come in a variety of sizes for all types of firearms. We consider them a \"must-have\" item for in-safe storage of fine rifles and shotguns. You can order BoreStores from Grafs.com, Cabelas.com, or Brownells.com. You can often find them for sale at gunshows and larger outdoor retailers.\n\nControlling humidity and temperature inside your safe is also very important. Rust forms much more quickly with moist air and when temperatures rise and fall. An electric warming unit, such as the GoldenRod?, is the best means to regulate temperature inside your safe. The GoldenRod? heats to a surface temperature of about 140? F, helping to maintain warm air throughout your safe on a 24-hour basis. Maintaining a warm temperature in the safe lessens the chance that water vapor will condense and promote rust. We have also found that running a simple light bulb in the safe all the time performs much the same function as a GoldenRod?, with lower initial cost. You can use a plain 20-watt incandescent bulb, or to save on electricity bills, use one of the \"long-life\" fluorescents. Warning: Bulbs can get hot--use only a very low wattage lamp, and be sure to keep the bulb away from papers, wood stocks, fabrics or other contents that can easily ignite.\n\nDesiccant products will absorb moisture out of the air in your safe. They offer handy, inexpensive protection against rust. We recommend putting small desiccant packs in ammo cans and handgun drawers, and a larger desiccant bag or pack on each shelf in your safe. Gun and hobby shops sell desiccants in various sizes, but you can save 80% or more on the price by ordering direct from shipping supply outfits such as Uline.com\n\nThe last line of defense in the war against rust is an active anti-corrosion vapor emitter. BullFrog offers vapor phase corrosion inhibitors (VpCI?s), which employ the same effective anti-rust ingredients used by the military, NATO, and major industries. These are available in strips or stick-on cups for small tool boxes and cabinets. For a large safe, use the Bullfrog Rust Blocker Shield. Priced under $10.00, a single Rust Blocker Shield will protect up to 50 cubic feet of space for one year.\n\nHandgun Storage\n\nPlacement in Safe\n\nI recommend that handguns be placed in the top half of the safe, at eye level if possible. This makes it easier to see what you're looking for. Additionally, in the case of a flood or water leak, if your handguns are stored well above ground level, there's a much better chance they'll stay dry and rust-free. Many locksmiths tell us that water damage is more common with safes than fire loss, particularly with safes stored in a basement or storage area below ground level. And remember, even in the case of fire, your safe may end up \"ankle-deep\" in water once the fire department has done its job.\n\nGun Rugs and Corrosion Protection\n\nBuy a Bore-Store for each one of your handguns. These are inexpensive and come in a variety of sizes to fit everything from a Walther PPK to a 10\" barreled .44 Mag Hunter. Bore stores cushion your pistols and revolvers--keeping them safe from nicks and scratches. The synthetic fleece fabric is treated to inhibit rust, and the fabric wisks moisture away. I have never seen any rust form on guns I've kept in Bore-Stores. Conversely, I've had rust start to form on dies kept in plastic boxes. For $7-$9.00 per gun, a Bore-Store is the best investment you can make. Don't store your precious pistols in plastic gun cases lined with synthetic foam--these can actually \"lock in\" harmful moisture.\n\nSliding Gun Drawers\n\nWhile racks are convenient, I think the best way to store handguns is in pull-out horizontal drawers. Handguns, even big magnum revolvers, are relatively thin, so they fit easily in a drawer. A 3\"-high drawer makes very efficient use of space and offers four-sided protection against nicks and scrapes. Drawers also keep your handguns out of plain view, and can be separately locked. (This is especially important if you have kids.) While it's nice if the drawer interiors are carpeted or cloth-lined, if you use Bore-Stores this isn't that important.\n\nHandgun Racks\n\nA variety of handgun racks are available for in-safe storage. Choose from wood, acrylic, or plasti-coated tubular metal. I've used the latter in my safes and they are hold all types of handguns (both semi-autos and revolvers) very securely. I've found that some of the wood racks crowd the guns too close together. The tubular-type racks, available in four- or six-gun versions, give adequate spacing. In fact, if (as I suggest), you keep your pistols in Bore-Stores the spacing is just about perfect. One other nice thing about the metal racks is that they can be stacked together to clear up space when they're not in use. Another interesting tubular rack is the 12-gun, \"double-decker\" Rack'Em? design available from SportsMansGuide.com for $27.00.\n\nGun-Racks.com makes a nicely-crafted, double-tier wood rack with slots for 12 handguns. Rayon-covered, it is gentle on your guns' finish. This two-level rack showcases a large handgun collection nicely. However, it does take up a lot of space in the safe.\n\nOn-Door Storage\n\nIf you've run out of space to store your sidearms inside the safe, there are a variety of means to mount handguns on the door. The best system I've seen, used by Browning and others, employs plasti-coated tubular metal cradles bolted into the door. These support the gun front and rear very securely; your guns won't shake loose as you open and close the door. That can happen with simple peg mounts that hang handguns by the trigger guard. (If you use pegs, make sure they are mounted at an upward angle or have a 90-degree bend at the end).\n\nAnother door-mount system uses fabric holsters fitted with \"hook and loop\" material on one side. This attaches directly to a carpeted door. I don't like such door holsters for a couple reasons. First, the nylon holster can, over time, abrade the finish of a high-polish blued handgun. Second, the nylon absorbs moisture which can promote rust. Third, over time, if you rearrange the holsters, the Velcro can lose its grip. Most of these holster designs have an open muzzle. So, if the holster works loose as you're inserting the gun, or if the Velcro fails to hold, the crown can be damaged when the gun hits the ground. Keep that in mind if your safe is in a garage or basement with a concrete floor.\n\nStorage in Foam-Lined Gun Cases\n\nMany handgun owners like to keep their guns in the foam-lined cases provided by the factory, or similar aftermarket products. This is a VERY BAD IDEA. That gray foam inside the case is a moisture magnet. It will soak up water vapor and hold it close to the gun, creating a perfect environment for rust to spread. I have one wealthy friend whose gun collection includes a dozen very expensive Colt Single Action Armys. He stored them inside foam-lined Doskocil cases. When I visited him recently I noted (to my horror) that many of his precious Colts were rusting INSIDE their plastic cases. To prevent this, use a good corrosion inhibitor such as Eezox or CorrosionX, and store your guns out of the box, preferrably inside a breathable Bore-Store gun sock.\n\nLow-Cost Gun Safes\n\nUnder $400, Less Than 300 lbs\n\nFor a basic entry-level safe, suited for those on a very tight budget, we were impressed with the SentrySafe product line. The Model G-4211 holds 14 guns (tightly) and weighs 257 lbs. It will fit in the back of an SUV and can be moved relatively easily by a single person with a strap-equipped appliance dolly. Outside Dimensions are 55\" H x 21\" W x 17-3/4\" D, allowing the safe to fit in most closets--but be sure to bolt it in place. The Sentry has some nice features at the price: a hidden storage compartment in the base, door hooks, and well-designed individually adjustable barrel holders. These barrel holders provide better spacing between guns than the typical wood racks found on most gun safes. The Sentry safes also feature a fully-carpeted, Velcro-friendly interior. There is enough height inside to fit a rifle with a 30\" barrel. Shown is model G-4311, identical to the G-4211, except with a digital lock. Purchase a G-4211 from Dean Safe Company for $369.00, or Walmart for $389.49.\n\nUnder $700, Less than 600 lbs\n\nGranite Security, maker of Winchester-brand safes, manufactures a bargain-priced safe for Sam's Club. This is available, on a pick-up basis, for $599.99. While we recommend a bigger, heavier safe with fire-lining, Winchester's Sam's Club Safe is much more secure than thin-walled sheet-metal gun lockers, which typically run $200-$400. With 1\"-thick bolts, 1\" door-jam, and 12-gauge sidewalls, the Sam's Club safe carries a UL Residential Security Container (RSC) rating. The interior is about 56\" high, long enough for 30\"-barreled guns if you remove the top shelf or make some cut-outs. Exterior dimensions are: 60\" H x 30\" W x 22\" D. The convertible interior is designed for 12 guns on the left, or 24 guns (using both sides of the interior), or all shelves. (Realistically, figure 8-10 guns per side). At 575 pounds, the safe is heavy enough that it would be difficult for a thief to move with a dolly. The safe comes pre-drilled with three\n\n7/16\" diameter holes for 3/8\" anchor bolts, plus a dehumidifier access hole. The safe has a UL-listed electronic lock, but we would recommend upgrading to an S&G or LaGard commercial-grade digital lock. Commercial grade locks offer higher-quality keypads with much enhanced long-term reliability.\n\nHorizontal Safes\n\nAfter studying many safe designs, this Editor believes that a horizontal safe, set up much like a wine rack with internal front-loading chambers, would be ideal for long-gun storage. Each rifle would rest in its own steel-shielded box. Imagine a rack with four vertical rows of five rifle \"boxes\". The safe could rest on a heavy concrete base with a swinging door at one end, and the whole unit could be shielded with thick ceramic bricks. The top surface could even be used as a work bench in your loading room.\n\nRight now, no manufacturer offers such a product. However, AMSEC does offer a \"stealth\" horizontal, top-loading safe. Designed to appear like a normal piece of furniture, the AMSEC HC1854 features a lower compartment for rifles with a removable tray on top. Hydraulic piston arms at each end assist door opening and hold the safe door in the raised position.\n\nRecommended Related Articles\n\nGun Safes, by Chris Luchini.

While we’re at it, we might as well play some beer pong, and what better table to use than Tom Sejkora’s PokÃ©mon beer pong table. You read that right, there is a PokÃ©mon beer pong table out there, covered in hundreds of PokÃ©mon cards. Keep reading to take a look!\n\nPretty impressive, no? I contacted Tom and asked him what his inspiration was for the table and how he made it. Here was his response:\n\nMy inspiration? Beer and pokemon obviously. My friends had a table covered in bottlecaps that made out the Irish flag. I thought it was cool, and wanted to try my own design. Originally I collected bottlecaps, but soon realized how much time it would take to collect them all, as well as the cost of coating them and the difficulty of doing so properly. Plus the bottlecap table has been done to death. I was considering fortunes from chinese takeout, and all other sorts of other things, until I realized I had a gajillion pokemon cards that I hadn’t used in years (even though I did play with my friends during class in high school). In case anyone wants to make something similar, the construction of this is fairly easy. I started it at the beginning of winter break last year with a few friends, and it only took a few weeks to finish. Found the table on craigslist for $10. The construction is fairly simple, we laid out the cards in a basic design, then glued them down and sprayed them with a few coats of polyurethane for some light water resistance. After a couple days of drying, we cut an acrylic sheet I bought into the proper sizes (since the table folds). We glued them down with epoxy and I used silicone to seal the sides a bit better. I covered it with black trim (electrical tape) to make it look a bit better, as well as further waterproof it. I want to replace the tape/trim with much sturdier gorilla tape, as it’s coming loose on some edges, but I’ve been lazy and its still waterproofed very well.\n\nOn a side note, I don’t even like playing beer pong, and I’m absolutely atrocious at it. But its fun to have at parties, the table is a great conversation piece, and I had a blast making it.\n\nHe also mentioned that there is a hidden secret somewhere on the table. Can you see it?

  "latent_20153": "NEW DELHI: Traders and stockists seem to be making a killing as onion prices have soared across the country in the past 2-3 weeks. The staple kitchen item was selling at around Rs 80 per kg in the market in Delhi, as a substantial jump in prices was reported from Delhi's wholesale mandis. Prices of pulses have also gone up considerably in the past three weeks.Now there are fears whether the retail price of onion will touch Rs 100 a kg or even surpass that as supply remained deficient.Data shows arrival of onion in Delhi on Friday was about 1,300 tonnes, which is over 50% of the total arrival in all mandis in Maharashtra. The arrival at Delhi's mandis was nearly 900 tonnes exactly a year back when the wholesale price was half of the prevailing prices.Observers said that the unprecedented increase in prices is artificial and traders want to maximize profit before government imports huge quantity of onion, which is likely to happen by mid September.Meanwhile, sources in the consumer affairs department said that so far only three states – Odisha, Telangana and West Bengal - have notified stock limits for traders to store onion at any given point of time. It's far more critical in the case of major onion producing states where traders are stocking the key kitchen item since there is no restriction on storage.\"The price has gone up substantially after there was news that the first effort to import 5,000 tonnes of onion did not happen. So, traders are holding up their stocks for prices to spike further,\" said government official.He added that the critical phase would continue till September last week when fresh produce from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat start arriving at mandis.On Friday, average quality of onion was selling at Rs 5,400 a quintal in Asia's largest onion mandi, Lasalgaon while high quality produce was available around Rs 5,800. In Pimpalgaon, onion was trading at Rs 4,900 a quintal.Arrivals have declined significantly in the last one month. In Lasalgaon, onion arrivals fell to 240 tonnes on Friday from 1,021 tonnes on July 21.On the other hand, government effort to import both urad and arhar pulses have failed to moderate the prices. In fact, price of arhar has increased by Rs 15-20 across cities in the past three weeks, while urad, moong and masoor also haven't seen any drop in price.",

  "latent_20428": "http://gty.im/631185664\n\nAdam Ostermeier Breakdown The Best And Worst Detroit Lions.\n\nWelcome to the latest installment of the Detroit Lions Best and Worst All Time series. If you’re interested in following along from the beginning click here to go back to the introduction. If you see something you agree or disagree with or even if you just want to share your feelings on a particular player or moment share your thoughts in the Detroit Lions’ subreddit.\n\nThe Best: Matthew Stafford\n\nDespite being only 29 years old, Matthew Stafford is unquestionably the most talented quarterback in franchise history. Taken first overall in the 2009 NFL draft, this product of the Lions’ infamous 0-16 season has been a blessing for a team that desperately needed it.\n\nOne of the most powerful arms in the NFL, Stafford exploded on to the scene in 2011 after struggling with injuries his first two years. He became just the 5th quarterback ever to throw for 5,000 yards in a season and also tossed 41 touchdowns. When looking at the statistics he’s already 44th all time in passing yardage and 49th in passing touchdowns.\n\nIf he can simply continue on with his average yearly performance, Stafford should be in or around the top 10 of both those categories in the next 4-5 seasons. Blazing trails as the youngest QB to reach many season and career milestones there’s no telling where he can get to on the NFL’s all time numbers list.\n\nAfter several years of being the NFL’s high octane boom or bust arm cannon, Stafford matured and altered his game over the 2015 and 2016 seasons with new offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter.\n\nThe results have been less high risk, high reward plays, reduced interception numbers, and an almost 10 point boost in his completion percentage. Due to an early exit from Georgia at only 21 years of age, he has the distinction of being both one of the best young arm talents in the game, and a seasoned veteran in his prime entering his 9th year in the league. Truly taking over as the leader of the Detroit Lions now, with a developing young team that can support him going forward, it will be fun to watch what Stafford can do going forward.\n\nThe most notable point that will be remembered about Matthew Stafford when he is discussed in the future however will be the comebacks. Stafford has always been known for his countless examples of late game heroics, starting with his rookie year against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nOn the second to last play of the game Stafford scrambled and threw a deep ball prayer to the end zone before getting levelled and suffering a major separation in his non throwing shoulder. The rest became history that I will let the great Steve Sabol tell:\n\nIn those few minutes Stafford won over the city of Detroit and took one big step toward becoming a legend in the city. Since then he’s contributed to his comeback resume with the fake spike against Dallas, the miracle in London, and of course last year’s record setting most comebacks in a season. While I like the stability that a new regime is providing through talent around the roster and settling down Stafford’s play, here’s hoping we get to ride this Stafford-coaster for years to come.\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nOf course worth also mentioning is the clear number two Lions quarterback of all time Bobby Layne. The hard partying gunslinger was the Tom Brady of the 50’s leading the Lions to four championships and three NFL titles in eight seasons. Truly beloved by his teammates, he was the consummate leader that got an elite group of players to rally behind him on the way to dominating the competition. While he had his share of controversies, Layne was an exciting talent, forever changing the game as the innovator of the two-minute offence. Despite the curse he’s bestowed upon the franchise after his unceremonious trade to Pittsburgh in 1958, he will always be one of it’s favourite and most recognized players.\n\nIf you want one QB moment that truly was one of the greatest in Lions history you cannot forget Eric Hipple’s Monday night game against the Bears in 1981. Season starter Gary Danielson was already out for the year with a dislocated wrist and backup Jeff Komlo just wasn’t getting the job done, so coach Monte Clark decided to start his third QB Hipple in a hugely important divisional game to the surprise of almost everyone. Hipple paid his coach back and then some for the opportunity, scoring six touchdowns in a 48-17 demolishing of the Bears. Hipple created a career for himself in one game, playing another seven seasons for the team with varying levels of success.\n\nThe Worst: Karl Sweetan\n\nSurprisingly in this process it was one of the greatest challenges to crown one player the worst Lions quarterback of all time. Why you ask? Simply put: because there have been a whole lot of bad ones. That being said however, for me Karl Sweetan takes the cake. Sweetan was the Lions starter on and off for the ’66 and ’67 seasons, leading them to a 6-12-2 record in games he played. It became quite obvious to every fan his carelessness with the football was his biggest issue.\n\nSweetan averaged an interception every 19 throws in Detroit, completing only 47.5% of his passes, and 14 touchdowns. This resulted in him having a 53.1 quarterback rating in that two year period, one of the worst of all time among starters.\n\nTo put that number into perspective, the worst quarterback rating a starter has received in this decade was Jimmy Clausen in 2010 at 58.4, over 5 points higher then Sweetan’s two year average. While it may not be fair to jump on a 249th overall pick for sucking after getting thrown into action he was never ready for, he still deserves this title.\n\nThe Lions cut ties with Sweetan after drafting Gregg Landry and trading for Bill Munson in the 1968 offseason. He went on to actually play his worst football as a backup in New Orleans. In three starts and 5 total games he put up an absolutely ridiculous 34.6 completion percentage, completing only 27 of 78 throws, and a quarterback rating of 12.6. After two years riding the bench for the LA Rams he called it a career, only to pop back into the news a few years later for trying to sell one of his play books for some quick cash.\n\nOutside of his poor play and forgettably short time as a Lions quarterback, Sweetan will probably be best known for either one of three things. He’s tied for the longest completion in NFL history at 99 yards…. in garbage time of a game the Lions lost to the Baltimore Colts 45-14. He also remarkably managed to take his teams to three ties in 19 starts, two of those ties coming for Detroit. His most infamous reason for being known however might be that he played himself in the film Paper Lion. Instead of celebrating the tail end of a great era of Lions football with Gregg Landry, or catching the earlier domination of Bobby Layne, if you want to watch this fun little movie literally based around the Detroit Lions you have to suffer through knowing that the worst Lions quarterback of all time is immortalized with a great group of Lions legends. Through no fault of his own that might be Sweetan’s biggest sin as it will never go away.\n\nhttp://gty.im/83237653\n\nDishonourable Mentions\n\nIf we’re going for worst Lions disappointments of all time, it would be tough to argue against Joey Harrington for that title. Seen as the Lions saviour at long last, Harrington was taken 3rd overall in 2002 and could never come close to living up to the hype. Rather then getting the time he needed to develop as a player, our good friend Matt Millen and the Detroit Lions front office totally botched Harrington’s development from every aspect. He got no help from any decent picks around him either on the o-line or at skill positions, and he went through drastic scheme changes under Steve Mariucci. By the end of his time in Detroit he was physically abused and emotionally distraught. While some fans may want to give him the title of the lions worst due to the pain he caused, he still showed flashes of ability that will keep him away from that title. Unfortunately he just never had a chance to put it all together.\n\nI may be playing with recency bias here, however Dan Orlovsky running out of the back of the end zone in the lions 0-16 season of 2008 might be the single most painful moment in Lions history. When things were at absolute bottom in the middle of an absolutely abysmal season Orlovsky, terrified and running for his life from unblocked Jarred Allen, turned the Lions through the bottom to unknown dark matter shadowy depths of despair territory. Forever after known as ‘Safety Dan’ he had an alright tail to his career as a nice backup to Matthew Stafford, but that one moment is arguably the worst quarterback black spot in Lions history.\n\nIf you would like to see more in this series follow the link below:\n\nIntroduction Click here",
  "latent_20552": "He’s slain a dragon in The Battle Of The Five Armies and played the vampiric Count in Dracula Untold, now Welsh actor Luke Evans is hitting cinema screens in blockbuster The Girl On The Train – an adaptation of the best-selling thriller that got commuters everywhere totally hooked. Audi and partner Curzon were delighted to host an advanced screening and exclusive Q&A with script editor Kate Leys and Oscar winning producer Mia Bays a few days ago, and we even managed to sit down with Luke before his Audi A8 picked him up for the airport...\n\nLondon or LA? London is my home, it’s been my home for 20 years. I’ve wanted to live here ever since I was a child.\n\nHeroes or villains? Both heroes and villains are fun to play as they both come with their own challenges. The Girl On The Train was a thoroughly rewarding experience, and getting to work with Emily Blunt was a bucket-list moment for me.\n\nThe book or the film? I’m not a huge bookworm, although I read a lot of scripts, which are like mini novels! If I’m shooting a film that is an adaptation of a book then of course I will read the book.\n\nRugby or football? Rugby has always been a family favourite sport in our household. We were brought up playing it, we were brought up watching it, and I still think one of the most amazing experiences you can have is watching Wales play at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nInstagram or Twitter? Both are interesting platforms – Instagram is more arty but Twitter is more immediate.\n\nHome or away? People ask me where I go on holiday, and my usual answer is home, because I spend so little time there.\n\nStage or screen? I don’t prefer one to the other, they are both incredible mediums. Theatre obviously is live and you have an audience but with film you’re able to tweak and redo scenes as you go along. They are too different for me to be able to choose one.\n\nDrive or be driven? Probably the most rewarding experience in my life as a driver has been to drive an Audi car – from the R8 to the SQ5. Also, being driven in an A8 to a red carpet event always makes you feel a little bit royal!\n\nTechnophile or technophobe? I love technology and gadgets. It sometimes takes me a little while to get my head around some of them, but they’re amazing. Most of my house is digital and I can access most things from my iPhone.\n\nHalf-full or half-empty? Always half-full. I had a teacher who used to say, ‘Some people walk in the rain and others get wet.’\n\nCats or dogs? I don’t have any pets now but I had cats during my childhood. I’d love a dog, but sadly with all the travelling I do it’s too impractical.\n\nRule keeper or rebel? I think I’m probably more of a rebel than a rule keeper. Let’s just leave it there…\n\nBeach or backpack? I backpacked around Southeast Asia for three months when I was 23 and I loved every second of it.\n\nNight out or night in? I can enjoy a great night out as much as I can enjoy sitting in front of the TV with a bowl of popcorn and the fire on.\n\nHigh culture or pop culture? I like to mix up culture. Through Audi I’ve been to many ballets and operas which I have loved, but I quite like a bit of pop culture now and again too.\n\nWritten by Emma Barlow. Photographs by Alexander Rhind.\n\nFind out more about the Audi A8 range",
  "latent_20557": "Donald Trump. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Richard Cordray, the recently departed head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, both named separate successors at the agency following Cordray's abrupt Friday exit, creating a fresh battle in Washington that could have significant ramifications for the agency that sprang up out of the financial crisis.\n\nBoth sides have claimed legal authority over the other to name the successor to an agency that was championed by the likes of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. It has also been vilified by much of the right, including by Office of Budget and Management Director Mick Mulvaney, the person named acting director of the CFPB by Trump on Friday night.\n\nCordray, who is expected by many to make a bid for Ohio's Democratic gubernatorial nomination, announced an earlier-than-expected departure from the agency Friday. He named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as the acting director of the CFPB. Cordray, nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the agency, announced that he would leave the position earlier this month.\n\nThat means on Monday, in all likelihood and unless some sort of agreement can be reached in the interim, two people will begin the work day believing they are running the agency.\n\nTrump weighed in Saturday afternoon on Twitter, calling the agency a \"disaster.\"\n\n\"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick,\" he said. \"Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!\"\n\nTwo sides start to take shape\n\nAfter announcing Mulvaney, who once called the agency a \"sick, sad joke,\" as acting director, the White House argued that the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for Trump to override Cordray's selection. Those in opposition cited the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the agency, as evidence that Cordray, and not Trump, has the proper authority to name a replacement until a Trump-chosen successor is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDodd-Frank calls for the agency's deputy director to serve as acting director when the director is absent or unavailable. Meanwhile, the Federal Vacancies Act allows for Trump to appoint any Senate-confirmed official, such as Mulvaney, as acting director of such an agency. Mulvaney will remain OMB director while serving as the CFPB's acting director.\n\nMick Mulvaney. REUTERS/Carlos Barria The White House, which said in a statement that Trump looks forward to Mulvaney taking \"a common sense approach to leading the CFPB's dedicated staff\" that \"will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,\" made its argument in a conference call with reporters Saturday morning.\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on background, called the move \"typical\" and \"routine\" with years of precedent to back it up. They said the Federal Vacancies Act allows for Trump to supersede Dodd-Frank.\n\n\"The common objections that you hear in these various blog posts online is that, 'Oh, the CFPB statue said the CFPB deputy director shall serve as the director,\" one White House official said, according to The Hill. \"That's clear in lots of these statues that the Vacancies Act trumps.\"\n\nThe official added that the White House doesn't expect this clash to turn into a legal dispute.\n\n\"I know it makes it a better story if things are unpleasant and there's a clash of two directors, but I don't think it's [at] all clear that's going to happen,\" they said. \"I think there's a very good chance that Director Mulvaney will come in on Monday morning and that will be end of things.\"\n\nBut the official said Cordray's move to appoint a successor indicates \"that he is trying to provoke\" such a legal battle.\n\nMost prominently arguing in favor of Cordray's right to appoint his interim successor was Warren, who tweeted Friday that Trump \"can nominate the next @CFPB Director — but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act.\"\n\nOthers agreed that the Trump administration has the proper authority to name the interim successor, regardless of Dodd-Frank's language.\n\nTrump \"is right,\" tweeted conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \"Director Mulvaney is running @CFPB. If anyone tells him to pound sand, they'll be pounding the pavement ala PATCO. We are not a government of unelected bureaucrats.\"",

  "latent_20590": "Donald Trump’s ‘global gag rule’ could align US with Iran, Sudan, Syria and other countries targeted by US travel ban at Commission on the Status of Women\n\nUS may go cheek by jowl with women’s rights abusers at UN gender talks\n\nUS negotiators at this week’s UN Commission on the Status of Women could find themselves standing shoulder to shoulder with some of the world’s worst violators of women’s rights, activists have warned.\n\nDonald Trump’s reinstatement of the “global gag rule” and his proposed funding cuts to the UN are expected to embolden right-wing conservative groups seeking to undermine women’s rights during the CSW talks in New York.\n\nThe rule, which Trump reintroduced on his fourth day in the White House, restricts overseas NGOs from receiving US aid if any of their work touches on abortion. It will critically hinder the lifesaving work of organisations involved in family planning, maternal and child health, and in HIV and cervical cancer prevention and care. Trump has also said he is reviewing funding to the UN population fund, the UNFPA.\n\nIn the first real test of the Trump administration’s stance on women’s rights on the international stage, the US delegation may find itself firmly aligned with conservative countries including Iran, Sudan and Syria – among the six countries targeted in Trump’s revised travel ban.\n\nThese countries are notorious in their attempts to water down language on women’s rights – not least on sexual and reproductive health, what constitutes a family, and the protection of female activists – during the annual CSW discussions, which begin on Monday.\n\n“It’s very likely we will see the US standing shoulder to shoulder with Russia, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Sudan, the very countries it has named in its latest ban,” said Shannon Kowalski, director of advocacy and policy at the International Women’s Health Coalition. “Shoulder to shoulder with some of the worst abusers of women’s rights around the world.”\n\nAt this year’s CSW – a two-week forum designed to advance women’s rights globally, but in reality a display of geo-politics and a battleground to preserve decades-old agreements on promoting gender equality – UN member states will be asked to agree an action plan on accelerating economic opportunities for women.\n\nEarlier this year, the World Economic Forum predicted that, at the current pace of change, it will take another 170 years for economic equality between men and women to be achieved.\n\nBut campaigners worry the reinstatement of the “gag rule” – also known as the Mexico City policy – could encourage conservative campaigners to lobby delegates into taking a more hardline stance in negotiations. The travel ban has already prevented some activists from attending the CSW, while others have decided to boycott the event.\n\nKowalski said there was a risk that such groups could reach out to the US delegation to oppose language on sexual and reproductive health and rights. “It may cause some groups to harden their positions and dig in more.”\n\nSerra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, said: “Our hope is that the US will align with countries that respect and uphold human rights.”\n\nHowever, she voiced concern about the new US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. “Given Haley’s statement during her confirmation hearing that she will do anything to keep women from having access to information and services related to abortion, we rightfully are concerned about the US joining in an unholy alliance with member states and observers that are hostile to gender equality and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the ambassador will be directly involved in the CSW negotiations this year.\n\nCynthia Rothschild, a feminist activist and former consultant with the UN high commissioner for human rights, said: “The interesting question will be about how other [UN member] states show backbone in resisting conservative US policy.”\n\nThe Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Finland have already pledged millions of dollars to help plug the gap in funding expected from US cuts.\n\nRothschild’s view was echoed by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of UN Women. She said initial discussions with the US team had gone well, but added: “I am relying on the other member states who are equally powerful and up to the task to really step it up and stand for things we believe in, support the countries with information, data and so on.”\n\nCountries pledge millions to plug hole left by US 'global gag rule' Read more\n\nShe added that the fact the “gag rule” has been extended to include not just family planning programmes but all US-funded health programmes “has galvanised a much stronger base who want to protect the rights of women fully”.\n\nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), said women’s chances of getting a decent job rest on their ability to access healthcare services and have control over their bodies.\n\n“The inclusion of sexual and reproductive health and rights must be central to the CSW agenda as women’s opportunities to access decent work and to stay in work are shaped by them being able to act on their sexual and reproductive health and rights,” said Preethi Sundaram, policy and advocacy adviser at IPPF.\n\n“Given the current political climate, in particular the re-enactment and expansion of the global gag rule, we are concerned that these rights are more vulnerable than ever.”\n\nChiara Capraro, policy and advocacy manager for economic rights at Womankind, said: “We remain concerned the needless pulling of funds from reproductive health by the US might overshadow important discussions to garner a shared understanding and advance the thinking and commitment of governments in addressing economic inequalities, improve women’s rights in the world of work, and move towards an economic model that works for women.”\n\nShe added that she believed the reintroduction of the “gag rule” presented “a nightmare situation for women globally”.",
  "latent_20622": "In addition to finding a baby sitter or a contractor, a private social media website will now connect Baltimore residents with their local district police commander.\n\nStarting Wednesday, Baltimore police commanders will begin communicating with residents on Nextdoor.com, a private social network already in use in more than 200 city community groups. The officers will be able to tailor specific information to a single neighborhood, or even sections or a neighborhood.\n\n\"Nextdoor is a powerful tool because it gives us the ability to target messages by area,\" said Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. Nextdoor will provide \"a direct line of communication with residents about important and often critical updates about crime and other critical events,\" he said.\n\nThe department also plans to share information about ongoing events and services, in addition to ongoing crime or breaking situations.\n\nThe website is free but requires users to create a log in where they must validate their home address and enter their full name before they can access the site or share information within the community. The police department will only see its own posts and not have access other posts on neighborhood sites.\n\nDavis said the website will enhance police-community relations. \"The more transparent the police department is, the better we're connected with our community and the safer we become\" Davis said.\n\nBaltimore resident Earl Johnson, a member on Nextdoor's Oliver community group, said he started the group because it was an easier way to communicate with his neighbors rather than passing our fliers.\n\nDuring the April unrest, he said he fielded many concerns from residents about whether they were safe in the neighborhood.\n\nThey asked \"should I stay or should I leave,\" Johnson recalled. \"If it wasn't for the information pouring into Nextdoor about what was going on in my neighborhood… I don't think I would have been able to answer that question.\"\n\nUltimately, he advised his neighbors to stay, he said because other residents said they felt safe. \"I knew they felt safe because we were communicating through Nextdoor,\" he said.\n\njkanderson@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/janders5",
  "latent_20673": "My father’s unexpected death in 2010 suddenly thrust me into managing a business I was totally unprepared to run. Overnight, I inherited two inseparable realities:\n\nWe had a growing stack of overdue bills from people and places I’d never heard of, all demanding payment right away. Meanwhile, the company bank account was basically empty, because nobody was collecting the money that customers owed us (that had been my dad’s responsibility).\n\nThese twin problems were two sides of the same horrible coin, and felt completely intractable. How could I pay anyone unless someone paid us first?\n\nNothing in school had prepared me to enter the world of negotiating, collecting, or paying down debts. I always thought of debt as a dirty word; I never carried a balance on my credit card, and diligently made slightly-higher-than-minimum payments on my student loans. Now I was confronted with a problem I could barely wrap my head around, and I didn’t know where to start.\n\nDebt collectors, though, know exactly where to start — and when. The first time I received a collections call, I was in my mom’s apartment, lacing up my shoes the morning of my father’s funeral. A deep-voiced man was calling about some overdue credit card bill, and I quickly said, “I’ll pay as soon I can.”\n\n“But when?” came the angry reply. For someone who’s used to cheerful call center reps from Zappos and LL Bean, the direct aggression of a collections agent can be jarring. Collections companies make their money by being intimidating and menacing — the industry is rife with well-documented abuse, but it’s also highly regulated. I needed to figure out how to play by the rules of the game until we could comfortably pay what we owed.\n\nI said “soon,” and quickly hung up, trembling and scared.\n\nFrom my tiny grad school apartment, I pored over our balance sheets. The business made money — but where was it, and why wasn’t it in our bank account?\n\nThe answer was: It was still with the customers. People who were always slow to pay my dad when he was alive, more or less stopped paying altogether after he died. I started calling customers one by one to introduce myself and feel things out.\n\nAt first I played it cool and sheepish about the money they owed us. “Do you think you’ll be able to pay us this week?” To my relief, most of them actually said yes.\n\nAnd then… exactly nothing happened. Nobody paid us anything. I felt like an idiot.\n\nOur lawyer told me I could “get more aggressive” about collecting our due. I needed to become less timid about the mounting trouble we were in. Taking a cue from the collectors on my back, I started getting annoyingly persistent. I’d call customers daily, my tone becoming clipped. I’d ask when, precisely, I should expect payment. If someone said they needed to call me back later, I would say, “No — what time will you have an answer for me? I’ll call you back then.” And then I would.\n\nMy father probably worried about alienating his customers, even when they were behind on their bills. I didn’t have that luxury — I was behind on my bills, and whatever loyalty my dad felt to his clients didn’t transfer to me. I felt fully justified in becoming a major dick.\n\nCollection calls from the other side were coming day and night on my personal cell from unknown numbers, and I was always too scared they’d be business-related emergencies that I wouldn’t just let them go to voicemail. I learned that many debt collectors will begin the call by asking for the debtor by name, before identifying themselves and what they’re after. When I knew I couldn’t pay, I would have awkward routines with call center reps:\n\nCollections agent: “Hello, I’m calling from [bank]. May I please speak to [name]?”\n\nMe: “May I ask what this is regarding?”\n\nHim: “Am I speaking with [name]?”\n\nMe: “What is this in reference to?”\n\nWe’d go back and forth like this a few more times, but they’d always end the call before explaining what he was calling about. That was usually good enough to buy me a couple more weeks until I could send them a check.\n\nSome debts turned out to be negotiable. One bill was for a portion of an old insurance policy, long expired but never fully paid off. My lawyer told me I’d need to pay something, but that I could try talking them down. Emboldened, I offered the snarling collector half of the total amount owed, but said I’d need to pay over six months. That was my red-herring.\n\n“Or,” I said, my voice shaking. “I can pay you 30 percent of the total right now. I could put that check in the mail today. Does that work?” I remember pushing mute on my phone so that she couldn’t hear my breathing.\n\nIt turned out the magic words were “right now” and “today.” The 30 percent offer was cheerfully accepted. I asked for confirmation of the agreement in writing — a full and complete release from the debt in exchange for a 30 percent payment right away. Then I sent them the check.\n\nMeanwhile, I began practicing my own collections routines in the mirror or with my girlfriend. “When will you pay?” I’d say sharply to an overdue customer on the phone. “This is now several weeks overdue. Will you send a check today? Tomorrow? When?”\n\nI became distrustful. If a customer said they were mailing a check, I’d ask if I could collect it in person instead. Offering to show up at somebody’s office — and then actually hauling myself to Queens or Westchester to do it — was super effective.\n\nI would negotiate on this side of the equation, too. If a customer owed us, say, $20,000, I might offer a small discount if they paid right away. Channeling my inner tough-guy, I ominously added that the offer would expire at the end of the day. “Clock’s ticking,” I’d say.\n\nAs I perfected my own techniques for stalling creditors, I became intolerant of others’ excuses: Our accounting system is down. Our office only sends checks once a month. The guy who does your invoices is out sick. I need to talk to my supervisor. Our office just moved. We leave early on Fridays.\n\nI don’t care about the reason, I replied flatly, my adrenaline coursing with righteous indignation. All I need is a check. All I want is the goddamn money you owe us, so I can pay this other goddamn company that’s breathing down my neck. Can I come by in an hour?\n\nI think many small business owners go on like this forever: locked in a perpetual cycle of paying and collecting, never sure if you’ll have enough cash to make it through the month. Behind every transaction is a complex calculus of what can be deferred and what can be collected, and from whom, and by when. Your ability to pay depends on your place in the food chain — who you owe, who they owe, and so on.\n\nBut to me, this all felt sleazy and horrible — dodging and stalling bill collectors, playing the heavy with people I barely knew and giving them a hard time when they couldn’t or wouldn’t pay. When the time seemed right, I wrapped things up and sold the business. I sometimes miss the rush I’d get from putting the squeeze on people to collect money. But I never miss being on the receiving end of that squeeze.\n\nMatt Baer lives in New York and no longer owns a bus company.

  "latent_20720": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nAn Atlanta man who was arrested after being the first to widely share a viral video of a man being killed by the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, claims he was detained in retaliation for distributing the recording.\n\nChris LeDay, a 34-year-old Air Force veteran, did not film the video of Alton Sterling, a husband and father of five who was shot by police outside a Louisiana convenience store last Tuesday. But LeDay used to live in Baton Rouge, and he posted the video—which he says he got from a friend of the videographer—on July 5 after Sterling’s death. “I wanted to share it a zillion times and make sure everyone saw it,” LeDay told Mother Jones via phone. “The police were already saying their body cameras had fallen off.”\n\nThe next day, LeDay was detained by military security while going through a routine checkpoint for his job at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, a security procedure he told Mother Jones he had been through “at least 15 times” without issue. Military officers handcuffed LeDay, a black man, and told him that he met the description of someone wanted for assault and battery. Shortly afterward, officers from the nearby Dunwoody Police Department took LeDay in handcuffs and leg shackles to Dekalb County Jail.\n\nIn jail, LeDay was booked on a charge of “failure to appear.” According to LeDay, it wasn’t until he was in transit to Dekalb that he was told he’d actually been arrested over an unpaid traffic infraction, the result of an outstanding ticket issued in July 2014. That earlier citation involved driving on a suspended license, as well as vehicle registration and improper headlights charges. According to Dunwoody PD, a judge had issued a warrant for his arrest two summers ago after LeDay failed to pay the sum. All told, LeDay spent 26 hours in jail and was released July 7 after paying $1,231 in fines.\n\nThe spokesperson at Dobbins told Mother Jones that the base had in June signed off on a base pass for LeDay, who had started working there as a ground technician about a month before his arrest. The spokesperson said the open warrant was found during an additional screening of several contractor pass applications on July 6, and that base security notified Dunwoody PD and agreed to detain LeDay the next time he came to work.\n\nThe Dunwoody Police Department confirmed that timeline but said LeDay’s arrest was unrelated to the Facebook post. “If Mr. LeDay had paid his fines or appeared in Court and settled the matter approximately two years ago, a warrant for Failure to Appear would not have been issued and Mr. LeDay would not have been arrested on these charges,” according to Mark Stevens, Dunwoody’s public information officer. Dunwoody PD deny that the assault and battery charge was ever alleged, but Captain Meredith Kirchoff, chief of public affairs at Dobbins, told Mother Jones via email that there was indeed “a note of a previous battery charge” on the open warrant. LeDay says he’s never been arrested or charged with battery.\n\nLeDay still believes the police action was a retaliatory measure intended to embarrass him and threaten his job security. Since the arrest, LeDay says his manager has asked him not to come into work. “It’s still up in the air,” said LeDay. Despite attempts to clarify his legal status, he is unsure if he will be allowed to return in the future. “I’d like to have my job back, but at this point I’m losing wages and my reputation is being questioned.”\n\nLeDay’s claims raise parallels to Ramsey Orta, who recorded Eric Garner’s death in July 2014, after New York City police placed Garner in a headlock during a confrontation over sidewalk cigarette sales. Orta, 24, claims he has been subject to persistent police mistreatment since Garner’s death and recently entered pleas on multiple drug and weapons charges stemming from three separate arrests since August 2014. He has been described as the only person at the scene of Garner’s killing to be charged with a crime.",

  "latent_21252": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg agreed on Friday on the Western alliance’s “enduring importance”, NATO said, striving to reassure Europe that Washington will remain committed to its security.\n\nTrump questioned during his election campaign whether the United States should protect allies seen as spending too little on their defense, raising fears that he could withdraw funding for NATO at a time of heightened tensions with Russia.\n\n“The president-elect and the secretary general both underlined NATO’s enduring importance and discussed how NATO is adapting to the new security environment, including to counter the threat of terrorism,” NATO said in a statement after a phone conversation between Trump and Stoltenberg.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Trump’s side.\n\nThe NATO statement said the Republican Trump, who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, is expected in Brussels for a NATO summit next year.\n\nThe two leaders also addressed defense spending and agreed that “progress has been made on fairer burden-sharing, but that there is more to do” - underlining the fact that the United States spends far more on defense than Europe does.\n\nAfter the break-up of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago, NATO’s European members cut defense spending to historic lows, leaving the United States to make up around three quarters of the alliance’s military expenditure.\n\nA more assertive Russia under President Vladimir Putin has begun to change the picture and European governments are again spending more.\n\nFEW MEET DEFENSE SPENDING TARGET\n\nBut Britain, Poland, Greece and Estonia are the only European nations to meet a NATO goal of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, spends far less than 2 percent of its GDP on defense.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg delivers a speech on European defence and transatlantic security at the German Marshall Fund think-tank in Brussels, Belgium, November 18, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nSpeaking before the phone call, Stoltenberg told a conference in Brussels that European defense spending was one of his top priorities and that he had raised it with every NATO member, winning support from defense ministers.\n\nHe said the main obstacle was convincing the respective finance ministers who have the keys to treasuries.\n\n“You have to increase defense spending when tensions go up,” Stoltenberg said, citing as evidence failing states in North and West Africa, the threat of Islamist militants and Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s peninsula of Crimea.\n\n“Stop the cuts and gradually increase (defense spending) to reach 2 percent (of economic output) is a very robust message. We have started to move although there is a very long way to go. I am certain Trump will make this his top priority (for NATO).”\n\nTrump’s campaign suggestion of making U.S. defense of its European allies conditional appeared to question the central tenet of NATO - namely that an armed attack against one ally is an attack against all.\n\nStoltenberg has said he expects an overall 3 percent real increase in European defense spending in 2016. He said on Friday that if all European allies and Canada reached the 2 percent spending target, it would yield an extra $100 billion for NATO.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk also spoke to Trump by phone on Friday.

  "latent_21376": "AD-1 The AD-1 with its wing at a moderate angle Role Experimental aircraft National origin United States Manufacturer Ames Industrial Co. Designer Burt Rutan First flight December 21, 1979 Retired August 1982 Primary user NASA Number built 1 Unit cost USD $240,000\n\nThe NASA AD-1 was both an aircraft and an associated flight test program conducted between 1979 and 1982 at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards California, which successfully demonstrated an aircraft wing that could be pivoted obliquely from zero to 60 degrees during flight.\n\nThe unique oblique wing was demonstrated on a small, subsonic jet-powered research aircraft called the AD-1 (Ames-Dryden-1). The aircraft was flown 79 times during the research program, which evaluated the basic pivot-wing concept and gathered information on handling qualities and aerodynamics at various speeds and degrees of pivot.\n\nProject background [ edit ]\n\nThe first known oblique wing design was the Blohm & Voss P.202, proposed by Richard Vogt in 1942.[1]\n\nThe oblique wing concept was later promoted by Robert T. Jones, an aeronautical engineer at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California.\n\nAnalytical and wind tunnel studies Jones initiated at Ames indicated that a transport-size oblique-wing aircraft, flying at speeds up to Mach 1.4 (1.4 times the speed of sound), would have substantially better aerodynamic performance than aircraft with more conventional wings.\n\nAt high speeds, both subsonic and supersonic, the wing would be pivoted at up to 60 degrees to the aircraft's fuselage for better high-speed performance. The studies showed these angles would decrease aerodynamic drag, permitting increased speed and longer range with the same fuel expenditure.\n\nAt lower speeds, during takeoffs and landings, the wing would be perpendicular to the fuselage like a conventional wing to provide maximum lift and control qualities. As the aircraft gained speed, the wing would be pivoted to increase the oblique angle, thereby reducing the drag and decreasing fuel consumption. The wing could only be swept in one direction, with the right wingtip moving forward.\n\nAircraft [ edit ]\n\nThe AD-1 aircraft was delivered to Dryden in February 1979. The Ames Industrial Co., Bohemia, New York, constructed it, under a US$240,000 fixed-price contract. NASA specified the overall vehicle design using a geometric configuration studied by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Seattle, Washington. The Rutan Aircraft Factory, Mojave, California, provided the detailed design and load analysis for the intentionally low-speed, low-cost aircraft (there, the aircraft was known internally as the Model 35). The low speed and cost, of course, limited the complexity of the vehicle and the scope of its technical objectives.\n\nPiloting the aircraft on its first flight December 21, 1979, was NASA research pilot Thomas C. McMurtry, who was also the pilot on the final flight August 7, 1982. Another well-known test pilot involved in the project was Pete Knight.\n\nThe AD-1 was powered by two small Microturbo TRS18-046 turbojet engines, each producing 220 pounds of static thrust at sea level. These were essentially the same engines used in the BD-5J. The aircraft was limited for reasons of safety to a speed of about 170 mph.\n\nThe AD-1 was 38.8 feet (11.8 m) in length and had a wingspan of 32.3 feet (9.8 m) unswept. It was constructed of plastic reinforced with fiberglass, in a sandwich with the skin separated by a rigid foam core. It had a gross weight of 2,145 pounds, and an empty weight of 1,450 pounds.\n\nA fixed tricycle landing gear, mounted close to the fuselage to lessen aerodynamic drag, gave the aircraft a very \"squatty\" appearance on the ground. It was only 6.75 feet (2.06 m) high. The wing was pivoted by an electrically-driven gear mechanism located inside the fuselage, just forward of the engines.\n\nFlight research [ edit ]\n\nOverhead view\n\nThe research program to validate the oblique wing concept was typical of any NASA high-risk project — to advance through each test element and expand the operating envelope, methodically and carefully. The basic purpose of the AD-1 project was to investigate the low-speed characteristics of an oblique-wing configuration.\n\nThe AD-1 made its first flight late in 1979. The wing was pivoted incrementally over the next 18 months until the full 60-degree angle was reached in mid-1981. The aircraft continued to be flown for another year, obtaining data at various speeds and wing-pivot angles until the final flight in August 1982.\n\nThe final flight of the AD-1 did not occur at Dryden, however, but at the Experimental Aircraft Association's (EAA) annual exhibition at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where it was flown eight times to demonstrate its unique configuration.\n\nFollowing the flight research, Jones still considered the oblique wing as a viable lift concept for large transoceanic or transcontinental transports. This particular low-speed, low-cost research vehicle, however, exhibited aeroelastic and pitch-roll-coupling effects that contributed to poor handling qualities at sweep angles above 45 degrees. The fiberglass structure limited wing stiffness that would have improved the aircraft's handling qualities, as an improved (and thus more expensive) control system would also have done.\n\nThus, although the AD-1 structure allowed completion of the program's technical objectives, there was still a need for a transonic oblique-wing research aircraft to assess the effects of compressibility, evaluate a more representative structure, and analyze flight performance at transonic speeds (those on either side of the speed of sound).\n\nAfter completion of the test program, the AD-1 was retired and is now on exhibit in the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.[2]\n\nSpecifications [ edit ]\n\nData from Linehan 2011[3]\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 1 (pilot)\n\n1 (pilot) Length: 38 ft 10 in (11.83 m)\n\n38 ft 10 in (11.83 m) Wingspan: 32 ft 4 in (9.85 m) unswept\n\n32 ft 4 in (9.85 m) unswept Lower wingspan: 16 ft 2 in (4.93 m) swept 60° sweep angle\n\n16 ft 2 in (4.93 m) swept 60° sweep angle Height: 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n\n6 ft 9 in (2.06 m) Wing area: 93 sq ft (8.6 m 2 )\n\n93 sq ft (8.6 m ) Airfoil: NACA 3612-02, 40 [4]\n\nNACA 3612-02, 40 Empty weight: 1,450 lb (658 kg)\n\n1,450 lb (658 kg) Gross weight: 2,145 lb (973 kg)\n\n2,145 lb (973 kg) Fuel capacity: 80 US gallons (300 l)\n\n80 US gallons (300 l) Powerplant: 2 × Microturbo TRS 18 turbojets, 220 lbf (0.98 kN) thrust each\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 200 mph (322 km/h; 174 kn)\n\n200 mph (322 km/h; 174 kn) Service ceiling: 12,000 ft (3,700 m)\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\nRelated lists\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCitations\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nBibliography\n\nft]]",

  "latent_21770": "Archie C. Gbessay, coordinator of the Active Case Finders and Awareness Team in West Point, a large slum in Monrovia, Liberia, discusses efforts to combat Ebola with his team in a school classroom in September. (Michel du Cille/The Washington Post)\n\nThe news out of West Africa in recent days — good and bad — has demonstrated a fundamental challenge in the fight against Ebola: The virus is more nimble than the human response to it. The landscape of infection and disease has changed dramatically in recent weeks, even as institutions have largely stuck to blueprints drafted months ago.\n\nThe looming question now is whether governments and other organizations can find a way to become as agile as the virus, which has vanished suddenly in some hard-hit places while erupting just as quickly in new locations.\n\nThe first Ebola treatment unit built in Liberia by the U.S. military is expected to open in the coming days, about two months after President Obama announced that he would send troops to supplement the civilian effort against the disease. But even before that first ETU has become operational, Liberia has seen a sharp drop in new infections and has empty beds in Ebola wards. The new ETUs, temporary structures that can’t easily be used for anything else, may not treat many patients.\n\nUp the coast of West Africa, Sierra Leone has made far less progress in the fight against Ebola. The country had three times as many new infections as Liberia in the most recent three-week monitoring period, according to the World Health Organization. The United States has sent troops to Liberia but not to Sierra Leone.\n\nThousands more U.S. troops are to join the American mission to fight Ebola in Liberia. (Reuters)\n\nGuinea, the third West African country hit hard by the virus, is another landscape entirely. It is bigger than Liberia and Sierra Leone combined. There was a drop in cases in the capital, Conakry, over the summer, but the virus recently surfaced again in some neighborhoods. In addition, hot spots continue to pop up in remote places, and health workers still encounter community resistance.\n\nAs the epidemic enters this new phase, officials say the strategy must be more aggressive: looking for Ebola “brush fires” and recognizing that “sparks are igniting all over,” as Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview last week.\n\nThe contagion has to be tracked to the last patient and obliterated lest it flare anew.\n\n“We need the large U.N. aid agencies and bureaucracies to also work with a nimbleness, and adapt on the spot and on the fly and reroute resources,” Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who recently toured the affected region, said in an interview Friday. “Nothing you achieve in Liberia is sustainable unless you contain and end the virus in Guinea and Sierra Leone.”\n\nMore needs to be done to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa, according to Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who visited Ghana during a trip to West African countries hit by the disease. (Reuters)\n\nIn a speech in Brussels after her trip to West Africa, Power pointed out the inertial forces that often hamper big bureaucracies in situations like this: “We tend to plot out static, long-term plans to respond to the outbreak and then stick to them, rather than developing fluid structures that can move with the virus.”\n\nChanging with the outbreak\n\nOfficials involved in the response want to push ahead with the existing plan to build many ETUs in Liberia, for one obvious reason: Ebola has been known to subside for a while and then come roaring back, as it did in the spring. It’s a better-safe-than-sorry approach.\n\n“We don’t want to take the foot off the gas pedal until we’re absolutely sure,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a top official with the U.S. Agency for International Development who joined Power on her tour.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. officials are looking for ways to adapt that plan, for example by opening units in new locations and with only a small number of beds. This approach would mimic the brush-fire pattern of the epidemic at the moment.\n\nA Lofa County health department burial team rolls down a dirt road with the body of Gulu Mulbah, 45, in Voinjama, Liberia, on Friday. The team members took Mulbah’s body to his home, where, wearing protective suits, gloves and goggles, they buried him in his back yard. (Michel du Cille/The Washington Post)\n\n“As we’re dealing with this devious, adaptive virus as it is moving out in the real world, we have come to realize that 17 100-bed units are less needed,” Power said in the interview. Instead, what is needed is “a large number of 10-bed treatment units geographically dispersed to where the epidemic is now and where contact tracing suggests the virus might move.”\n\nU.S. officials also recognize that Guinea has not received enough support, so the United States is funding three ETUs there through the U.N. World Food Program, she said.\n\nMany major challenges remain, not least of which is staffing the health facilities. International aid groups continue to struggle to find the thousands of health-care workers needed for the effort. They are hard to come by, given the grueling work conditions, the unusually terrifying nature of Ebola and concerns that volunteers will be quarantined upon returning home. Adding to that is concern that the facilities won’t be in the places they’re needed most, said Sophie Delaunay, executive director of the U.S. arm of Doctors Without Borders.\n\n“At the moment, our main concern is less about staffing those facilities and more about the necessity to adapt the response based on the development of the outbreak,” she said.\n\nThe United States has historic ties with Liberia, which was founded by African Americans in the first half of the 19th century. Reflecting colonial-era connections, Britain is focused on Sierra Leone, and France is concentrating on Guinea.\n\n“The crisis is accelerating,” said Sia Dean, a nurse who runs a company in Sierra Leone with her husband, Charles Dean II, and who spoke via Skype at an Ebola conference in Washington last week.\n\nShe said that five doctors and dozens of nurses have died in Sierra Leone and that there are not enough ambulances to pick up the dead in Freetown, the capital. The British are taking too long to build the ETUs, she said, adding, “Time is against us.”\n\nLiberian health workers load the bodies of six Ebola victims into the back of a pickup truck outside Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, the capital. (Michel du Cille/The Washington Post)\n\nThe situation in Guinea also remains tenuous. The forested areas where the outbreak began late last year are still a challenge. They often are difficult to reach. And skepticism runs high, meaning health workers often must forge relationships with local leaders before they can earn the trust of residents.\n\n“The first people who show up can’t be wearing spacesuits,” said Michael Kinzer, the CDC’s team leader in the country.\n\nMounting a major response\n\nThe Pentagon’s plan, announced in September, was largely crafted by the Army’s Africa Command, based in Germany.\n\nThe ETU building process has taken longer than expected, in part because the rainy season and a lack of heavy-duty construction equipment and other infrastructure have slowed things down. The Army also has been hampered by the lack of a place to house soldiers. Some set up camp in hotel rooms pending the construction of living quarters at a Liberian military facility.\n\nThe Army in recent days finished its first field hospital, designed solely for health-care workers who become sick treating Ebola patients. That achievement reflects the step-by-step requirements of mounting a major response to an epidemic: Volunteers have to know that they’ll be cared for if they contract the disease. The United States and Britain also have focused on creating medical-evacuation options for sick workers.\n\nObama on Wednesday asked Congress for $6 billion to supplement about $1 billion already committed by the United States to fight Ebola in West Africa and domestically. The United States has had only one Ebola case in recent days, and New York’s Bellevue Hospital announced Monday that the patient, Craig Spencer, is free of the virus and will be released Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s request will be the subject of hearings this week on Capitol Hill, starting Wednesday afternoon, when top administration officials will testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n1 of 66 Full Screen Autoplay Close Nov. 7, 2014 Friday Nov. 5, 2014 Wednesday Nov. 4, 2014 Tuesday Oct. 29, 2014 Wednesday Oct. 28, 2014 Tuesday Oct. 18, 2014 Saturday Oct. 16, 2014 Thursday Oct. 15, 2014 Wednesday Oct. 13, 2014 Monday Oct. 8, 2014 Wednesday Skip Ad × Ebola epidemic View Photos The Ebola virus is killing 70 percent of those infected, and there could be as many as 10,000 new cases a week in West Africa by Dec. 1, a top official with the World Health Organization said in October.

A chunk of money also would go toward upgrading more than 50 hospitals in the United States to ensure that they have good infection-control measures if Ebola is brought to this country again. Many of those hospitals are located near the five U.S. airports where passengers from West Africa are required to arrive.\n\nThe CDC also will stockpile $2.7 million in personal protective equipment that it can deliver to U.S. hospitals caring for Ebola patients. That includes nearly 6,000 disposable gowns, more than 6,000 respirators and 55,000 pairs of gloves — enough gear for 250 days of treatment.\n\nOutreach sees success\n\nWhat has worked well in West Africa, officials say, has been communication — broadcasting the message over and over that Ebola is not a hoax or a scam, and that its spread can be contained through adjustments in behavior, particularly in funeral practices that included repeated washing of the body.\n\nIn Guinea, an Israeli cellphone company agreed to give free airtime to imams on Fridays so they could send text messages to congregants telling them about Ebola prevention.\n\nA new public-awareness campaign in Sierra Leone will feature one “big idea” per week, starting this week with “Safe Burials Save Lives.” Targeting local media outlets and opinion leaders, the campaign is full of common-sense advice, such as not touching the bodily fluids of sick people and assuming that anyone who is sick could have Ebola.\n\nFreetown has a new Ebola response call center, and residents are asked to call 117 when someone is suspected of having Ebola or when an infected person dies. On the wall of the call center is a map of Freetown. Red pins mark the spots where bodies have been reported. When teams bury a body, blue pins replace the red ones. When Power visited Oct. 28, the map showed one red pin surrounded by a sea of blue.\n\nThis is the largest outbreak of the Ebola virus in history.\n\nA key effort is the enlistment of grass-roots women’s groups. In Grand Bassa County, Liberia, the Bassa County Women’s Development Association has been training women and religious leaders since August to spread the message.\n\n“We have been working here with them for a very long time, and they know what we tell them,” said Martha Karnga, the group’s executive director. The message is working, she said. “They understand because we see them practice hand-washing in the buckets.”\n\nPower has called the Ebola epidemic the greatest public health crisis of our time, and in Friday’s interview she said there is no time for traditional funding proposals or elaborately crafted plans.\n\n“We’re building the airplane as we fly it,” Power said. “We’re deciding how to allocate the spare parts depending on the signals on the control panel.”",

  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nKrokodil, a highly addictive designer drug that aggressively eats through flesh, has reportedly arrived in the United States. A Phoenix CBS affiliate revealed this week that two cases involving krokodil had been phoned into a local poison control center and quoted one of the center’s medical directors, Dr. Frank LoVecchio, saying he and his colleagues were “extremely frightened.” While the US Drug Enforcement Administration has not yet received a sample of the drug for analysis, and thus cannot confirm it was krokodil, Barbara Carreno of the DEA told Mother Jones that the agency often learns about new synthetic drugs (including the infamous bath salts) through local poison-control centers. “We’ve been scrambling to see what we know about the cases in Arizona,” she added. “This concerns us very much.”\n\nKrokodil, technically known as Desomorphine, has a similar effect to heroin, but is significantly cheaper and easier to make. In the last few years, it’s been wreaking severe havoc on the bodies and lives of Russian youth. The drug earned its nickname—the Russian word for crocodile—because of the ghastly side effects it has on the human body. Wherever the drug is injected, the skin turns green and scaly, showing symptoms of gangrene. In severe cases, the skin rots away completely revealing the bone beneath. Other permanent effects of the drug include speech impediments and erratic movement. Rotting flesh, jerky movements, and speech troubles have prompted media outlets to tag krokodil the “zombie drug.” According to Time, the average user of krokodil only lives two or three years, and “the few who manage to quit usually come away disfigured.” Quitting is its own nasty business. Heroin withdrawal symptoms last about a week; symptoms for krokodil withdrawal can last over a month.\n\nKrokodil use has skyrocketed in poor rural communities in Russia in the last few years, despite the troubling side effects. The Federal Drug Control Service in Russia told Time that in the first three months of 2011, it confiscated 65 million doses of the drug. Desomorphine didn’t originate in Russia; the potent painkiller was patented in the United States in 1934. It only became a recreational drug about 10 years ago, when it surfaced in Siberia. The Independent reported in 2011 that up to 5 percent of Russian drug users have used krokodil—as many as 100,000 people. Zhenya, a former user in Russia, told the Independent that when she used to inject krokodil, she was “dreaming of heroin, of something that feels clean and not like poison. But you can’t afford it, so you keep doing the krokodil. Until you die.”\n\nThe main ingredients in krokodil are codeine, iodine, and red phosphorous. The latter is the stuff that’s used to make the striking part on matchboxes. Sometimes paint thinner, gasoline, and hydrochloric acid are thrown into the mix. Like meth, it’s fairly easy to cook up in a home kitchen. You need a stove, a pan, and about 30 minutes. The drug is then injected directly into the vein, producing a high that lasts about an hour and a half. According to the Week, each injection costs about $6 to $8, while heroin is up to $25.\n\nCarreno of the DEA says that krokodil isn’t a controlled substance yet because the agency has to have more evidence that it’s a public health problem. “You don’t want a federal agency going around making things illegal willy-nilly…We’d have to see more than two cases before we control it,” she notes. “But people are mixing codeine and gasoline, and shooting it into their veins. What do they expect?”\n\nIn the mean time, if you want to feel disgusted and never eat lunch again, look at the graphic picture below of a krokodil user. For more gruesome images, go here.",
  "latent_22156": "by Real Python advanced flask front-end web-dev\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate how to set up token-based authentication (via JSON Web Tokens) with Angular 4 and Flask.\n\nMain Dependencies:\n\nAngular v4.2.4 (via Angular CLI v1.3.2) Flask v0.12 Python v3.6.2\n\nFree Bonus: Click here to get access to a free Flask + Python video tutorial that shows you how to build Flask web app, step-by-step.\n\nAuth Workflow\n\nHere’s the full user auth process:\n\nClient logs in and the credentials are sent to the server If the credentials are correct, the server generates a token and sends it as a response to the client Client receives and stores the token in Local Storage Client then sends token to server on subsequent requests within the request header\n\nProject Setup\n\nStart by globally installing the Angular CLI:\n\n$ npm install -g @angular/cli@1.3.2\n\nThen generate a new Angular 4 project boilerplate:\n\n$ ng new angular4-auth\n\nFire up the app after the dependencies install:\n\n$ cd angular4-auth $ ng serve\n\nIt will probably take a minute or two to compile and build your application. Once done, navigate to http://localhost:4200 to ensure the app is up and running.\n\nOpen up the project in your favorite code editor, and then glance over the code:\n\n├── e2e │ ├── app.e2e-spec.ts │ ├── app.po.ts │ └── tsconfig.e2e.json ├── karma.conf.js ├── package.json ├── protractor.conf.js ├── src │ ├── app │ │ ├── app.component.css │ │ ├── app.component.html │ │ ├── app.component.spec.ts │ │ ├── app.component.ts │ │ └── app.module.ts │ ├── assets │ ├── environments │ │ ├── environment.prod.ts │ │ └── environment.ts │ ├── favicon.ico │ ├── index.html │ ├── main.ts │ ├── polyfills.ts │ ├── styles.css │ ├── test.ts │ ├── tsconfig.app.json │ ├── tsconfig.spec.json │ └── typings.d.ts ├── tsconfig.json └── tslint.json\n\nIn short, the client-side code lives in the “src” folder and the Angular app itself can be found in the “app” folder.\n\nTake note of the AppModule within app.module.ts. This is used to bootstrap the Angular app. The @NgModule decorator takes metadata that lets Angular know how to run the app. Everything that we create in this tutorial will be added to this object.\n\nMake sure you have a decent grasp of the app structure before moving on.\n\nNOTE: Just getting started with Angular 4? Review the Angular Style Guide, since the app generated from the CLI follows the recommended structure from that guide, as well as the Angular4Crud Tutorial.\n\nDid you notice that the CLI initialized a new Git repo? This part is optional, but it’s a good idea to create a new Github repository and update the remote:\n\n$ git remote set-url origin <newurl>\n\nNow, let’s wire up a new component…\n\nAuth Component\n\nFirst, use the CLI to generate a new Login component:\n\n$ ng generate component components/login\n\nThis set up the component files and folders and even wired it up to app.module.ts. Next, let’s change the login.component.ts file to the following:\n\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'login' , templateUrl : './login.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './login.component.css' ] }) export class LoginComponent { test : string = 'just a test' ; }\n\nIf you haven’t used TypeScript before, then this code probably looks pretty foreign to you. TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to vanilla JavaScript, and it is the de facto programming language for building Angular 4 apps.\n\nIn Angular 4, we define a component by wrapping a config object with an @Component decorator. We can share code between packages by importing the classes we need; and, in this case, we import Component from the @angular/core package. The LoginComponent class is the component’s controller, and we use the export operator to make it available for other classes to import.\n\nAdd the following HTML to the login.component.html:\n\n< h1 > Login </ h1 > < p > {{test}} </ p >\n\nNext, configure the routes, via the RouterModule in the app.module.ts file:\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' ; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core' ; import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router' ; import { AppComponent } from './app.component' ; import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component' ; @ NgModule ({ declarations : [ AppComponent , LoginComponent , ], imports : [ BrowserModule , RouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent } ]) ], providers : [], bootstrap : [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }\n\nFinish enabling routing by replacing all HTML in the app.component.html file with the <router-outlet> tag:\n\n< router-outlet ></ router-outlet >\n\nRun ng serve in your terminal, if you haven’t already, and then navigate to http://localhost:4200/login. If all went well you should see the just a test text.\n\nBootstrap Style\n\nTo quickly add some style, update the index.html, adding in Bootstrap and wrapping the <app-root></app-root> in a container:\n\n<!doctype html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > Angular4Auth </ title > < base href = \"/\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < link rel = \"icon\" type = \"image/x-icon\" href = \"favicon.ico\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css\" > </ head > < body > < div class = \"container\" > < app-root ></ app-root > </ div > </ body > </ html >\n\nYou should see the app auto reload as soon as you save.\n\nAuth Service\n\nNext, let’s create a global service to handle a user logging in, logging out, and signing up:\n\n$ ng generate service services/auth\n\nEdit the auth.service.ts so that it has the following code:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; @ Injectable () export class AuthService { test () : string { return 'working' ; } }\n\nRemember how providers worked in Angular 1? They were global objects that stored a single state. When the data in a provider changed, any object that had injected that provider would receive the updates. In Angular 4, providers retain their special behavior and they are defined with the @Injectable decorator.\n\nSanity Check\n\nBefore adding anything significant to AuthService , let’s make sure the service itself is wired up correctly. To do that, within login.component.ts inject the service and call the test() method:\n\nimport { Component , OnInit } from '@angular/core' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'login' , templateUrl : './login.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './login.component.css' ] }) export class LoginComponent implements OnInit { test : string = 'just a test' ; constructor ( private auth : AuthService ) {} ngOnInit () : void { console . log ( this . auth . test ()); } }\n\nWe’ve introduced some new concepts and keywords. The constructor() function is a special method that we use to set up a new instance of a class. The constructor() is where we pass any parameters that the class requires, including any providers (i.e., AuthService ) that we want to inject. In TypeScript, we can hide variables from the outside world with the private keyword. Passing a private variable in the constructor is a shortcut to defining it within the class and then assigning the argument’s value to it. Notice how the auth variable is accessible to the this object after it is passed into the constructor.\n\nWe implement the OnInit interface to ensure that we explicitly define a ngOnInit() function. Implementing OnInit ensures that our component will be called after the first change detection check. This function is called once when the component first initializes, making it the ideal place to configure data that relies on other Angular classes.\n\nUnlike components, which are automatically added, services have to be manually imported and configured on the @NgModule . So, to get it working, you’ll also have to import the AuthService in app.module.ts and add it to the providers :\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' ; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core' ; import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router' ; import { AppComponent } from './app.component' ; import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component' ; import { AuthService } from './services/auth.service' ; @ NgModule ({ declarations : [ AppComponent , LoginComponent , ], imports : [ BrowserModule , RouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent } ]) ], providers : [ AuthService ], bootstrap : [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }\n\nRun the server and then navigate to http://localhost:4200/login. You should see working logged to the JavaScript console.\n\nUser Login\n\nTo handle logging a user in, update the AuthService like so:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; import { Headers , Http } from '@angular/http' ; import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise' ; @ Injectable () export class AuthService { private BASE_URL : string = 'http://localhost:5000/auth' ; private headers : Headers = new Headers ({ 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' }); constructor ( private http : Http ) {} login ( user ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /login` ; return this . http . post ( url , user , { headers : this . headers }). toPromise (); } }\n\nWe employ the help of some built-in Angular classes, Headers and Http , to handle our AJAX calls to the server.\n\nAlso, update the app.module.ts file to import the HttpModule .\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' ; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core' ; import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router' ; import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http' ; import { AppComponent } from './app.component' ; import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component' ; import { AuthService } from './services/auth.service' ; @ NgModule ({ declarations : [ AppComponent , LoginComponent , ], imports : [ BrowserModule , HttpModule , RouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent } ]) ], providers : [ AuthService ], bootstrap : [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }\n\nHere, we are using the Http service to send an AJAX request to the /user/login endpoint. This returns a promise object.\n\nNOTE: Make sure to remove console.log(this.auth.test()); from the LoginComponent component.\n\nUser Registration\n\nLet’s go ahead and add the ability to register a user as well, which is similar to logging a user in. Update src/app/services/auth.service.ts, taking note of the register method:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; import { Headers , Http } from '@angular/http' ; import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise' ; @ Injectable () export class AuthService { private BASE_URL : string = 'http://localhost:5000/auth' ; private headers : Headers = new Headers ({ 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' }); constructor ( private http : Http ) {} login ( user ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /login` ; return this . http . post ( url , user , { headers : this . headers }). toPromise (); } register ( user ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /register` ; return this . http . post ( url , user , { headers : this . headers }). toPromise (); } }\n\nNow, to test this we need to set up a back end…\n\nServer-side Setup\n\nFor the server-side, we’ll use the finished project from a previous blog post, Token-Based Authentication With Flask. You can view the code from the flask-jwt-auth repository.\n\nNOTE: Feel free to use your own server, just make sure to update the baseURL in the AuthService .\n\nClone the project structure in a new terminal window:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/realpython/flask-jwt-auth\n\nFollow the directions in the README to set up the project, making sure the tests pass before moving on. Once done, run the server with python manage.py runserver , which will listen on port 5000.\n\nSanity Check\n\nTo test, update LoginComponent to use the login and register methods from the service:\n\nimport { Component , OnInit } from '@angular/core' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'login' , templateUrl : './login.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './login.component.css' ] }) export class LoginComponent implements OnInit { test : string = 'just a test' ; constructor ( private auth : AuthService ) {} ngOnInit () : void { let sampleUser : any = { email : 'michael@realpython.com' as string , password : 'michael' as string }; this . auth . register ( sampleUser ) . then (( user ) => { console . log ( user . json ()); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); this . auth . login ( sampleUser ). then (( user ) => { console . log ( user . json ()); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } }\n\nRefresh http://localhost:4200/login in the browser and you should see a success in the JavaScript console, after the user is logged in, with the token:\n\n{ \"auth_token\" : \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1M…jozfQ.bPNQb3C98yyNe0LDyl1Bfkp0Btn15QyMxZnBoE9RQMI\" , \"message\" : \"Successfully logged in.\" , \"status\" : \"success\" }\n\nAuth Login\n\nUpdate login.component.html:\n\n< div class = \"row\" > < div class = \"col-md-4\" > < h1 > Login </ h1 > < hr >< br > < form ( ngSubmit )=\" onLogin ()\" novalidate > < div class = \"form-group\" > < label for = \"email\" > Email </ label > < input type = \"text\" class = \"form-control\" id = \"email\" placeholder = \"enter email\" [( ngModel )]=\" user . email \" name = \"email\" required > </ div > < div class = \"form-group\" > < label for = \"password\" > Password </ label > < input type = \"password\" class = \"form-control\" id = \"password\" placeholder = \"enter password\" [( ngModel )]=\" user . password \" name = \"password\" required > </ div > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-default\" > Submit </ button > </ form > </ div > </ div >\n\nTake note of the form. We used the [(ngModel)] directive on each of the form inputs to capture those values in the controller. Also, when the form is submitted, the ngSubmit directive handles the event by firing the onLogin() method.\n\nNow, let’s update the component code, adding in onLogin() :\n\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; import { User } from '../../models/user' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'login' , templateUrl : './login.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './login.component.css' ] }) export class LoginComponent { user : User = new User (); constructor ( private auth : AuthService ) {} onLogin () : void { this . auth . login ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { console . log ( user . json ()); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } }\n\nIf you have the Angular web server running, you should see the error Cannot find module '../../models/user' in the browser. Before our code will work, we need to create a User model.\n\n$ ng generate class models/user\n\nUpdate src/app/models/user.ts:\n\nexport class User { constructor ( email ?: string , password ?: string ) {} }\n\nOur User model has two properties, email and password . The ? character is a special operator that indicates that initializing User with explicit email and password values is optional. This is equivalent to the following class in Python:\n\nclass User ( object ): def __init__ ( self , email = None , password = None ): self . email = email self . password = password\n\nDon’t forget to update auth.service.ts to use the new object.\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; import { Headers , Http } from '@angular/http' ; import { User } from '../models/user' ; import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise' ; @ Injectable () export class AuthService { private BASE_URL : string = 'http://localhost:5000/auth' ; private headers : Headers = new Headers ({ 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' }); constructor ( private http : Http ) {} login ( user : User ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /login` ; return this . http . post ( url , user , { headers : this . headers }). toPromise (); } register ( user : User ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /register` ; return this . http . post ( url , user , { headers : this . headers }). toPromise (); } }\n\nOne last thing. We need to import the FormsModule in the app.module.ts file.\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' ; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core' ; import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router' ; import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http' ; import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms' ; import { AppComponent } from './app.component' ; import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component' ; import { AuthService } from './services/auth.service' ; @ NgModule ({ declarations : [ AppComponent , LoginComponent , ], imports : [ BrowserModule , HttpModule , FormsModule , RouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent } ]) ], providers : [ AuthService ], bootstrap : [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }\n\nSo, when the form is submitted, we capture the email and password and pass them to the login() method on the service.\n\nTest this out with-\n\nemail: michael@realpython.com\n\npassword: michael\n\nAgain, you should see a success in the javaScript console with the token.\n\nAuth Register\n\nJust like for the login functionality, we need to add a component for registering a user. Start by generating a new Register component:\n\n$ ng generate component components/register\n\nUpdate src/app/components/register/register.component.html:\n\n< div class = \"row\" > < div class = \"col-md-4\" > < h1 > Register </ h1 > < hr >< br > < form ( ngSubmit )=\" onRegister ()\" novalidate > < div class = \"form-group\" > < label for = \"email\" > Email </ label > < input type = \"text\" class = \"form-control\" id = \"email\" placeholder = \"enter email\" [( ngModel )]=\" user . email \" name = \"email\" required > </ div > < div class = \"form-group\" > < label for = \"password\" > Password </ label > < input type = \"password\" class = \"form-control\" id = \"password\" placeholder = \"enter password\" [( ngModel )]=\" user . password \" name = \"password\" required > </ div > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-default\" > Submit </ button > </ form > </ div > </ div >\n\nThen, update src/app/components/register/register.component.ts as follows:\n\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; import { User } from '../../models/user' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'register' , templateUrl : './register.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './register.component.css' ] }) export class RegisterComponent { user : User = new User (); constructor ( private auth : AuthService ) {} onRegister () : void { this . auth . register ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { console . log ( user . json ()); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } }\n\nAdd a new route handler to the app.module.ts file:\n\nRouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent }, { path : 'register' , component : RegisterComponent } ])\n\nTest it out by registering a new user!\n\nLocal Storage\n\nNext, let’s add the token to Local Storage for persistence by replacing the console.log(user.json()); with localStorage.setItem('token', user.data.token); in src/app/components/login/login.component.ts:\n\nonLogin () : void { this . auth . login ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , user . json (). auth_token ); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); }\n\nDo the same within src/app/components/register/register.component.ts:\n\nonRegister () : void { this . auth . register ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , user . json (). auth_token ); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); }\n\nAs long as that token is present, the user can be considered logged in. And, when a user needs to make an AJAX request, that token can be used.\n\nNOTE: Besides the token, you could also add the user id and email to Local Storage. You would just need to update the server-side to send back that info when a user logs in.\n\nTest this out. Ensure that the token is present in Local Storage after you log in.\n\nUser Status\n\nTo test out login persistence, we can add a new view that verifies that the user is logged in and that the token is valid.\n\nAdd the following method to AuthService :\n\nensureAuthenticated ( token ) : Promise < any > { let url : string = ` ${ this . BASE_URL } /status` ; let headers : Headers = new Headers ({ 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , Authorization : `Bearer ${ token } ` }); return this . http . get ( url , { headers : headers }). toPromise (); }\n\nTake note of Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token . This is called a Bearer schema, which is sent along with the request. On the server, we are simply checking for the Authorization header, and then whether the token is valid. Can you find this code on the server-side?\n\nThen, generate a new Status component:\n\n$ ng generate component components/status\n\nCreate the HTML template, src/app/components/status/status.component.html:\n\n< div class = \"row\" > < div class = \"col-md-4\" > < h1 > User Status </ h1 > < hr >< br > < p > Logged In? {{isLoggedIn}} </ p > </ div > </ div >\n\nAnd change the component code in src/app/components/status/status.component.ts:\n\nimport { Component , OnInit } from '@angular/core' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'status' , templateUrl : './status.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './status.component.css' ] }) export class StatusComponent implements OnInit { isLoggedIn : boolean = false ; constructor ( private auth : AuthService ) {} ngOnInit () : void { const token = localStorage . getItem ( 'token' ); if ( token ) { this . auth . ensureAuthenticated ( token ) . then (( user ) => { console . log ( user . json ()); if ( user . json (). status === 'success' ) { this . isLoggedIn = true ; } }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } } }\n\nFinally, add a new route handler to the app.module.ts file:\n\nRouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent }, { path : 'register' , component : RegisterComponent }, { path : 'status' , component : StatusComponent } ])\n\nReady to test? Log in, and then navigate to http://localhost:4200/status. If there is a token in Local Storage, you should see:\n\n{ \"message\" : \"Signature expired. Please log in again.\" , \"status\" : \"fail\" }\n\nWhy? Well, if you dig deeper on the server-side, you will find that the token is only valid for 5 seconds in project/server/models.py:\n\ndef encode_auth_token ( self , user_id ): \"\"\" Generates the Auth Token :return: string \"\"\" try : payload = { 'exp' : datetime . datetime . utcnow () + datetime . timedelta ( days = 0 , seconds = 5 ), 'iat' : datetime . datetime . utcnow (), 'sub' : user_id } return jwt . encode ( payload , app . config . get ( 'SECRET_KEY' ), algorithm = 'HS256' ) except Exception as e : return e\n\nUpdate this to 1 day:\n\n'exp' : datetime . datetime . utcnow () + datetime . timedelta ( days = 1 , seconds = 0 )\n\nAnd then test it again. You should now see something like:\n\n{ \"data\" : { \"admin\" : false , \"email\" : \"michael@realpython.com\" , \"registered_on\" : \"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 17:21:52 GMT\" , \"user_id\" : 4 }, \"status\" : \"success\" }\n\nFinally, let’s redirect to the status page after a user successfully registers or logs in. Update src/app/components/login/login.component.ts like so:\n\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core' ; import { Router } from '@angular/router' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; import { User } from '../../models/user' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'login' , templateUrl : './login.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './login.component.css' ] }) export class LoginComponent { user : User = new User (); constructor ( private router : Router , private auth : AuthService ) {} onLogin () : void { this . auth . login ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , user . json (). auth_token ); this . router . navigateByUrl ( '/status' ); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } }\n\nThen update src/app/components/register/register.component.ts:\n\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core' ; import { Router } from '@angular/router' ; import { AuthService } from '../../services/auth.service' ; import { User } from '../../models/user' ; @ Component ({ selector : 'register' , templateUrl : './register.component.html' , styleUrls : [ './register.component.css' ] }) export class RegisterComponent { user : User = new User (); constructor ( private router : Router , private auth : AuthService ) {} onRegister () : void { this . auth . register ( this . user ) . then (( user ) => { localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , user . json (). auth_token ); this . router . navigateByUrl ( '/status' ); }) . catch (( err ) => { console . log ( err ); }); } }\n\nTest it out!\n\nRoute Restriction\n\nRight now, all routes are open; so, regardless of whether a user is logged in or not, they they can access each route. Certain routes should be restricted if a user is not logged in, while other routes should be restricted if a user is logged in:\n\n/ - no restrictions /login - restricted when logged in /register - restricted when logged in /status - restricted when not logged in\n\nTo achieve this, add either EnsureAuthenticated or LoginRedirect to each route, depending on whether you want to guide the user to the status view or the login view.\n\nStart by creating two new services:\n\n$ ng generate service services/ensure-authenticated $ ng generate service services/login-redirect\n\nReplace the code in the ensure-authenticated.service.ts file as follows:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; import { CanActivate , Router } from '@angular/router' ; import { AuthService } from './auth.service' ; @ Injectable () export class EnsureAuthenticated implements CanActivate { constructor ( private auth : AuthService , private router : Router ) {} canActivate () : boolean { if ( localStorage . getItem ( 'token' )) { return true ; } else { this . router . navigateByUrl ( '/login' ); return false ; } } }\n\nAnd replace the code in the login-redirect.service.ts like so:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core' ; import { CanActivate , Router } from '@angular/router' ; import { AuthService } from './auth.service' ; @ Injectable () export class LoginRedirect implements CanActivate { constructor ( private auth : AuthService , private router : Router ) {} canActivate () : boolean { if ( localStorage . getItem ( 'token' )) { this . router . navigateByUrl ( '/status' ); return false ; } else { return true ; } } }\n\nFinally, update the app.module.ts file to import and configure the new services:\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' ; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core' ; import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router' ; import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http' ; import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms' ; import { AppComponent } from './app.component' ; import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component' ; import { AuthService } from './services/auth.service' ; import { RegisterComponent } from './components/register/register.component' ; import { StatusComponent } from './components/status/status.component' ; import { EnsureAuthenticated } from './services/ensure-authenticated.service' ; import { LoginRedirect } from './services/login-redirect.service' ; @ NgModule ({ declarations : [ AppComponent , LoginComponent , RegisterComponent , StatusComponent , ], imports : [ BrowserModule , HttpModule , FormsModule , RouterModule . forRoot ([ { path : 'login' , component : LoginComponent , canActivate : [ LoginRedirect ] }, { path : 'register' , component : RegisterComponent , canActivate : [ LoginRedirect ] }, { path : 'status' , component : StatusComponent , canActivate : [ EnsureAuthenticated ] } ]) ], providers : [ AuthService , EnsureAuthenticated , LoginRedirect ], bootstrap : [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }\n\nNote how we are adding our services to a new route property, canActivate . The routing system uses the services in the canActivate array to determine whether to display the requested URL path. If the route has LoginRedirect and the user is already logged in, then they will be redirected to the status view. Including the EnsureAuthenticated service redirects the user to the login view if they attempt to access a URL that requires authentication.\n\nTest one last time.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nIn this tutorial, we went through the process of adding authentication to an Angular 4 + Flask app using JSON Web Tokens.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTry switching out the Flask back-end for a different web framework, like Django or Bottle, using the following endpoints:\n\n/auth/register\n\n/auth/login\n\n/auth/logout\n\n/auth/user\n\nIf you’d like to see how to build a complete Python web app using Flask, check out this video series:\n\nFree Bonus: Click here to get access to a free Flask + Python video tutorial that shows you how to build Flask web app, step-by-step.\n\nAdd questions and/or comments below.

  "latent_22236": "This is Peter Hitchens's Mail on Sunday column\n\nWhat on earth is the point of the Labour Party if it cannot even oppose the mad disaster of railway privatisation? Well, there was a feeble flicker of hope at the weekend that some of its would-be MPs have realised this, and we should all be glad.\n\nFor, once Labour actively opposes this costly, tragicomic failure, everyone else will have to recognise the truth and we can go back to good old British Railways.\n\nLike comprehensive schools, EU membership, windmill electricity, equality and diversity and multiculturalism, privatisation was imposed on us against our will by inmates of the political asylum.\n\nPolitics is a mild form of mental illness in all cases, but in recent years it has become more virulent. Much of this is the fault of the think-tanks in which political careerists can shelter from reality.\n\nAlas, most modern politicians have no ideas or convictions of their own and, needing to do things they can be remembered for, they are easy victims of these gabbling charlatans.\n\nThe privatisation of the railways was done against the advice of everyone who knew anything about the subject. Quite predictably, it cost far more in subsidies than the old nationalised system. In a few years it destroyed more than a century of experience in safety and track maintenance. It finished off most of what was left of our train manufacture.\n\nAll the claims made for it are bogus. Passenger numbers increased not because of privatisation but in spite of it, as more and more people were forced by unhinged house prices to commute vast distances to work – and could only do so by train.\n\nPunctuality has improved because the timetables were padded to avoid penalties from the ‘Passenger’s Charter’. The trains take just as long if not longer, and break down just as much, but are not officially late.\n\nFor many years, investment in such things as electrification almost ceased. The trains I ride daily are 1970s antiques that ought to be in the National Railway Museum at York.\n\nIt is bitterly funny to record that Network Rail, successor to the disastrous Railtrack (or ‘Failcrack’ as it should have been called), is now officially classified as a ‘government body’ and its debts of £30 billion are part of the national debt. Meanwhile, one of the most successful ‘privatised’ train companies, East Coast, is currently publicly owned, and many of the others are owned by foreign state railways. And all of them are being subsidised by you and me, thanks to artificially low track charges levied by Network Rail.\n\nThe truth will out. It was always better for the railways to be nationalised and subsidised. What a pity it took us so many years, so many needless deaths and so many billions of wasted money to find out what we already knew. Bring back BR.\n\nGunned down - by 'good' Ukrainians\n\nThe absurd bias of most coverage of the Ukraine crisis is best shown in what it does not say. It never mentions that the USA and EU started the whole thing by trying to bribe Ukraine into joining their gang, and by sending leading politicians to egg on the Kiev mob.\n\nAnd it never gives a fair deal to the Russian case.\n\nHere’s proof, if you like. Yulia Izotova, a 21-year-old nurse, was shot dead while carrying sandwiches to a checkpoint manned by Russian separatists in Kramatorsk. All the evidence suggests her killer was a Ukrainian soldier.\n\nHad it been the other way round, you would have seen a lot of her pretty face, and of her bitter funeral. But you haven’t.\n\nThe same is true of the Russians, at least 40 of them, burned to death in Odessa after being besieged in a blazing building by a pro-Kiev mob. Imagine the headlines and the coverage if it had been pro-Putin marchers doing the besieging.\n\nBut this horrible event is barely mentioned in the West. You’re being manipulated by people who want your support for a stupid war. Resist.\n\nWhy not have an A-level in Russell Brand studies? Mr Brand is the true face of modern British thought and politics. His language – at the same time florid, pompous and crude – is pretty much the way most people under 35 argue these days.\n\nWhy carry on pretending that we are the land of Shakespeare and Milton, when we are really the nation of Sid Vicious, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross?\n\nFree trade will make slaves of us all\n\nI have stopped believing in free trade. I have been told for decades now that it is good for everyone, that we cannot protect our own jobs or industries or even our borders.\n\nThis may have been true when we were the workshop of the world, flooding the planet with the products of our ingenious new industries.\n\nBut it’s not true now. If we cannot keep out goods produced by sweatshops in Canton (and I have seen these awful places) how long before we, too, are reduced to the same living standards? We cannot afford our present welfare state, and, when it collapses, how exactly do you think your sons and daughters are going to live? By eating their first-class social science degrees?\n\nWhen I was a child there was almost nothing we used that wasn’t made here, from the cutlery in the kitchen and the tools in the shed to my third-hand bicycle, not to mention all our food (apart from the New Zealand lamb and butter) and clothes. When we spent our money, most of it went to our fellow Britons. Then, in a few years, it all went. I still recall my father’s shame and misery at even contemplating buying a foreign car. He gave in in the end, but never really got used to it. The ironmongers still tried to sell solid British tools, but they were ludicrously costly compared to the foreign imports beside them.\n\nWhy was the old arrangement wrong, and the new one better? Is protection really so wicked? No doubt it would make life more expensive, but for a good purpose. As people who barely make anything but buy a great deal, can we expect our current standard of living to last? We are visibly becoming a land of cheap labour, debt, insecure jobs and overcrowded housing.\n\nOddly enough, we have managed to preserve two major industries – defence and pharmaceuticals. Both have been saved – so far – by covert protection. Nobody will admit it, but the Ministry of Defence and the NHS have kept them going. Now even that is coming to an end, what is left?\n\nIf you wish to comment, please scroll down",
  "latent_22293": "HOUSTON -- Michigan State men's basketball coach Tom Izzo is set to join the basketball elite after being elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The announcement was made Monday, April 4 in Houston as part of Final Four Weekend.\n\n\"I've always told my players that they need to dream something before they can achieve it,\" said Izzo. \"Growing up in Iron Mountain, I had plenty of dreams, many of them seemed like long shots. But I'd be lying if I said being in the Hall of Fame was one of those dreams -- it seemed too big. Even today, it's surreal.\n\n\"As a coach, you can't accomplish anything without the help of others. While I'm the one being recognized by the Hall of Fame, it's only because of the work, support and advice from so many people that have touched both my life and my career. From the guidance and love of my family and friends, to the instruction and advice from my teachers and mentors, to the hard work and accomplishments of my coaches and players, and the great support from my administration, they've all made the `undreamable' a reality.\"\n\n\"On both a personal level, and on behalf of Michigan State University, I congratulate Tom Izzo on his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame,\" said MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon. \"As Spartans, we've known for a long time that Tom is a Hall of Fame coach and a Hall of Fame person, but today we are all proud as he receives the ultimate recognition for a remarkable, but far from finished, career.\n\n\"Everyone sees his passion for winning games, cutting down nets and hanging championship banners. They see his commitment to never cutting corners, relying instead on hard work and determination to accomplish great things. I'm fortunate in that I get to see Tom work equally as hard to develop young men, preparing them for success after basketball. His determination to see others succeed and reach their goals, be it within athletics or across campus, make him the ultimate ambassador for Michigan State University -- a world class University built on land-grant values such as hard work, integrity and ingenuity. And that's why today all of Team MSU salutes Coach Izzo on his landmark honor.\"\n\n\"As a roommate and friend of Tom Izzo since the early 1980s, I have always admired and respected Coach's ability to care and fight for people and issues beyond his area of responsibility,\" said MSU Athletics Director Mark Hollis. \"He is passionate about the game of basketball, higher education and the people that commit their lives to the ideals of these pursuits. His attention to detail, concern about right and wrong, and the importance of personal accountability of everyone contribute to his success. With humility as his athletic director, emotion as his friend, and pride as a Spartan, I appreciate the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in recognizing Tom's contributions to the game.\"\n\nIn 21 seasons as a head coach, all at Michigan State, Izzo has put together a resume worthy of induction. He has guided Michigan State to seven Final Fours (1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015), ranking fifth all-time and tied for third among active coaches. Since Izzo's first season as head coach in 1995-96, no other coach has appeared in more than six. In guiding the Spartans to a seventh Final Four in 2015, Izzo became just the second coach to appear in seven Final Fours in a 17-year period since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\n\nUnder Izzo's watch, Michigan State has appeared in 19 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, establishing the longest streak in Big Ten history, and ranking as the third-longest active streak and the fourth longest of all time. Izzo's 19 straight NCAA Tournaments are the fourth-longest streak for any coach in tournament history. His 46 NCAA Tournament victories rank tied for eighth all time. To put his success into perspective, of Izzo's 19 trips to the NCAA Tournament, MSU has advanced at least to the second weekend 13 times, including nine Elite Eights, while losing its opening game just four times. Two other stats stand out in Izzo's NCAA Tournament success: 1) MSU is 21-4 in the second game of an NCAA Tournament weekend; 2) MSU is 13-10 as the lower-seeded team, as the 13 wins are the most in NCAA Tournament history for any coach.\n\nIn 33 total seasons at Michigan State, Izzo has cemented his name among the very best coaches in Big Ten history. Earlier this year, he passed former Purdue coach Gene Keady to become the second-winningest coach at a Big Ten school, trailing only Indiana's Bob Knight. His 246 Big Ten wins rank third all-time behind just Knight and Keady. He is one of just five coaches to win seven regular-season Big Ten Championships (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2009, 2010, 2012), while his five Big Ten Tournament Championships (1999, 2000, 2012, 2014, 2016) are the most ever.\n\nIzzo is an eight-time national coach of the year, capturing the award in 1998 (Basketball News, Associated Press, USBWA), 1999 (Basketball Times), 2001 (NABC), 2005 (Clair Bee), and 2012 (NABC, CBSSports.com). He is a three-time Big Ten Coach of the Year, capturing the award in 1998, 2009 and 2012.\n\nIn 21 seasons, Izzo has posted a record of 524-205. The 524 wins are the fifth-highest total for a coach through 21 seasons in NCAA history. This past November, Izzo won his 500th career game, becoming the eighth coach to accomplish the feat in his first 21 seasons. One of the things in which Izzo takes the most pride is the difficult schedule Michigan State has faced over the years. Since 1997-98, the year of Izzo's first appearance in the NCAA Tournament, Michigan State has faced a nation's-best 205 ranked opponents.\n\nIzzo has repeatedly said that one of his top priorities is seeing his players reach their goals. Individually, players have excelled under Izzo. Ten Spartans (Charlie Bell, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Draymond Green, Gary Harris, Drew Neitzel, Adreian Payne, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson and Denzel Valentine) have earned some form of All-America honors. Thirty different players have earned all-conference recognition, including 12 different first-team honorees, five Big Ten Players of the Year (Cleaves, Green, Kalin Lucas, Peterson, Valentine), and one Big Ten Freshman of the Year (Harris). Both Green and Valentine have earned National Player of the Year honors under Izzo.\n\nSpartan student-athletes are prepared for life after Michigan State, both on and off the court. Under Izzo, 16 Spartans have been selected in the NBA Draft, including 15 since 2000, eight of whom were first rounders (Cleaves-2000 first round, Peterson-2000 first round, Richardson-2001 first round, Zach Randolph-2001 first round, Andre Hutson-2001 second round, Marcus Taylor-2002 second round, Erazem Lorbek-2005 second round, Shannon Brown-2006 first round, Maurice Ager-2006 first round, Davis-2006 second round, Goran Suton-2009 second round, Green-2012 second round, Adreian Payne-2014 first round, Harris-2014 first round, Branden Dawson -2015 second round). In addition, four undrafted Spartans (Bell, Alan Anderson, Lucas and Keith Appling) have also appeared in the NBA. Numerous other former Spartans have enjoyed lucrative professional careers playing overseas.\n\nThe Spartans have also experienced success in the classroom under Izzo. Chris Hill and Neitzel earned Academic All-America honors. Among players who have completed their eligibility under Izzo, 84 percent have left MSU with a degree.\n\nIzzo arrived at Michigan State prior to the 1983-84 season. He was promoted to associate head coach in 1990, and on March 30, 1993, then-MSU Athletics Director Merrily Dean Baker recommended that Izzo be appointed head coach following Jud Heathcote's retirement following the 1994-95 season. He came to MSU from Northern Michigan, where he served as an assistant at his alma mater from 1979-83. His coaching career began as head coach at Ishpeming High School in 1977-78.",
  "latent_22298": "Seeing The Internet As An 'Information Weapon'\n\nSecond of two parts\n\nThe United States and other world powers have agreed to arms control measures in recent years that limit the deployment and use of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, as well as tanks and other artillery pieces.\n\nA Fight To Control Information Countries that have endorsed a Russian-sponsored U.N. initiative to strengthen \"information security\" on the Internet:\n\nSo why is there no arms control measure that would apply to the use of cyberweapons?\n\nIt is not for lack of attention to the issue. Government and military leaders around the world have warned that the next world war is likely to be fought at least partly in cyberspace, and cyber \"disarmament\" discussions have been under way at the United Nations for more than a decade and more recently at the International Telecommunications Union, the leading U.N. agency for information technology issues.\n\nThe problem is that governments have widely varying ideas of what constitutes a \"cyberweapon\" -- and what a \"cyberwar\" might look like.\n\nAdvanced industrial democracies are likely to see a cyberattack as an assault on the computer infrastructure that underlies power, telecommunications, transportation and financial systems.\n\ntoggle caption AFP\n\nBut many developing countries see cyberwar in political terms.\n\nThe Russian government, the leading advocate for a cyber-arms-control agreement, prefers the term \"information war\" and describes the threat in terms that make cyber conflict sound like a battle of ideas.\n\nEach year since 1998, Russia has introduced a resolution at the United Nations calling for an international agreement to combat what it calls \"information terrorism.\" Russian leaders worry that the Internet makes it so easy for people to communicate that a government could use the Internet to challenge another country's political system. Some Russian diplomats have actually revived an old Soviet term -- \"ideological aggression\" -- to describe what governments could do to each other via the Internet.\n\nAt a U.N. disarmament conference in 2008, Sergei Korotkov of the Russian Defense Ministry argued that anytime a government promotes ideas on the Internet with the goal of subverting another country's government -- even in the name of democratic reform -- it should qualify as \"aggression.\" And that, in turn, would make it illegal under the U.N. Charter.\n\n\"Practically any information operation conducted by a state or a number of states against another state would be qualified as an interference into internal affairs,\" Korotkov said through an interpreter. So any good cause, like [the] promotion of democracy, cannot be used as a justification for such actions.\"\n\nThe United States has consistently opposed efforts to limit Internet communication, but the Russians are not alone in their interpretation of the \"information\" threat. James Lewis, who has advised the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, says he's heard similar views from several governments.\n\n\"The thing that really unites them is their desire to control information, to control content,\" Lewis says. \"They see information as a weapon. An official from one of those countries told me [that] Twitter is an American plot to destabilize foreign governments. That's what they think. And so they're asking, 'How do we get laws that control the information weapon?' \"\n\nLast year, Russia successfully sponsored an even sharper version of its cyber disarmament proposal at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which includes China and four Central Asian countries as well as Russia. The accord defined \"information war,\" in part, as an effort by a state to undermine another's \"political, economic, and social systems.\"\n\nUsing the term \"mass psychologic [sic] brainwashing,\" the agreement said that the dissemination of information \"harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states\" should be considered a \"security threat.\"\n\nU.S. diplomats suspect the Russians view the Shanghai accord as a blueprint for the kind of cyber disarmament agreement they would like to see approved at the U.N.\n\nGiven the open nature of the Internet, the implementation of content controls in the name of cyberpeace may require some changes in the way the Internet is governed.\n\nIn recent months, the debate over Internet governance and cyber-arms control has moved to the International Telecommunications Union. The ITU secretary-general, Hamadoun Toure, has even suggested that his organization could \"broker\" a cyber disarmament accord.\n\n\"My dream is to have a cyberpeace treaty,\" Toure said in London earlier this month.\n\nU.S. officials are wary of Toure's agenda, in part because he has linked his cyber disarmament ideas to proposals for restructuring Internet governance in ways that would boost government controls. But his ideas have considerable support in the developing world.\n\n\"India feels this way. Brazil feels this way. China feels this way,\" says Lewis, who directs the Technology and Public Policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"They want a bigger role for government on the Internet.\"\n\nHarvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, author of Who Controls the Internet, sees a parallel between broad geopolitical trends and the changing international lineup on cyber governance. Just as emerging economic powers are redefining the global economy, he says, those same countries are also trying to influence the Internet.\n\n\"How could it be any other way?\" Goldsmith says. \"[The Internet] is a hugely important [and] consequential political, social and economic tool. And powerful nations are going to try to wield it and shape it to reflect their interests. The network will increasingly, I fear, look like what they want it to look like.\"\n\nThe desire of many countries to see more regulation in cyberspace has prompted the Obama administration to work with Russia and other governments to establish some norms of \"appropriate government behavior\" in cyberspace.\n\nBut the United States would not support information controls -- and continuing disagreements over the definition of cyberweapons are likely to complicate any effort to reach international agreement on a broad cyber disarmament accord.",

  "latent_22541": "Jessica Chastain in Miss Sloane\n\nMiss Sloane, like the gun-control movement as a whole, is a flop.\n\nMiss Sloane, a highly anticipated movie demonizing the NRA and calling for gun control, has bombed. The movie succeeded only in emphasizing the top-down nature of the gun-control campaign and how little intensity there is for more regulations.\n\nThe movie seemed to have everything going for it. Liberal movie critics loved it, and it was backed by a hefty ad budget along with heaps of favorable news coverage. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has already nominated the movie’s star, Jessica Chastain, for a prestigious Golden Globe, considered a strong predictor of the Oscars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut two weeks after its national release, it has made only $3.2 million. During its second weekend, it averaged just $102 per movie theater per day. With a ticket price of $10.30 per adult, that comes to an average of only 9.9 people a day seeing the movie in any given theater. At least people had no problem finding a good seat.\n\nAnd it wasn’t for lack of trying to get people to show up. Out of the 200 highest-grossing movies of 2016, only ten exceeded the $15.9 million television advertising budget of Miss Sloane, and seven of those did so by very small amounts. Miss Sloane spent more than the Star Wars spinoff Rogue One, Star Trek, Pete’s Dragon, Arrival, Doctor Strange, and Hacksaw Ridge. It had twice the advertising budget of such hits as Sully, The Girl on the Train, and The Secret Life of Pets.\n\nFor every dollar spent on advertising, Miss Sloane brought in just 21 cents in ticket sales. By this measure, it came in dead last out of the 200 top-grossing movies in 2016. No one else was even close. Coming in second-to-last was Collateral Beauty, which made 53 cents per advertising dollar. The average movie made almost $2 for each dollar spent on advertising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTV ads for Miss Sloane aired a total of 2,270 times: 316 times on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC; 289 on prime-time CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox shows. All told, they covered 34 different networks.\n\nThe concept of the script had also been thoroughly road-tested. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have galvanized public support by suggesting that politicians are intimidated from passing sensible regulations only because gun makers want to make money. And, like a Clinton or Obama speech, the film leaves out all of the strong arguments made by gun-control opponents. There is no response to concerns that the very gun-sale-control regulations being pushed in the movie primarily disarm law-abiding citizens, especially poor blacks and Hispanics living in high-crime inner cities.\n\nWill Democrats follow the box-office returns?\n\nPoorly funded gun-control advocates are shown doing battle with the big, bad National Rifle Association. Of course, Michael Bloomberg is never mentioned. He would spoil the story, since he gives $50 million a year to his regulation-pushing Everytown for Gun Safety. This is 2.5 times more than the NRA spends on political activities. From 2013 to 2016, Bloomberg donated a total of $48 million to candidates running for federal office. The NRA contributed just $2.1 million. And that’s not even mentioning the hundreds of millions that Bloomberg, George Soros, and others funnel into producing gun-control research.\n\nIndeed, if it weren’t for Bloomberg, there wouldn’t be a gun-control movement today. The continually repeated claim that 80 to 90 percent of Americans favor background checks on private transfers of guns is an illusion of poorly done polling. Bloomberg’s Nevada ballot initiative eked out a win this November by less than one percentage point, and only because of the almost $20 million spent on it, amounting to an incredible $35.30 per vote. In Maine, the same initiative failed by eight percentage points despite equally unlimited spending. Even in Washington state, which passed the initiative with 59 percent of the vote, Bloomberg and his supporters outspent those opposed to it 33-fold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#related#Surveys have long shown that gun control has not been something Americans feel intensely about, with usually only 1 percent of Americans saying it is an important issue. The movie’s empty theaters are just one more measure of that lack of intensity.\n\nBack in January 2014, prominent film-studio executive Harvey Weinstein promised a gun-control movie that would make the NRA “wish they weren’t alive.” Meryl Streep was scheduled to star in the movie (titled “The Senator’s Wife”), but almost three years later it is still listed as “in development.” With each passing year it looks like Weinstein’s taunt was never serious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question is now whether Democrats will follow the box-office returns better than they have followed the polls.\n\n– John R.

They value men and women equality.\n\nSo they will save 1 men for every 1 women.\n\nThird tribe consider Women’s safety as there priority.\n\nSo they will save 1 men for every 2 women.\n\nAfter that all tribes will enter recovery, In every generation after the disaster 3 babies that will reach adulthood will be born.\n\nWe will see how long it will take tribes to recover.\n\nTribe A (Men are more valuable)\n\nStart: 300 people: 150 men and 150 women\n\nDisaster strike\n\n150 people 100 men and just 50 women survive the disaster.\n\nRecovery begins 3 new people for every 1 women.\n\n150(50*3) people 75 men, and 75 women in the first generation after the disaster.\n\n225(75*3) people, 112 men and 113 women in the second generation.\n\n339(113*3) people, 169 men and 170 women in third generation. Recovery complete.\n\nTribe B (Egalitarians)\n\n300 people 150 men and 150 women\n\nDisaster strike\n\n150 people 75 men and 75 women survive the disaster.\n\nRecovery begins 3 new people for every 1 women.\n\n225(75*3) people 112 men and 113 women in the first generation after the disaster.\n\n339(113*3) people, 169 men and 170 women, in the second generation.

Tribe A will need 75 years, Tribe B 50 years, and Tribe C 25 years.\n\nNow 2 generation will be strike with disaster.\n\nTribe A (Men are more valuable)\n\n300 people 150 men and 150 women.\n\nDisaster strike.\n\n100 men and 50 women.\n\nRecovery. 3 new people for every 1 women.\n\n150(50*3) people 75 men and 75 women.\n\nSecond disaster strike.

Survive the second disaster\n\nRecovery take them 1 generation.\n\nIn 5 generation that Tribe A need to recover the number of Tribe C will reach over 1500 people and they will be split in to 5 new tribes.\n\nFor does who wonder. 3 disasters in the row\n\nTribe A will go down to 36 people (24 men and 12 women) They will recover in 7 generations.\n\nTribe B will go down to 84 people (42 men and 42 women) They will recover in 4 generations.\n\nTribe C recover always in 1 generation. In 7 generation They go to little more than 3400 people splited in more than 11 tribes.\n\nNow I encourage you to have fun with this numbers.\n\nHowever basic rule will always emerge. Tribes, Cultures, Nations that put safety of there women as highest priority are better off than groups that will not do so.\n\nI know that some critic will be toss on this model. So I want repeat basics from Lesson 1.\n\nWomen are the choke-point in creating new generation. Women go through 9 month of pregnancy, than childbirth and than they need to take care of child for ad least couple weeks if not months.\n\n50 guys can easily impregnate 500 women. However 500 men will fight for access to the 50 women.\n\nTo quote Doctor Warren Farrel.\n\n“What every civilization needs is strong backs to build and protect it. Second they need a way to replace this backs.”\n\nI want you to remember lesson 2. Men are more physically capable.\n\nThe basics of first two lesson that I show you create reality when society must convince men to sacrifice. To sacrifice there life to defend the tribe. Sacrifice to take the dangerous job. Sacrifice to keep women safe. Because society can afford losing males.\n\nBut lose of women is lost chance for future generation.\n\nMen are Disposable. Women are protected.\n\nMany repeat that in the past women were oppress by men. This is false. Societies and environment oppress both men and women. Or to quote once again Dr. Farrel\n\n“Men don’t oppress women any more than women oppress men.”\n\nI know that you need more to even giving this notion a chance.\n\nSo pleas watch this two videos.\n\nFirst one will tell you more about disposable men.\n\nSecond will tell you about female privilege, and how it can backfire.\n\nBecause here is catch, Societies are first and fore most consider with women safety. Not with there happiness. This is something new. In the pass women were force in to position were they were more safer, and by this men were force in to positions of protectors.\n\nEven in war propaganda you can see this.\n\nYou hear young men? You must enlist because women say that you should go.\n\nto protect women and children.\n\nto keep this dirty hands of them.\n\nYou men must destroy this mad brute.\n\nYou want even more? Than pleas listen to this Emma Watson UN speech. The Feminists who say that men have issues, that if things change for men they will change for women as natural consequence. That’s why they ask MEN to step up and take the pledge to help women.\n\nThe imperative to protect women is every where. Even in videos games. The famous feminist video game critic Anita Sarkesian repeats that in so many games the hero is men and he save some women.\n\nAnd she toss this out as male power fantasy. Not once, not even for moment she stop and realize that imperative to protect women is so previous in our culture that even in fantasy the only thing that men need to know. To go on dangerous quest, is that women is in danger and he must save her.\n\nAnd just to squash the male power fantasy. Pleas take look ad this covers of romance novels.\n\nAnonymus 4channer sum up this brilliantly.\n\nMen and Women are suppose to work in duet. Women dreams about strong powerful guy that will protect them. Men dream about being strong powerful guy who protect women and is adore and respected. They compliment each other. They suppose to create a pair.",
  "latent_22872": "Introduction\n\nAdopting a vividly detailed 5.7-inch Quad HD (1440 pixel) screen together with stereo sound, the water repellent Android based and high-customizable Moto X Style smartphone boasts TurboPower charging tech that’s capable of 10 -hours of battery life in just 15 mins of charging, it’s claimed.\n\nAs for imaging process, the Moto X Style offers a 21-Mpix camera with a wide-angle lens, rapid autofocus and low shutter lag, plus a color-balancing built-in flash. In our industry standard photo and video tests, consisting of real world use and stringent lab analysis, this new Moto achieves some highly competitive results, proving that there’s no distinction between style and substance.\n\nRanking\n\nAchieving an excellent score in the DxOMark Mobile tests, the Moto X Style comes joint second alongside the Samsung Galaxy Note IV and edging the Sony XPeria Z3+ into third place.\n\nWith an over DxOMark Mobile score of 83 points, the Moto X Style is just three points behind our current leader the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and shows the maker hasn’t prioritized style over substance.\n\nPhoto and Video Sub-scores\n\nIn our industry standard tests the Moto X Style attained high scores across many of the categories and is a well-balanced performer overall. Scores for Exposure and contrast and Color are on a par with the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and iPhone 6 Plus and remained competitive for Autofocus, Texture (detail), and for control of Noise and Artifacts.\n\nAlthough the Moto X Style achieved a good score of 76 points for Flash operation, it was somewhat behind this models but it’s convincing result nonetheless.\n\nFrom our tests, a mix of outdoor real-world scenes and lab tests, images produced by the Moto X Style are generally well exposed even under tricky lighting. However, although images show good shadow recovery in high contrast scenes some highlights were clipped with the expected loss of details in those areas. In the low light tests (5 lux), exposure inaccuracies were noticeable with images being slightly underexposed, though remaining quite useable.\n\nWhite Balance was mostly accurate and color was good in most situations particularly in bright light though not unexpectedly less so in low light. Colors remain pleasing however and are mostly free of the typical and distracting yellow cast under tungsten lighting.\n\nLike many rival offerings color shading was evident at times, and was easy to see in bright, uniformly lit outdoor scenes, for example of subjects against a light colored wall or background. Although less obvious depending on the scene and lighting in our low light analysis (at 20 lux) the shading is visible as slightly pink coloration in the center and green in the corners.\n\nSharpness and autofocus accuracy were very good and focusing was fast under all test lighting conditions, though some focusing oscillation and overshooting was observed during previewing in low light. Somewhat typically, color fringing was visible on high contrast edges. And in addition to some ringing-type artifacts, saturation in the blue channel was evident. This was particularly noticeable in rendering blue skies.\n\nUnder good lighting, noise is barely noticeable and preservation of fine detail was very good. In our indoor noise tests under low light (20 lux) the Moto X Style didn’t perform quite so confidently. Although pictures retained quite good levels of detail, noise was readily visible however.\n\nFlash performance was one area of weakness for the X Style, at least when compared to the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. While white balance was accurate with pleasing color and good detail, images showed occasional slight overexposure, strong chroma noise and reduced illumination in the corners along with a pink tint on the left and green to the right.\n\nVideo\n\nVideo results were equally strong with the X Style offering a good balance of performance. In our scores the X Style achieved a Video score of 83 points, just one point behind the current leader the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nThe X Style delivered good results for exposure accuracy, color and white balance adjustment and particularly so with image stabilization, where it was one of the best we’ve seen to date. Although the X Style achieved a relatively low score for noise that was visible in the corners of the frame in low light, it reversed the trend and delivered a good score for texture preservation and control of artifacts. Occasional line skipping in one video test and some traces of ringing prevented the X Style from beating the S6 Edge in that category. In addition to the weaker score for noise, autofocus was another area that held the X Style back a little, where some slow focus adjustments and occasional overshooting was observed in low light levels.\n\nOutdoors under good lighting, white balance is accurate and colors are pleasing. Exposure accuracy is generally good even under trying conditions, though slight underexposure is not uncommon.\n\nAlthough the foreground in this outdoor scene shows good shadow recovery, the limited dynamic range has resulted in some highlight clipping.\n\nIndoors under tungsten illuminant, without the typical yellow tint both the white balance and resulting colors are good.\n\nIn this outdoor scene sharpness is high and detail preservation is very good, while noise is barely noticeable in areas of single color (in this case the sky).\n\nIn our low-light (20 lux) test scene, images retain quite good levels of detail but noise is noticeable.",

John McCain answers a question during a town hall in Scottsdale in August 2015. He and others are taking steps to avoid disruptions by protesters at events. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\nWASHINGTON — With tensions rising over President Donald Trump's agenda and the fate of the Affordable Care Act, liberal activists and voters are demanding lawmakers hold events where they can vent their frustrations.\n\nThe public town-hall meeting is a classic American political tradition, giving voters the opportunity to ask questions or complain to their elected representatives.\n\nBut recalling the lessons of the 2009 \"tea party\" uprising in which conservatives swarmed such meetings — and a few more recent examples in which Republican lawmakers around the country were drubbed by angry crowds — some senators and representatives are rethinking their approach.\n\nThe goal: Don't go viral.\n\nSensing an organized liberal effort to set them up for bad publicity at town-hall meetings, some lawmakers are conducting Q&A sessions via large telephone conference calls, where participants can be screened, or with the employees of a private business, an audience that usually is better behaved because their bosses are watching.\n\nRELATED: How to contact your member of Congress\n\nIn a widely covered incident, U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the House Oversight Committee chairman, earlier this month took a beating from constituents who said he has been lax in holding Trump accountable for possible conflicts of interest. Video clips of the gathering circulated widely on social media.\n\nCLOSE Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz got grilled by a fiery crowd during a local town hall. A retired teacher asked him 'what is your line in the sand?' and if he will hold President Trump accountable. USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nU.S. Reps. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., and Diane Black, R-Tenn., also have been on the receiving end of outbursts at town-hall meetings; McClintock exited his forum with police help.\n\nProgressive pressure groups using the name \"Indivisible\" have sprung up around the country, trying to force Republicans to hold more public meetings. An online \"Indivisible\" guide makes their intentions clear: Use the same tea-party tactics that hurt President Barack Obama and the Democrats to resist Trump and the GOP.\n\n\"MoCs (members of Congress) regularly hold local 'town halls' or public listening sessions throughout their districts or state,\" says the guide, which apparently was put together by erstwhile congressional aides. \"Tea Partiers used these events to great effect — both to directly pressure their MoCs and to attract media to their cause.\"\n\nRELATED: McCain: Out-of-state callers tying up lines\n\nNobody knows the damaging political optics of a hasty escape from an unruly crowd better than U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Last year, he ran television ads featuring August 2009 footage of his Democratic Senate challenger, then-U.S. Rep Ann Kirkpatrick, fleeing a constituent event at a grocery store in Holbrook.\n\nOne pro-McCain TV ad said Kirkpatrick \"betrayed Arizona on 'Obamacare,' walking out on constituents when questioned about it.\"\n\nMcCain and U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., this year have been deluged with telephone calls and emails from activists who want them to oppose the confirmation of certain Trump Cabinet picks or take action on other issues.\n\nMcCain, who was famous for holding town halls in New Hampshire and other states while running for president in 2007 and 2008, told The Arizona Republic that he intends to host some sort of modified town-hall sessions in the future. But the gatherings might not be open to everybody.\n\n\"We may do like we've been doing and that is go to a company or a corporation or a business in Arizona and have it with them,\" McCain said. \"There's been almost constant sit-ins in my office, as you know. And the phones have been tied up. You want to have a town-hall meeting where you can listen to people and they listen to you. If it's just going to be one of these filled with demonstrators, there's no point in it.\"\n\nThe group \"Indivisible AZ\" organized an event Saturday in Mesa using the hashtag #SearchForFlake. The message was that Flake has been missing in action in Arizona and has not scheduled any town-hall meetings for this week.\n\nFlake, who is up for re-election in 2018, told The Republic he will hold some town halls at some point, and has just been too busy in Washington to have had any in recent weeks.\n\nBecause Senate Democrats are not cooperating, the confirmation process is taking longer, and Flake and other senators must be prepared to work on the weekends sometimes, he said. That makes scheduling constituent events a challenge.\n\n\"We'll be doing some telephone town halls coming up, but I'll have regular town halls as well,\" Flake said. \"The last thing you want to do is schedule a town hall on a Saturday and then have to cancel it, because then people will say, 'Oh, they canceled because they're afraid of the crowds or whatever else.' ... I enjoy them, but you've got to be able to make sure you're there.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who represents southern Arizona's competitive 2nd Congressional District, also scoffed at suggestions that she is afraid to face voters, even calling it \"a bit insulting.\"\n\n\"Some of the feedback is like, 'McSally was courageous in combat but she's afraid to face her constituents.' Give me a break,\" McSally, an Air Force veteran, said. \"I put my life on the line for us to have the freedom and opportunity to have the kind of dialogues that are important to representative government. ... I'm not afraid of anything.\"\n\nMcSally said a \"focused effort, nationally\" has been helping coordinate the demands for town-hall meetings. She said she has been \"engaging tirelessly\" in her district for the past two years using different models, including Facebook, meeting with small groups and even protesters, and answering letters and emails. She held a telephone town hall on Tuesday.\n\n\"If your goal is to be disruptive, that's not useful,\" McSally said. \"But if your goal is to have a civil dialogue on people's concerns across the board, whether it's related to actions by the administration or anything else, then there are ways to have civil dialogues.\"\n\nRELATED: Democrats are fired up.

It's not a Q-and-A with the audience.\n\n\"This is a conversation between me and Dave Brat,\" Gosar said. \"It’s not an open town hall. It’s learning about people who are in the news today.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., said he understands that GOP lawmakers have been advised by leaders not to hold town-hall events. The Republicans are in a bind, he said, because they are not yet able to articulate how they plan to replace Obama's Affordable Care Act, which critics on the right have dubbed \"Obamacare.\"\n\n“At home, I do constituent events on a regular basis and the interest and the volume of attendance has skyrocketed.” U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema\n\n\"That's what happened to us: We went out for the ACA without having the president's plan or anything,\" Grijalva recalled of the 2009 public outpouring of opposition that presaged the 2010 midterm elections in which Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives. \"Just, 'We're going to do health reform. Here are the basic forms.' And that's when we got hit with 'death panels.' We were defending something that we weren't fully informed of what it was. I think that's what's happening to the Republicans.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said Democrats are feeling pressure too.\n\n\"The phone calls, letters and emails have dramatically increased,\" Sinema said. \"In fact, we are in the process of adding an additional staffer to help us deal with the volumes of letters. At home, I do constituent events on a regular basis and the interest and the volume of attendance has skyrocketed.\"\n\nThe monthly \"Kyrsten In Your Community\" events offer constituents one-on-one access to Sinema and her staff.\n\n\"There are some people who come who are frustrated, but we talk and everything's fine,\" she said. \"I try to be who I am, which is someone who is empathetic and caring and listening.

  "latent_23283": "Just a week after telling the Australian media to be kinder and to stop attacking each other (to howls of laughter), News Corp’s Australian boss Michael Miller joined a chorus of media chiefs who accused the public broadcasters of stealing audiences with their free content, distorting the market for commercial players and aggressively competing for TV shows and online news audiences.\n\nThe Australian used its front page to launch an unedifying attack on the ABC and SBS (“Calls to rein in ABC and SBS”) which continued for a couple of days. “Corporate chiefs at News Corp, Fairfax Media, Seven West Media and Nine Entertainment are among a group of industry leaders throwing new weight behind criticisms the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service are overstepping their public service remit,” the report said.\n\nWhile attacks on the ABC are commonplace at the Oz, SBS was now in Murdoch’s sights. Why? Because The Handmaid’s Tale was a hit. While News Corp hates Netflix as its competition for Foxtel, what they hate even more than the US giant is “free Netflix” or SBS on Demand, which has built an excellent library of quality TV shows, documentaries and classic movies. SBS also bought the online rights to The Handmaid’s Tale, the show of 2017, and the commercial media are jealous.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale review – no television event has hit such a nerve Read more\n\n“It’s rank hypocrisy really,” the SBS managing director, Michael Ebeid, said of the attack in the Australian. “News Corp, who is running the agenda against us, has received $30m for women’s sport on Foxtel and millions of dollars through Screen Australia to produce drama for Foxtel and Screen Australia money for a crime vodcast on the Australian. But all this content is locked up to 30% of homes who have Foxtel and 70% of Australians can’t watch it. For them to be crying foul when they’re taking money from the public purse is just crazy.”\n\nDespite many requests neither Foxtel nor the government has explained what the $30m is for.\n\nEbeid said: “Surely anyone can see that our budget is 10% of Seven and Nine. We spend $130m on TV, Seven spends $1.4bn and Nine $1.3bn. So at 10% how does the little guy outbid them? I think they just enjoy throwing hand grenades over the fence and running. We’re giving audiences content they’re not getting elsewhere and they’re doing the same thing they’ve been doing for 10 years.”\n\nIn the same week Handmaid’s Tale dominated the catch-up rankings as viewers binge-watched the show, Seven’s top show was the universally panned reality show Yummy Mummies.\n\nAnd no SBS did not outbid anyone to get The Handmaid’s Tale. They picked it up as part of a broader content deal with the distributor MGM which gave them an additional 100 hours of television on top of the groundbreaking show. “There was no bidding war,” Ebeid said. “Channel Nine would not have wanted any of that content. We had no idea it would be a hit. We take these risks every day. I think they’re just being a bunch of sookie boys to be honest.”\n\nAll about the metrics\n\nThe editor of the Rupert Murdoch’s Townsville Bulletin, Ben English, has raised the stakes in his newsroom by telling reporters “a key measure” of performance “will be how many subscriptions your stories generated”.\n\nWith legacy media companies like News Corp and Fairfax struggling to survive, digital subscriptions have become a lifeline and if reporters’ stories are so strong they motivate readers to subscribe it makes editors really happy.\n\n“This will be the most important objective of our newsroom from now on,” English said in a memo obtained by Weekly Beast. English congratulated reporter Andrew Backhouse who has “more than doubled his nearest rival with more than 46k page views”.\n\n“In the coming days and weeks I will sit down with each of our reporters to outline new, more focused measures of performance,” English said.\n\n“These will zero in on specific objectives including page views and time spent on articles.”\n\nWhen English says “time spent on articles” by the way, he means time spent reading them online not researching and writing them. For the record, $7 a week will give you unrestricted digital access to the Townsville Bulletin and a home delivered paper six days a week.\n\nGovernment declines to explain Foxtel's $30m handout for sports broadcasting Read more\n\nMoir scribbles on\n\nSadly the Courier Mail newsroom suffered more major losses on Thursday and Friday this week. Sources say about a dozen people were made forcibly redundant while a smaller group left voluntarily. The 20-odd departures were mainly subeditors, page designers and backbench editors.\n\nThe multi-award winning Sydney Morning Herald cartoonist Alan Moir was a victim of Fairfax’s recent brutal staff cuts. After more than 30 years on the paper he lost his gig as a daily cartoonist but continues as a Saturday-only contributor. But Moir is not giving up his day job that easily. He is still drawing daily cartoons and publishing them on a subscription website. For just $4 a month fans can still get his scribblings in their inbox daily. Pretty innovative we thought.\n\nOakes calls time\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s time’: Political reporter Laurie Oakes is set to retire after a career spanning more than 50 years. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP\n\nArguably the greatest Canberra press gallery reporter of all time, Laurie Oakes, has announced his retirement after almost 50 years covering national affairs. The Channel Nine political editor, who is about to turn 74, began his role at Nine in 1984 and has been an institution ever since. His hard-hitting political interviews on the Sunday program, his exclusive reports on the Nine News bulletin and his written analysis in the Bulletin and the Daily Telegraph have made him one of the most respected journalists in the nation’s capital and one of the most recognisable faces on TV.\n\n“To pinch an election slogan – it’s time,” Oakes said.\n\nMichelle Grattan (@michellegrattan) The place won't be the same without Laurie, who has the capacity to terrify politicians in a way no one else can\n\nAccording to Oakes his best exclusives were: the Kirribilli leadership pact between Bob Hawke and Paul Keating; staring down Julia Gillard at the Press Club over the Kevin Rudd coup; the leak of the entire 1980 federal budget; the travel rorts scandal of 1997 which cost three ministers their jobs; and the Gair Affair, where Gough Whitlam tried to use a diplomatic appointment to shore up his numbers in parliament.\n\nDead men don’t write letters\n\nLast October Port Stephens resident Scott Broadhead was shocked to see a letter from his father in the Fairfax Media local paper under the headline “Bike path an asset”. His dad Bill Broadhead had written to congratulate Port Stephens Council for building and maintaining a local cycling and walking track.\n\nScott was shocked because his father had died two years earlier – and because the letter was written by him seven years ago. It was also the second printing of said letter, which led him to wonder if the paper was recycling letters. Scott complained to the Australian Press Council that it was “totally insensitive and misled the public that its message was current” and the council ruled it breached standards of accuracy.\n\n“The council considers that the publication of the letter suggested the author of the letter was alive, had recently offered his congratulations on the pathways to Port Stephens Council rather than just the mayor, was recently impressed by the maintenance of the paths, and that this was the first time this letter had been published,” the adjudication said.\n\n“The publication could have avoided these misleading impressions by observing the date on the email or contacting the author.”",
  "latent_23449": "Where could you encounter Passé Simple (the historical and formal tense)? You will probably not see it in a friendly chit-chat, maybe not even in this kind of blog article if it is translated into French. You will probably say \"so what is the point of knowing it? I am not a native speaker, and I can understand French text without it\". OK, you have some point there, but imagine one day, you are reading an amazing novel, and encounter a \"strange verb\" that you have never seen before. You are probably seeing a verb in Passé Simple, and you will no doubt regret not knowing it before. You know what, this tense is usually regarded as a complicated tense for foreign learners of French, but you can never \"feel\" the beauty and how flowery French is without understanding the passé simple. What a pity if this were the case, no? The purpose of this article is, of course, not to make you a master of Passé Simple, but to help you understand its rules and be able to recognize verbs using this tense So, ready to go? Grab your notebook and pen to take some notes. If you already have a good/fair level of French and a good memoire, you may try to write down a short paragraph employing Passé Simple after understanding the rules.\n\nWhat is passé simple? Most FLE students (Français Langue Etrangère – French as a Foreign Language) are told that Passé Simple is old-fashioned and that there is no need for them to understand it. No, don't do that. It would be a pity if you couldn't see and \"feel\" this beautiful aspect of the French language. The passé simple is as important as the passé compose, which is commonly used in spoken French. The passé simple or simple past in English takes the place of the Passé Composé in literature. It sounds more flowery and knowing it will help you to better understand novels written in French. When and where to use passé simple? Similar to the Passé Composé, the main role of the Passé Simple is to recount a specific action in the past. You will not hear a French guy to talk to you in this form as passé simple is only used in formal writing. You may not need it when talking in French but it is important that you know its rules as it is frequently used in formal writings, like presidential speeches, literature (fiction or non-fiction), etc.\n\nHow to use it simple past in French? The conjugation rule of the passé simple is not “simple” as its name suggests, and usually students who attempt to master this tense are advance-level students. But don't be afraid, if you follow the rules, recognizing and understanding this tense is really an achievable target. Tips: If you read a verb in a French novel that looks weird, think about the Passé Simple. Next, try to replace it with the passé composé, if you feel that the meaning of the sentence has not changed, so you are probably right (that this is the Passé Simple). 1. For regular verbs, to form passé simple, you have to drop the infinitive endings, such as –er, -ir, and –re, then replace it with the passé simple's endings. a. Verb –er Let's take the example of \"parler\" (to speak). Stem Passé simple endings Passé simple parl- ai Je parlai parl- as Tu parlas parl- a Il/Elle parla parl- âmes Nous parlâmes parl- âtes Vous parlâtes parl- èrent Ils/Elles parlèrent Note: If the verb ends with –cer, you will need to change c into ç to keep the sound of the soft c. EXAMPLES: J’avançai. Nous avançâmes. Ils avancèrent. The same rule applies to verbs ending in –ger, like voyager. Change the –g into –ge but add it before –a. EXAMPLES: Je voyageai. Tu voyageas. 2. Now, for regular verbs ending in -ir or -re, use the following endings: Stem Passé simple endings Passé simple fin- is Je finis fin- is Tu finis fin- it Il/Elle finit fin- îmes Nous finîmes fin- îtes Vous finîtes fin- irent Ils/Elles finirent\n\n3. For irregular verbs, we usually encounter these 2 types of endings: Ending -us Pronoun ending Example: être Je us Je fus Tu us Tu fus Il/Elle ut Il/Elle fut Nous ûmes Nous fûmes Vous ûtes Vous fûtes Ils/Elles urent Ils/Elles furent\n\nEnding -ins Pronoun ending Example: venir Je ins Je vins Tu ins Tu vins Il/Elle int Il/Elle vint Nous înmes Nous vînmes Vous întes Vous vîntes Ils/Elles inrent Ils/Elles vinrent\n\nThe hard part is to get the stem. Here , we would recommend you to learn the conjugation of some common irregular verbs (avoir, être, faire, savoir, pouvoir, devoir…), and then you will be able to recognize other verbs when you encounter them in a text. Quick Recap\n\nVerbs ending in –er, replace them with –ai, -as, -a, -ames, -ates and –erent\n\nVerbs ending in IR/RE will have –is, -it, -imes, -ites and –irent as their endings\n\nIrregular verbs use to have \"–us/ûmes\" or \"-is/îmes\" endings\n\ncheck Reading novels in French as much as possible will help to familiarize you with irregular verbs of the passé simple",

You can follow him on Twitter and read previous installments here.)\n\nI finally managed to rip down the electric reindeer from my neighbour's garage last night and had a pretty sweet spot picked out for it over my front window. So I goes to plug it in and the fucker don't flicker. I banged it on the ground like a hundred times, but it just wouldn't start working. But here's the thing—instead of nailing it up anyway, and stealin' a bunch of new lights and trying to drape them on top, I went out and stole another one from a different house, and it works fuckin' great.\n\nNow imagine if the original electric reindeer was a panther, and the replacement lights I was gonna drape over the lifeless carcass cost $68 million, and I was borrowing that money from my landlord. I bet you're thinkin', \"Deaner what the fuck are you talking about,\" and you're right, it don't make a lick of sense, but that's EXACTLY what's goin' on with the NHL and the Florida Panthers right now.\n\nREAD MORE: Say Goodbye to Peak Crosby\n\nThey're trying to loan $68 million on this dead fuckin' carcass!! I had more empties at my party than they had fans at the last Panthers game. It's a fuckin' joke. Hey, Gary, there's a brand new NHL rink in the East which sold out its EXHIBITION GAME three months in advance. Oh ya, that's right, Gary and his millionaire dickwads are gonna hold actual fans hostage to get $500 million for Nordiques expansion, so we may as well get used to the Panthers, cuz they ain't goin' anywhere.\n\nBut get a load of the holiday DEAL at Sunrise—TWO premium tickets to THREE GAMES, TWO tix to the Everglades theme park (where you get to airdrop out of a helicopter on an actual gator into the bayou), free parking, TWO JERSEYS, AND an autographed puck, for $99. THIS IS REAL! Sorry for the all caps but THAT'S $17 A TICKET for an NHL GAME!!!! Sweet Mary on a merry-go-round it costs more to go see the fucking Wheeling Nailers. And at the arena in Wheeling, they don't even have a zamboni between periods, they just drag around a wasted guy who pissed his pants. C'mon!\n\nOh, sure, the players love comin' to the rink in flip flops and swim trunks, but how do you think Jonathan Huberdeau feels when he gets a hat trick on home ice and the only thing that comes flying down from the fans is an IOU from Gary Bettman? Bush league. And of course if they get their loan, the league's promised them an All-Star Game. Just unreal.\n\nAnd, man, this coach's challenge disaster... one day there's gonna be a challenge for the Stanley Cup-winning goal, and we're all gonna be sittin' there for like 45 minutes while some chimpanzee in Toronto looks at a screen. Did they win the Cup or not? Only the monkey knows! Guys, the NHL made $4.1 BILLION last year. BILLIONS!!!!! If I'm in charge, fuck the coach's challenge.\n\nI'd hire a team of trained hockey dogs who can sniff out rules to watch every single game and the second they see something wrong, the dogs start fuckin' barking like crazy! They have a direct line to the refs. Did they score when it was offside? Call down, stop the fucking game and blow off the play. No goal. Now put the time bark on the clock and let's get the barkin' game bark on.\n\nCoach always says hockey's all about confidence—no matter how much talent you got, if you keep losin' all the time you're gonna start to feel like a fuckin' loser. So here's what I think we should do to help out the Oilers and Leafs who must really be feelin like fuckin' losers right now. You drop both teams down a division to the AHL, and see what happens. Best-case scenario, they play each other for the Calder Cup, the Oilers win, the boys feel like winners, they move on back up and maybe make the NHL playoffs in 2017. Baby steps. And the Leafs, well, I bet the fans would just be so fuckin' stoked they finally had a winning team, they wouldn't give a shit if their opponents were the Baltimore Grey Nuns, so AHL might be the long-term solution.\n\nWell, that's it for this week.

  "latent_23723": "You might have heard about the spectacular misadventures of one Gary Faulkner. Equipped with little more than a sword he'd bought on a home-shopping network, a pair of night-vision goggles, and the blessing of a vengeful Christian God, the 50-year-old ex-con (and his failing kidneys) traveled to the most volatile region of Pakistan to capture Osama bin Laden. What's surprising is that it wasn't his first attempt. It was his eleventh.\n\nTalking to Gary Faulkner's friends, the impression you get is that they had become so accustomed to this one unusual fact about good old Garythe pursuit that would eventually bring about his weird, jagged flash of famethat it had come to seem quite commonplace. Routine. Unremarkable. Just one more detail about a man they knew:\n\nGary was the kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back. Gary could eat prodigious amounts of chicken wings. Gary was an inventive contractor and carpenter who excelled at tile countertops. Gary was always joking around. Gary disappeared every now and again to hunt down Osama bin Laden.\n\nWhen it was reported in June that a 50-year-old from Greeley, Colorado, had been found high in the mountains of Pakistan near the Afghan border carrying a sword, a dagger, a pistol, and night-vision equipment and apparently declaring \"I think Osama is responsible for bloodshed in the world, and I want to kill him,\" the romance of such a solo quest struck a chord around the globe.\n\nThere were skeptics, too. No wonderit already seemed such a lunatic and improbable tale. But one kind of skepticism, at least, made no sense at all: the notion that this was an act of publicity-seeking. If that had been all Gary Faulkner had wanted, then he would surely have tried to interest the world in his missions before now. This was, after all, his eleventh attempt.\n\nGary's youngest brother, Scott, a doctor in Fort Morgan, Colorado, drove him to the Denver airport two weeks earlier, on May 30. \"He was in great spirits,\" says Scott. \"He was excited about his trip. I remember he was looking at his crossbow, deciding whether or not he should take it.\" Outside the airport, Scott used his phone to snap what he feared might be the last photo of his brother, turning and grinning to the camera. Scott recalls his farewell: \"Be safe, come back to me alive, and keep your head low.\"\n\n\"You got it!\" Gary replied.\n\nScott began to discover how poorly this last injunctionthat his brother keep his head lowhad worked when his phone rang at four in the morning on June 15. Soon everyone knew, including their mother, who didn't even know Gary was in Pakistan until Fox News called.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she told them. \"I know a Gary Faulkner. But he's on dialysis three times a week.\"\n\nScott, who became the family's de facto spokesman, gave interviews explaining that this mission wasn't some whim of his brother's but something he had been committed to for a long time, and for which he had planned carefully. Over these first few days the question Scott had to field most often was: Do you think your brother's crazy?\n\n\"Well, as a physician I see people with psychological problems all day,\" he says, \"and I could attest that he did not have psychosis, paranoia, schizophrenia, any of those diagnoses. Yes, it's out of the norm, but that's what Gary does. It was his passion, his calling.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Gary had committed, or would be charged with, a crime in Pakistan, but eventually the family was informed through the State Department that he could come home if they sent $683 to pay for his changed airline ticket. At the airport, Gary addressed the media scrum: \"What this is about is the American people and the world,\" he told them. \"We can't let people like this scare us. We don't get scared by people like this. We scare them. And that's what this is about.\"\n\n\"I believe that is going to go down in history,\" his other brother, Todd, tells me, \"and kids are going to write essays about that 200 years from now.\"\n\nWe expect our heroes to be exactly how we want them to be. Our idiots, frauds, and madmen, too. But from the first moment that he was allowed to tell his own story, Gary Faulkner made clear that it would often not fit with anyone's expectations, and that furthermore he really wasn't too concerned with whether it did or whether it didn't.\n\nFrom the start, he wanted to clear up some misconceptions about what he was doing in Pakistan. He told everyone who would listen that he had never planned to kill Osama bin Laden but rather to capture him and deliver him to the Pakistani authorities. It turned out that this information was contained in CNN's original report, but the narrative of Faulkner as the armed solo avenging assassin was so compelling that this was widely ignored. You could almost feel the disappointment when Faulkner kept insisting upon his nonlethal intentions, because it seemed less melodramatically satisfying, and also because it seemed even more impractical. (As did Faulkner's further puzzling suggestion that once he had found bin Laden he had hoped to use his dialysis machine, for if the reports are correct, they share an affliction.)\n\nFaulkner soon flew to New York to appear on The Early Show, The View, Letterman, and Fox News, where he seemed, second by second, to charm, scare, and confuse his hosts. A few of his tropes became familiarhis habit of referring to his target as \"Binny Boy,\" for instance, and, more annoyingly, his insistence on always referring to the former ruler of Iraq as \"Saddam who was insane\" with a lilt in his voice that suggested he had just said something both potent and witty. And despite protests from both Letterman and the View interviewers, as Faulkner explained his mission from God he persisted in calling the inhabitants of the country he had just visited \"Pakis.\" It became clear that he was dancing to the beat of a very different drum and that, in his insistence on being honest to himself, he might say almost anything. This is one of the final questions he was asked when he was interviewed by his local TV station, on Denver's 9News, and his answer, in which one syllable of their question seems to trigger a quite unexpected series of revelations:\n\n\"You have been described as everything from a hero to a crackpot. What are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a little of everything. I've done crack, I've done crank, I've done coke, I've done pot, I've done everything in the world out there. You know, I've been to prison, I've been shipwrecked, blown up, shot, stabbed. My story does not just start here; it started when I was 5 years old, the first time I tried to hot-wire a car.\"\n\nThe day after he returns from New York, I meet Faulkner at his local dialysis center in Greeley, where he's happy to talk while connected to a machine for four hours, as he must be three times every week. But when he arrives, he is taken straight to the hospital, the North Colorado Medical Center, with a temperature of 104. It is there, the following afternoon, that we finally begin to talk. Faulkner has various monitors connected to him, and on his chest just below his right shoulder hangs the catheter that is permanently plumbed into his circulatory system. This catheter has become infected. Official diagnosis: bacteremia. Patient's own description: \"I'm feeling a little better, but I still feel very loopy. I'm jacked up. It's really getting me on the tizzy up and down and stuff. I've got so many toxins and poisons in my body, it's just like 'wow.' I've been having the shakes and the shivers. It's almost like convulsionsit's a pretty ugly sight. Hey, you know, the champ's down right now, but I'll be back up before the ten count.\"\n\nFaulkner discovered that his kidneys weren't working last year while he was hiking in the Rockies, checking out some new high-altitude gear he'd gotten for his next trip to Pakistan. People might rush to assume he is somehow paying a rough price for youthful recklessness. He himself says, \"I've tormented my body, I've been used and abused, but there's a saying that a very dear friend of mine has: We were not meant to go to the grave in a pristine, well-kept body but to come power-sliding in, totally spent, and say, 'Whoooooo! What a ride!' Well, I'm still on that ride.\" Even so, it is likely to have happened anyway. Polycystic kidney disease runs in the family; it's what caused Gary's father's fatal heart attack when he was 45.\n\nFaulkner has plenty of colorful stories about the mischief he would get up to in his youth. He talks about transporting coke, marijuana, and pills across the border from Mexico, partying while the drugs were loaded or unloaded from wherever they were hidden: \"It was just the excitement, the thrillI was an adrenaline junkie.\" He talks about a bank job. He has endless tales about driving too fast, and liberating vehicles that belonged to othersmost of his convictions involved this. (His longest stretch inside was for four years.) \"I boosted everything, it didn't matterdump truck, forklift, cars, boats, whatever.\" One time he nearly stole a helicopter. He thought better of it when he saw all the gears, but he was tempted. \"They should never have left the keys in there.\"\n\nIt's easy to romanticize this kind of thing, and Faulkner is not immune to that temptation. Part of his patter and self-justification is that it is his experiences in this part of his life that offer him a unique advantage in his missions. When you think like a thief, you are free of all those inflexible military rules and habits. The thief has a different style of approach: \"Like I say, it's easier for a mouse to get into a castle than a lion.\" And that is his goalto steal away with a person as his loot. \"I'm going in there as a thief, not as a military mind. I'm boosting this guy right out from underneath their noses.\"\n\nBut he can also be stern with himself and characterize those years as wasteful, repetitive, and ultimately fruitless.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he reflects, \"high-speed chases are fun, and breaking into a vault is fun, but everyone at some point pays the piper, and when it ends, it normally ends ugly.\" One day I'll overhear him talking to someone he has just met, explaining something of his life and reflecting on his newfound celebrity: \"People say, like, 'You're a wonderful guy.' They don't know the whole story. I was a piece of shit. I ruined people's lives, literally. But I'm honest about it.\"\n\nSeptember 11 took its time to fire Gary up. He remembers reading an article about bin Laden hiding out in the mountains of Pakistan, but he didn't even really know where that was. It was around 2004 that his mission came to him. \"He just had a dream about hunting down bin Laden,\" remembers Jim Sage, who has worked on construction jobs with Faulkner over the past decade. \"In his dream he was supposed to get there without his feet touching the ground.\" At first, Faulkner took this to mean that he had to go by boat. So he bought a twenty-one-foot yellow-and-white yacht called the Pia Colada. He'd never been in a boat before, other than on freshwater lakes and waterskiing, but a friend showed him how to put up the sail. Ignoring the Coast Guard's admonitions that his boat was illegal because he had no life jackets, no flares, and so on, he set sail from San Diego. He figured he'd head west across the Pacific and work it out from there. There is documentary evidence that supports much of what Faulkner says he did on future trips, but one wonders whether it can be true that he was really at sea for twenty-two days without any food to speak of before a hurricane threw his boat against a beach halfway down the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. Either way, it was his first failed attempt.\n\nThe next year, he bought another boat, which he was readying in his friend's driveway in Northern California when, in an accident involving the mast, he badly dislocated his shoulder. He decided that there had to be a better way. He sold the boat, bought a plane ticket, and within a week he was in Pakistan for the first time. It was the spring of 2005.\n\nHe had no idea about anything: \"I didn't know how hot it was. I didn't know anything about the people, the language. I didn't know diddly-squat.\" But he had faith that what he needed to know would be revealed to him. He traveled from Islamabad to Lahore to Sialkot, where he stayed on a military base and was finally directed to a town in a northern tribal area called Gilgit. There he began to explore the remote mountainous hinterland.\n\nIt is hard to know how to judge Faulkner's accounts of what he discovered on each Pakistan trip. My hunch is that everything that he says happenedin terms of his own experience and of where he went and what he diddid actually happen. What might be more questionable is the significance of what was happening to others he came across, and their relevance to his stated quest. On his first trip, for instance, he says that he found himself more or less running for his life coming down from the mountains and that he lost his pack and his money and his blade. That evening, at the Madina Hotel Guest House in Gilgit, where he was staying, he says that the military guard who was posted outside was shot dead through the head, and that he was told that this was done by the same peopleAl Qaeda, he assumedwho had been chasing him down from the mountains. He also says that he found something encouraging in this turn of events: \"I thought it was pretty cool, myself, because I shook the tree and at least I got a response.\"\n\nHe made four other similar visits before his most recent trip to Pakistan. (These were attempts numbers 4, 5, 9, and 10.) He describes them to me in some detail. Recently, he'd moved his attention to the mountains west and southwest of Chitral, toward the Afghan border. (When pressed on the reasons for such decisions, he generally alludes to an unspecified combination of inside information, local help, and divine guidance.) During the first of these Chitral trips, he believes he met a very high-ranking Al Qaeda official when he inadvertently shared a car with a man who had a particularly unwelcoming demeanor. That was also when Faulkner says he wandered for four days among Al Qaeda workers up near a cave mouth, in disguise and unidentified. \"There were a lot of people running around with axes and all kinds of stuff,\" he says, \"working on cutting down trees and making the new cave.\" On his second trip to Chitral, he says that he would sleep up there in the mountains on a bed of pine needles covered in a rug for days at a time. Watching that cave. Waiting for Binny Boy.\n\nI visit him again in the hospital the next morning. When I walk in he is lying on his back with his eyes closed, headphones on. He is listening to Nickelback on the pink iPod Shuffle he had with him in Pakistan. (Also on the playlist of the dedicated Osama-hunter: Bon Jovi, the Eagles, the Zac Brown Band, Creedence.) He says that there's another song he likes a lot, \"Voice of Truth,\" by the Christian rock group Casting Crowns, about having the faith to step out of a boat on top of the waves. \"It's not like I'm in it for the money,\" he says. \"I'm in it because of my faithand that's where he's at, too, so it's the two titans of their faith. He stood up on a world platform and made his announcement, I stood up on a world platform and made my announcement, and we're getting ready to go toe-to-toe.\"\n\nDo you think Osama is fundamentally evil?\n\n\"Absolutely, yeah. There's no doubt. His god is actually Satan. Mine's the Living God.\"\n\nDid God choose you for this?\n\n\"Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm always wondering: Why did you pick me instead of somebody else?\"\n\nAnd why do you think he did?\n\n\"Because I'm the only one crazy enough to do it.\"\n\nFaulkner is feeling better today, though he says, \"I can still smell the toxinsI've been sweating it out of my body.\" He rhapsodizes about the shower he had the previous night—his first since last December. \"I flooded that thing! I didn't care. It felt soooooo good.\"\n\nToday he'll be discharged. A nurse comes in and takes him through a medical summary prior to his release. \"Primary diagnosis: bacteremia, dialysis catheter-related. Secondary diagnosis: CRF, chronic renal failure. Or ESRD, end-stage renal disease\"\n\n\"Okay, cool,\" he says.\n\n\"PKD, polycystic kidney disease, hypertension anemia\"\n\nShe says that aside from dialysis, the recommendation is for \"normal activity.\" She pauses. \"Whatever normal is.\"\n\nBefore he leaves the hospital, he orders lunch and eats it in his beda cheeseburger with olives, mustard, and Thousand Island dressing, with some cottage cheese and fresh fruit on the side.\n\n\"I don't want French fries,\" he specifies, \"because of the potassium.\"\n\nHe talks about moving to a remote new home that has been found for him, and about his plans to get a wolf the following week. He says he'll train it by walking the property's perimeter over and over. He had a wolf once before, when he was married. She was called Jessie. She ran away while he was in prison.\n\nI travel around Colorado, crisscrossing the Rockies, visiting his friends. On the warm afternoon of July Fourth, in a trailer park in Orchard Mesa, on the south side of Grand Junction, an extended family are celebrating, among them Daren Paredes, his mother, Esther, and her brother Tony, all close friends of Gary's.\n\n\"Man, he has a spirit,\" says Daren. \"It's hard to be down around him.\" They reminisce about the firework fight they had on a previous July Fourth, and Tony points with pride to a scar on his torso from a firework of Gary's. He says Gary liked to come over to his house and watch shows like Survivorman. Tony gave him his pig sticker, the knife he was found with in Pakistan. (\"I got it at a pawnshop. It cost me like eight bucks. He liked it and I was, 'You know what—go get bin Laden.'\") Daren says they liked to go to the all-you-can-eat-buffalo-wings at the New Plantation Restaurant in Evans, and how sometimes they'd get through about six buckets—about sixty wings each.\n\nWhen the local newspaper in Grand Junction, The Daily Sentinel, compared Gary to Forrest Gump, Esther was so incensed she phoned them up: \"How dare you call my friend that? You guys don't know him.\"\n\nHer daughter Kaya wanders in.\n\n\"She's 10, she loves Gary,\" says Esther.\n\n\"She got mad seeing him on TV,\" says Daren.\n\n\"They're jerks and they're stupid,\" says Kaya. \"They were talking about Gary.\"\n\nI ask her what he's like.\n\n\"He's a nice guy. He's funny. He's cool.\"\n\nI meet two other friends, Jen Oliver and Peggy Gates, at Peggy's home in Golden. It was Jen he was staying with when he was diagnosed with kidney disease. Both of them have had Gary living with them while he worked on their houses. (It takes me a while to realize this, but for most of the last fifteen years before his diagnosis, Faulkner was technically homeless, living on the site of whatever job he was doing.) It was while watching Knife Show on TV with Jen and her husband that Gary spotted the $300 samurai sword.\n\nI ask what he's like as a houseguest.\n\n\"He's entertainment plus,\" says Jen.\n\n\"Sometimes you're just happy when he falls asleep,\" Peggy says, laughing.\n\nBoth would ferry him down the mountain to Denver early in the morning for dialysis. They say that he seemed fine about his kidney problems at first, but then it really hit himthe reality of a life like this with no home, no savings, and little more than $449-a-month disability with a few food stamps. They thought he wouldn't go back to Pakistan, but it was Peggy who ended up buying his $1,700 plane ticket, money she owed him for work on the house. \"I didn't think he would come back this time,\" says Jen. \"I thought it was death for sure. But he was totally prepared for death.\"\n\nSo far, three of Faulkner's eleven attempts—attempts numbers 6, 7, and 8—have not been mentioned. None of these involved a successful visit to Pakistan.\n\nAttempt number 8 faltered in the place that sometimes seems a rapacious machine invented purely to suck down well-intentioned plans: Las Vegas. Each time he wanted to fly to Pakistan, Faulkner had to first visit Los Angeles to apply for a visa. In January 2008, he decided to do the trip by road, accompanied by his friend Tony Montana and a man they knew as Pickles. They left on Friday, just after they'd been paid. On the way, they decided to stop off in Las Vegas. That was that. \"I still don't remember all of Vegas,\" Gary says. \"And I forgot the whole reason why I was going out that way anyway.\" No Los Angeles. No visa. Convinced that he would get in anyhow, he still made his scheduled flight to Pakistan.\n\nThere he was sternly informed that he should take the next plane home.\n\nAttempts numbers 6 and 7 were failures of a different kind. Faulkner's vision that his feet wouldn't touch the ground led him to the certainty that on his next expedition to Pakistan, he should approach bin Laden in a new way—by hang glider. He also decided that the perfect and proper place to try out such a hang glider would be Israel: \"I've got to test it somewhere, so in my mind: Well, if I go to Israelt—he Dead Sea! Hit the water, you float!\" He found a hang glider for $500, cut it up into six-foot pieces that would fit into a long ski bag, and crafted brackets to reassemble it using the copper tubes from a cabin he was renovating at the time. In Israel in September 2006, he put it back together and prepared to launch himself off a cliff by the Dead Sea. He had never flown a hang glider in his life. \"I just figured everything else I'd ever done in my life is: Jump on and go for the ride.\"\n\nThis ride was short. Three seconds later, he had several broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. \"Damn, I crashed hard,\" he says. \"I still feel that one.\"\n\nA sensible man might have decided to put hang gliding behind him. Faulkner asked a local hostel to store his flying machine until he could return.\n\nHe was back the following August. This time, he decided, he should take off much closer to the water. There was maybe twenty feet between him and the water when he launched himself. \"You think I could hit the water? Not on your life. I was dragged and smashed and beat down by the rocks. I ripped up my shins this time.\" He undid his harness, left the remains of his glider on the rocks, and hobbled to the road.\n\n\"I normally give stuff two tries,\" he explains. \"And if it doesn't work by the second time, I'm through.\"\n\nAs far as Faulkner is concerned, analyzing the tactical sense or practicality of his plans is, when it comes down to it, beside the point. He is on a mission from God. He follows his heart, not his mind: \"If you have the heart to go out and do something, you go do it. If you have a mind to go out and do something, you're going to be in trouble, because your mind is going to try and calculate and figure things out.\"\n\nAnd God has told him that he is the man to do this. \"I'm the one that the Lord put his finger on and said, 'You're it.' I accept thatI take that responsibility all the way to the grave with me if I have to. When you really look at this story, you stop and you think, Okay, here's this guy now, is he just crazy, is he a fool, or what's happening? People just still don't get the real gist of what's happening. God's making a statement. It isn't me. I'm just doing what I am programmed to do through my faith. Nothing is actually a thought process; it's emotion out of my heart. Because when I start thinking about stuff, I'll get confused. I don't have a clue. And I'll be the first to say it.\"\n\nHe knows some people think he has a death wish: \"I don't have a death wish. What I do have is a wish to be obedient and to do what I'm designed to do. Everybody's designed to do something. Other people are, 'Oh, I'd be scared to go there.' \" He grins. \"That's why you're not going there.\"\n\nThere is little reason for those who do not share Faulkner's faith to accept his interpretation of what has happened or what will happen. But if you suspect he is simply some kind of fantasist, I think you are wrong. Though he sometimes seems prone to elaboration, his specific accounts of events over a period of time are generally consistent down to small details. His passport confirms that he made these trips. And an unedited sampling of his recent e-mails shows that his current account of what he was up to matches what he wrote at the time.\n\n\"I'm a very bold person, and I can be a little obnoxious sometimes,\" he says, \"and I can be a little bit boastful sometimes, too, but I'm true to my faith, and I'm true to my God and my heart. I can't be anything else. If you don't want to hear the answer, don't ask. I'll try to be as nice and gentle as I can, but there's a point where, you know what? Parole's denied!\"\n\nOn this last trip, he flew into Islamabad carrying with him his new pig sticker, a few light clothes, some mountaineering pants meant to be worn over clothing to keep the wind off (he didn't use a tent), his King James Bible, a copy of Andrew Wommack's A Better Way to Pray, and the Liberty Dollar he has taken on all his travels for many years.\n\nIn Pakistan he was reunited with the rest of his equipment: the night-vision scope, a Night Hawk that he'd originally bought at Big 5 in Greeley; his samurai sword; his Smith Wesson handcuffs; and a .30-caliber Chinese pistol that carried eight rounds and had no safety. He'd picked up this gun on a previous visit. The first time he mentions it, he tells me that he bought it for about $100 \"in Chitral in the back alleys,\" but another time, when he is trying to impress on me that he has had more informal encouragement from the authorities than he is able to let on, he says, \"I mean, how do you think I got the gun? Yeah, we tell everybody it was the back alley and stuff, but a very special person delivered that gun to me as a matter of fact. Shit, this is a brand-new gun.\"\n\nHe checked into room 4 of the Ishpata Inn in the Bumboret Valley south of Chitral. He spent some of this first week making preparations, but when he finally tried to climb toward the cave where he believed bin Laden was now hiding, he found his strength lacking. He called Jen. \"He came down,\" she says, \"and he goes, 'Whoa, I can't do it. I tried to do it, I can't go up there, I'm real weak now.' \" He'd also come to realize that Pakistan wasn't without medical resources, so he asked her to research not just dialysis but also kidney transplants in the area. She e-mailed back to him a number of options; the closest dialysis center was the Rehman Medical Institute in Hayatabad, Peshawar, so he took an all-day bus ride there and got two hours of dialysis. On his return, after a day in which he says maybe seventy Al Qaeda members came down from the mountains to threaten the locals, he e-mailed her with a requested update on his physical, mental, and spiritual well-being:\n\nI'm physically ok, mentally demented, SPIRITUAL I'M ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!! I went to a al quida meeting today at the P.T.D.C. They told the elders that they now have the north hill side and every body is freaked out because they don't know what is going on next, Well I have to get ready to go.\n\nGary says he was told that Al Qaeda had not only noticed him but photographed him and was circulating his picture. After dark that night, believing they were soon coming to get him, he headed up the mountain. He heard barking he believes revealed Al Qaeda's movement through a nearby ravine. They were searching for him; the military police were searching, too. \"It's old-school for me, because I used to be a thief, so nighttime is my time. I laugh. Here I am in the middle, they've got a squeeze play going on, and once again I slipped away in the night.\" He laughs. \"I love it. I'm glad that I was a criminal.\"\n\nAt daybreak, what would be portrayed in press reports as his \"capture\" by the government took place, though he insists that he simply stepped out from where he had been hiding and flagged two policemen walking below. Faulkner is likewise convinced that he connived with the police to put on a show that he was being arrested so that no one who had helped him would be implicated. \"We came up with a plan,\" he insists. \"Everyone played it off cool. They did it by the book to make it look like an arrest—they had me blindfolded and a hood on, the whole works. But that was also at my request.\" When I suggest that some people may wonder, just because this was what Gary thought was going on here, whether it really was, he replies: \"What do I give a shit what anyone thinks? Hey, kiss my ass, I'm the one that was there.\" In support of his narrative, he points out that they didn't take his gun. As he sees it, the custody he was in until he left the country was part of the same continuing act of theater by authorities who tacitly endorsed and supported his actions and intentions. He points out that while he was in their care, they gave him Pizza Hut pizza.\n\nIf one were making a bad bio-pic, there are a few obvious moments of redemption and revelation one might choose to depict in the life of Gary Faulkner. The first came when he was 5. Faulkner maintains that he had the specific vision that set him upon this path before his sixth birthday. It would happen over and over. There were these monsters coming at him—well, what seemed like monsters to a 5-year-old, though he now recognizes them as men dressed as they are in the Himalayan foothills. He told his mother that these creatures were trying to kill him. One day the Faulkner family went to the carnival, and Gary got a balloon on a stick. When the balloon popped, leaving nothing but the stick, he says that his mother said to him: \"Here, this is your sword, and when they come at you again, you kill them.\" The next time they came at him, he wielded his sword, and he killed every single one of them; he says that his mother saw him do so and that she told him he had seemed like a real man with a real sword.\n\nHe believes that this is the dream he has been living out, and the search he has been on, ever since. In his vision, after the bad people had been conquered, he would find himself in a cave. \"Once I get to the cave,\" he explains, \"then the earthquake hits. That's how people will know that he's been captured around the world without hearing the report. I'm standing here in the cave watching it, and I'm seeing the dirt and the rocks and everything come crashing down. I never actually saw Binny Boy. He's in the cave, but he's trapped because it all caves in on him.\"\n\nThis is what you saw when you were 5?\n\n\"Yeah. Exactly, and I still feel it. You experience something and you know you were there, but this is so much far beyond that. It's like you read a book and then all of a sudden the movie comes outnow you see all the color and the peoples and everything else. I know it sounds strange.\"\n\nSo you're just making the movie of a book you've already read?\n\n\"Right. See, I already know how it ends, because I've read the book. I know the ending of this. And that's why I'm so positive and how I'm so determined and without that fear. It's incredible.\"\n\nSo, specifically, do you really believe that's how it will endthat you won't lead him out. You'll just be there and then the cave will collapse?\n\n\"Yeah. Then the people will come up and dig him out. It's already been prepared. Everything is set and ready to go. I just got to get there. They know the signal, they know what to look for. And then they'll drag him down.\"\n\nHe won't be killed by the collapsing cave?\n\n\"No, he's just going to be trapped in there. He's going to be trapped in there because he can't die in battle.\"\n\nI do try to discuss it with his mother, this vision her eldest son says he had when he was 5.\n\nShe shrugs.\n\n\"He never mentioned it,\" she says.\n\nSo I ask her whether there was any clear ambition or calling that Gary seemed to have when he was a young child. She allows that there was:\n\n\"He wanted to be a fireman.\"\n\nWe had made plans to meet up again in Colorado, but instead Faulkner heads east in his brother Scott's truck to help his niece Nikki, who is moving to Massachusetts. I catch up with him in a motel there, fresh out of the bath. He sits talking to me in nothing but a towel, his twin green and blue catheter nozzles hanging down his chest. He tells me that he has hurt his right foot on a curb, though tomorrow he will change his mind and diagnose it as gout caused by the pizza he ordered with everything on it. On the bedside table is a prescription bottle. He says someonethe maid, he suspectshas helped themselves to his medical marijuana. (\"I'm a sativa guy, not an indica guy,\" he tells me; when he was searched at the end of his recent Pakistan adventure, aside from his weapons, they found a small amount of hash.) Gary's unlicensed Glock .40 and his hollow-point bullets are in his day bag. (There is a fairly long list of rules Gary eschews. Seat belts, for instance. Also taxes.)\n\nThe next morning, at the hotel's buffet breakfast, we pore over a map of Pakistan on my computer as he talks me through his travels. When he describes his most recent trip, we close in on Bumboret. He points to a valley that heads west-northwest from there toward the Afghan border, and then an area reached by climbing over the range to your left after you have headed far up that valley. \"Homeboy's right here,\" he says.\n\nAfter he has dialysis at a West Springfield center, we head south in Scott's truck, stopping when he needs something to drink because his hand is cramping badly from the lack of fluid. Wherever we eat, he flirts shamelessly with the waitress. \"I'm a dogat least I'm honest about it,\" he'll repeat at such times. He has told me that he doesn't particularly care for the media nickname that seems to have stuck the most, Rocky Mountain Rambo, but I'm not so sure. When I see him write down his name for strangers, he'll write \"Rocky Mountain Rambo\" beneath it, and when there's a problem finding a New York hotel reservation, he wonders aloud whether he might have been booked under the name Rocky Mountain Rambo.\n\nOn the road, having to raise even his unbridled voice over the thumping of the rain on the truck, he suddenly starts to tell me about the whippings his father used to give him. When it comes to the moment in the story when he finally stands up to his father, he still gets belted one more time, but then tells his father, \"If you ever touch me again, I'm going to cut your throat in your sleep,\" and says how much better their relationship was from that day on. He follows this with the strange statement: \"I think he actually wanted to create me like this.\" Gary says that that day, the day he stood up to his father, was the day he decided something. \"I'm not going to put up with anybody's bullshit,\" he says. \"And from that day on, I was hell on wheels. And I was purposely looking for this moment, but I was also looking for what would make me afraid. Still haven't found it. That's why I'm able to go and do what I do. No fear.\"\n\nThese are not necessarily the words you want to hear from a man behind the wheel of a truck on a freeway on a rainy night with an unlicensed gun in a bag beside him who has just had a rum and Coke at the Olive Garden, but I think they nonetheless explain something about such a man.\n\nAll the time Faulkner returns to the same theme. \"I can't wait to get back and finish the mission,\" he says. \"I'm tired, but I have one more rodeo to go.\" He constantly talks about the money he needs to buy equipment for his return to Pakistan. \"People don't realize this isn't overI've still got to finish this,\" he says. \"If I gotta go boost a bank, I'm going after this guy. There is nothing that's going to stop my ass from getting this dude.\"\n\nTwo sensible ways of judging the sincerity of someone's beliefs are by how consistently they are held over a long period of time and by what someone is prepared to sacrifice for them. By these standards, Faulkner scores well.\n\nOn other counts? If I wanted to play up Gary Faulkner's heroism, I would point out that his claim that he's betting his life on what he believes in is quite probably true. If I wanted to make him seem unlikable, perhaps I would detail some of his less anchored rants, full of anger and misogyny (for instance, his account of his murderous state of mind during a bitter dispute with his sister: \"As God is my witness, I wanted to break that bitch's neck. If I'd have got hold of her neck, I had a place where I was going to put the body\"). If I wanted to bolster his credibility, I would quote from the New York Times blog that cited Pentagon sources and suggested that Faulkner may very well turn out to be looking in the right place.\n\nAnd if I wanted to convince most people that he was crazy beyond belief, then perhaps all I would have to do is betray what he considers sensitive operational secrets about his forthcoming twelfth and final attempt, a plan that makes hang gliding your way into the Pakistani tribal areas seem both practical and foolproof by comparison. I would also explain how he has a fixed date by which this must be achieved before Al Qaeda detonates a small nuclear device at Mecca and unleashes a global holy war of unimaginable proportions upon us all. And then perhaps I might mention how, after the successful resolution of his mission, he believes that he will become king of a Central American nation.\n\nBut there is little point. For him, ultimately this is not about strategy or sanity or feasibility or probability. It is about faith, and faith cannot be fought by argument, and when faced with doubt and scorn it often thrives. Its only repudiation is disbelief. And whatever you choose to believe or disbelieve, Gary Faulkner intends to continue as he has.\n\n\"The thing I'm about to do is the least likely,\" he says. \"The most improbably unlikely, outrageous, crazier-than-hell idea is the one that will get my mission accomplished. And that is sweet. I giggle to myself.\"\n\nGary Faulkner believes that by the time this article is published, he will be triumphantly completing his mission in the rubble of a cave in northwest Pakistan.\n\nIf he fails, it will be one more victory for rationality; one more victory for everyone who likes to see the world carry on spinning evenly and predictably; one more victory for common sense. It will be one more sad victory for all of us who never really tried.",
  "latent_23788": "U.S. and Iraqi security forces were focused on Mosul in Iraq's northwest, leaving the starving residents of ISIS-held Fallujah a half-hour's drive from Baghdad to wait indefinitely for liberation, according to Obama administration and U.S. military officials.\n\nIn a recent briefing to the Pentagon from Baghdad, Army Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said the 217 additional U.S. advisers and eight AH-64 Apache attack helicopters recently authorized by President Barack Obama for the ISIS campaign would be \"tied to the fight for Mosul,\" although there was no timetable for the offensive.\n\nVolesky, commander of the U.S. Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command in Iraq, made no mention of Fallujah but said that the Iraqis backed by U.S. airstrikes and artillery had advanced to the town of Qayyarah about 20 miles southeast of Mosul. He said that was \"the farthest north that Iraqi security forces have been since the fall of Mosul\" in June 2014.\n\nVolesky made no mention of Fallujah, which was the scene of fierce street fighting by U.S. Marines in 2004 in which an estimated 95 U.S. troops were killed and another 560 were wounded. The mainly Sunni city, where snipers affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, now prevent residents from fleeing, has been under the control of the extremist group since May 2014.\n\n\"We know that the Iraqis have attempted on several occasions to open up humanitarian corridors to allow some of those civilians to come out\" of Fallujah, Army Col. Steve Warren said last Friday in a video briefing from Baghdad to the Pentagon.\n\n\"Those have met with generally not much success,\" he said. \"ISIL has done things like set up snipers to cover down on those corridors, to kill people as they're trying to get out. So that has really discouraged their use,\" he said, using another acronym for ISIS.\n\nUnited Nations officials in Iraq have reported on a growing humanitarian crisis in Fallujah, with residents cut off from access to food and medicine.\n\n\"The UN reporting that I've seen certainly indicates that there are growing problems, that food is becoming scarce and that, you know, people who want to leave can't,\" said Warren, the spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve. \"It's a legitimate humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nWarren said Iraqi forces have been working to seal off the city but has run up against ISIS resistance. He said an effort last week by the Iraqis to move closer to the city gained only 340 meters.\n\n\"This is a tough city,\" he said. This is a tough nut to crack.\"\n\nUnder questioning from the Daily Beast's Nancy Youseff on why Mosul had preference over Fallujah in the strategy, Warren said, \"I am confident that the Iraqis are aware that they need to liberate Fallujah. Where it falls into the sequence -- Fallujah before Mosul, Fallujah after Mosul -- is unclear.\n\n\"From a military perspective, Fallujah doesn't have much impact on Mosul. So, you know, you don't need to liberate Fallujah in order to get to Mosul,\" he said. \"Fallujah doesn't really have any tactical influence on Mosul. So then it becomes a political decision, right? This becomes a decision that, you know, is made at the political level. There is no military reason to liberate Fallujah now, to answer your question.\"\n\nThe politics of the Shia-dominated Baghdad government also appeared to work against focusing on Sunni Fallujah, despite concerns in the capital that the recent spate of suicide bombings in Baghdad was coming from Fallujah.\n\nIn a national address Saturday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that a \"climate of dispute\" in his government had given ISIS the space to operate and send truck bombs into Baghdad. \"The political conflict among politicians and their impact on the brave security forces permits acts of terrorism to occur,\" he said.\n\nDespite the political turmoil in Baghdad, Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's special envoy to the coalition against ISIS, told a news conference in Jordan on Sunday that the push on Mosul was progressing as an increasingly hard-pressed ISIS lacked the funding to attract more foreign fighters.\n\n\"We are doing precision strikes in Mosul almost every day,\" McGurk said, noting that the U.S. was also countering ISIS on social media. \"For every pro-Daesh Twitter handle, there are now six calling out its lies and countering its message,\" he said.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter has also left Fallujah out of the overall strategy against ISIS that he has said repeatedly now has two main goals -- retaking Mosul and Raqqa, the self-proclaimed ISIS capital in northeastern Syria.\n\nAfter meetings with Abadi in Baghdad last month, Carter said the additional 217 U.S. troops and the Apaches would \"enable the Iraqi security forces, and not try to substitute for them\" in the Mosul offensive.\n\nApaches have been in Iraq since ISIS invaded in 2014, but Abadi denied permission for the U.S. to use them in assisting Iraqi forces in retaking Ramadi earlier this year.\n\nCarter said that Abadi had now agreed to having the Apaches support a drive on Mosul, since the attack helicopters \"can respond so quickly and so dynamically to an evolving tactical situation.\"\n\nIn his briefing last Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Volesky, who also commands the 101st Airborne Division, was reluctant to respond to questions on whether the Apaches had already been used in combat. He couched his response in double negatives: \"I didn't say we hadn't used Apaches, and I won't say when or if we have.\"\n\nWarren said later that the Apaches had yet to be used in an offensive operation and had been limited to flying security for VIP visits.\n\n-- Richard Sisk can be reached at Richard.Sisk@Military.com.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nOn Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump will sit down with one of his harshest critics and get his insight on the presidency.\n\nTrump's transition team announced Friday that the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate will meet with Trump in Bedminster, N.J., Saturday. Trump will be at his golf course throughout the weekend, conducting meetings.\n\nWhat exactly does this meeting mean?\n\n\"I think what that meeting suggests, and the meetings you’ve seen over past couple of days, is the president-elect wants the best and brightest people to put this country forward: people who supported him, people who didn’t support him,\"Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the presidential transition told reporters Friday. Spicer said that most conversations start out with Trump soliciting opinions and thoughts, and as the conversation progresses he may or may not consider them for a post. The \"conversation with Mitt Romney is just that: an opportunity to hear his ideas and his thoughts.\"\n\nRomney and Trump have had a contentious relationship with Trump calling him \"a choker\" for losing the 2012 election, and Romney frequently blasting Trump as a \"fraud.\"\n\n\"His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,\" Romney said in March.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g5xdZ7",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAug. 7, 2017, 2:10 PM GMT / Updated Aug. 7, 2017, 2:10 PM GMT By Herb Weisbaum\n\nDespite what you might think, it isn’t easy to spot a counterfeit check. Fraudsters know how to make a fake check look completely legitimate — so good that even a bank teller can’t spot it.\n\nThat’s why fraudsters are using fake checks to commit all sorts of scams, including phony prize awards, fake job offers, mystery shopper scams, and bogus online classified ad sales.\n\n“This scam comes in many different variations” said John Breyault, who runs the National Consumers League’s Fraud.org website. “But the key thing that binds them all together is the use of a fake check. The consumer is instructed to deposit that check into their personal account and then send a portion of the proceeds to someone right away.”\n\nA closeup of a checkbook. Michael Shake / Featureepics.com\n\nMost victims are instructed to send the money via a wire transfer service, such as Western Union or MoneyGram. But some are told to buy prepaid debit cards or iTunes gift cards that they can use to buy things.\n\nWhen the bank discovers the check is counterfeit — which could be days or weeks later — that deposit is removed from the victim’s checking account. The crooks already have their money and the poor consumer is left holding the bag.\n\nEarlier this year, the Better Business Bureau released a list of the Top 10 Most Risky Scams based on an analysis of complaints collected through its online Scam Tracker. Fake check scams came in at number two, just behind home improvement scams. That ranking is based on how many people are targeted by the scam, how likely they are to fall for it and how much money the average victim loses.\n\nThe typical loss to a scam is about $275 — but with fake check scams, it's almost $1,500.\n\n“This is definitely a very, very serious concern right now,” said Emma Fletcher, director of scam and fraud initiatives at the BBB Institute for Marketplace Trust. “The typical loss to a scam that’s reported to us is about $275, but with fake check scams the median loss is almost $1,500. That’s a lot of money.”\n\nWhile anyone can fall for a fake check scam, the BBB’s analysis shows that men between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most susceptible. This is also the top scam for students, and military families and veterans.\n\nThese Crooks Are Clever\n\nFake checks are commonly used to steal money from people who want to become mystery shoppers. Kathy, who lives in Dallas, Texas, got taken for $2,650 this way. She asked that we not use her last name.\n\n“What these crooks are doing is disgusting, absolutely disgusting,” Kathy told NBC News. “They’re really clever and they need to be brought to justice.”\n\nKathy had done mystery shopping before, so she wasn’t surprised to get an email from a mystery shopping company asking her to do some work for them.\n\n“The email seemed totally legit and everything on the website seemed on the up and up, so I didn’t question it. There were no warning signs,” she said.\n\nKathy’s first assignment as a “survey agent” was to rate money transfer companies. The mystery shopper scammers sent her a check for $2,850 and emailed her a list of questions to fill out about her experiences.\n\n“It was a cashier’s check and it looked totally legit,” she said.\n\nKathy was told to deposit the check, take the cash and go to three different money transfer services and wire $900 from each. That left her with $100 for doing the job. She did as instructed.\n\nAbout a week later, Kathy got a letter from her bank. It said the $2,850 check was counterfeit and couldn’t be cashed, so the money she had withdrawn would be debited from her checking account.\n\n“The bank should have been able to determine immediately whether the check was legit or not and they didn’t. And that really disturbed me,” she said.\n\nKathy realizes she’ll never get that money back, but she hopes that by sharing her experience she can prevent others from becoming victims.\n\nWhy Fake Check Scams Work So Well\n\nFew of us understand how the banking system works and the scammers use that confusion to trick us.\n\nWhen we deposit a check, the financial institution is required by federal law to make the money available to us long before it can be certain the check is legitimate. We see the money show up in our account and assume the check is good and has cleared.\n\nFake check scam victims frequently report that their financial institutions decline to help them.\n\nBut that’s not what really happens. It may take a couple of days or a week or more for the check to work its way through the banking system and actually clear. During that time period, the bank gives us a short-term, no-interest loan using that check as collateral. If the check bounces, we have to pay back that loan in full.\n\n“Unfortunately, you don’t realize you’ve been defrauded until you find that your bank account has a big negative balance,” said Fraud.org’s John Breyault. “And because of how our banking laws are written, it’s the consumer who’s on the hook for that — not the scammer and not the bank. It’s not like a fraudulent transaction on a credit card that you can dispute. It doesn’t work that way with personal checks.”\n\nVictims Say the Bank Wouldn’t Help Them\n\nPeople who’ve lost money to fake check fraudsters frequently complain that their bank teller did not warn them about the scam and their financial institution would not help them when the check turned out to be bogus.\n\nErika, a single mom in Oklahoma City who preferred not to be identified by her last name, was excited to be offered a work-at-home job this past spring. Her new employer sent her a check for $1,000 to buy office supplies and cover her first paycheck.\n\nErika was told to cash the check at her bank, take $979 to another bank in town and deposit it into the account of a corporate vendor who would ship the supplies she needed to get started.\n\nA few days after she did that, Erika got a call from her bank. The check was a fake and there would be a $979 debit to her account. Not only that, but the debit caused her account to be overdrawn, which meant in addition to the $979 stolen by the scammers, she now owed the bank overdraft fees.\n\n“I’m looking for a job, so I can provide for my three year old son, and instead I get fleeced,” she said.\n\nErika told NBC News she asked the bank if they could help her with this, but she was told there was nothing they could do. That’s not uncommon. Fake check scam victims frequently report that their financial institutions decline to help them.\n\nThe nation’s bankers insist they take fake check fraud very seriously and are doing a better job of spotting it and stopping it. For example, the American Bankers Association said tellers are trained to say something and ask questions when they see a transaction that appears to be suspicious.\n\n“These losses are not something that bankers ever want to see,” said Doug Johnson, ABA’s senior vice president of payments and cyber security. “We continually educate our customers about the frauds being perpetrated against them, but we can’t stop every crime.”\n\nThat’s why it’s up to you to protect yourself and understand how scammers use fake checks to steal your money.\n\nThe BBB’s Emma Fletcher told NBC News she cannot think of any legitimate business transaction where someone would send you a check, ask you to deposit it and wire back the money.\n\n“Any time you're asked to do something like that, an alarm should go off that this is a scam,” she said.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has information on Fake Check Scams and the Better Business Bureau provides 10 Steps to Avoid Scams.\n\nHerb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan.

  "latent_24472": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is to hold a series of high-profile meetings with Turkish, British and Saudi leaders, among others, as part of his schedule for attending a summit in China in early September.\n\nYury Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, told reporters on Tuesday that Putin will hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on September 3, when he is in Hangzhou, China, for the summit of the group of 20 world major economies, known as G20.\n\nUshakov said Putin’s meeting with Erdogan will take place as the “process of normalization of relations between the two countries is under way.”\n\nRussia downgraded ties with Turkey last November, when Ankara shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border. Relations began to improve in July after Ankara offered an apology as demanded by Putin. The two met this month in Russia, with reports suggesting they narrowed gaps on the conflict in Syria.\n\nUshakov said Putin will also hold a meeting with Saudi Arabia's powerful deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to discuss the crisis in Syria. He would not elaborate but said the meeting will come on September 4, the day when the Russian president will also hold an important meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss a need for “a new impetus in bilateral relations.”\n\nThe official said a trilateral meeting of leaders from Russia, Germany and France, which had previously been agreed to discuss the conflict in Ukraine, was called off and instead Putin would meet separately with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 4 and 5, respectively. He noted that the sensitive meeting on Ukraine was cancelled because of new tensions that have emerged over Crimea, a former Ukrainian territory which rejoined Russia following a referendum in 2015.\n\nPutin will also hold a much-anticipated meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who will be in China as a guest to G20, Ushakov said.",

  "latent_24807": "Dr. Kent Brantly was drawn to Africa with Samaritan’s Purse, to help the people of Liberia live longer, healthier lives. During his time there, the unimaginable happened, there was an outbreak of Ebola, and he contracted the virus while treating patients with this incurable disease.\n\nFortunately, Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol (an American aid worker) were given the experimental drug ZMapp and quickly evacuated to the U.S. for further treatment.\n\nThe best news possible was announced this week; they have been released from the hospital. In a televised news conference, Dr. Kent Brantly was all smiles, and grateful for the treatment and kindness he has received. So, what is Ebola and what should you know about this deadly virus?\n\n1. The Ebola Virus Or Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever\n\nThe rare, but deadly virus Ebola has been in the headlines for months, but few in the U.S. actually understand what it is, and how it is transmitted. This virus causes both internal and external bleeding while damaging the immune system and vital organs.\n\nSign up for the DailyHealthPost newsletter.\n\nAll the doable stuff to live better naturally, sent to your inbox daily.🍎 SIGN UP\n\n× Enter your email below to sign up. We hate SPAM and will NEVER violate your privacy.\n\nThe internal storm caused by this virus results in blood not clotting leaving victims to bleed to death. Currently, it is believed that the Ebola virus is fatal in up to 90% of infected individuals. That is why the recent news about the recovery of Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol is such welcomed news.\n\n2. How Ebola Virus Spreads\n\nWhile Ebola is a virus, like the common cold, the measles, or the flu, fortunately it doesn’t spread as easily or quickly as these everyday maladies. Researchers believe that Ebola spreads through the direct contact with bodily fluids and waste from both humans and infected animals.\n\nIn Africa, monkeys, chimps, bats, and other animals carry Ebola, and their spit, feces and other fluids are believed to spread to humans. While some viruses have a fairly short life outside their host, it is believed that Ebola can survive quite some time. This virus can be spread through casual contact with tables, beds, floors, lamps, door handles, and more.\n\nThe Ebola virus is not airborne, cannot be spread throughout the water supply, or in properly handled and cooked foods.\n\n3. Signs & Symptoms\n\nPart of the problem with Ebola, is that it presents like so many other diseases and infections. The first signs are much like the flu – high fever, headaches, achy joints and muscles, weakness, lethargy and lack of appetite.\n\nHowever, as Ebola progresses, individuals start to bleed internally and externally. Common areas of bleeding are gums, nose, eyes, ears, and around fingernails or toenails, while internally, tissues are bleeding as well.\n\n4. Travel Precautions\n\nIf you travel for business, and it takes you to Europe, Africa or beyond, it is important to understand that not all countries and cultures practice the same level of hygiene that we do in the western part of the world. It is important to be mindful of your surroundings, and of the people you come into contact with.\n\nDrink water only from sealed bottles; avoid raw fruits and vegetables; clean your hands thoroughly with disinfectants, and avoid touching your face or mouth whenever possible. If you are planning a trip soon, please review the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s article “Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever – prevention” for more information on how to protect yourself, and your family.\n\nUntil individuals are symptomatic, they are not spreading the disease. The incubation period can be anywhere from 2 days to over a month.\n\nOf course, the best news of all is that the two Americans that have been treated with ZMapp and tender care, are, by all accounts, cured of the Ebola virus.\n\nSign up for the DailyHealthPost newsletter.\n\nAll the doable stuff to live better naturally, sent to your inbox daily.🍎 SIGN UP",

However, San Jose States’ extra point attempt was blocked, so BYU led 7-6.\n\nBut the Spartans would put take the lead for good when they scored on their next two drives. Fales threw touchdown passes to Chandler Jones late in the first quarter, then found Grigsby again early in the second.\n\nThe Spartan defense would hold the score 20-7 in their favor for what seemed like an eternity, until BYU struck on a Riley Nelson 20-yard strike to David Foote to draw the Cougars within a touchdown of taking the lead. Nelson somehow escaped from a near sack, then scrambled find Foote for a miraculous score.\n\nIt then became nerve-wracking for the Spartans and their fans, as BYU recovered an onside kick, and had the ball at their own 47-yard line with under three minutes to play.\n\nOn fourth-and-8, Nelson found Cody Hoffman for a first down at the Spartans’ 35-yard line. The Cougars worked their way down to the 21-yard line before linebacker Kevin Smith saved the day.\n\nSmith sacked Nelson from the blindside, as Nelson never saw him coming as he dropped back to pass. Even better, Nelson coughed up the football which rolled away and was recovered by Vince Buhagiar, sealing the victory for the Spartans.\n\nSpartans’ quarterback David Fales set a couple of school records tonight, as the San Jose Mercury News describes:\n\nFales broke his tie with Steve Clarkson for the school’s passing touchdown record on the opening possession.

  "latent_24867": "DAEJEON (Yonhap) — South Korean scientists said Tuesday four meteorites discovered in the southern part of the country earlier this year are estimated to be as old as the solar system.\n\nIn early March, residents in Jinju, a city some 434 kilometers south of Seoul, found the space rocks that weighed 34 kilograms in total, a rare discovery in the country. Some 312 grams were donated by the owners for analysis.\n\nAnnouncing the results of its months-long analysis, the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) said the rocks appear to be between 4.48 billion to 4.59 billion years old, or about the age of our solar system at 4.56 billion years.\n\nIt suggests that the rocks are most definitely from space, marking the first meteorites owned by South Koreans.\n\nThe analysis was done using a device called a secondary ion mass spectrometer, which analyzes the abundance of different minerals in a sample, the KBSI said.\n\nThe spectrometer bombards the sample with an ion beam to eject “secondary ions,” which are in turn sorted out by mass and energy. A detector in the machine will then count how many ions there are for each kind.\n\nSpectrometers are commonly used to analyze meteorites because they cause minimal damage to what are often precious samples.\n\nPlugging the numbers into a uranium-lead dating equation will give the age of the sample, according to the think tank.\n\nKBSI scientists said they plan to report the results to an international conference due to be held in Daejeon from Thursday to Friday.\n\nThe third International Conference on Analytical Science and Technology is expected to attract more than 250 scientists from the United States, Japan, Australia and Britain, among other countries.",

I did not. Those measures have been in place since 2008/09.\n\n\"The Home Secretary also implies that I relaxed the controls in favour of queue management. I did not. Despite pressure to reduce queues, including from ministers, I can never be accused of compromising security for convenience.\n\n\"This summer saw queues of over three hours (non EU) on a regular basis at Heathrow and I never once contemplated cutting our essential controls to ease the flow.\n\n\"On the trials, I have pressed since December 2010 to progress these and I was pleased when the Home Secretary agreed to the pilot arrangements.\n\n\"The evidence to support them is substantial and the early findings are encouraging.\n\n\"I would do nothing to jeopardise them and I firmly believe that a more fully risk-based way of operating will offer far greater protection to the United Kingdom.\"\n\nHe went on: \"I deeply regret having to make this statement.

  "latent_24911": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Under pressure from U.S. legislators, Apple Inc moved Wednesday to quell a swelling privacy controversy by saying that it will begin to require iPhone and iPad apps to seek “explicit approval” in separate user prompts before accessing users’ address book data.\n\nApple’s move came shortly after two members of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee requested the company to provide more information about its privacy policies. Bloggers, in recent days, have published findings that some of the most popular software applications in Apple’s App Store have been able to lift private address book data without user consent.\n\n“Apps that collect or transmit a user’s contact data without their prior permission are in violation of our guidelines,” an Apple spokesman told Reuters. “We’re working to make this even better for our customers, and as we have done with location services, any app wishing to access contact data will require explicit user approval in a future software release.”\n\nIn a letter addressed to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Representatives Henry Waxman of California and G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, both Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked Apple earlier on Wednesday to clarify its developer guidelines and the measures taken by the company to screen apps sold on its App Store.\n\nThe letter came after Path, a San Francisco startup that makes a Facebook-like social networking app, attracted widespread criticism last week after a Singaporean developer discovered that Path’s iPhone app had been quietly uploading his contacts’ names and phone numbers onto Path’s servers.\n\nIn the following days, other technology bloggers discovered that iPhone apps like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and Foodspotting similarly uploaded user data — without permission, in some cases.\n\nThe Path incident “raises questions about whether Apple’s iOS app developer policies and practices may fall short when it comes to protecting the information of iPhone users and their contacts,” the letter said.\n\nThe legislators’ request for information cast the spotlight squarely onto Apple for the first time since an independent blogger, Dustin Curtis, wrote in a widely distributed post last week that “there’s a quiet understanding among many iOS app developers that it is acceptable to send a user’s entire address book, without their permission to remote servers and then store it for future reference.”\n\nCurtis blamed Apple, writing that he could not “think of a rational reason for why Apple has not placed any protections on Address Book in iOS.”\n\nIn their letter to Apple, Waxman and Butterfield, referenced Curtis’ blog post, adding: “There could be some truth to these claims.”\n\nThe legislators had asked Apple to submit its response by February 29.",

  "latent_25070": "One of the world’s most prestigious mathematics journals has issued what appears to be its first retraction.\n\nThe Annals of Mathematics recently withdrew a 2001 paper exploring the properties of certain symmetrical spaces.\n\nWhat prompted this retraction? And why did it occur 16 years after the paper was published?\n\nThe retraction notice for “Invariant differential operators and eigenspace representations on an affine symmetric space” says only that the paper has been “withdrawn.” A spokesperson for the Annals of Mathematics explained:\n\nThe paper was retracted because the proofs in the paper were found to be incomplete.\n\nThe paper’s author, Jing-Song Huang, agreed that there were errors in two proofs, but he told us he is confused about why the paper was withdrawn because he had sent the editors corrections to both, which he thinks should have solved the problem.\n\nHuang, chair in the Department of Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, explained that a few years after the paper was published, some mathematicians found a gap in one proof when they were trying to use the techniques.\n\nHuang told Retraction Watch that he wrote to the editors of the journal in June 2008 about the gap in the proof and sent them a one-page erratum to correct it:\n\nI received feedback from the referees on the first correction and improved the manuscript. It was expanded to two pages with more details for the sake of readers.\n\nBut one of the referees found a new issue, an error in an argument called a lemma. Huang said:\n\nI replaced that lemma with a new argument. That was most recent version of four pages that I sent to the Annals in August of 2015.\n\nHuang said the journal responded in August 2015 to acknowledge receiving the erratum.\n\nBut Huang heard nothing from the journal for over a year, which Huang noted was not unusual given how technical papers in the journal can be:\n\n[T]he expert circle is very, very small…\n\nWhen the first issue was identified, it even took Huang\n\na lot of time to understand what went wrong, since it is very technical issue.\n\nIn February 2017, Huang emailed the journal to ask about the status of the erratum. The journal responded, informing Huang that they intended to withdraw the paper.\n\nHuang emailed the journal to say that he was “really shocked” by the decision. He had been waiting for input about his erratum from the journal, which he said he never received, so he did not understand why the paper was being withdrawn, instead of corrected. Huang said:\n\nI asked several times for the referee reports.\n\nHe began working on the concepts in 1989, when he was a graduate student at MIT. He published a paper in 1996 in the American Journal of Mathematics with two colleagues on a related topic, and expanded on it his 2001 paper in Annals of Mathematics. Huang told us:\n\nIt took me many years to develop these ideas.\n\nThe paper has not yet been cited, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. Here’s the retraction notice:\n\nThe paper “Invariant differential operators and eigenspace representations on an affine symmetric space,” which was published in Vol. 154, pages 703–707 of the Annals https://doi.org/10.2307/3062145, is hereby withdrawn\n\nNow that the paper has been withdrawn, Huang plans to post his correction in arXiv.\n\nHat tip: Miguel\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

  "latent_25216": "Editor’s note: One of our readers asked about how to find a good couple therapist/counselor, so we contacted our colleague Dr. David A. Sbarra. In Part 1 of this article he discussed the process of choosing a therapist.\n\nYou’ve found someone (a therapist) who might be good, but what treatments will they provide? There are many different forms of couple treatment, but only a handful have good scientific support. In my opinion, you want a therapist who is up-to-date on the best scientific treatments available to you. Here’s a brief description of three basic forms of therapy:\n\nBehavioral (or cognitive-behavioral) couple therapy (BCT). This treatment is based on the idea that couples with relationship problems have developed behavioral patterns that erode relationship quality. The essential elements of treatment are altering interaction patterns through, for example, things like how to communicate in less destructive ways, how to interrupt and alter negative thoughts about a partner, or how to express and experience emotion in a more positive way.\n\nIntegrative behavioral couples therapy (IBCT). IBCT is a direct extension of BCT and focuses on teaching couples ways to manage and accept irreconcilable differences in their relationship. IBCT provides couples skills for decreasing dysfunctional relationship patterns, and it also focuses teaching couples to accept and better understand their partner’s actions. For instance, when a husband learns to be accepting of his wife’s lack of affection in certain situations, he may no longer react with negativity or withdrawal, which, in turn, results in a positive (rather than vitriolic) outcome. I note that some therapists may simply say they are “integrative” when describing their practice; this does not mean they practice IBCT per se, and you should ask directly: “What do you mean by integrative?” IBCT is the most well-established form of integrative couple treatment, and simply drawing from multiple, unsupported treatments in an “integrative way” is not necessarily meaningful. It’s equivalent to saying, “I have no real theory of what’s wrong with couples, so I pull from everything and hope something will work.”\n\nEmotionally focused couple therapy (EFT). EFT is fairly different from the two therapies I described above. As its core, EFT is based on the idea that distressed couples have developed a problem using each other for emotional support (technically, EFT says that distressed couples “fail to use each other as a secure base”), and the treatment is based on teaching couples to identify with and connect to each other’s emotional needs. An EFT therapist does this work by helping couples explain their emotional needs to each other and to respond in new ways that deepen their emotional connect. In this way, EFT is not focused on, say, communication skills directly but is pluralistic and uses many approaches to teach couples how to deepen their emotional connections to each other, as well as how to recognize and validate their partner’s emotional/attachment needs.\n\nThese three treatments constitute some of the main “empirically supported” therapies for couples. When you speak with a potential therapist, you should ask him/her directly about what types of interventions he/she uses. If you’re going to spend months working with a therapist, you want to know, to the best of your ability, if they are going to deliver a treatment that is known to work well for couples. Don’t be afraid to ask what treatment your therapist will provide when he/she works with you.\n\nWhere to go from here? You feel like you have decent answers to the questions above and that your therapist is well-versed in one of the treatments I’ve mentioned. What’s next? My suggestion is for you to think about the first few sessions as an evaluation of sorts. To be sure, you should invest as much energy as you can in the treatment and your therapist’s recommendations, but you also want to ask yourself if this therapist, in practice, is the best match for you and for what you think your relationship needs. These are general issues about fit, but you can consider the following questions:\n\nDoes my therapist understand my perspective on our relationship problems? Do I feel connected and as if I have a good alliance with this person? Does my therapist seem to take sides, perhaps suggesting that one of us is right/wrong about the majority of our issues? Most simply, with the help of this therapist, is our relationship going to be better off now than before we started treatment with this person?\n\nTime and again, research shows us that feeling understood by and connected to your therapist is important for a good outcome, and this is no less important in couples treatment than in individual therapy. You have the right to evaluate your therapist and make sure he/she is a good fit for you. You want to find someone you connect with and who does not take sides in your relationship disagreements. Making sure this is the case is the last step in choosing a good couples therapist.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope you find this advice helpful.",
  "latent_25244": "Every so often someone decides to write an article attacking Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) on some basis. The most resent example is @anonymint's article claiming DPOS can't internet-scale.\n\nBefore I go on to address Anonymint's claims, I feel it is important that people realize that everything in life has design tradeoffs and the secret is to make the best tradeoffs. In order to make the best tradeoffs you must look at the entire picture. You cannot attack an idea in a vacuum, everything must be compared to something else. Furthermore, if comparisons are to be made they should be against accurate descriptions of working alternatives and not against theoretical alternatives for which there is no known nor proven implementation.\n\nConsortium Blockchains vs Proof of Work\n\nIn his blog, @anonymint claims that \"permissioned\" blockchains such as Tendermint and DPOS create overlords. The claim is that overlording \"whales\" can extract higher and higher rents. This claim cannot exist in a vacuum, but must be compared to alternatives of which Proof of Work is presented. What we know is that Fiat Whales control the majority of the hash power and that they hold the network ransom for fees. They use their control over block production to profit at the expense of everyone else.\n\nThe claim is that Proof of Work is \"Open Entry\"; however, to believe that one must ignore economic barriers to entry. For example, no one can enter the proof of work game unless they can mine profitably. Mining profitably means economies of scale and ultimately alternative revenue streams derived from the political power the miners possess. Many governments in the world can trivially make mining unprofitable for all free market actors. They can do this will relatively little capital cost because all mining profits or losses are based upon the margins. Since governments are not concerned about direct economic profit and can realize gains by defending their monopoly, all proof of work systems will be dominated by our current fiat overlords who use their fiat printing presses to subsidize and control cooperative miners.\n\nFurthermore, no minority can create their own smaller consensus system without risk of abuse by the mining powers that be. All one needs to do is look at the mining attacks between BTC and BCH to see how this unfolds.\n\nWhat we can conclude from this is that mining is a dead-end, winner takes all, system. Once economies of scale optimize a mining algorithm that algorithm cannot be used by any minority which is at odds with the mining powers.\n\nLiveliness and the 1/3+ attack\n\nOne of the criticisms levied by @anonymint is:\n\ncolluding malevolent 33% of the stake can permanently and irreparably shutdown the blockchain\n\nThis statement is an example of one of many misunderstandings of existing DPOS systems, such as Steem. DPOS as it was originally designed for BitShares uses the longest-chain rule. Because DPOS limits the frequency a block producer can produce, the chain with the most participation will eventually become the longest chain. This means that stake holders can vote out malicious actors even if 51% are malicious, so long as their exists at least 1 honest producers willing to accurately tally an election on a temporarily minority fork. The \"bad fork\" will start out at 2/3 speed, and the honest fork will be operating at 1/3 speed. Once an election occurs on the 1/3 network it will gain speed to 3/3 and eventually overtake the \"bad guys\".\n\nThis is still the underlying \"rule of DPOS\" on STEEM and BitShares and everything else is simply establishing a high probability of irreversibility.\n\nImportance of Minimizing Finality Latency\n\nBitcoin never reaches finality and without timely finality inter-blockchain communication is not practical. Imagine all consensus systems as a substitute for digital signatures. Now imagine if every time a user signed a transaction it took 1 hour for 99.9% certainty (6 blocks) and the transaction was never truly final. At some point society needs to make a decision to either accept the signature and \"transfer the money\" or reject the signature and not transfer it. If the signature is eventually invalidated then the money shouldn't be transferred; however, if the product has shipped or the \"exchange made\", then it isn't possible to fairly unwind the transfer.\n\nWe need to accept things as final even if there is some potential they could be wrong or be fraudulent because higher level processes cannot advance until lower level processes are final. The cost finality approaches infinity as the certainty demand approaches 100%. At some point, the cost of additional certainty is greater than the loss if it turns out to be fraudulent.\n\nBecause finality is critical for inter-blockchain communication and inter-blockchain communication is fundamental to ultimate internet-scale solutions, we can conclude that stating nothing is ever final is not an acceptable solution. Furthermore, latency in finality dramatically impacts inter-blockchain communication for real world applications. If we must have finality, then we should have it as quickly as possible.\n\nBitcoin accepts 6 blocks as \"final\" which means that 5 mining pools vote on which transactions are final. Even if miners could switch pools in the event that a pool was corrupt, they are unable to identify the corruption or switch within the 1 hour window of finality. This is even without considering the potential corruption at the hash-power distribution level.\n\nIf we are going to rely on 5 mining pools, then we might as well let them sign off on things in seconds rather than waiting an hour or more. The resulting security will be the same, but the latency will be dramatically reduced.\n\nConclusion\n\nPerfecting any single dimension of a problem will come at the expense of the whole and reduce overall volume (value). The optimum solution will maximize the volume by carefully observing the 80/20 rule: 80% of the benefits (value) are achieved by 20% of the effort (cost). Furthermore, no system exists in a vacuum and therefore all security analysis that ignores the larger environment is incomplete and likely misleading.\n\nSecurity must always consider the use of physical threats, the use of short selling to invert POS incentives, and the potential for alternative income streams.",

Friday the 13th was merely cashing-in on the success of John Carpenter’s Halloween, but the slasher craze was so dominant in the late 70s and early 80s, Friday the 13th became a hit. Besides being one of Kevin Bacon’s first movies, Friday the 13th remains unique because the killer was an older woman. She merely wanted to punish the character archetypes responsible for her son drowning, as any mother would. While Friday the 13th is known for Jason Voorhees, his mother’s fueled the initial round of killings. The flick holds up pretty well, largely because it’s actually trying to be scary and surprising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBody Count: 9\n\nCountdown Until Drugs And/Or Pre-Marital Sex: 40 minutes\n\nWeapons: Knife (6X), arrow (2X), axe\n\nHow Pamela Dies: Decapitation\n\nBest Kill: Poor Kevin Bacon!\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.

The Final Chapter was not actually the final chapter, but it was a really good sequel! It’s got Corey Feldman pre-Goonies! It’s got Crispin Glover before Back to the Future! It’s fun and self-aware! Jason’s found his mask, and there’s a real confidence to the series, which is why they were probably trying to end it on a high note.

While other Friday the 13th movies might actually be better than Part II, I can’t help but applaud the movie that brought one of horror cinema’s most memorable monsters to life.

The problem with any series like Friday the 13th is coming up with a way to make the monster scary again. The reboot makes Jason faster, meaner, and more vicious.

  "latent_25938": "In 2001 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) allowed states to opt out of the requirement for reimbursement that a surgeon or anesthesiologist oversee the provision of anesthesia by certified registered nurse anesthetists. By 2005, fourteen states had exercised this option. An analysis of Medicare data for 1999–2005 finds no evidence that opting out of the oversight requirement resulted in increased inpatient deaths or complications. Based on our findings, we recommend that CMS allow certified registered nurse anesthetists in every state to work without the supervision of a surgeon or anesthesiologist.\n\nSurgical anesthesia in the United States is administered by both anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). For almost 150 years, these nurses were the dominant providers of anesthesia services, but by 1986 the rapid influx of physicians into the specialty resulted in a greater number of anesthesiologists who practiced alone or in a team arrangement with nurse anesthetists. 1,2 Even so, 37,000 certified registered nurse anesthetists provide thirty million anesthetics annually in the United States and represent two-thirds of anesthetists in rural hospitals. 3\n\nBackground On The Issue\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement rules for anesthesia providers prohibited payments to certified registered nurse anesthetists who administered anesthesia in the absence of physician supervision. This supervision could be provided by either an anesthesiologist or the surgeon, 4 although surgeons now largely defer to anesthetists at the operating table during the administration of anesthesia and immediately after surgery.\n\nIn December 1997, CMS published a proposed rule to, in the words of the final version, “let State law determine which professionals would be permitted to administer anesthetics, and the level of supervision required for practitioners [seeing Medicare patients] in each category.” 5 The agency later reported basing its decision on a “lack of evidence to support…[the] requirement for [surgeon or anesthesiologist] supervision of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists.” 6\n\nIt should be noted that except for the extra training that anesthesiologists receive in medical school and residency in specialties other than the direct provision of anesthesia, both certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists undergo similar classroom and clinical training in anesthesia care. 7\n\nAnesthesiologists opposed the proposed rule, arguing that they provide anesthesia care superior to that of certified registered nurse anesthetists, 2,8 even though adverse events related to anesthesia are rare regardless of the provider. 5,9–11 The final CMS rule of November 2001 maintained physician supervision of nurse anesthetists “unless the governor of a State, in consultation with the State’s Boards of Medicine & Nursing, exercises the option of exemption from this requirement” through a written request signed by the governor. 6\n\nAs of 1998, eighteen states permitted certified registered nurse anesthetists to practice independently of any physician, 12 although for reimbursement purposes, Medicare still required physician supervision at least by the surgeon if not by an anesthesiologist. 6 By 2005, fourteen governors in mostly rural states 13 had submitted written requests to Medicare and opted out of the supervised anesthesia requirement. Solo practice by certified registered nurse anesthetists is especially important in rural areas, where anesthesiologists are in short supply.\n\nThis article explores whether the change in CMS policy toward anesthesia supervision had a negative impact on patient outcomes. We begin by examining the absolute level and time trends of adverse patient outcomes within the states that opted out and those that did not.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that differences in these gross measures do not constitute prima facie evidence of a response to the policy change. The act of opting out of the supervision requirement does not necessarily imply any changes in the actual practice of anesthesia within any hospital in a state. The opt-out exemption does not mandate that hospitals allow certified registered nurse anesthetists to provide anesthesia without supervision by a surgeon or an anesthesiologist. It means only that Medicare would not require such supervision as a condition of reimbursement.\n\nNonetheless, if patient outcomes are unchanged after a state has opted out, as we show to be the case, then the requirement that governors petition CMS to exempt certified registered nurse anesthetists from physician supervision is unnecessary and should be rescinded.\n\nStudy Data And Methods\n\nFor the opt-out policy to affect outcomes, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the opt-out policy must result in a shift in anesthesia arrangements. If the policy change does not affect anesthesia arrangements, then it alone could not affect patient outcomes.\n\nSecond, there must be some systematic difference in the outcomes associated with the different anesthetist arrangements. If the outcomes across the different arrangements are the same, then even if the policy change affected anesthesia arrangements, it would not affect overall patient outcomes in opt-out states.\n\nWe therefore examined whether there was a material change in the provision of anesthesia services away from anesthesiologists in favor of certified registered nurse anesthetists and, separately, whether there is evidence of different outcomes associated with the two types of anesthetists. In examining outcomes, we first determined whether case-mix complexity differed between opt-out and non-opt-out states and by anesthetist training.\n\nData Source\n\nTo address the research questions, we used the 5 percent Medicare Inpatient (Part A) and Carrier (Part B) Medicare limited data set files for 1999–2005. The files include all Part A claims from facilities and Part B claims from physicians and suppliers for a 5 percent sample of beneficiaries.\n\nGiven the distribution of states opting out of physician supervision at different times, we used seven calendar years of Medicare 5 percent data. This gives three full years of post-opt-out data for six of fourteen opt-out states and at least two full years of data for eleven opt-out states. Any deleterious effects of shifts to more anesthesia by unsupervised nurse anesthetists should be seen soon after a state opts out because more anesthesia complications would occur during the patient’s inpatient hospital stay.\n\nWe abstracted Part A claims for each study year for all admissions in all Medicare surgical diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), which were 98,000–114,000 claims per year. Procedures taking place in ambulatory surgery centers were excluded because of uncertainty in measuring mortality or complications in those cases.\n\nBecause the 5 percent limited data sets do not contain the patient’s measurement on the physical status scale of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, we merged onto the claims the anesthesia base units for the most complex anesthesia procedure ( International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision, or ICD-9) code for each admission. For example, the base unit for a thyroid biopsy is 3; for cardiac catheterization, 8; and for tracheobronchial reconstruction, 18. 14\n\nWe used the two Part B procedure modifier fields to identify three anesthesia provider arrangements: anesthesiologists practicing solo, certified registered nurse anesthetists practicing solo, and team anesthesia in which anesthesiologists supervise or direct nurse anesthetists. If a modifier on either a nurse anesthetist or an anesthesiologist claim indicated supervision or direction of the nurse anesthetist, then the anesthesia category was defined as team anesthesia.\n\nAny nonteam hospitalization with a certified registered nurse anesthetist claim but no anesthesiologist claim was coded as certified registered nurse anesthetist solo. Finally, any procedure with an anesthesiologist claim not already characterized as team or certified registered nurse anesthetist solo was considered anesthesiologist solo.\n\nBecause all date fields in the data are aggregated to the quarter level, it was not possible to accurately link inpatient Part B anesthesia claims to specific hospitalizations for patients who had multiple hospitalizations in the same quarter. Therefore, we excluded patients with more than one hospitalization in a quarter.\n\nThe resulting seven-year pooled file contained 741,518 surgical discharges. Roughly one-third did not have any anesthetist claim. The majority of cases without anesthesia bills were for procedures that often do not require an anesthetist, such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, pacemaker lead inserts, sigmoidoscopies, bronchoscopies, diagnostic catheterizations, and endoscopic surgeries.\n\nHospitalizations without a Part B anesthesia claim were excluded unless a surgical procedure took place in a Medicare “pass-through” hospital. In these hospitals, claims for services by nurse anesthetists are rolled into (“passed through”) the Part A hospital claims. Therefore, observations from these hospitals were assigned to the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo category.\n\nHospitalization claims were also deleted if a Part B inpatient anesthetist claim was present in the previous quarter for the same beneficiary with no admission claim in that quarter. We assumed in those cases that the anesthetist filed his or her claim earlier than the hospital’s claim for the same admission.\n\nThis left us with 481,440 hospitalizations for analysis, of which 412,696 were in non-opt-out states and 68,744 were in opt-out states. Of the latter, 41,868 hospitalizations occurred before the state had opted out.\n\nAnalytic Methods\n\nWe analyzed two outcomes measures: inpatient mortality and complications. Mortality is reported on the Medicare discharge abstract. To measure possible anesthesia complications, we identified seven relevant patient safety indicators developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: 15 complications of anesthesia (patient safety indicator 1); death in low-mortality diagnoses (indicator 2); failure to rescue from a complication of an underlying illness or medical care (indicator 4); iatrogenic pneumothorax, or collapsed lung (indicator 6); postoperative physiologic and metabolic derangements, or physical or chemical imbalances in the body (indicator 10); postoperative respiratory failure (indicator 11); and transfusion reaction (indicator 16). (Descriptions of each complication are provided in the online Appendix.) 16\n\nEach of these complications occurred only infrequently. Therefore, we used a single no/yes indicator (0 for no, 1 for yes) to show if any one of them occurred on a single admission.\n\nState-level analyses cannot completely answer the question of whether allowing certified registered nurse anesthetists to provide anesthesia without supervision exposes patients to meaningful additional risks. By focusing on individual hospitalizations, however, it is possible to use Medicare claims to isolate any impact of opting out by anesthesia provider type.\n\nIt is possible that hospital managers systematically refer more difficult procedures to anesthesiologists and less difficult ones to nurse anesthetists. We therefore controlled for patient characteristics and procedure complexity.\n\nWe compared inpatient mortality rates between opt-out and non-opt-out states, stratifying by year and anesthesia arrangement. Anesthesiologists practicing alone were involved in more complex surgical procedures than certified registered nurse anesthetists practicing alone. Therefore, we adjusted anesthesiologist solo mortality rates by applying to the anesthesiologist solo group the nurse anesthetist case-mix for surgeries that the two providers had in common.\n\nFrequency weighting was done at the diagnosis-related group level for each state, separately. T-tests were used to measure the differences in the adjusted mortality rates between opt-out and non-opt-out states within each stratum.\n\nWe also estimated logistic regressions using indicators for state opt-out status before and after opt-out and for anesthesia provider, to determine the effects of these variables on the probability of mortality and complications. Also included were the patient’s age, sex, and race, along with year indicators and the procedure’s anesthesia base units, to measure its complexity. The model was applied to surgical admissions pooled across all seven years in all opt-out and non-opt-out states.\n\nResults\n\nWho Provides Anesthesia\n\nWe examined whether a state’s decision to opt out of the supervision requirement resulted in different anesthesia arrangements. In our sample, the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo group provided anesthesia in 21 percent of surgeries in opt-out states and about 10 percent in non-opt-out states ( Exhibit 1 ). Solo provision of anesthesia by nurse anesthetists increased over time in opt-out and non-opt-out states.\n\nExhibit 1 Percentages Of Surgical Anesthetics By Anesthesia Provider, In States That Did And Did Not Opt Out Of Physician Supervision, 1999–2005 Opt-out states Non-opt-out states CRNA solo MDA solo Team CRNA solo MDA solo Team 1999 17.6 40.7 41.7 7.0 47.3 45.8 2000 18.4 42.5 39.1 8.3 46.7 45.0 2001 20.2 42.0 37.8 9.2 45.3 45.5 2002 22.2 41.7 36.1 9.9 44.7 45.4 2003 22.9 42.5 34.7 10.3 43.7 46.0 2004 23.4 42.0 34.6 11.3 42.3 46.5 2005 22.5 42.8 34.7 12.0 41.5 46.5 1999–2005 21.0 42.0 37.0 9.7 44.5 45.8\n\nAlthough the absolute increase was roughly five percentage points in both opt-out and non-opt-out states, the proportional increase was larger in non-opt-out states (71 percent) than in opt-out states (28 percent). The growth of the solo share by certified registered nurse anesthetists in opt-out states came at the expense of team anesthesia, while in the non-opt-out states it came at the expense of anesthesiologist solo anesthesia.\n\nDifferences By Patient Type Or Procedure\n\nBefore comparing trends in outcomes, we examined whether the case-mix of certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists differed by type of patient or procedure. Exhibit 2 shows patient characteristics as of 2005, stratified by anesthesia provider and state opt-out status. The figures have not been adjusted for the different diagnosis-related group surgical cases that are typical of the two types of anesthesia providers. With the exception of base units, the differences in patient characteristics between the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo and anesthesiologist solo groups, although statistically significant, were clinically minor and would not explain large differences in patient outcomes within opt-out and non-opt-out states.\n\nExhibit 2 Characteristics Of Anesthesia Patients In States That Did And Did Not Opt Out Of Physician Supervision, 2005 Characteristic Opt-out states Non-opt-out states CRNA solo ( n = 2,310) MDA solo ( n = 4,605) Team ( n = 3,736) CRNA solo ( n = 7,554) MDA solo ( n = 26,354) Team ( n = 29,511) Age 75+ 51% 48% 45% 44% 47% 44% Male 41% 45% 44% 43% 45% 44% African American 1% 2% 2% 8% 7% 11% Base units a 7.2 8.3 7.6 7.2 8.4 7.6\n\nWith the exception of the prevalence of African American patients, the differences within provider groups across opt-out status were also minimal.\n\nIn opt-out and non-opt-out states, the mean number of base units in the anesthesiologist solo group was about a full point higher than in the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo group ( p < 0.05 , or unlikely to be due to chance). This indicates that solo anesthesiologists were performing more complex or difficult procedures than the nurse anesthetist solo group. One might have expected higher relative complexity by nurse anesthetists practicing solo in opt-out states, given their higher proportion of cases.\n\nHowever, many opt-out states are rural, and surgery and anesthesia in those states may be less complex overall than in more urban states. This is because patients with more difficult surgical procedures are referred to major urban hospitals with experienced surgical teams and technologies.\n\nOutcomes For Patients\n\nGiven that the solo practice of nurse anesthetists did increase in opt-out states, we next determined whether there were any differences in patient outcomes by anesthesia arrangement. We started with mortality rates within each hospital for procedures that the two provider types had in common in opt-out and non-opt-out states.\n\nIn non-opt-out states, mortality rates for the three anesthesia arrangements followed a general downward trend throughout the seven-year period, from 3.1–3.5 percent to 2.2–2.8 percent ( Exhibit 3 ). A general downward trend is also apparent in opt-out states. Of particular interest is the mortality trend for the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo group in opt-out states. The rate increased from 1999 to 2001—prior to the introduction of the opt-out provision—and decreased from 2001 to 2005. December 2001 was when the first state, Iowa, opted out of the supervision requirement.\n\nExhibit 3 Surgical Inpatient Mortality Rates (Per 100 Patients) By Anesthetist Arrangement, In States That Did And Did Not Opt Out Of Physician Supervision, 1999–2005 Year Opt-out states Non-opt-out states CRNA solo MDA solo Team CRNA solo MDA solo Team 1999 1.76 3.45 2.92 3.10 3.50 3.19 2000 2.50 3.67 1.79 3.16 3.21 2.58 2001 3.01 2.80 1.94 3.54 3.68 3.19 2002 2.26 2.72 2.15 3.09 3.44 2.95 2003 2.49 2.39 2.01 3.21 3.58 2.86 2004 1.86 3.82 2.03 2.84 3.20 3.08 2005 2.03 1.32 1.45 2.34 2.76 2.20\n\nMultivariate Analyses\n\nExhibit 4 shows the results of the multivariate analyses for inpatient mortality and complications. It presents the odds ratios for each of the three provider groups in three different opt-out status conditions: non-opt-out states, opt-out states prior to opting out, and opt-out states after opting out. In addition to the provider group and opt-out status indicators, the model controlled for patients’ age categories, sex, and race; anesthesia procedure base units; indicators for the ten highest-mortality diagnosis-related groups; and an annual time trend.\n\nExhibit 4 Likelihood Of Death And Complications From Anesthesia, For Different Combinations Of Anesthesia Provider Groups And States’ Opt-Out Status: Odds Ratios Anesthesia provider Mortality Complications Non-opt-out states Opt-out states Non-opt-out states Opt-out states Before opting out After opting out Before opting out After opting out MDA solo 1.00 0.797 a 0.788 a 1.00 0.824 a 0.818 a CRNA solo 0.899 a 0.651 a 0.689 a 0.992 0.798 a 0.813 a Team 0.959 a 0.708 a 0.565 a 1.067 a 0.927 0.903\n\nThe reference group for the odds ratios for both mortality and complications was the anesthesiologist solo group in non-opt-out states. All eight comparison cells for mortality had odds ratios less than 1.0, which indicates that mortality occurred with lower probability in all other combinations of provider and opt-out status than it did with solo anesthesiologists in non-opt-out states (the differences are all significant at the 0.05 level). In opt-out states, there were no statistically significant mortality differences between the periods before and after opting out.\n\nUnlike mortality, complication rates did not differ between anesthesiologist and certified registered nurse anesthetist solo groups in non-opt-out states ( Exhibit 4 ). 17 Yet, as with mortality, nurse anesthetists practicing solo in opt-out states had a lower incidence of complications (odds ratios were 0.798 before opting out and 0.813 after) relative to solo anesthesiologists in non-opt-out states. These differences were statistically significant for both time periods.\n\nIn opt-out states, complication rates for the nurse anesthetist solo group were essentially identical to those for the anesthesiologist solo group. The difference between complication rates for nurse anesthetist solo and team anesthesia was also not statistically different in opt-out states.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLinking the change in CMS reimbursement policy to changes in patient outcomes requires both that the proportion of surgical procedures for which certified registered nurse anesthetists alone provided anesthesia changed as a consequence of the policy change, and that the type of anesthesia provider affects the likelihood of in-hospital mortality or other adverse event. Our analysis does not support either of the two.\n\nInstead, we found that from 1999 to 2005, the proportion of surgeries in which anesthesia was provided by nurse anesthetists with no anesthesiologist involvement increased by five percentage points in both opt-out and non-opt-out states. However, the rate of increase was nearly three times as great in non-opt-out states as in opt-out states because nurse anesthetist solo rates initially were lower in the former than in the latter. This implies that the increase in the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo share in opt-out states cannot be ascribed wholly, if at all, to the change in the CMS supervision policy.\n\nWhatever forces are driving the growing share of nurse anesthetist solo cases, they appear to be different in the fourteen opt-out states than in the non-opt-out states. In opt-out states, the seven-percentage-point decline in team anesthesia resulted in more solo practice by both types of anesthetists. Anesthesiologists practicing solo explained about one-third of the decline in team anesthesia, and nurse anesthetists practicing solo accounted for the other two-thirds. Elsewhere in the country, team anesthesia rates were constant.\n\nDespite the shift to more anesthetics performed by nurse anesthetists, no increase in adverse outcomes was found in either opt-out or non-opt-out states. In fact, declining mortality was the norm. Moreover, the mortality rate for the nurse anesthetist solo group was lower than for the anesthesiologist solo group in opt-out states both before and after opting out, although the difference was statistically significant only before the state opted out.\n\nThese results do not support the hypothesis that allowing states to opt out of the supervision requirement resulted in increased surgical risks to patients. Nor do the results support the claim that patients will be exposed to increased risk as a consequence of more nurse anesthetists’ practicing without physician supervision.\n\nWe did find that case-mix complexity was different for the two types of providers. Anesthesia base units for procedures in which anesthesiologists practiced solo were a full point higher than for procedures in which certified registered nurse anesthetists worked alone.\n\nAlthough base units might not completely describe the complexity of either surgical or anesthetic procedures, base units were associated with a statistically greater mortality risk in our multivariate model. We estimate that each one-point increase in procedure base units is associated with a 7 percent higher mortality risk.\n\nTo this extent, base units can capture a sizable part of the complexity and risk of the procedures. Moreover, we believe that using additional measures of complexity would not qualitatively change our results.\n\nThere were clearly differences between the opt-out and non-opt-out states that were not a consequence of their opt-out status. With the exception of the proportion of African American patients, it does not appear that these differences were primarily caused by patient characteristics such as sex and age.\n\nYet opt-out states had lower mortality and complication rates than non-opt-out states, even prior to opting out. This suggests that some unobserved difference existed between opt-out and non-opt-out states, perhaps related to the fact that opt-out states were more rural and tended to be located in the West and Midwest.\n\nIn any case, the policy conclusions supported by this study remain valid. In opt-out states, mortality and complication rates for the certified registered nurse anesthetist solo group did not vary greatly between the period before opting out and the period after. That means that our data do not support the hypothesis that patients are exposed to increased surgical risk if nurse anesthetists work without physician supervision.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nOur analysis of seven years of Medicare inpatient anesthesia claims suggests that the change in CMS policy allowing states to opt out of the physician supervision requirement for certified registered nurse anesthetist reimbursement was not associated with increased risks to patients. In particular, the absolute increase in the provision of anesthesia by unsupervised nurse anesthetists in opt-out states was virtually identical to the increase in non-opt-out states, and the proportional increase was smaller in opt-out states.\n\nThis lends no support to the belief that a meaningful shift in provider shares occurred as a consequence of the policy change. Similarly, our analysis found no evidence to suggest that there is an increase in patient risk associated with anesthesia provided by unsupervised certified registered nurse anesthetists.\n\nBoth a change in the proportion of anesthesia provided by the different groups—nurse anesthetists alone, anesthesiologists alone, and nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists working in teams—and a difference in the outcomes of the different groups are necessary to conclude that the change in CMS policy led to changes in patient safety. Because our data provide no evidence to support either of these conditions, we conclude that patient safety was not compromised by the opt-out policy.\n\nWe recommend that CMS return to its original intention of allowing nurse anesthetists to work independently of surgeon or anesthesiologist supervision without requiring state governments to formally petition for an exemption. This would free surgeons from the legal responsibility for anesthesia services provided by other professionals. It would also lead to more-cost-effective care as the solo practice of certified registered nurse anesthetists increases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was funded by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists.

  "latent_26113": "I wonder if the Conservatives regret calling an election during the media feeding frenzy that is the Mike Duffy trial.\n\nThe thinking must have been that Stephen Harper’s appearances on the campaign trail would deflect attention from the goings-on in court.\n\nThose hopes look increasingly forlorn.\n\nWhile most people won’t delve into the minutiae of the testimony, they will remember the prime minister looking like a character from the poster for the Usual Suspects, as he was peppered with reporters’ questions about the murky behaviour of his most senior staff.\n\nBeing caught on the defensive is never a good look for a campaigning politician and Harper lost the benefit of the doubt some time around his first prorogation of parliament.\n\nWhile the Duffy trial is unlikely to shift votes on its own, it does hurt a government that was first elected on the twin pillars of accountability and fiscal competence way back when God was a boy.\n\nStanding behind a podium with a large sign reading “Leadership,” while denying any knowledge of what was happening in his own office does not bolster the prime minister’s credentials on the accountability file.\n\nWe’re nearly two weeks into the 42nd general election and it’s clear already the ballot question is: “to change or not to change?” Polls suggest people say the economy is the issue that will decide the election. It is a narrative Harper is keen to advance. “Who do you trust on the big issues?” he asked Friday as he extolled his “proven experience in keeping Canadians safe and the economy strong.”\n\nYet other polls suggest nearly half of all Canadians approve of Conservative management of the economy. If that really were the lone theme of the election, Harper would be sitting around his swimming pool, rather than being asked when he stopped lying to the Canadian public.\n\nThe real barometer of public opinion is the question of whether it is time for another party to take over in Ottawa. A poll by Ipsos Reid suggested that two in three voters think it is. That change voter is split but, ominously for Harper, most of those people think the two main opposition parties should gang up on the Tories, if they win a minority (86 per cent of NDP supporters and 84 per cent of Liberal voters support the parties co-operating to form a government to prevent the Conservatives taking power again, according to Ipsos).\n\nTom Mulcair appears to have digested that he doesn’t need to be the greatest — just the most ready to deliver change.\n\nTom Mulcair appears to have digested that he doesn’t need to be the greatest — just the most ready to deliver change\n\nThe NDP took steps Friday to insulate itself from fears that it would drive the economy into the ground, while promising improved transparency and accountability.\n\nMulcair unveiled a new star candidate with impeccable economic management credentials in the form of Andrew Thomson, a former Saskatchewan finance minister, who will run in the Toronto riding held by federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver.\n\nWhen asked why he would run such a high-profile candidate in a riding the NDP has never held, Mulcair said he loves the challenge. “I was told that I would never win in the Liberal fortress of Outremont (in Montreal), that I was foolhardy to run there. I proved them wrong,” he said.\n\nThomson’s recruitment is a real coup — he was the finance minister who introduced the largest tax cuts in Saskatchewan’s history, while posting a $2-billion surplus. It doesn’t inoculate the NDP against Tory charges it has a “dangerous plan to keep Canadian resources in the ground” but, as Mulcair pointed out, he has recruited a man who has done something Oliver has never achieved — balanced a budget.\n\nHarper will have to turn the fear factor dial to 11 if he going to bring the “time for change” number back to more manageable levels.\n\nAt the moment, voters are discounting the economic consequences of changing governments — one poll suggested the number who think a change in Ottawa would make things worse is lower than the number who intend to vote Conservative. Not exactly a recipe for Tory growth.\n\nStill, being open to change doesn’t necessarily translate into votes, if the change on offer is unappealing — as we learned in the Ontario election last year.\n\nHence, the need for the opposition parties to fill the shop window.\n\nMulcair is set on exploiting Conservative weaknesses, chief among which are its record on government secrecy.\n\nThe NDP leader said as prime minister he would strengthen the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Officer by making the position a fully independent officer of Parliament, similar to the auditor general. He would also require government departments to make financial information available to the PBO.\n\nThis is a seemingly arcane point that most voters will likely gloss over. But it plays into a broader narrative that an NDP government would not subscribe to the Conservative belief open government is a contradiction in terms — you can have one or other.\n\nThat is, of course, what all parties say in opposition. It’s what the Conservatives said before setting up the PBO as part of their Accountability Act.\n\nBut if you’re the opposition, you have to do something different — and this is something.\n\nFrankly, while the PBO is currently under the auspices of the Library of Parliament, and there were fears that the new budget officer, Jean Denis Fréchette, would prove to be a tame replacement for his vocal predecessor, Kevin Page, my experience is the PBO has continued to provide vital information to parliamentarians and the media, even when it embarrassed the government.\n\nStill, it can’t hurt to formalize freedom from political interference.\n\nWith the election stretched before us like an endless sea, only a fool would make any predictions on its outcome. But it is already clear Harper has to convince more people the consequences of change will be catastrophic to their personal circumstances. Right now, Mulcair is laughing all the way to the ballot box.\n\nNational Post\n\n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nSep. 28, 2016, 10:01 PM GMT / Updated Sep. 28, 2016, 10:01 PM GMT By Maggie Fox\n\nResearchers have invented a new type of artificial bone that can be shaped using a 3-D printer for customized implants.\n\nThe new material, which they call hyper-elastic bone, appears to act like natural bone in the body and can repair deformed bones and some injuries, the team reports in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nA Hyperelastic Bone human skull. Interior of the skull is hollow Adam E. Jakus, PhD\n\nWhen the material was tested in a monkey, the bone fused to the animal’s skull, and new blood vessels grew into it, the team at Northwestern University said.\n\n“Within four weeks, the implant had fully integrated, fully vascularized with the monkey’s own skull. And there is actually evidence of new bone formation,” Adam Jakus, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of materials science and engineering at Northwestern, told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nRelated: Scientists Print Living Body Parts\n\nThey hope to gain permission to test the implants in people within the next five years.\n\nThe material is cheap and appears to be useful for a range of bone injuries, including for the spine, skull and jaw, they said.\n\n“The first time that we actually 3-D printed this material, we were very surprised to find that when we squeezed or deformed it, it bounced right back to its original shape.”\n\nCurrently, the best option is a bone graft from the patient, which can be painful and which doesn’t always work well, or donated bone from someone who has died. These transplants often do not heal well. Artificial bone grafts currently in development are often brittle and risk being rejected, also.\n\nJakus and assistant professor Ramille Shah developed a mixture of materials including hydroxyapatite, the main mineral component of natural bone tissue, which also lends itself to ink-jet printing.\n\nRelated: Regenerative Medicine Means Lab-Grown Body Parts\n\n“Despite the fact that it is majority ceramic, which is usually very brittle, it possesses very unique nano and micro-structural properties that makes it highly elastic,” Shah said.\n\n“The first time that we actually 3-D printed this material, we were very surprised to find that when we squeezed or deformed it, it bounced right back to its original shape.”\n\nIt can be “easily cut, rolled, folded, and sutured to tissue. And since it is elastic, it can be pressed, fit into a defect, and expand to mechanically fix itself into a space without glue or sutures,” she added.\n\n\"Since it is elastic, it can be pressed, fit into a defect, and expand to mechanically fix itself into a space without glue or sutures.\"\n\nThey stuck some under the skin of a mouse and it acted like natural tissue. Cells grew on it and blood vessels made their way into it, much like natural bone.\n\nWhen they put some into a soup with immature human stem cells pre-programmed to form bone or muscle, the cells took right to the new material. “One of the truly astonishing things that happened was that the stem cells actually turn into osteoblasts, or bone-like cells over the course of this time. And this was just because of the material,” Jakus said.\n\nScanning electron micrograph from a small region of a Hyperelastic Bone scaffold that was explanted from the back of mouse after more than 30 days. The micrograph shows the cross-section of a single Hyperelastic fiber (circular region in center) being surrounded by and becoming integrated with biological tissues. Adam E. Jakus, PhD\n\nThe material could be used for tailor-made implants, perhaps based on MRI and other scans. And various sizes and shapes of bone could be pre-printed for wider use, because the material is easy to cut and shape more precisely later on.\n\n“So this makes it really ideal for those third-world applications where you could just ship it way ahead of time, have it on the shelf until it's needed rather than having to create a complex biomaterial that needs to be heavily refrigerated or frozen,” Jakus said.\n\n“In most of these cases, like in third world countries, those types of facilities may not be accessible. So being able to open a package and to use the material is fantastic, both in the United States and first world nations, as well as third world nations.”",

He said there is a reference in the script as to why the film has a singular title, and that the film will carry an R rating.\n\nThe original Predator was directed by John McTiernan and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the leader of a United States special forces team that comes under attack from an alien entity that prizes the thrill of the hunt above all else. It was followed by a direct sequel, Predator 2, in 1990 before crossing over with Fox’s Alien franchise for two additional sequels, Alien vs. Predator and AvP: Requiem. In 2010, Nimrod Antal helmed a reboot with a new feature, Predators.\n\nThe Predator will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.\n\n[Gallery not found]",

It appeared to be fading in a way that looked as though its light energy was being sucked from it – sparking theories that a form of life has placed a massive megastructure around it to harness it for fuel. Scientists were quick to dismiss the claims at first but now a ground-breaking study has been published – suggesting something very mysterious is going on.\n\n“It’s a big challenge to come up with a good explanation for a star doing three different things that have never been seen before” Ben Montet It claims Tabby’s star has been fading slowly then suddenly very rapidly over a four-year observation, scientists from California Institute of Technology revealed. And while it might sound like a whole lot of fuss over a dimming star. No others are behaving like Tabby’s.\n\nSIMONMONTET COMETS: An artist's impression shows how comets could be to blame for blocking out the light\n\nEarth 2 unveiled: Proxima b Proxima b, which was unveiled today, is a new Earth-like planet orbiting Proxima Centauri – the closest neighbouring star to the Sun.

  "latent_26282": "Image copyright US Army/Kyodo/Alamy Stock Photo Image caption Sgt Charles Jenkins pictured as a young US soldier, and Hitomi Soga at 17, two years before she was abducted\n\nEvery night before going to bed, US defector Charles Jenkins turned to Hitomi Soga, the woman North Korea had forced him to marry, and kissed her three times.\n\n\"Oyasumi\" he said, using her native Japanese. \"Goodnight\", she replied in English, the language of his North Carolina childhood.\n\n\"We did this so we would never forget who we really were, and where we came from,\" Jenkins wrote in his memoir.\n\nTheirs is a dark, strange, compelling tale - and finally, a love story.\n\nTrapped in the hermit kingdom known for its famines and labour camps, the pair were united by one of its less noted hazards: prisoner matchmaking.\n\nJenkins, who died on Monday aged 77, staggered into North Korea on a bitter night in January 1965.\n\nAged 24, he was drunk and depressed. A US Army sergeant stationed on the South Korean side, he worried he would catch a stray bullet patrolling the border. Or worse, be sent away to his death in Vietnam.\n\nJenkins knew defecting was risky, but figured he would claim asylum at the Russian embassy and make it home in a prisoner swap. He would later write: \"I did not understand that the country I was seeking temporary refuge in was literally a giant, demented prison; once someone goes there, they almost never get out.\"\n\nMeet the four defectors\n\nNorth Korea duly took him captive, and a four-decade ordeal began.\n\nJenkins was held in a Spartan single room with three other GIs who had deserted since 1962 - Pte James \"Joe\" Dresnok, a 6'5 giant of a man; Pte Larry Abshier - believed to be the first US soldier to defect to the North; and Cpl Jerry Parrish, just 19 when he went over, who said that if he ever went home to Kentucky his father-in-law would kill him.\n\nThe four were forced to study the teachings of then-leader Kim Il-sung for 10 hours a day, and beaten regularly by their captors. Desperate - and desperately bored - they tried to make their own fun \"stealing government property, or going on daredevil hikes,\" as Jenkins wrote in his book \"The Reluctant Communist\".\n\nImage copyright AFP / VeryMuchSo Productions Image caption James Dresnok, pictured in his sixties, defected across the minefields of the DMZ in 1962\n\nIn 1972, the defectors were finally given separate homes and declared North Korean citizens - though they still endured constant surveillance, beatings and torture.\n\nThey taught English at a military school (which eventually fired Jenkins over his southern drawl), and were ordered to play evil Americans in a 20-part series of propaganda films, a move that made them instant celebrities.\n\nAnother set of orders was more surprising still. The four men were paired off with female prisoners of the regime, all foreigners, and forced to marry.\n\nWhy would North Korea bother? For Jenkins, the rationale was clear: he believed Pyongyang was running a spy breeding programme, and would train their Western-looking children to serve as agents abroad.\n\nImage copyright STR/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Kim Jong-il (R) produced North Korean propaganda films to impress his father, Kim Il-sung\n\nWhile the four US soldiers took their own paths to the communist kingdom, the same was not true of the women they married.\n\nNorth Korea has only admitted to kidnapping Japanese citizens, but Jenkins claimed their wives, all from different countries, were abducted by its secret service.\n\n'I wasn't letting her go'\n\nHitomi Soga, who would become Mrs Jenkins, was a 19-year-old nurse in 1978 when she was seized from her home island of Sado, off Japan's west coast. She had been kidnapped to serve as a teacher, training North Korean spies in Japanese language and behaviour. Ultimately, her nationality would buy her husband a future he could never have dreamed of.\n\nWhen the pair wed in 1980, Jenkins had spent 15 years alone in Pyongyang's frosty embrace. He later told CBS: \"I'll put it like this. I looked at her one time. I wasn't letting her go.\"\n\nThe newlyweds had nothing in common but a passionate hatred of North Korea - yet gradually, they fell in love.\n\nOver 22 years, Jenkins and Ms Soga found a measure of happiness. They were grateful for each other. Two daughters followed; Mika, now in her mid 30s, and Brinda, two years younger.\n\nThe extraordinary development that would change their lives came in 2002. Kim Jong-il, then leader of North Korea, admitted that his country had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nKim said eight had died (a claim questioned by Japan), but agreed that five survivors should be sent back to Japan for a 10-day visit. They were two couples, and Hitomi Soga - minus her husband.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The Jenkins family pictured later in 2004\n\nJapan embraced the men and women who had made it back with an outpouring of public sympathy. They never returned to North Korea.\n\nJenkins and his daughters were bereft. Desertion from the US army carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and the old soldier knew that if he tried to join his wife in Japan the US military would arrest him.\n\nTwo years after Ms Soga was repatriated, he could stand it no longer. Jenkins and their children flew to Indonesia - which has no extradition treaty with the US - to meet her.\n\nPyongyang had only sanctioned a brief visit. But with the encouragement of Japan's then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the defector said he would risk a court martial and death in prison in order to reunite his family.\n\nImage copyright STR/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Reunited, the Jenkins family wipe away tears at Indonesia's Jakarta airport in July 2004\n\nImage copyright TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA Image caption Jenkins looked older than his years by the time he reached Japan with his daughters\n\nOn 11 September 2004, the deserter left hospital in a mini-van bound for Camp Zama, just outside Tokyo. He looked a good decade older than his 64 years. Standing without his walking stick in a smart grey suit, he gave the US military police officer a long, crisp salute.\n\n\"Sir, I'm Sergeant Jenkins and I'm reporting,\" he said.\n\nJenkins served 25 days of a 30-day sentence after pleading guilty to desertion and aiding the enemy (for the time he spent teaching English). He was released early for good behaviour.\n\nIt is believed he shared his full knowledge of North Korea with the US in exchange for clemency.\n\nJenkins broke down after his release, sobbing: \"I made a big mistake of my life, but getting my daughters out of there, that was one right thing I did.\"\n\nImage copyright TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Charles Jenkins salutes Lieutenant Colonel Paul Nigara at the US base, Camp Zama, after 39 years AWOL\n\nUntil his death, he was convinced that North Korea wanted to weaponise his children, and that the elite languages college they attended had been grooming them for espionage.\n\nHitomi Soga moved back to Sado island in 2004, taking her husband and daughters with her. Jenkins got a job at a tourist park, selling senbei rice crackers and posing for photos. Ms Soga went to work in a local nursing home. Jenkins told their adult daughters never to pull over for Japanese traffic police, fearing they could be North Korean agents.\n\nAs a prisoner of Pyongyang, Sgt Charles Jenkins lost his appendix, one testicle, 39 years, and part of a US army tattoo that was hacked off his forearm without anaesthetic.\n\nHe credited Hitomi Soga with saving his life. Without question, she was the reason he died a free man.\n\nImage copyright STR/AFP/Getty Images Image caption An emotional Hitomi Soga kisses her husband at Jakarta airport in July 2004, two years after she was sent back to Japan\n\nWho did the other defectors marry?\n\nAnocha Panjoy, a young Thai woman, was given to Larry Abshier by the North Korean authorities in 1978. She had been working in a bathhouse in Macau when she vanished. They had no children, and Anocha was widowed when a heart attack killed Abshier at 40. According to Jenkins, her neighbour at the time, she was taken away and re-married by the regime - to a German who worked as a Korean spy abroad.\n\nSiham Shraiteh, from Lebanon, had three sons with Jerry Parrish. By Jenkins' account, she was taken from a secretarial school in Beirut with three other women. When their parents negotiated their return in 1979, Siham was found to be pregnant. She returned to North Korea to deliver her baby, and never left again.\n\nFor James Dresnok, the forced marriage would be his second. His young American wife had divorced him in 1963, the year after he defected. For him, the regime lined up a Romanian woman, Doina Bumbea, who gave him two sons. Jenkins wrote that she was abducted while living in Italy as an arts student. After her death, reportedly from lung cancer in 1997, Dresnok wed the daughter of a Togolese diplomat and a North Korean woman, and had a third son.\n\nAll three of Dresnok's children, and his third wife, featured in a 2006 British documentary film about him, Crossing the Line. Siham Shraiteh appeared too, insisting that she was never kidnapped and had stayed in North Korea with her children by choice. It is not clear if she was speaking under duress, but criticism of the Kim regime would certainly be dangerous for a foreigner.\n\nDresnok, the last known US soldier living in North Korea, died of a stroke aged 74 in late 2016. \"I have never regretted coming to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\", he declared in Crossing the Line. \"I wouldn't trade it for nothing.\"\n\nCharles Jenkins was the only one of the four 1960s defectors who set foot outside North Korea again.",

These blundering and implausible plots to bring down an airliner seem far removed from al-Qaida’s expertise in pulling off 9/11.\n\nIf we are to believe the U.S. government, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged al-Qaida “mastermind” behind 9/11, outwitted the CIA, the NSA, indeed all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies as well as those of all U.S. allies including Mossad, the National Security Council, NORAD, Air Traffic Control, Airport Security four times on one morning, and Dick Cheney, and with untrained and inexperienced pilots pulled off skilled piloting feats of crashing hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center towers, and the Pentagon, where a battery of state of the art air defenses somehow failed to function.\n\nAfter such amazing success, al-Qaida would have attracted the best minds in the business, but, instead, it has been reduced to amateur stunts.\n\nThe Underwear Bomb plot is being played to the hilt on the TV media and especially on Fox “news.” After reading recently that The Washington Post allowed a lobbyist to write a news story that preached the lobbyist’s interest, I wondered if the manufacturers of full body scanners were behind the heavy coverage of the Underwear Bomber, if not behind the plot itself. In America, everything is for sale. Integrity is gone with the wind.\n\nRecently I read a column by an author who has a “convenience theory” about the Underwear Bomber being a Nigerian allegedly trained by al-Qaida in Yemen. As the U.S. is involved in an undeclared war in Yemen, about which neither the American public nor Congress were informed or consulted, the Underwear Bomb plot provided a convenient excuse for Washington’s new war, regardless of whether it was a real attack or a put-up job.\n\nOnce you start to ask yourself about whose agenda is served by events and their news spin, other things come to mind. For example, last July there was a news report that the government in Yemen had disbanded a terrorist cell, which was operating under the supervision of Israeli intelligence services. According to the news report, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh told Saba news agency that a terrorist cell was arrested and that the case was referred to judicial authorities “for its links with the Israeli intelligence services.”\n\nCould the Underwear Bomber have been one of the Israeli terrorist recruits? Certainly Israel has an interest in keeping the US fully engaged militarily against all potential foes of Israel’s territorial expansion.\n\nThe thought brought back memory of my Russian studies at Oxford University where I learned that the Tsar’s secret police set off bombs so that they could blame those whom they wanted to arrest.\n\nI next remembered that Francesco Cossiga, the president of Italy from 1985-1992, revealed the existence of Operation Gladio, a false flag operation under NATO auspices that carried out bombings across Europe in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The bombings were blamed on communists and were used to discredit communist parties in elections.\n\nAn Italian parliamentary investigation unearthed the fact that the attacks were overseen by the CIA. Gladio agent Vincenzo Vinciguerra stated in sworn testimony that the attacks targeted innocent civilians, including women and children, in order “to force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.”\n\nWhat a coincidence. That is exactly what 9/11 succeeded in accomplishing in the U.S.\n\nAmong the well-meaning and the gullible in the West, the supposition still exists that government represents the public interest. Political parties keep this myth alive by fighting over which party best represents the public’s interest. In truth, government represents private interests, those of the office holders themselves and those of the lobby groups that finance their political campaigns. The public is in the dark as to the real agendas.\n\nThe U.S. and its puppet state allies were led to war in the Middle East and Afghanistan entirely on the basis of lies and deception. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction did not exist and were known by the U.S. and British governments not to exist. Forged documents, such as the “yellowcake documents,” were leaked to newspapers in order to create news reporting that would bring the public along with the government’s war agenda.\n\nNow the same thing is happening in regard to the nonexistent Iranian nuclear weapons program. Forged documents leaked to The Times (London) that indicated Iran was developing a “nuclear trigger” mechanism have been revealed as forgeries.\n\nWho benefits? Clearly, attacking Iran is on the Israeli-U.S. agenda, and someone is creating the “evidence” to support the case, just as the leaked secret “Downing Street Memo” to the British cabinet informed Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government that President Bush had already made the decision to invade Iraq and “the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.”\n\nThe willingness of people to believe their rulers and the propaganda ministries that serve the rulers is astonishing. Many Americans believe Iran has a nuclear weapons program despite the unanimous conclusion of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies to the contrary.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney and the neoconservatives fought hard with limited success to change the CIA’s role from intelligence agency to a political agency that manufactures facts in support of the neoconservative agenda. For the Bush Regime creating “new realities” was more important than knowing the facts.\n\nRecently I read a proposal from a person purporting to favor an independent media that stated that we must save the print media from financial failure with government subsidies. Such a subsidy would complete the subservience of the media to government.\n\nEven in Stalinist Russia, a totalitarian political system where everyone knew that there was no free press, a gullible or intimidated public and Communist Party enabled Joseph Stalin to put the heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution on show trial and execute them as capitalist spies.\n\nIn the U.S. we are developing our own show trials. Sheikh Mohammed’s will be a big one. As Chris Hedges recently pointed out, once government uses demonized Muslims to get the new justice (sic) system going, the rest of us will be next.\n\nTo find out more about Paul Craig Roberts, and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate web page at www.creators.com .",
  "latent_26371": "\"Couturier\" redirects here. For other uses, see Couturier (disambiguation)\n\nHaute couture (; French pronunciation: ​ [ot kutyʁ]; French for \"high sewing\" or \"high dressmaking\" or \"high fashion\") is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. Haute couture is high-end fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers - often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.[1][2] Couture translates literally from French as \"dressmaking\" but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework[3] and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit.[4] Haute translates literally to \"high\". A haute couture garment is always made for an individual client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag: budget is not relevant.\n\nThe term originally referred to Englishman Charles Frederick Worth's work, produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century.[5] The Dapifer notes that Worth would allow his clients to select colors, fabrics and other details before ever beginning his design process which was unheard of at the time.[2] In modern France, haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in Paris or in other fashion capitals such as London, Milan, New York City or Tokyo. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or fashion designers that create exclusive and often trend-setting fashions or to the fashions created.\n\nFrench legal status of term [ edit ]\n\nIn France, the term haute couture is protected by law and is defined by the Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris based in Paris. The chambre syndicale de la haute couture is defined as \"the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses\". Their rules state that only \"those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves\" of the label haute couture.[6] The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organization was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the \"couture\" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the Federation Francaise, de couture, du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode.[7]\n\nMore rigorous criteria for haute couture were established in 1945.[8] To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term haute couture in its advertising and any other way, members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture must follow specific rules:[citation needed]\n\ndesign made-to-order for private clients, with one or more fittings;\n\nhave a workshop ( atelier ) in Paris that employs at least fifteen staff members full-time;\n\n) in Paris that employs at least fifteen staff members full-time; have at least twenty full-time technical people, in at least one workshop ( atelier ); and\n\n); and present a collection of at least fifty original designs to the public every fashion season (twice, in January and July of each year), of both day and evening garments.\n\nOther uses of the term [ edit ]\n\nThe term \"haute couture\" has taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art, music, etc.[9]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nActors in Haute couture, 2012.\n\nHaute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th Century.[10] Rose Bertin, the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture.[11] Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models.\n\nAs railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and dressmakers were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations.[citation needed]\n\nA couturier ( French: [ku.ty.ʁje]) is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture.[12] Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed.[citation needed]\n\nThe couturier Charles Frederick Worth (1825–1895), is widely considered the father of haute couture as it is known today.[5][13] Although born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry.[2] Revolutionizing how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of-a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colors and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period.\n\nFollowing in Worth's footsteps were Callot Soeurs, Patou, Poiret, Vionnet, Fortuny, Lanvin, Chanel, Mainbocher, Schiaparelli, Balenciaga, and Dior. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of young designers who had trained under men like Dior and Balenciaga left these established couture houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Ted Lapidus, and Emanuel Ungaro. Japanese native and Paris-based Hanae Mori was also successful in establishing her own line.\n\nLacroix is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.[14]\n\nModernized haute couture shows are not designed and made to be sold, rather they are exactly what they are displayed for—for show. Instead of being constructed for the purpose of selling and making money, they are made to further the publicity, as well as perception and understanding of brand image.\n\nFor all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in ready-to-wear clothing and related luxury products such as shoes and perfumes, and licensing ventures that earn greater returns for the company. Excessive commercialization and profit-making can be damaging, however. Cardin, for example, licensed with abandon in the 1980s and his name lost most of its fashionable cachet when anyone could buy Cardin luggage at a discount store. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes.[15] Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to the television show Gossip Girl.[16]\n\nThe 1960s also featured a revolt against established fashion standards by mods, rockers, and hippies, as well as an increasing internationalization of the fashion scene. Jet travel had spawned a jet set that partied—and shopped—just as happily in New York as in Paris. Rich women no longer felt that a Paris dress was necessarily better than one sewn elsewhere. While Paris is still pre-eminent in the fashion world, it is no longer the sole arbiter of fashion.\n\nMembers of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture [ edit ]\n\nFor the Spring 2017 season the official list of members are:[17]\n\nOfficial members [ edit ]\n\nCorrespondent members (foreign) [ edit ]\n\nGuest members [ edit ]\n\nJewelry [ edit ]\n\nAccessories [ edit ]\n\nRecent guest members have included the fashion houses of Boudicca, Cathy Pill, Richard René and Udo Edling,[19] as well as Eymeric François, Gerald Watelet [fr], Nicolas Le Cauchois [fr][20] and Ma Ke (Wuyong).[21] In the 2008/2009 Fall/Winter Haute Couture week, Emanuel Ungaro showed as an Official Member.\n\nFormer members [ edit ]\n\nPublic and private collections [ edit ]\n\nThe largest private collection of haute couture may be that of Mouna Ayoub, whose collection is estimated to encompass more than 1,600 items.[24]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nNudelman, Z.

  "latent_26386": "More than two dozen states have refused to fully comply with a sweeping and unprecedented White House request to turn over voter registration data, including sensitive information like partial Social Security numbers, party affiliation and military status.\n\nOverall, the states that have said they will not be complying at all with the Kobach commission's request represent over 30 percent of the nation's population. That could complicate any efforts to build a truly national voter file, although it remains unclear what the commission's ultimate goal is in collecting the data.\n\nThose states found themselves the targets of the President Trump's ire on Twitter on Saturday morning: “Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide?”\n\n[Trump challenges states on voter fraud]\n\nAs it turns out, the bipartisan group of state officials withholding information from the commission have been very forthcoming about their reasons for not complying. Here's what a number of them have said.\n\n“I will not provide sensitive voter information to a commission that has already inaccurately passed judgment that millions of Californians voted illegally,” said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat.\n\n“California's participation would only serve to legitimize the false and already debunked claims of massive voter fraud made by the President, the Vice President, and Mr. Kobach,” he added. \"[Kobach's] role as vice chair is proof that the ultimate goal of the commission is to enact policies that will result in the disenfranchisement of American citizens.”\n\n[Kris Kobach: The conservative gladiator from Kansas behind restrictive voting laws]\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, another Democrat, struck a similar note.\n\n“The president created his election commission based on the false notion that 'voter fraud' is a widespread issue — it is not,” Grimes said. “Kentucky will not aid a commission that is at best a waste of taxpayer money and at worst an attempt to legitimize voter suppression efforts across the country.”\n\nOn Aug. 1, a federal judge declined to block the president's voter fraud commission from collecting voter data. A lawsuit attempting to block the collection of voter data could now go to a federal appeals court. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nA number of states said they would only provide limited, publicly available information, as required by state law.\n\nVermont Secretary of State James Condos (D) said “I am bound by law to provide our publicly available voter file, but will provide no more information than is available to any individual requesting the file.”\n\nNorth Carolina will comply with the request by handing over “publicly available data as already required under state law,” said Kim Westbrook Strach, the executive director of the bipartisan North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics enforcement.\n\nMississippi rejected the request on privacy and states' rights grounds. “They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico,” Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said on Friday. “Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our State's right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral process.\"\n\nIn Alabama, another GOP stronghold, Secretary of State John Merrill told the Montgomery Advertiser he will not comply with the request until he learns more about how the Kobach commission will keep the data secure. “We’re going to get answers to our questions before we move on this,” Merrill said.\n\nPerhaps most strikingly, at least two of the holdouts were members of the commission, including commission co-chairman Kris Kobach himself, who said that state law prevented them from fully complying with the request.\n\nThe Kansas secretary of state, a Republican, told the Kansas City Star on Friday that he would not be providing any parts of Kansas voters' Social Security numbers because that data is not publicly available under state law. “In Kansas, the Social Security number is not publicly available,” he said. “Every state receives the same letter, but we’re not asking for it if it’s not publicly available.”\n\nSimilarly, Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson said in a statement that “Indiana law doesn't permit the Secretary of State to provide the personal information requested by Secretary Kobach.” Lawson, another Republican, is also a member of the commission.\n\nTrump's tweet suggests the commission's work remains a top priority for him. That's going to cause concern for elections experts and voting rights activists, many of whom are concerned that Kobach will use the state voter registration data to manufacture “evidence” of widespread voter fraud.\n\n“We're concerned about unlawful voter purging, which has been something that Kris Kobach has been leading the charge,” said Vanita Gupta of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, in an interview Friday.\n\nGupta and others argue that Kobach doesn't exactly have a reputation for being honest about his work on voter fraud. Just a week ago, a federal judge fined Kobach $1,000 for “presenting misleading arguments in a voting-related lawsuit.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly categorized South Carolina's compliance status.

  "latent_26461": "There’s been much talk recently of the motives behind the terrorist attacks that targeted Iran’s parliament and the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran, and there will be much talk in media outlets on those responsible. Despite the fact that ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack, certain ambiguities still exist regarding the operators behind them.\n\nLooking into the previous instances of ISIS’s terrorist attacks around the world, one would conclude that this is not the work of ISIS. Taking the videos that were circulated of the attackers that had been recorded in the days prior to the attacks into question, none of these were circulated in the name of ISIS, nor did they show its banner. Moreover, on the day of the attack, there were no indicators pointing towards ISIS or its black banner.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Al-Arabiya TV was the first media outlet to broadcast the video sent by the attackers, and after that, ISIS’s Aamaq broadcast that same video, announcing that ISIS claims responsibility for the attack. In reality, the fact that the attackers spoke Arabic in the video would have one think that they are affiliated with ISIS, and it’s easier to believe that ISIS would be behind it.\n\nThe question that comes to mind is, if ISIS was not behind these attacks, then why did it claim responsibility for them? In answering this question it must be said that one of ISIS’s goals has always been to showcase itself, and show its capabilities on the international level, performing terrorist attacks around the world to show that it has the ability to perform such actions all over the world, such as its attacks in European countries and elsewhere. Furthermore, ISIS sees Iran as one of its most important enemies, and had threatened to perform terrorist attacks against it time and time again, always failing to perform any attacks on Iranian soil. It so follows that these latest attacks are the best chance for it to make some political gains without putting up any of the costs.\n\nAnother question that comes to mind is: who are the true perpetrators of the Tehran attacks then? The “Ansar al-Islam” organization is a radical Sunni organization, active in Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan, is anti-Iranian, and has deep religious and ethnic differences with the Shia system ruling Iran. It has arranged a number of operations against the Iranian state in the past, and some informed sources have cited them as being behind the Tehran attacks. We will discuss this group’s role in the management and the execution of the attacks as we go along.\n\nMullah Krekar is one of the well-known Salafi figures of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan. He had been a follower of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan for a number of years and fought alongside him. Upon his return to Halabja he began spreading Salafi Jihadism in Iraqi Kurdistan, founding Ansar al-Islam, which simultaneously fought against Saddam Hussein and the Taliban and Barzani movements. After 9/11, he added fighting the U.S to his agenda.\n\nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi left Afghanistan, settling in Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan. The members of Ansar al-Islam, who were mostly Sunni Kurds from Iraq and Iran, were placed under his ideological and intellectual tutelage. This is why this organization considers Al-Zarqawi to be its spiritual leader.\n\nDuring Zarqawi’s stay in Iraq, especially in August 2003, three months after the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, he planned and led the Najaf attacks which resulted in the assassination of Sayyid Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, the head of the Shia Supreme Council of Iraq on August 29th, in the shrine of Imam Ali, the first Imam of Twelver Shia Muslims. After the incident, he established “Tanzim al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn”, Al-Qaeda’s Iraq branch, which eventually came to form ISIS.\n\nThroughout their period of activity, Ansar al-Islam managed to gain great ideological and intellectual influence among Iranian Kurds, leading to the formation of the “Tawhid and Jihad” group. This group, through its commencement of operations since 2011, managed to impose itself as a serious player among Jihadi groups. Furthermore, being the earliest of Salafi Jihadist groups in Iran, it began to spread the ideas of ISIS when the latter revealed itself, and a number of them have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq with ISIS. The group was active in Western Iran and its neighbor Iraq, and enjoyed financial support from some of the region’s wealthier countries whose politics run counter to Iran’s.\n\nAnother matter is that anti-Iran groups, apart from their relations with anti-Iran countries, also possess relations with other anti-Iran groups, and cooperate with one another. One of the oldest of these groups is the MEK, which in the post-revolutionary period had many differences with Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran’s then supreme leader, and began fighting the new rule. This organization, in its efforts to combat the Iranian administration, has relations with all anti-Iranian groups, including Ansar al-Islam, and cooperates with them. The MEK enjoys political and social support from the U.S, as well as financial support from Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome informed sources have said almost 50 members of Ansar al-Islam, all of whom are Iranian, Kurdish Sunni Muslims, operate from a base linked to the MOC operations room in Jordan, under the military and operational tutelage of the MEK, and are now ready to launch wide attacks inside Iranian soil.\n\nThese sources have also added that the MEK handled the planning of these latest operations, and that Ansar al-Islam executed them on the anniversary of al-Zarqawi’s death. However, because of Iran’s security forces’ grip on Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan, and their fears of backlash from Iran, Ansar al-Islam decided it was better to conceal their responsibility for these operations, remaining silent, and letting ISIS claim responsibility for them.\n\nIt is noticeable that Saudi Arabia’s king, Iran’s traditional opponent in the region, has supported all radical anti-Iran groups, and even political opposition outside of Iran, such as the MEK, both financially and morally. So much so that Prince Turki al-Faysal, the former head of Saudi Intelligence, in his speech before the MEK’s yearly conference in 2016 in Paris, announced Saudi Arabia’s full support of the organization, as well as all anti-Iran groups.\n\nSaudi Arabia will continue to support these groups in the possibility that Iran, a Shia Islamist country, might be weakened or its system of government changed. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran, on a number of occasions, of supporting terrorism and exporting its revolution to other countries, and interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries. Mohammad bin Salman, the Saudi Minister of Defense and Deputy Crown Prince, has very recently accused Iran of trying to control the entire region, and threatened to create instability and take the war to within Iranian soil. Meanwhile, refuting Saudi claims, Iran’s minister of defense said that if Saudi Arabia should start a war with Iran, nowhere will remain safe in Saudi Arabia but for Mecca and Medina, which are sacred ground. Taking all these factors into question, are the Tehran attacks also a message that the Middle East will be the arena of a military bout between Iran and Saudi Arabia?\n\nAdvertisements",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nKilling subsidies will hike premiums by 20% and raise deficits by $194 billion over the next decade: Our view\n\nPresident Trump signs an executive order on Oct. 12, 2017. (Photo11: Michael Reynolds, EPA-EFE)\n\nDonald Trump and fellow Republicans spent much of the Obama administration complaining about how the president was legislating by the fiat of executive order, bypassing Congress and undermining existing law.\n\nSo what has President Trump done with his latest actions on the Affordable Care Act? Legislate by fiat, bypass Congress and undermine existing law.\n\nTrump’s actions are a blatant effort to do himself what Congress refused to do this summer: sabotage the health insurance markets that millions of individual Americans have come to rely on to cover themselves and their families.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW: Health care order expands insurance\n\nHere is the sequence: In 2010 Congress passed, and President Obams signed, a law expanding health insurance to at least 20 million people. In the first nine months of this year, Congress considered, and rejected, multiple plans for repealing that law.\n\nThen, in a fit of pique last week, Trump signed an executive order that would allow insurers to sell short-term plans that don't meet ACA guidelines, and he stopped federal payments used to support private health care markets.\n\nThese moves have the potential to destroy the delicate balance of the Affordable Care Act, which provides private insurers incentives to offer coverage in individual markets while also giving individuals the right to buy such coverage.\n\nTrump's executive order, which allows insurers to market skimpy policies, is apparently addressed at Americans who feel that their policies cover too much. It is also a deceptive way of undermining the requirement under the law that all Americans have coverage.\n\nKilling the subsidies that help insurers cover low-income and high-cost patients will raise premiums and result in fewer people being insured. Without those subsidies, and with an ongoing prohibition against denying people coverage based on previous medical conditions, some insurers will simply stop offering coverage to individuals through the ACA.\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending the payments will raise premiums on popular \"silver\" health plans by 20% next year and increase federal deficits by $194 billion over the next decade.\n\nTrump's spiteful actions are full of pettiness and partisanship. If his goal is to force congressional Democrats to the bargaining table on health care, he is playing a dangerous game with people's lives, akin to committing arson and hoping the fire department shows up.\n\nLegal challenges by health care organizations, governors and perhaps insurers are all but certain. And given Trump’s usurpation of Congress’ constitutional powers, the challengers’ chances of success would appear to be good at first blush, at least regarding the changes to the health care system contained in the executive order.\n\nIn the meantime, Congress needs to make clear that it will not allow its institutional rights to be trampled. The Republican Party, for its part, might want to think long and hard about the future that awaits it as Trump’s reckless actions become more frequent and destructive.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

  "latent_26677": "Yoga and the Year of the Selfie\n\nThere was a lot of talk about President Barack Obama’s selfie at a memorial for Nelson Mandela. That moment, now frozen in time, shows Obama, Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, and her British counterpart, David Cameron, posing like three giddy teenagers while first lady Michelle Obama appeared to scowl off to the side.\n\nThe strong response to the photo reflects the nation’s ambivalence about our collective obsession with taking pictures of ourselves in order to record every moment of our lives. What ever happened to being present?\n\nThe controversy comes just weeks after the Oxford English Dictionary named “selfie” word of the year, and begs the question: Are selfies superficial or are they empowering, perhaps even driven by nostalgia for the moment, as psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz claims?\n\nThe issue may not be whether these self-portraits and their distribution on social media are good or bad, but rather how people are using them.\n\n“I was an accidental selfie addict,” says Sadie Nardini, founder of Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga, who travels all over the world. She uses selfies as a way to connect with students and friends while she’s on the road, which can be isolating.\n\n“I am a fan, but it can get irritating, and I can get irritated with myself,” says Sadie. “It can get really egomaniacal after a while, so they need to be used sparingly and wisely.”\n\nWriter and yoga teacher Jennifer Pastiloff agrees: “I think we need to pause more. I learned that myself when I started posting about my ectopic pregnancy.” She realized that sometimes we need to exercise discernment and honor our experience. For some, that means showing restraint in what we share.\n\nSelfies are also a way to literally show our face to the world, and can be perceived as powerful, and even empowering, for that reason, says Kripalu Yoga teacher Jennifer Reis. “It’s like looking into the mirror and having a moment to self-reflect,” she explains. “Where am I right now? Who am I right now? The visual is capturing not just an image but a mood and energy.” If you look at it from a yogic perspective, she says, a selfie is a form of witness consciousness, which is at the center of Kripalu philosophy—the ability to closely observe yourself without reactivity or judgment.\n\nDoes this mean every moment should be captured and shared? Of course not. But perhaps, when infused with positive intention, at times we can view the upside of connection. While some claim selfies are a sign of the end of days, maybe they can reflect self-acceptance and a willingness to act boldly, or bring attention to an important cause. As we've seen through social media, sharing images can be a form of connection, empowerment, and social good.\n\nIn the end, it’s about intention—and self-editing. Just because you take a photo doesn’t mean you have to post it on Instagram or Twitter.\n\n“Have dignity and self-respect in how you portray yourself to the world,” Jennifer Pastiloff advises.\n\n© Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health.

  "latent_26982": "Florida lawmakers are considering shutting down community redevelopment agencies, citing reports of misuse of public money. Supporters are hoping to strike a compromise, before the Legislature kills CRAs outright.\n\nCommunity Redevelopment Agencies work with local governments to improve blighted neighborhoods. They fund better roads, sidewalks, affordable housing units and parks, to improve underserved areas. Some projects are wildly popular, like Cascades Park in downtown Tallahassee. What was once an abandoned brownfield is now a community hub with trails, rolling hills, and an open air amphitheater. It’s a favorite spot for families and lunchtime walkers. Business analyst Anna Carradine works remotely, and often brings her laptop here.\n\n“I think it’s a nice place for people to come out and just be outside in nature and really enjoy the weather,” Carradine said.\n\nBut just down the hill from Cascades Park sit long-empty warehouses and storefronts. Critics say the CRA should fund more projects in areas like this, instead of in the trendy All Saints District a mile away.\n\nReports of mismanagement are spurring Valrico Republican Representative Jake Raburn to re-examine the agencies.\n\n“In the CRA process, we’re actually taking away some of the local control from counties,” Raburn said.\n\nWhile some CRA boards are made up of local elected officials, they’re not held to the same standards as city or county commissions. Critics say they’re redundant, and that local governments do the same work with more transparency. Raburn referenced a recent survey of CRAs in the state.\n\n“Ninety-seven percent of those that responded said that similar projects could be funded by local government entities such as cities or counties. Ninety-seven percent. And those are the board members of the current active CRAs,” Raburn said.\n\nRaburn is sponsoring a bill that would require more budget oversight and ethics training for board members. And CRA supporters are open to that. They believe the agencies are doing their job: building the environment that fosters business and community investment. Thomas Hawkins represents the planning organization 1000 Friends of Florida.\n\n“We don’t have a free market for most infrastructure. There’s not a free market for putting gin new water pipes or sewer pipes or roads. These are public infrastructure. And we’ve got to have public agencies that make these investments. So CRAs fill that gap,”Hawkins said.\n\nSupporters say the projects ultimately add property value, which in turn increases tax revenues. But opponent lawmakers aren’t satisfied. Raburn’s House Bill 13 would effectively kill CRAs. It would prevent new agencies from forming, and prohibit existing groups from funding new projects after October 2017. Bill Peebles represents the Florida Redevelopment Association.\n\n“This is a nuclear option. That’s a death knell for these things. And I think it will have a dramatic and a negative impact in most of your districts,” Peebles said.\n\nSome lawmakers are defending the programs, particularly those who served in local governments. But despite some reservations, the plan passed its first committee stop Wednesday. The Senate has not yet taken up the companion bill.",

Here are four underlying reasons why China's crisis in Xinjiang won't go away.\n\nEthnic politics\n\nThe Uighurs of Xinjiang are a distinct minority in China, a Silk Road people with a long, separate history centered around the oases and mud-brick towns of the Tarim Basin and the caravan routes toward Central Asia. The region's most storied city, Kashgar, was the birthplace, some argue, of the Turkish language — or at least of its first chronicler. For two spells in the 1930s and 1940s, Uighurs in Xinjiang declared independence under the banner of East Turkestan — a name and flag dissidents in exile still use to this day.\n\nNo matter the lip service to multiculturalism paid by Beijing, the Uighurs, not unlike the Tibetans next door, struggle with the hardship of being a minority group in an intensely centralized and authoritarian state. Uighurs face discrimination in major Chinese cities and, at home, look on as an influx of Han Chinese migrants radically reshape their homeland. Between 1949 and 2008, the proportion of the population of Xinjiang that is ethnic Han Chinese went from 6 to 40 percent. In Urumqi, Han Chinese now make up some three-quarters of the population. Ethnic riots there in 2o09 led to nearly 200 deaths.\n\nMilitant Islam\n\nChina is fighting its own war on terror, taking aim at Islamist separatists it views as part of a wider regional plague of extremism. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is the group whose name is bandied about the most — though it's sometimes referred to as the Turkestan Islamic Party. ETIM is thought to have links with terror groups elsewhere, particularly in Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. Chinese authorities say ETIM has ties to al-Qaeda and training camps in the tribal area along the Pakistani-Afghan border. Uighurs were among the hundreds of supposed foreign fighters swept up and detained by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay following the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nBut all this doesn't amount to a direct causal link between organized transnational terror networks and the current epidemic of violence in Xinjiang. China blamed a bombing at a train station a month ago that killed three people on ETIM, but has now been more circumspect in pointing the finger at specific groups. It's unclear what kind of real operational capacity ETIM and other like-minded outfits have inside China and to what degree attacks like Thursday's are far more local actions.\n\nRepression\n\nHeavy-handed Chinese policies to combat militancy haven't helped the situation. Beijing warns against separatism and \"splittism\" and has arrested prominent Uighurs whose public statements and activities would in more democratic societies not be considered threatening. Human Rights Watch has documented a regime of mass detentions and enforced disappearances carried out by the security apparatus in Xinjiang.\n\nChina has curtailed Islamic religious practices in the region, razed much of the historic Old Town of Kashgar — a monument to Uighur culture leveled for the sake of \"modernization\" — and clamped down on other freedoms. After the 2009 violence, the government turned off the Internet in Xinjiang to curb the spread of messages that inflamed the riots, an act which radically altered the tapestry of life in Xinjiang for almost a whole year. Under former president Hu Jintao, the region's then-party secretary Wang Lequan downgraded the status of the Uighur language, deeming it unfit \"for the 21st century\" and making it an optional foreign language taught in state-run schools, akin to English.\n\nMarginalization\n\nChinese government white papers point to the considerable economic and infrastructure developments brought about by Beijing in the region — which is rich in resources and sits at a strategic crossroads between China and Central Asia. Clearly, that's a narrative not accepted by all Uighurs.\n\nWhile their disaffection remains palpable — and many observers call for a liberalization of Chinese policy in the region rather than an inevitable, harsh crackdown — the Uighurs also have very little leverage. While well-known, their plight is hardly a cause celebre internationally, and few regional governments would risk trade ties and other diplomatic links with China over the rights of one marginalized minority. In the past, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed solidarity with the Turkic Uighurs, but even he sees little point in compromising relations with the world's next superpower, and promised China's President Xi Jinping on a visit in 2012 that Turkey would not allow any Uighur separatist activity to take place on its soil.\n\nIn an environment in which Uighurs have few means to agitate for change, it's perhaps not surprising that some choose such brutal, terrible methods to attract attention.",
  "latent_27493": "RANGERS have scored over seventy goals this season and the Light Blues fans were asked to cast their vote recently for the best of the campaign.\n\nIt’s been very hard to select just a handful from some of excellent strikes and team goals that the Light Blues have scored this season.\n\nAt the time of going to print, seventeen different players have scored this season, with 62% of strikes being scored in the first half of matches, 89% of them being from inside the box and 65% being scored at Ibrox.\n\nThe average time for a goal scored by the Light Blues this season has been in the 54th minute of matches, with 21% of the total goals scored being within the last ten minutes of games.\n\nIt’s a pretty even split in terms of which foot we’ve scored the most, with 53% scored by the right boot and we’ve had 13% of goals scored from a header.\n\nHere’s the selection that the fans have had to choose from this season to find the best scored by the Gers this season.\n\nTHIS VOTE IS NOW CLOSED\n\nJAMES TAVERNIER – KILMARNOCK\n\nFrom a free-kick 30 yards from goal, Tavernier curled the ball up and over the wall into the postage stamp spot in the top right-hand corner of the net just beyond the reach of Killie keeper Jamie MacDonald, who managed to get a hand to ball as it flew in.\n\nNIKO KRANJCAR – LINFIELD\n\nCroatian midfielder Kranjcar created a moment of magic by himself against old friends Linfield, picking the ball up 25 yards out, side-stepping his marker and rifling the ball into the top left corner leaving goalkeeper Roy Carroll only able to watch it on the way back out of the net.\n\nKENNY MILLER – INVERNESS CALEY THISTLE\n\nFor this strike, Kenny Miller acrobatically finished off a cross from Lee Wallace on the left with an excellent, cleanly struck, volley into net his 100th goal for Rangers. The finish left Inverness keeper Owain Fon Williams helpless as Miller’s volley flew into the back of the net.\n\nJOE DODOO – PARTICK THISTLE\n\nDodoo expertly converted a looping pass from Kenny Miller to level the match in the 81st minute. The finish left Thistle keeper Thorsten Stuckmann helpless as Dodoo’s volley flew into the back of the net and brought Rangers back into the match.\n\nMARTYN WAGHORN – HAMILTON\n\nMartyn Waghorn expertly converted a Jason Holt cross with a high looping header from the edge of the box into the top corner which left the Hamilton keeper rooted to the spot.\n\nEMERSON HYNDMAN – HEARTS\n\nGrabbing his second goal for the Light Blues a week after bagging his first against Motherwell, Hyndman scored this excellent half volley. A James Tavernier corner from the right was sent into the box and parried clear by the keeper as far as the young American and he rifled home high into the net with his left foot.\n\nCLINT HILL – CELTIC\n\nA goal that probably doesn’t need a description as it’ll be remembered for a long time by the Gers fans watching worldwide. Trailing 1-0 to a goal scored by Stuart Armstrong, the Gers pushed forward and a low drive from Emerson Hyndman was parried by Craig Gordon. Clint Hill was live to the loose ball at the back post and hammered home before celebrating inside the goal with Kenny Miller.\n\nKENNY MILLER – ABERDEEN\n\nWith just ten minutes remaining and the scores locked at 0-0 away to Aberdeen in the cauldron that is Pittodrie, Kenny Miller sprung to life and began a four minute salvo that led to a 3-0 win. Martyn Waghorn had a chance saved by Joe Lewis and Miller latched onto the loose ball and rattled high into the top corner from a tight angle.",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nBucks-Wizards Preview\n\nBy TAYLOR BECHTOLD\n\nPosted Dec 05 2013 4:01PM Though it's been a while since the Washington Wizards had a winning record, a date with the lowly Milwaukee Bucks could help them get there. The surging Wizards look to move above .500 for the first time in four years Friday night when they host a Milwaukee team looking to avoid its eighth straight road loss. John Wall was a freshman at Kentucky when Washington opened the 2009-10 season by winning two of its first three games. That's the last time the franchise has been above .500, as the Wizards have gone 105-222 since. Although they appeared to be on their way to yet another losing season during a 2-7 start, the Wizards turned things around by winning seven of nine. \"These guys lost a lot of games last year,\" said center Marcin Gortat, who was acquired from Phoenix in October. \"Everybody's excited we're finally winning.\" Without top scorer Bradley Beal, Trevor Ariza had 24 points on 8-of-9 shooting and Wall finished with 16 points and 13 assists in Monday's 98-80 victory over Orlando that got the Wizards (9-9) to the break-even mark with their fifth straight home win. Beal, averaging 20.6 points, is expected to miss at least another week after sitting out five games because of a leg injury. Ariza has stepped up since Beal went down, averaging 17.8 points and hitting 14 of 29 from 3-point range. \"It's just something we knew we could do. We're not satisfied,\" Ariza said. \"We want to continue this winning thing, make it a tradition around here.\" The Wizards have improved on the defensive end, giving up 94.8 points per game on 44.6 percent shooting in the last nine. They gave up an average of 104.6 points and allowed opponents to shoot 48.3 percent over the first nine contests. Washington should be able to continue that defensive effort against a Milwaukee team that ranks near the bottom of the NBA in scoring (90.3) and field-goal percentage (41.7). The league-worst Bucks (3-15), who have lost 13 of 14, shot 39.6 percent from the field in Wednesday's 105-98 loss to visiting Detroit. Ersan Ilyasova has missed seven games because of injuries, including a sore ankle, but he was a bright spot with a season-high 22 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. \"It's the first time I feel healthy. My ankle is getting better,\" said Ilyasova, who has averaged 17.3 points and 9.0 rebounds in his last three meetings with the Wizards. \"We have to find a way to play much better. We have to come together and find a way to win games.\" O.J. Mayo, averaging a team-high 14.8 points, finished with seven on 2-of-8 shooting. He's played well in recent meetings with Washington, scoring 20.3 per game and shooting 24 of 48 in his last three. Mayo led the Bucks with 21 points and hit a tying 3-pointer with 6.9 seconds left to force overtime in a 100-92 loss to visiting Washington on Nov. 27. Gortat had a season-high 25 points on 11-of-12 shooting and eight rebounds, while Wall scored 19 and Martell Webster added 18 for the Wizards. Washington has won the last three meetings.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

When the game was on the line, he was happy with what he saw. Khris Middleton scored a career-high 29 points and Brandon Knight added 20 as the Bucks beat the Wizards 109-105 in overtime. Washington went 0 for 6 from the field in the extra period. \"I thought they did a really good job, particularly defensively in overtime,\" Drew said. \"I think they really locked in.\" John Henson had 19 points and 17 rebounds for the Bucks (4-15), who had lost 13 of their previous 14. \"It was huge,\" Middleton said of the win. \"We've been struggling all season so far and just to gut out a win like this in overtime is good.\" John Wall scored 30 points and Trevor Ariza added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Washington. With the score tied at 102 heading to the extra period, Hensen's jumper put the Bucks ahead in the opening minute and Ersan Ilyasova layup made it 106-102 with 3:12 to go. Ariza was fouled and made three free throws with 42.8 seconds left to pull the Wizards within one. Knight answered with a jumper with 21.1 seconds left and added a free throw 12 seconds later to seal the win and avenge Washington's overtime win last week in Milwaukee. \"I think we've given away a lot of wins,\" Knight said. \"We've gifted a lot of teams this year.\" Washington (9-10) had won two straight and missed chance to go over the .500 mark for the first time in four years \"Somebody on this team has got to become the leader that doesn't allow these things to happen,\" Wizards coach Randy Wittman said. \"I went into the locker room to talk to them before the game. It was carefree unlike the last two weeks. ... I told our guys when we walked out we could be in a little trouble tonight. Washington went 0 for 6 from the field in overtime. The Wizards, who trailed by 13 at halftime, rallied and led by five after Wall's jumper with 43 seconds left in regulation. Middleton's jumper cut the lead to three and, after a miss by Wall, Knight's 3-pointer with 15.1 seconds left tied the score at 102. Washington's Chris Singleton missed a corner three as regulation ended. \"First half we played bad. Second half we had a chance to win it,\" Wall said. \"The last 40 seconds we didn't execute. What we're supposed to do to get stops. Washington lost Martel Webster to a sprained left ankle at the end of the first quarter and Nene (right knee tendinitis) in the third quarter. Washington chipped away at Milwaukee's lead in the third quarter as Ariza's 3 made pulled the Wizards to 78-74 heading to the fourth. The Wizards took an 85-84 lead on a driving dunk by Trevor Booker with 8:21 left and the teams traded the lead for the next several minutes. Drew called timeout during the first minute shortly after Washington's Marcin Gortat was fouled going to the basket. \"The first defensive play of the game we had a breakdown and that is just not acceptable and I felt it important to burn a timeout to let these guys know that we're going to do it the right way,\" Drew said. \"There can't be those type of breakdowns early in the game. It caught their attention.\" Washington forward Otto Porter Jr., the No. 3 overall pick in the June draft, made his NBA debut. Sidelined since September with a hip flexor, the former Georgetown star entered at the start the second quarter and played nearly 13 minutes, going 0 for 3 from the field with two rebounds. On the night the Wizards gained Porter, they played most of the game without Webster and the stretch run without Nene. As the first quarter ended, Webster missed a long 3. When he landed, he went to the floor. In obvious pain and holding his left ankle, he had to be assisted to the dressing room. The Wizards announced Webster had a sprained left ankle and he didn't return. The shot 14 for 21 in the first quarter and built a 42-33 lead early in the second. Washington closed to 42-40 on a jumper by Nene, but the Bucks went on a 15-1 run, capped by Nate Wolters' baseline drive late in the quarter, and led 56-43 at halftime. \"We came out and played like it's a pickup game in the first half,\" Wittman said. \"That's where we lost the game.\" Middleton had 20 of his points on 7-for-11 shooting in the first half. NOTES: Milwaukee was without F Caron Butler (sore left knee) and C Zaza Pachulia (sprained right foot). ... C Kevin Seraphin (sore right knee) was out for the Wizards. ... Bucks G-F Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA's youngest player, turned 19 Thursday and scored six points. ... Wall and Wittman were whistled for technical fouls in the second quarter.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Update: In the time since this article was posted, Snail Games released a statement via Facebook confirming that the mention of Dark and Light being \"a p2p game\" was, in fact, a miscommunication. Dark and Light will be a buy-to-play title, but there will be no subscription.\n\nIt was previously announced that Snail Games might pursue a buy-to-play business model for Dark and Light, as well as Age of Wushu 2. At the time, it was unconfirmed. Yesterday, however, a Reddit user posted a screenshot of Snail Games Associate Producer Horsejoke confirming that the game would be buy-to-play in a Discord message.\n\nFurthermore, in a now-removed comment on the official Facebook page, it was stated that the game will be pay-to-play. 2p managed to capture a screenshot before it was removed, which you can see below.\n\n2p also notes that Snail Games is aiming to launch a Beta in late October or early November and that an official website should be ready by the end of this month.\n\nMatt's Take:\n\nIt's quite interesting to see that Snail Games might be going the box fee plus subscription route for Dark and Light in the West. Subscription games are widely recognized as being on the decline and all of their games up until now have been free-to-play, albeit Age of Wushu offers an optional subscription. With the focus on PvP and other player interactions, this may very well be the way to go, but it remains to be seen if the game can drum up enough hype to be successful, should it, in fact, opt for such a high barrier to entry. For the time being, I'm skeptical about whether the confirmation of a subscription model was intentional, as the comment was removed. Until there is further confirmation, we should all keep in mind that there may have been a miscommunication involving the terms \"buy-to-play\" and \"pay-to-play.\"",
  "latent_27651": "Jeffrey Duncan Jones (born September 28, 1946) is an American character actor best known for his roles as Emperor Joseph II in Amadeus (1984), Edward R. Rooney in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Charles Deetz in Beetlejuice (1988), and A. W. Merrick in Deadwood (2004–2006).[2][3] His career started in Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota and advanced to London and Broadway. In film and television, Jones has had many roles which capitalized on his deadpan portrayal of characters in unusual situations, often to comic effect. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance in Amadeus and a Screen Actors Guild Award as part of the ensemble cast of Deadwood. [4][5]\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nAfter graduating from the Putney School in 1964, Jones enrolled at Lawrence University as a premed student, where his performances in university productions brought him to the attention of Tyrone Guthrie, who recruited him for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[6] He then went to London in 1969 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, followed by a three-year stint with the Stratford Theatre in Stratford, Ontario.[7]\n\nHis stage career included more than 125 productions, starting with the Guthrie Theater, then internationally in South America, Canada, and London,[8] and ultimately in New York's Broadway theatre, appearing with Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken, David Bowie and Meryl Streep. Productions included, Cloud 9, A Flea in Her Ear, Romeo and Juliet and The Elephant Man. His transition from stage to film began in 1970.[6]\n\nFilm and television career [ edit ]\n\nJones began acting in small parts in film and television in the 1970s. In his best-known roles as Emperor Joseph II in Amadeus, Charles Deetz in Beetlejuice, and Edward R. Rooney in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, his dead-pan expression and distinctive face bring a comic flavor to his characters through their reactions to the situations in which they find themselves, more so than the wit in their scripted lines.[6] The New York Times' biographic profile says of Jones, \"Although he has tried to steer clear of playing only sinister roles, the actor's imposing height, bugged-out eyes, easy sneer, and shock of reddish-blond hair give him vaguely devilish features that have prompted villain typecasting. However, the actor is also widely respected and considered a boon wherever he appears.\" The profile describes his portrayals variously as a \"hissable, cartoonish high school principal\" in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a \"good-natured father\" in Beetlejuice, \"an interplanetary freedom fighter\" in Mom and Dad Save the World, a \"demon stand-in\" in Stay Tuned, \"evil bespectacled twins\" in Out on a Limb, plus other personae in a variety of other roles.[8]\n\nAmadeus [ edit ]\n\nMiloš Forman cast Jones as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Amadeus (1984), an adaptation of the Peter Shaffer play of the same name, upon seeing his work in the Lucille Lortel Theatre production of Cloud 9.[9][10] Critic James Berardinelli noted that Jones portrayed the Emperor \"as a superficial and self-absorbed ruler who can't tell the difference between a great opera and a mediocre one\".[11] Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the performance, citing the film's most memorable line, when the Emperor complains of Die Entführung aus dem Serail that \"there are too many notes\".[12] Jones' work earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.[13]\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off [ edit ]\n\nJones' performance as Edward R. Rooney in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) made him a cultural icon.[6][14] Rooney, self-important and obsessed with catching the chronically truant Ferris Bueller, became a symbol of pomposity and authoritarian hatefulness. The New York Times' review characterized Jones' performance as having \"fine cartoon like ferocity\", wherein his character \"gets scratched, bitten, attacked by ferocious dogs and covered with mud while pursuing his weaker, but craftier prey, and emerges each time bruised but undaunted, thinking up some new (and futile) plan.\" The review likened Jones' role as akin to that of Wile E. Coyote as a character who is fated to be unable to catch The Road Runner (Ferris Bueller).[15] Jones expressed concern about being remembered more for this role than for Amadeus. He further said, regarding the film's premise, \"What's amazing about Ferris Bueller, is that we're asked to, and do, sympathise with a kid whose only complaint in life is that his sister got a car for her birthday and he got a computer.\"[16]\n\nBeetlejuice [ edit ]\n\nIn the horror comedy film Beetlejuice (1988), Jones and Catherine O'Hara portrayed a married couple (Charles and Delia Deetz) who unwittingly become co-owners of a haunted house. To highlight this couple's status as bores, director Tim Burton cast Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet to appear as their guests at a dinner party, at which the ghosts of the previous owners cause everyone to sing \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\".[17] Jones further collaborated with Burton on the films Sleepy Hollow (1998) and Ed Wood (1994), in which he portrays The Amazing Criswell.\n\nOther films [ edit ]\n\nJones played Dr. Walter Jenning in the George Lucas film Howard the Duck (1986).[18] He portrayed Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes spoof film Without a Clue (1988). In The Hunt for Red October (1990), he played ex-submarine commander Skip Tyler, who identifies the Red October's propulsion system to Alec Baldwin's Jack Ryan. He also appeared as real life figure Thomas Putnam in The Crucible (1996). As lumber mogul Joe Potter, Jones was the primary antagonist of the Eddie Murphy comedy Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001).\n\nTelevision roles [ edit ]\n\nOne of Jones' earliest television roles was in an episode of the short-lived CBS series Sara (1976). He showcased his villain persona as the sinister Mister Acme (owner of Acme Toxic Waste) in the satirical comedy miniseries Fresno (1986), starring Carol Burnett, Charles Grodin and Dabney Coleman. For Disney, Jones hosted the 1987 D-TV Monster Hits musical special (as the Magic Mirror) and later co-starred with Tyra Banks, Kathy Najimy and Kevin Pollak in the video storyline portion of the Walt Disney World attraction ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, a staple of Tomorrowland from 1995 to 2003. He has had guest roles on a number of television series, including Amazing Stories, Tales from the Crypt and Batman: The Animated Series.[7] He was the star of another short-lived CBS program: sitcom The People Next Door (1989), portraying a cartoonist whose imagination could make things come to life.[8]\n\nJones' most prominent television role is that of newspaper publisher A. W. Merrick on the acclaimed HBO drama series Deadwood (2004–2006).[19] Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine referred to both Jones and the character of Merrick as \"peversely appropriate additions\" to the program, further citing Merrick as its \"secular soul\".[20] Along with the ensemble cast, Jones was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[21]\n\nLater career [ edit ]\n\nSubsequent to his legal troubles,[22] Jones has become progressively less active as a performer. Following his appearance in the golf comedy Who's Your Caddy? (2007), he was absent from film and television for several years. He returned with an uncredited cameo as Collier's editor Charles Colebaugh in the Emmy-nominated HBO original film Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012), followed by the supporting role of scientist Gladstone in the independent disaster film 10.0 Earthquake (2014). Jones' most recent screen credit is a fictional characterization of himself in the short film 7 Days (2016).[23]\n\nIn May 2015, Jones had a minor success with the New American Theatre production of 63 Trillion, directed by Steve Zuckerman. The Los Angeles Times praised his portrayal of financial adviser Dick as having \"malevolent gusto that Satan himself might envy.\"[24][25] He returned to the stage in March 2018, portraying ailing patriarch Bradley in a production of the A. R. Gurney play The Cocktail Hour, staged at the Annenberg Theater in the Palm Springs Art Museum.[26][27]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nJones was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Ruth (née Schooley) and Douglas Bennett Jones. His mother was an art historian, who urged him towards a career in acting. His father died during Jones's childhood.[28][29]\n\nOne interviewer found Jones to value anonymity and the enjoyment of everyday tasks, like home repairs, and found him to be uninterested in status symbols and fan adulation. In that 1989 interview, Jones pointed out that greater public recognition actually makes it more difficult to transition between roles and allow the character to come to the fore and the actor to recede from view.[6]\n\nJones has one son, actor Julian Coutts,[1][30] whose mother was Lloy Coutts (1941–2008), a respected Canadian voice coach. She and Jones met in Stratford, Ontario.[31]\n\nLegal troubles [ edit ]\n\nIn 2002, Jones was arrested for possession of child pornography and accused by a 17-year-old boy of soliciting him to pose for nude photographs.[32] He pleaded no contest to a felony charge of soliciting a minor, as the boy was 14 when the offense first occurred.[33] At the same time, the misdemeanor charge of possession of child pornography was dropped. His attorney emphasized that there was no allegation of improper physical contact. His punishment was five years probation, counseling, and the requirement to register as a sex offender.\n\nJones was arrested twice for failing to update his sex offender status, in Florida (2004)[35] and in California (2010).[36] Jones' record became the subject of community complaint during production of Who's Your Caddy? (2007) in Aiken, South Carolina. Upon learning of his involvement, locals insisted that the public should have been alerted, considering that families were being invited to visit the set.[37]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nOther works [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1995 Bombmeister[39] The Bombmeister Interactive movie (unreleased) 1995 ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter L.C.

  "latent_27666": "For the past 20 years, municipal elections in York West have been foregone conclusions, but with an embattled incumbent and a changing ward, 2014 is shaping up to be different.\n\nCouncillor Giorgio Mammoliti has represented the area for the past 24 years, first as an MPP in the Bob Rae government, and then as a councillor since before amalgamation in Toronto.\n\nMr. Mammoliti took on one of the most prominent roles in Mayor Rob Ford's inner circle. As a member of the cabinet-like executive committee, the Ward 7 councillor would give mayoral allies the thumbs up or down on key motions at council. Much like Councillor Doug Ford, he also attacked the mayor's opponents or defended the agenda as needed.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDespite his long tenure and high profile, Mr. Mammoliti's most memorable City Hall moments have little to do with the ward he represents. Remember the pitch to create a red-light district on Toronto Island?\n\nMore recently, the councillor became the subject of a police investigation related to an $80,000 fundraiser the city's Integrity Commissioner deemed to have violated council's code of conduct. Lobbyists, developers and contractors paid $500 each to attend the red carpet affair. Mr. Mammoliti also received $275,000 in loans from developers, which he argues are of a personal nature and have no bearing on his conduct as a councillor. He faces five non-criminal charges in an ongoing court case related to his 2010 campaign finances.\n\nMr. Mammoliti dismissed the concerns in an interview. \"I don't have anything to worry [about] with my integrity,\" he said, adding that he is limited in what he can say about the allegations that are before the courts.\n\nHe referred to the investigations and legal challenges as a \"well-orchestrated manoeuvre by many organizations and professionals\" who disagree with what he is doing at City Hall.\n\nThe incumbent is running on a platform of lower taxes, stopping the Finch LRT to pursue a subway, and advocating for seniors.\n\nAfter a night of canvassing, he expressed characteristic confidence about his election chances.\n\n\"It's going really well. I would actually say it's going better than 2010,\" he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThroughout it all, Mr. Mammoliti has defied his critics, and consistently denied wrongdoing for his alleged indiscretions.\n\nThe barrage of controversies creates an opportunity for the seven candidates challenging the councillor. Recent polls, albeit with small sample sizes and large margins of error, suggest the race could be more competitive than 2010. Challenger Nick Di Nizio, who finished second in the previous council race, is in a statistical tie with Mr. Mammoliti, according to two polls. This is significant given that, over the past three elections, incumbents won more than 90 per cent of the time. Mr. Mammoliti won in 2006 by 33 percentage points, and in 2010 by 14.\n\n\"The ward needs change,\" Mr. Di Nizio said.\n\nDriving through the ward, the candidate pointed to flower pots placed in an industrial area by the Emery Village BIA as wasteful spending.\n\n\"Someone has to water those,\" he said, calling it a sign of misplaced priorities.\n\nAmong his top issues, Mr. Di Nizio said the ward needs more services for a growing population of seniors, and that a shortage of grocery stores is a concern.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"We don't have any grocery stores here,\" save for one No Frills, a Food Basics, and a Centra Foods. \"We've got seniors who can't drive, they have to get a ride from a friend,\" he said.\n\nBordered by Humber Valley to the west, Jane Street to the east, and the 401 to the south, Ward 7 saw a lot of development in the 1960s and early 1970s as Italian families moved to newly built semi-detached homes and high-rises.\n\nNow, while Italian is the most common language after English, many residents speak Spanish, Vietnamese and Punjabi at home. It indicates a changing community – 62 per cent of residents are from outside Canada – that comes with its own set of challenges.\n\nHousehold income is 28-per-cent lower than the city average, and residents are 34-per-cent less likely to have a postsecondary degree. In the most recently available census data, unemployment was one third higher than the city average. Accessibility is a concern too: While two highways go through the ward, the area is poorly served by transit.\n\nBus service standards and crowding were made worse in the 2012 budget. As council candidate Keegan Henry-Mathieu rides the Finch bus at 3:30 p.m., riders are packed like sardines, and for Mr. Henry-Mathieu, the Finch LRT cannot come soon enough.\n\nWalking through the Chalkfarm towers, which house many low-income tenants, Mr. Henry-Mathieu's campaign manager, Claire McWatt, pointed out the number of balconies on which the front wheel of a bicycle pops over the ledge. She explained that although the community was built for cars, a lot of residents cannot afford one. This is made worse by a lack of bike infrastructure, both bike lanes to get around, and secure places to store them.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Henry-Mathieu, who secured the Labour Council endorsement, is a long shot to win the ward, and polls around 10 per cent. But he hopes change will come soon. Walking through a playground, he pointed out basketball backboards with missing hoops. He explained that Mr. Mammoliti had them taken down for fear that they would attract drug dealers.\n\n\"Some kind of sports just need a bit of supervision, and I think basketball is one of them,\" the councillor said.\n\n\"For one reason or another, [basketball hoops] seem to attract the wrong crowd outside,\" Mr. Mammoliti said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"What I've heard loud and clear is that nobody is playing outdoor basketball any more, they seem to be selling drugs,\" Mr. Mammoliti said – a claim, he added, that he heard from the local police division.\n\nHe said that at least one of the basketball courts has been replaced with outdoor ball hockey, which has made it safer for families.\n\nMr. Henry-Mathieu contends that the community – which has produced some of Canada's best basketball players – needs a diversity of sports and places for kids to play. He explained that local kids find a way to make use of the backboard, creating their own game in which hitting parts of the backboard get different point values.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"They make do with what they have.\"",
  "latent_27696": "Share\n\nHBO appears to be plenty excited for its new adult-themed animated series from Duplass Brothers Television, Animals. After acquiring the show at Sundance this year from the TV arm of indie film darlings Mark and Jay Duplass’ production company, the network announced today the series will premiere on February 5, with a second season already set to air before the show even launches, according to Deadline.\n\nCreated by Phil Matarese and Mike Luciano, the series focuses on the unsung squatters in “Earth’s least-habitable environment: New York City,” including rats, pigeons, and even bedbugs. HBO claims the comedy will explore the intricacies of the creatures’ surprisingly complicated lives, touching on themes like moral ambiguity, gender identity, mid-life crisis, and other decidedly human themes, from the deep to the inane, via comical small talk.\n\nAnimals garnered critical clout in January after showing two completed episodes at the special events section of the festival, according to the report. HBO appeared to waste no time in wooing the show’s creators, announcing in May that the network was laying down enough runway for two full seasons at the get-go.\n\nIt’s unclear how many episodes each season will run, but Deadline expects that the creators’ original plan for 10 episodes each season will likely be the blueprint. That would definitely fit into HBO’s usual format, following the same pattern as other quirky comedies from the network like Veep, and Silicon Valley — though both of those series began with just eight episodes for their first season run.\n\nSundance has been good to the Duplass brothers as of late, as the filmmakers also inked a deal with Netflix at the festival this year which includes four small-budget movies to be produced exclusively for the site.\n\nAnimals will premiere on HBO and its streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now beginning February 5 at 11:30 p.m. EST.",

  "latent_27730": "Will it be enough to persuade the House Republicans from high-taxed states?\n\nThe House GOP decided to wait a day to release its tax reform bill to smooth out some disagreements. That plan was finally released Thursday and like the framework President Donald Trump’s administration released, it reduces the number of tax brackets, eliminates deductions, and reduces the corporate tax rate.\n\nBut will it be enough to persuade the House Republicans from high-taxed states to pass the bill?\n\nFor Individuals\n\nThe plan outlines five tax brackets instead of seven. The framework touted three, but I guess it didn’t stick:\n\nZero\n\n12%\n\n25%\n\n35%\n\n39.6% for high-income Americans\n\nThat top rate will become “the income threshold for that rate to $1 million for married couples.”\n\nThey did not release the incomes for the other brackets, though.\n\nYou can still write off property taxes, but that deduction caps out at $10,000. The mortgage-interest deduction will remain, but only applies for “newly purchased homes up to $500,000.” It looks like they will do away with deductions for state and local taxes, which is likely to be problematic for representatives from high-taxed states.\n\nBest news: Despite the threats, the 401(k) plans remain untouched.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit goes up to $1,600 from $1,000 and “creates a $300 credit for expenses related to care of parents and non-child dependents, and it preserves the child and dependent care credit and the earned income tax credit.”\n\nThe alternative minimum tax goes away, but unfortunately the Estate Tax remains in place…until 2024! From The Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe estate tax provisions also contain wrinkles. The estate-tax exemption, set for $5.6 million per person and $11.2 million per married couple, would double immediately. The tax would get repealed starting in 2024. Even after repeal, heirs would continue to get something known as a “step-up in basis.” That means they would only owe capital-gains taxes on the difference between the sales price of an asset they inherit and the value of the asset at the previous owner’s death. Previous versions of estate-tax repeal had limited that benefit.\n\nCorporations\n\nThe bill lowers the corporate tax code from 35% to 20%. Pass-through businesses like S corporations and partnerships will receive the 25% rate Republicans promised, but the standard will change for them. WSJ continued:\n\nThe bill starts with the presumption that 70% of that pass-through income is attributable to labor and would be taxable at higher individual income-tax rates. For some that would create a blended top tax rate of about 35%, which those businesses and their influential trade groups may argue isn’t low enough. For professional services firms, including lawyers and financial-services professionals, the default rate would be 100% labor income, meaning they would get none of the benefit of the 25% tax rate for pass-through businesses.\n\nThe tax code for multinational companies will include changes, some of which appear to veer away from the promises of the administration and top GOP leaders:\n\nTo prevent companies from shifting profits abroad, the bill creates a new 10% tax on U.S. companies’ high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis. The plan also imposes new restrictions on foreign companies operating in the U.S. They would face a tax of up to 20% on payments they make abroad from their U.S. operations. That is designed to prevent them from loading up their U.S. operations with deductions and pushing profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Companies could lower those taxes by agreeing to have more of their operations in the U.S. tax system.\n\nTop conservative groups lashed out at this development:",
  "latent_27759": "Infantile skittishness on campus is not confined to just politically correct and so-called diversity issues, as bad as that is. As a recent Wall Street Journal article pointed out, college students are now literally flooding mental-health centers on campus year round for anything and everything.\n\nAt Ohio State University, a clinical psychologist holds a well-attended 'Beating Anxiety' workshop twice a week. To defuse anxiety, the students are advised to exercise, get more sleep, and refrain from \"catastrophic thoughts\" brought about things like an upcoming physics exam or if my friend doesn't text me back right away, does he/she does not like me anymore?\n\nIt gets worse.\n\n\"On the same day as the 'Beat Anxiety' workshop at Ohio State, the counseling center also put on its third annual \"Recess\" event. On a grassy lawn, there are tents where students can make balloon animals, blow bubbles and play with therapy dogs and a large colorful parachute. This event is designed to help students relieve stress and introduce them to the counseling center services and staff in a fun way.\"\n\nIf you're like me, you're probably puzzled by this childish display and horrified to think that these people are allowed to vote. But the last line in the above quote might be the true reason for this \"Recess\" -- that is, it's to drum up business for the counseling infrastructure that is growing like topsy at colleges and universities across the nation.\n\nAnd growing it is. The Journal reports that Ohio State has seen a 43% jump in the past five years in the number of students being treated at the university's counseling center. To handle this surge in demand, 12 additional staff members were hired, bringing the total providing clinical services to 65.\n\nAnd please don't think Ohio State is an outlier. The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) experienced a 36% increase in demand for counseling service in the last seven years. At the University of Central Florida (Orlando), the increase has been a whopping 12% increase each year for the past ten years.\n\nA 2016 survey by the American College Health Association found that 17% of college students were diagnosed with or treated for anxiety problems during the past year, and nearly 14% were diagnosed with or treated for depression.\n\nAnd speaking of demand for counseling services, don't think that this trend will not manifest itself more strongly than ever in mandated health insurance policies. Move over cancer and heart disease; make room for anxiety and depression counseling -- the Snowflakes are here.\n\nWhat accounts for this trend on campus?\n\nThe counseling 'experts' say that more students are coming to college with long psychiatric histories. (Oh brother!) And then there' are reasons like the economy, the cost of college, student debt, social media, and \"a so-called helicopter parenting style that doesn't let adolescence experience failure\" that is creating anxiety in the students.\n\nWhatever the reason, the Snowflakes are descending on our colleges and universities like a blizzard in Buffalo. Laugh at the Snowflakes if you want, but this is not funny. Culture leads politics, and these ever-so-sensitive souls will soon be influencing the path our society follows as their generation replaces the previous generations.\n\nOne can argue that a process akin to natural selection will see to it that only the more robust among the current college generation will rise to leadership positions. I say yes and no.\n\nFirst off, we live in a democratic republic. This means votes count. Do you think America would have disgraced itself with the election of the likes of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and maybe now Hillary Clinton if much of the voter bases hadn't already been dumbed down and corrupted starting in 1960s? To one degree or another, the Snowflakes will help decide who gets elected, and their bias will always be towards softness, accommodation, wishful thinking, and avoiding conflict and difficult choices at all cost.\n\nSecondly, it may be true that Snowflakes are not likely to rise to the pinnacle of leadership. But we have to realize that there are many thousands of leadership positions scattered throughout society, not just the high-visibility ones seen in the media. All organizations and institutions have leadership positions within them at various levels. And there, many a college-educated Snowflake will be imbedded with his/her ingrained outlook on life. That cannot help but affect things.\n\nThe question I cannot answer is this: Are the Snowflakes a harbinger of what lies in store for America, or will they be melted by the reality of life and thus mature and grow up so as to function as responsible citizens in a representative republic?",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may remember a while back we reported that Hello Games were being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority due to claims of Hello Games misleading gamers with the marketing of No Man’s Sky on Steam. The investigation looked into a wide array of claims including; not being able to find the creatures depicted in the game, the game’s graphics, the speed of the warp in No Man’s Sky, the ability to “Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits” and No Man’s Sky’s factions system. The results are now in and, as you can tell from the title, the ASA have ruled that Hello Games did not mislead gamers with No Man’s Sky’s marketing. Let’s break down each claim made against Hello Games, and what the ASA ruled.\n\nNOT ENCOUNTERING WHAT WAS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHello Games Response\n\nHello Games [from now on will be abbreviated to HG] explained to the ASA that due to the game being procedurally generated the probability of finding what was depicted in the ad would be very unlikely. HG explained that “as each user’s experience would be very different, it would be difficult to recreate the exact scenes from the ad”. HG also “noted that some elements were rarer than others; for instance, the larger the scale of a space battle, the more unusual it was, which they believed was to be expected because it made for a more rewarding experience.”\n\nASA\n\nThe ASA ruled that because the summary of No Man’s Sky “made clear that it was procedurally generated”, it was expected that players would understand any video or images used in the marketing of the game would be “representative” of the gameplay they would encounter but not necessarily the same as the gameplay they would encounter. The ASA also “acknowledged Hello Games’ assertion that the larger battles were more unusual, and noted the footage they provided of a materially similar type of battle”. Essentially HG provided footage of a space battle similar, but not the same as, the one shown in the trailer.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nHello Games Response\n\n“HG stated that the videos in the ad were produced using a gaming PC of average specification (based on the standard shown in Steam’s survey of typical user hardware), above the minimum specification. They said the quality of the graphics shown in the ad was inferior to the graphics the game was capable of exhibiting and was representative of the quality of the graphics of the NMS experienced by an average player. The videos in the ad were recordings of gameplay from the game, and the static images were in-game screenshots. They stated that the videos uploaded to Steam had an original resolution of 1080p and a framerate of 30fps with anti-aliasing. Performance of the game on a gaming PC typical of those used by Steam customers would run at 1080p with 60fps. They noted that post-release updates to the game also provided further visual improvements. They provided screenshots of the game uploaded to a third-party website by a player, which they said illustrated the high visual quality that players were able to achieve.”\n\nASA Ruling\n\nThe ASA made it clear they understood that the graphical output of the game was dependant on the player’s PC and it’s specs, and it was assumed that players would be aware of the specs needed to run No Man’s Sky. Because ad footage had been captured using on a “PC of broadly typical specification for the platform on which the ad appeared”, and videos were uploaded with a lower frame rate from the game itself, it was ruled that the images and footage used on Steam were not misleading.\n\nIN-GAME WARP SPEED VS AD WARP SPEED\n\nHello Games Response\n\nHG explained that there a number of in-game factors which could influence the warp speed for the player. As well as the players hardware, the complexity of the system the player warps to is an issue. Systems that have a higher abundance of planets and wildlife will take a longer time to warp to. “In the video in the ad that featured warping, the player warped to a sparse system with a single planet, one moon, and hardly any life; this took 3 to 5 seconds”. HG confirmed that they had not edited the video in question.\n\nASA Ruling\n\nHG provided footage that showed a warp a couple of seconds longer than the one shown in the ad, but the ASA understood that this was due to the complexity of the system that was warped to. During gameplay the ASA even experienced a warp that lasted 16 seconds. They acknowledged that some players have experienced longer warp times, but stated that as the ad showed general gameplay differences in speed were not considered to be significant. It was ruled that the ad did not mislead in terms of the games warp speed.\n\n“FLY SMOOTHLY FROM DEEP SPACE TO PLANETARY SURFACES, WITH NO LOADING SCREENS”\n\nHello Games Response\n\nHG explained that there were no loading screens involved in flying from deep space in a solar system to the surface of a planet. “They said the environments and characteristics were generated in real time while a player moved through the game, including when they warped between systems, during which time the player could continue to interact with the game.”\n\nASA Ruling\n\nThe ASA explained that they were aware that the warp screen could be considered a loading screen. However, as the warp is used only to travel between solar systems, this was not misleading as it is still possible to travel from deep space to a planet’s surface without a loading screen. The ASA also stated that the warp screen was not a loading screen as it didn’t interrupt the gameplay experience due to it being consistent with the gameplay before and after initiating the warp. The warp is the only thing close to a loading screen in No Man’s Sky, but because it was shown in the ad, the player was therefore aware of it before purchasing and so was not mislead.\n\nFACTIONS VIE FOR TERRITORY\n\nHello Games Response\n\nHG explained that the story relating to the factions would be uncovered as the player explored the universe and interacted with faction-related NPCs. HG went on to say that solar systems were controlled by a single faction, and when interacting with a NPC from a particular faction they would sometimes mention a dislike of the other factions. There was also the chance to partake in battles between factions, and supporting one faction in that fight would increase the player’s reputation with that faction. HG chose the word “vying” as it indicated the ongoing struggle.\n\nASA Ruling\n\nThe ASA understood that consumers would understand that there was more than one faction, with each faction holding a certain territory and some aspects would relate to tensions between the factions. The ASA also understood that players could engage in space battles by siding with one faction during the battle, and that this played a role in the player’s reputation with that faction. Noting the explanation from HG, the ASA ruled that the description did not differ from the relevant gameplay features.\n\nFINAL RULING\n\nThis is the exact quote from the ASA’s post detailing the case against HG. The word “Code” refers to the CAP Code, the guidelines the ASA used to judge the No Man’s Sky ad.\n\n“We understood that the screenshots and videos in the ad had been created using game footage, and acknowledged that in doing this the advertisers would aim to show the product in the best light. Taking into account the above points, we considered that the overall impression of the ad was consistent with gameplay and the footage provided, both in terms of that captured by Hello Games and by third parties, and that it did not exaggerate the expected player experience of the game. We therefore concluded that the ad did not breach the Code”\n\nWhat do you think of this result? Did you feel mislead? Let us know what you think in the comments! Or you can tweet us @games_bulletin and let us know!\n\nAbout the author Ben Robinson I’ve loved video games for as long as I can remember.

When we first started I was, I wouldn’t say worried, I was surprised at how out of shape he was. But he’s been out of the ring for two and a half years. He couldn’t really do a minute with any real intensity without being gassed out.\n\nHe’s surprised with the way I’m training him, with the intensity he’s having to train at because as a heavyweight he’s not going to be throwing as many punches as a super-bantamweight. I’m trying to keep him on his toes. I believe that if I can keep his speed there, his reflexes and head movement, when he has a big robotic guy in front of him, he’ll be able to see the shots a lot more and take his time.\n\nWhat is it he’s come to you for, what are the new things you’re doing with him?\n\nI think every trainer has their way of training fighters. I think him and Adam [Booth] worked well when he was youthful. I think he still would work well but a lot of their training was very ballistic training and his body was just breaking down.\n\nIf you look at the way David fights, he fights very reckless. He has to take risks to negate the distance because he’s fighting bigger guys. To be hitting these guys on the head, around the body, on their elbows, when you’re naturally slightly smaller, it does take that little extra toll.\n\nIt’s not about just getting through training camps for Mark de Mori or Tyson Fury, it’s where you want to go after it and how you want to live your life for the rest of your life. Whether you want to live in pain or in comfort. We’ve taken a more scientific approach, less ballistic training. He’s a naturally explosive guy, he doesn’t need to be jumping and bounding all the time and putting that wear and tear on his joints.\n\nWe’re taking each day as it comes, working on the structure and working on a couple of technical things that he has to brush up on. But I’m not going to change him. Adam Booth laid the foundation and he did a fantastic job. If I can add a couple of things to his game and get him in shape, we’ll see what’s going to come on January 16.\n\nHe’s done all the right corrective excercises to get his body back in shape and it’s just about bringing what I’ve seen in the gym to the table on January 16 against the likes of Mark de Mori.\n\nHow many times do you see him fighting in 2016?\n\nHe wants to fight two or three times a year. If the right fights are there then he’ll do it. I believe he doesn’t need to have too many comeback fights.\n\nIt’s not a rushed decision, we’ll take each fight as it comes. David’s a very smart guy, he’s a very shrewd guy. He’s got his plans. There’s the Anthony Joshua fight out there, which is a massive fight for both parties and I’m not sure if they’ll take it in the first 12 months, maybe 12-16 months we’re looking at that. But we’ll be ready.\n\nIs Joshua the ultimate target?\n\nI’ve seen [Haye] sparring Deontay Wilder, I’ve seen the footage. Widler’s probably improved a little bit since then. I’m not sure. When you’ve got those 10 ounce gloves on anything can happen with these big guys. That’s a fight that’s definitely out there. Widler’s there, Joshua’s there.\n\nTyson Fury, I don’t know if he’ll be happy to train for another camp on that. But there are lots of exciting fights out there. What’s more, the heavyweight division has been so boring for the last 10 years… It’s about time they got the most exciting person back.\n\nIt’s only going to add for exciting fights down the line.\n\nDe Mori’s number seven with the WBA and we’re looking to get world titles back.",
  "latent_28166": "Tasker is the most comprehensive automation app for Android, but it can be a little complicated to set up, especially for beginners. This article will explore five apps that will give you alternative means to automate actions on your Android device.\n\n1. MacroDroid\n\nMacroDroid features a more modern design than all the other apps on this list with an equally feature-rich experience, so that’s something you might want to consider when choosing a Tasker alternative. On the other hand, it offers a limited number of tasks and shows ads in its free version, but you can upgrade to pro for $3.49 if you desire to remove the limits and ads. You can get started with the app by clicking the “Add Macro” button on the homepage and selecting triggers for the actions you want to be performed. You can also set up optional constraints which determine the conditions which macros are allowed to run. It’s a really good app as evidenced by its 4.5 rating on the Play Store and it’s also regularly updated.\n\n2. Condi\n\nCondi takes a straight-forward approach to automating tasks on your device. Once you install the app, you are immediately directed to the homepage where you can create new tasks by clicking the “+” button at the top. In doing so you are presented with a variety of actions to select from, and afterwards, a trigger for your action. Condi allows you to add multiple triggers that must be satisfied before a task is performed but only after the initial creation of the task (as opposed to while creating the task).\n\nNote: Condi has not been updated since 2014.\n\n3. Automate\n\nAutomate is another highly-rated automation app that is very easy to set up for beginners. It uses a flowchart to display the hierarchy of blocks that make up a task which makes it ideal for those familiar with flow diagrams. It has some pre-configured flows which you can edit to see the underlying flow diagram, and you can also download several more community-made scripts as well as make your own.\n\n4. Llama\n\nLlama is a simple Tasker alternative that enables you to set location-based profiles that can trigger certain actions automatically based on your current location. For example, you can set your phone’s ringer to silent while at work and back to normal while at home or open your music player when your headset is connected. Llama uses phone masts (and not GPS) to determine your location, so it will not consume any additional battery power and will still provide a fairly reliable signal, especially if you live in a populated area with plenty of masts. In addition, there is GPS-based tracking and experimental WiFi-based location tracking if the phone mast method does not work well for you. If none of the location-tracking options work for you, you can create time-based profiles instead.\n\nOne thing to note is that Llama has not been updated since 2014.\n\n5. AutomateIt\n\nAutomateIt has the most unconventional layout of the apps on this list, but it’s pretty powerful as you’ll see. Creating a task (called “Rules”) is quite straightforward as you can select triggers and actions one after the other or check the rules market to download from a large selection of rules created by the community that can be applied immediately to your device without any hassle. The free version shows ads and has some restrictions, but you can upgrade to pro for $2.99 to unlock the ad-free unrestricted version.\n\nWrap Up\n\nIf you’ve always wanted to automate your device and found Tasker too complicated for you, try any of these alternative apps. If you prefer Tasker or know any other powerful automation apps for Android, leave a comment and let us know.",

Garry McCarthy said Thursday morning. \"A simple fact: a helpless child should never end up in that condition.\"A forensic artist created the composite sketch from the child's head, which was found along with his or her feet and hands over the weekend. Officials are asking for help in identifying the child, whose gender is not known.\"We're going to need help from the public to make that happen,\" McCarthy said.The Cook County medical examiner's office said the remains belonged to a mixed race child between 2 and 4 years old. The toddler had brown eyes and short, curly black hair. His or her ears were not pierced.\"We do know the dismemberment was post-mortem,\" Supt. McCarthy said. \"We are working with the medical examiner to put the DNA into the system.\"McCarthy said the hope is that maybe the child's DNA will lead to a familial link.The water department is draining the lagoon to search for more remains as officers go door-to-door in the neighborhood. The draining process , which began Tuesday, could take up to five days, officials said.\"We're making good progress,\" Deputy Chief Steve Georgas said.

Refugee Agency tents lining muddy tracks.\n\nMany in this hastily built camp are skilled middle-class Syrian Kurds from urban centers such as Aleppo. They have traveled hundreds of miles to be with fellow Kurds where they can speak their own Kurdish language and freely express their ancient culture.\n\n“Inside the camp, people are getting along perfectly. No problems,” said Abu Heibal, an assistant manager for a tea importer in the ethnically mixed city of Qamishli in northern Syria who fled to Iraq after pro-government gunmen tried to kill him.\n\n“In Qamishli, the army is trying to make trouble between the Kurds, Arabs and Christians.”\n\nThere is little opportunity for ethnic strife in the camp, where the refugees are Kurds. Syrian Arab refugees routinely are shuttled elsewhere, said Faisal Ahmed, a Syrian Kurd who works for the United Nations as a camp registration officer.\n\n“Syrian Arabs go to other cities, like Sulaymaniyah or Erbil. This camp is for [the] Kurdish,” he said.\n\nBarzani’s camp\n\nThe camp is run and financed by the Kurdish Regional Government, led by Massoud Barzani. His government’s largesse has bought the loyalty of many here. His party’s flags adorn many buildings, and refugees openly express their personal support for Mr. Barzani.\n\n“I thank you, Massoud Barzani, and all people of Kurdish Iraq for everything, everything — everything!” Mr. Heibal said.\n\nThat loyalty to Mr. Barzani is important for Turkey, the region’s top trading partner, which has a history of conflict with separatist Turkish Kurds and is increasingly uneasy about Kurdish rebel gains inside Syria.\n\nThe dominant Kurdish faction in Syria, the Democratic Union Party, is tied to Turkey’s archfoe, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which has been fighting for Kurdish self-rule inside Turkey for 28 years in a continuing conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.\n\nEva Savelsberg of the European Center of Kurdish Studies in Berlin said Democratic Union militiamen have increased their activities in recent weeks as they consolidate de facto control over parts of northern Syria.\n\n“This is something that Turkey has major problems with,” she said.\n\nIt is another front in the complex Syrian civil war.\n\nTurkey continues to support the rebel Free Syrian Army, but ethnic Kurds in Syria are distrustful of the predominately Sunni Arab rebels. Clashes between Syrian Kurdish rebels and Sunni Arab militias have erupted over the past several months.\n\nLast year, Mr. Barzani helped create the Syrian Kurdish National Council as a bulwark to the Democratic Union Party, but there is been little progress on forging unity, as the factions remain divided.\n\n“We’ve seen Barzani’s influence in Syria is very limited,” said Hugh Pope of the International Crisis Group in Istanbul.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Barzani’s Iraqi Kurdish Democratic Party, with its flags flying in the Domiz camp, has taken a hard line against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, listed as a terrorist group by the United States, European Union and Turkey.\n\nWith Mr. Barzani’s support, Turkey in recent weeks has ratcheted up airstrikes on suspected bases of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, tucked away in remote mountains on the Iraqi side of the border.\n\nEager trading partners\n\nDespite its uneasiness with an ethnic Kurdish political entity on its borders, Turkey remains an important economic partner for the Kurdish region. It is eagerly trading goods in exchange for hard currency and oil shipments. The Kurdish region has potential oil reserves of about 45 billion barrels, about one-third of the amount in southern Iraq.\n\nThe relationship between Turkey and Iraq’s Kurdish region is a very public one.\n\nTurkey recently sent its foreign minister to visit the Kurdish regional capital of Erbil, Iraqi Kurdish leaders threw a party for Turkish business leaders this month on the anniversary of the founding of the Turkish republic.\n\n“Turkey’s policy of cooperation with Iraqi Kurdistan is not a tactical move, but it reflects a continuing strategy,” said Aydin Selcen, Turkey’s consul-general in the Kurdish region, in a speech to mark the occasion.\n\nDespite the high-level cooperation between the Turkey and Kurds of northern Iraq, many Syrian Kurds were lured to the Domiz camps because they said they felt unwelcome in Turkey.\n\n“Turks don’t accept us, so we came to the Kurdish area,” said Ahmad Ibrahim, a 30-year-old barber who has set up shop in the camp.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Barzani called on Kurdish factions in Syria to cease fighting and work toward a common purpose. Syria’s Kurds, who make up 10 percent of the population, do not have the numbers or clout to hold territory and will need to unify as soon as possible, said Mr. Pope of the International Crisis Group.\n\n“At the end of the day, [Syria’s Kurds] are going to have to come to some sort of deal with whoever rules Syria,” he added. “But in the meantime, they’re trying to consolidate their hold on as much territory as they can get.”\n\nTurkey is trying to control the situation by attempting to stage-manage Syrian rebels and also work with Mr. Barzani, said Mr. Pope. However, he predicted Turkey’s maneuvering will not lead to any lasting solution.\n\n“Turkey is clearly trying to use its relationship with Barzani to mitigate its Kurdish problem and try to get some control over the situation in northern Syria where Kurds are being empowered,” he said.\n\n“Ultimately, it cannot control President Barzani in Iraq, and it has no way of determining the fate of Syria’s Kurds.”\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_28479": "Updated at 5 p.m. Tuesday with additional reaction and background\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling won't run for re-election next year, a decision that continues the reshaping of Republican politics in North Texas.\n\nThe Dallas lawmaker joins Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, as veteran GOP congressmen who are retiring at the end of 2018. It mirrors a trend across the country. According to CNN, at least 11 Republicans have announced they won't seek another term, resigned or are running for another office.\n\nHensarling, 60, has represented the 5th Congressional District since he was elected in November 2002. He chairs the powerful Financial Services Committee and has been a strong voice in regulating the financial industry.\n\n\"Today I am announcing that I will not seek reelection to the US Congress in 2018. Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,\" Hensarling told supporters in a statement.\n\nA staunch constitutional conservative, Hensarling has long believed that Congress was not a place for career politicians. Yet his announcement comes as a surprise to those who felt that he would be in line for more influential leadership posts.\n\nIn an interview with The Dallas Morning News, Hensarling said he was not seeking re-election because of the \"oldest reason in the book:\" family considerations. His children are teenagers and he wants to spend more time with them.\n\nThe Republican added that his term limit as chairman of the Financial Services Committee also provided a good departure point.\n\n\"I didn't come here to make elected office my lifetime avocation,\" he said. \"I've got 14 more months and I've got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nHensarling said his decision was not influenced by the political climate in the GOP, where the rise of President Donald Trump has created friction and some division.\n\n\"Quite the opposite,\" he said. \"I'm rather enjoying it.\"\n\nThe filing period for the March primary starts Nov. 11, leaving potential successors little time to make a decision and start the campaign process. District 5 includes the southeast portion of Dallas County including Mesquite and stretches southeast into Kaufman, Anderson, Henderson and Cherokee counties. The district is reliably Republican, with Trump winning 63 percent of the vote last November.\n\n\"Jeb is leaving Congress on his own terms, and his leadership will be greatly missed,\" said Kevin Brannon, a friend and political consultant who led Hensarling's first campaign for Congress. \"He's admired and respected, and I believe he could have continued to serve for as long as he wanted.\"\n\nHensarling said Tuesday he would spend the rest of his term fighting for the conservative causes that drew him to politics.",
  "latent_28492": "On 11 September 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made headlines for appearing unsteady on her feet before abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial event (a phenomenon later attributed to pneumonia).\n\nTwo hours later, Clinton appeared outside daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment, sparking rumors (along with a hashtag, #HillarysBodyDouble) that political impersonator Teresa Barnwell had “filled in” for the candidate in public later in the day to create a false appearance of renewed vigor.\n\nThe rumor took off on Twitter alongside the aforementioned hashtag, with a number of details appended to the intriguing mystery. Twitter users were confused by Clinton’s seemingly vast medical improvement in the space of two hours and referenced a widely-circulated clip of a visibly recovered of the presidential candidate:\n\nHere is Hillary Clinton leaving Chelsea’s apartment. (A little girl came up to give her a hug) pic.twitter.com/VreSXmT1Yh — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 11, 2016\n\nEven before rumors began flying about Barnwell filling in for Clinton, commenters balked at an apparent lack of Secret Service agents visibly present and an atypical amount of space around the candidate:\n\n@ABCLiz is this a joke? Secret Service would never allow this unless it was staged. No spontaneous actions like this would happen. — Wylde Rhoads (@WyldeRhoads) September 11, 2016\n\nAmong further evidence circulating on Twitter was a screenshot from a post attributed to Barnwell about a particularly intensive gig impersonating Clinton for an event:\n\nHere’s #HillarysBodyDouble @teresa_barnwell claiming she was contracted to double for Hillary last June pic.twitter.com/SVO8SxrNWI — Deplorable (@JaredWyand) September 12, 2016\n\nThe referenced post was legitimate, but it was clear that Barnwell had previously appeared as a political impressionist and not as part of any attempts to trick people into believing she was genuinely Hillary Clinton.\n\nImages circulating under the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag contrasted earlier shots of Clinton with enhanced photographs of her second 11 September 2016 appearance:\n\n#HillarysBodyDouble Clinton’s ‘body double twin’, Teresa Barnwell, 61, earns $1000’s monthly impersonating Hillary pic.twitter.com/Wx36rO58aZ — A World of Truth (@aworldoftruth) September 12, 2016\n\nRumors of #HillarysBodyDouble maybe True! Notice very different noses & subtle hair differences! ??pic.twitter.com/u3rdkuU2GN — Vegas4Trump (@trump2016fan) September 12, 2016\n\nUsers contrasted footage of Clinton at the 9/11 event with photographs of Clinton taken later in the day, not with images of Barnwell specifically. Barnwell shared a photograph of herself on 11 September 2016:\n\nHad a blast today! We were LIVE on Lip Sync Battle! Fight the power! pic.twitter.com/FcYGGeyL54 — Teresa Barnwell (@teresa_barnwell) September 12, 2016\n\nAlthough Barnwell clearly kept busy impersonating Clinton for entertainment purposes, her imperfect resemblance to the former Secretary of State made the conspiracy theory less plausible. Additionally, Barnwell said that she was in Los Angeles that day, not New York City:\n\nOK people, calm down. I was in LA today, all day. Was just messin’ with your crazy conspiracy minded little heads. Go to bed. — Teresa Barnwell (@teresa_barnwell) September 12, 2016\n\nMany speculated that a lack of Secret Service agents in view around the candidate was a clear indicator that the Clinton spotted later that day was an impostor. However, if that unprotected “Hillary Clinton” were seriously wounded or killed by an assassin, it would be impossible for the real Clinton to recover from the subterfuge and go on to win the 2016 election, so the risk of fallout from such a large cover-up would far outweigh the benefits of Clinton’s faking a “body double” reappearance on 11 September 2016.\n\nIt also doesn’t require a denial from Teresa Barnwell to determine she was not the woman depicted in the 11 September 2016 footage of Clinton following her early exit from a 9/11 memorial event. Whether Clinton looked the same in the two photosets is a subjective assessment, but video and photographs of the subsequent appearance reveal a woman who is clearly not Teresa Barnwell. There is no way the two women could be confused for each other, given their clear facial dissimilarities.",
  "latent_28577": "A prominent member of the Oklahoma coaching staff has leveled just about as harsh an accusation as you can make against a football player.\n\nTuesday, OU officials confirmed speculation that Charles Walker had played his last down for the Sooners as the defensive lineman had decided to turn his focus to preparing for the 2017 NFL draft. The defensive lineman had been projected as a possible first-round selection entering the 2016 season.\n\nShortly after the confirmation of Walker’s departure, an obviously-perturbed OU defensive coordinator Mike Stoops blasted Walker for his decision as well as his lack of commitment to the team.\n\n“Quitting on your teammates is hard to take, as a coach,” Stoops, the brother of head coach Bob Stoops, said. “That’s everything we stand for — our commitment to one another and, for whatever reason, that wasn’t there for him. He thought this was a better avenue so you would have to ask him for those (answers). …\n\n“[Y]ou can’t have guys coming and going and have a group of players committed to what they’re doing day in and day out, putting all the time and energy into it. It’s not fair to the players that are on our team if they’re not committed to the team.”\n\nWalker suffered a concussion in the TCU game Oct. 1 and hadn’t played since. That concussion was at least the second one the lineman has suffered in less than 10 months.",
  "latent_28599": "By Lawrence Hurley\n\nWASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday considers whether business owners can object on religious grounds to a provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare law that requires employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control.\n\nIn one of the biggest cases of the year, the nine justices will hear an extended 90-minute oral argument, with the extra 30 minutes the court added to the usual hour-long session hinting at the complexity of the legal issues involved.\n\nThe case pits religious rights against reproductive rights, with a heavy dose of politics added to the mix. A capacity crowd will fill the marble courtroom, with many demonstrators expected outside.\n\nEven the main lawyers in the case, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli for the Obama administration and Paul Clement for the religious employers, are familiar names. They argued against each other the last time the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, was before the justices in 2012.\n\nIn that case, the justices upheld by a 5-4 vote the constitutionality of Obamacare's core feature that requires people to get health insurance.\n\nThe dozens of companies involved in the litigation do not all oppose every type of birth control. Some object only to emergency contraceptive methods, such as the so-called morning-after pill, which they view as akin to abortion.\n\nThe case also touches on questions of corporate rights four years after the court, in a case called Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, endorsed broad free-speech rights for companies in the campaign finance context.\n\nA ruling is expected by the end of June.\n\nThe so-called \"contraception mandate\" of the healthcare law requires employers to provide in their health insurance policies preventive services for women that include access to contraception and sterilization.\n\nThe court will hear two consolidated challenges brought by closely held companies and their owners.\n\nOne of the cases was filed by arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby Stores Inc and Mardel, a chain of Christian bookstores. Both are owned and operated by David and Barbara Green and their children, who are evangelical Christians. The other case was brought by a Mennonite family that owns a company in Pennsylvania, Conestoga Wood Specialties. The company is owned and operated by Norman and Elizabeth Hahn and their three sons.\n\nFREEDOM OF RELIGION\n\nThe justices will weigh whether the challengers have a claim under a 1993 federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which ensures the free exercise of religion.\n\nThe case, which has no bearing on the broader fate of the healthcare law, will determine whether some companies will be exempted from the contraception coverage requirement. Religious institutions already are exempted from the regulation.\n\nIn court papers, some Republican members of Congress have supported the companies, while Democrats have backed the Obama administration.\n\nThe administration's lawyer, Verrilli, said in court papers that a victory for the companies could lead to a series of similar challenges to other federal requirements, potentially including objections to minimum-wage laws, Social Security taxes and anti-discrimination laws. He noted, for example, that a company could object to providing health coverage that includes vaccinations.\n\n\"A reading of RFRA that would produce this regime of virtually automatic exemptions from critical employee-protection legislation cannot be correct,\" Verrilli wrote.\n\nThe government is backed by women's rights groups, who say contraceptives should be made as widely available as possible for public health reasons. [ID: nL2N0M724C]\n\nThe challengers and their supporters, including a wide-range of religious groups, counter that the case is really about whether the government can trample on fervently held religious beliefs.\n\n\"No one should be forced to give up their constitutionally protected civil rights just to go into business,\" said Kyle Duncan, a lawyer for Hobby Lobby.",

  "latent_29041": "As I write this, in the late winter of 2006, we are more than twenty years into the AIDS era. Like many, a large part of my life has been irreversibly affected by AIDS. My entire adolescence and adult life — as well as the lives of many of my peers — has been overshadowed by the belief in a deadly, sexually transmittable pathogen and the attendant fear of intimacy and lack of trust that belief engenders.\n\nTo add to this impact, my chosen career has developed around the HIV model of AIDS. I received my Ph.D. in 2002 for my work constructing mathematical models of HIV infection, a field of study I entered in 1996. Just ten years later, it might seem early for me to be looking back on and seriously reconsidering my chosen field, yet here I am.\n\nMy work as a mathematical biologist has been built in large part on the paradigm that HIV causes AIDS, and I have since come to realize that there is good evidence that the entire basis for this theory is wrong. AIDS, it seems, is not a disease so much as a sociopolitical construct that few people understand and even fewer question. The issue of causation, in particular, has become beyond question — even to bring it up is deemed irresponsible.\n\nWhy have we as a society been so quick to accept a theory for which so little solid evidence exists? Why do we take proclamations by government institutions like the NIH and the CDC, via newscasters and talk show hosts, entirely on faith? The average citizen has no idea how weak the connection really is between HIV and AIDS, and this is the manner in which scientifically insupportable phrases like \"the AIDS virus\" or \"an AIDS test\" have become part of the common vernacular despite no evidence for their accuracy.\n\nWhen it was announced in 1984 that the cause of AIDS had been found in a retrovirus that came to be known as HIV, there was a palpable panic. My own family was immediately affected by this panic, since my mother had had several blood transfusions in the early 1980s as a result of three late miscarriages she had experienced. In the early days, we feared mosquito bites, kissing, and public toilet seats. I can still recall the panic I felt after looking up in a public restroom and seeing some graffiti that read \"Do you have AIDS yet? If not, sit on this toilet seat.\"\n\nBut I was only ten years old then, and over time the panic subsided to more of a dull roar as it became clear that AIDS was not as easy to \"catch\" as we had initially believed. Fear of going to the bathroom or the dentist was replaced with a more realistic wariness of having sex with anyone we didn't know really, really well. As a teenager who was in no way promiscuous, I didn't have much to worry about.\n\nThat all changed — or so I thought — when I was twenty-one. Due to circumstances in my personal life and a bit of paranoia that (as it turned out, falsely and completely groundlessly) led me to believe I had somehow contracted \"AIDS,\" I got an HIV test. I spent two weeks waiting for the results, convinced that I would soon die, and that it would be \"all my fault.\" This was despite the fact that I was perfectly healthy, didn't use drugs, and wasn't promiscuous — low-risk by any definition. As it happened, the test was negative, and, having felt I had been granted a reprieve, I vowed not to take more risks, and to quit worrying so much.\n\nOver the past ten years, my attitude toward HIV and AIDS has undergone a dramatic shift. This shift was catalyzed by the work I did as a graduate student, analyzing mathematical models of HIV and the immune system. As a mathematician, I found virtually every model I studied to be unrealistic. The biological assumptions on which the models were based varied from author to author, and this made no sense to me. It was around this time, too, that I became increasingly perplexed by the stories I heard about long-term survivors. From my admittedly inexpert viewpoint, the major thing they all had in common — other than HIV — was that they lived extremely healthy lifestyles. Part of me was becoming suspicious that being HIV-positive didn't necessarily mean you would ever get AIDS.\n\nBy a rather curious twist of fate, it was on my way to a conference to present the results of a model of HIV that I had proposed together with my advisor, that I came across an article by Dr. David Rasnick about AIDS and the corruption of modern science. As I sat on the airplane reading this story, in which he said \"the more I examined HIV, the less it made sense that this largely inactive, barely detectable virus could cause such devastation,\" everything he wrote started making sense to me in a way that the currently accepted model did not. I didn't have anywhere near all the information, but my instincts told me that what he said seemed to fit.\n\nOver the past ten years, I nevertheless continued my research into mathematical models of HIV infection, all the while keeping an ear open for dissenting voices. By now, I have read hundreds of articles on HIV and AIDS, many from the dissident point of view but far, far more from that of the establishment, which unequivocally promotes the idea that HIV causes AIDS and that the case is closed. In that time, I even published four papers on HIV (from a modeling perspective). I justified my contributions to a theory I wasn't convinced of by telling myself these were purely theoretical, mathematical constructs, never to be applied in the real world. I suppose, in some sense also, I wanted to keep an open mind.\n\nSo why is it that only now have I decided that enough is enough, and I can no longer in any capacity continue to support the paradigm on which my entire career has been built?\n\nAs a mathematician, I was taught early on about the importance of clear definitions. AIDS, if you consider its definition, is far from clear, and is in fact not even a consistent entity. The classification \"AIDS\" was introduced in the early 1980s not as a disease but as a surveillance tool to help doctors and public health officials understand and control a strange \"new\" syndrome affecting mostly young gay men. In the two decades intervening, it has evolved into something quite different. AIDS today bears little or no resemblance to the syndrome for which it was named. For one thing, the definition has actually been changed by the CDC several times, continually expanding to include ever more diseases (all of which existed for decades prior to AIDS), and sometimes, no disease whatsoever. More than half of all AIDS diagnoses in the past several years in the United States have been made on the basis of a T-cell count and a \"confirmed\" positive antibody test — in other words, a deadly disease has been diagnosed over and over again on the basis of no clinical disease at all. And the leading cause of death in HIV-positives in the last few years has been liver failure, not an AIDS-defining disease in any way, but rather an acknowledged side effect of protease inhibitors, which asymptomatic individuals take in massive daily doses, for years.\n\nThe epidemiology of HIV and AIDS is puzzling and unclear as well. In spite of the fact that AIDS cases increased rapidly from their initial observation in the early 1980s and reached a peak in 1993 before declining rapidly, the number of HIV-positive individuals in the U.S. has remained constant at one million since the advent of widespread HIV antibody testing. This cannot be due to anti-HIV therapy, since the annual mortality rate of North American HIV-positives who are treated with anti-HIV drugs is much higher — between 6.7 and 8.8% — than would be the approximately 12% global mortality rate of HIV-positives if all AIDS cases were fatal in a given year.\n\nEven more strangely, HIV has been present everywhere in the U.S., in every population tested including repeat blood donors and military recruits, at a virtually constant rate since testing began in 1985. It is deeply confusing that a virus thought to have been brought to the AIDS epicenters of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1970s could possibly have spread so rapidly at first, yet have stopped spreading completely as soon as testing began.\n\nReturning for a moment to the mathematical modeling, one aspect that had always puzzled me was the lack of agreement on how to accurately represent the actual biological mechanism of immune impairment. AIDS is said to be caused by a dramatic loss of the immune system's T-cells, said loss being presumably caused by HIV. Why then could no one agree on how to mathematically model the dynamics of the fundamental disease process — that is, how are T-cells actually killed by HIV? Early models assumed that HIV killed T-cells directly, by what is referred to as lysis. An infected cell lyses, or bursts, when the internal viral burden is so high that it can no longer be contained, just like your grocery bag breaks when it's too full. This is in fact the accepted mechanism of pathogenesis for virtually all other viruses. But it became clear that HIV did not in fact kill T-cells in this manner, and this concept was abandoned, to be replaced by various other ones, each of which resulted in very different models and, therefore, different predictions. Which model was \"correct\" never was clear.\n\nAs it turns out, the reason there was no consensus mathematically as to how HIV killed T-cells was because there was no biological consensus. There still isn't. HIV is possibly the most studied microbe in history — certainly it is the best-funded — yet there is still no agreed-upon mechanism of pathogenesis. Worse than that, there are no data to support the hypothesis that HIV kills T-cells at all. It doesn't in the test tube. It mostly just sits there, as it does in people — if it can be found at all. In Robert Gallo’s seminal 1984 paper in which he claims \"proof\" that HIV causes AIDS, actual HIV could be found in only 26 out of 72 AIDS patients. To date, actual HIV remains an elusive target in those with AIDS or simply HIV-positive.\n\nThis is starkly illustrated by the continued use of antibody tests to diagnose HIV infection. Antibody tests are fairly standard to test for certain microbes, but for anything other than HIV, the main reason they are used in place of direct tests (that is, actually looking for the bacteria or virus itself) is because they are generally much easier and cheaper than direct testing. Most importantly, such antibody tests have been rigorously verified against the gold standard of microbial isolation. This stands in vivid contrast to HIV, for which antibody tests are used because there exists no test for the actual virus. As to so-called \"viral load,\" most people are not aware that tests for viral load are neither licensed nor recommended by the FDA to diagnose HIV infection. This is why an \"AIDS test\" is still an antibody test. Viral load, however, is used to estimate the health status of those already diagnosed HIV-positive. But there are very good reasons to believe it does not work at all. Viral load uses either PCR or a technique called branched-chained DNA amplification (bDNA). PCR is the same technique used for \"DNA fingerprinting\" at crime scenes where only trace amounts of materials can be found. PCR essentially mass-produces DNA or RNA so that it can be seen. If something has to be mass-produced to even be seen, and the result of that mass-production is used to estimate how much of a pathogen there is, it might lead a person to wonder how relevant the pathogen was in the first place. Specifically, how could something so hard to find, even using the most sensitive and sophisticated technology, completely decimate the immune system? bDNA, while not magnifying anything directly, nevertheless looks only for fragments of DNA believed, but not proven, to be components of the genome of HIV — but there is no evidence to say that these fragments don't exist in other genetic sequences unrelated to HIV or to any virus. It is worth noting at this point that viral load, like antibody tests, has never been verified against the gold standard of HIV isolation. bDNA uses PCR as a gold standard, PCR uses antibody tests as a gold standard, and antibody tests use each other. None use HIV itself.\n\nThere is good reason to believe the antibody tests are flawed as well. The two types of tests routinely used are the ELISA and the Western Blot (WB). The current testing protocol is to \"verify\" a positive ELISA with the \"more specific\" WB (which has actually been banned from diagnostic use in the UK because it is so unreliable). But few people know that the criteria for a positive WB vary from country to country and even from lab to lab. Put bluntly, a person's HIV status could well change depending on the testing venue. It is also possible to test \"WB indeterminate,\" which translates to any one of \"uninfected,\" \"possibly infected,\" or even, absurdly, \"partly infected\" under the current interpretation. This conundrum is confounded by the fact that the proteins comprising the different reactive \"bands\" on the WB test are all claimed to be specific to HIV, raising the question of how a truly uninfected individual could possess antibodies to even one \"HIV-specific\" protein.\n\nI have come to sincerely believe that these HIV tests do immeasurably more harm than good, due to their astounding lack of specificity and standardization. I can buy the idea that anonymous screening of the blood supply for some nonspecific marker of ill health (which, due to cross reactivity with many known pathogens, a positive HIV antibody test often seems to be) is useful. I cannot buy the idea that any individual needs to have a diagnostic HIV test. A negative test may not be accurate (whatever that means), but a positive one can create utter havoc and destruction in a person's life — all for a virus that most likely does absolutely nothing. I do not feel it is going too far to say that these tests ought to be banned for diagnostic purposes.\n\nThe real victims in this mess are those whose lives are turned upside-down by the stigma of an HIV diagnosis. These people, most of whom are perfectly healthy, are encouraged to avoid intimacy and are further branded with the implication that they were somehow dreadfully foolish and careless. Worse, they are encouraged to take massive daily doses of some of the most toxic drugs ever manufactured. HIV, for many years, has fulfilled the role of a microscopic terrorist. People have lost their jobs, been denied entry into the Armed Forces, been refused residency in and even entry into some countries, even been charged with assault or murder for having consensual sex; babies have been taken from their mothers and had toxic medications forced down their throats. There is no precedent for this type of behavior, as it is all in the name of a completely unproven, fundamentally flawed hypothesis, on the basis of highly suspect, indirect tests for supposed infection with an allegedly deadly virus — a virus that has never been observed to do much of anything.\n\nAs to the question of what does cause AIDS, if it is not HIV, there are many plausible explanations given by people known to be experts. Before the discovery of HIV, AIDS was assumed to be a lifestyle syndrome caused mostly by indiscriminate use of recreational drugs. Immunosuppression has multiple causes, from an overload of microbes to malnutrition. Probably all of these are true causes of AIDS. Immune deficiency has many manifestations, and a syndrome with many manifestations is likely multicausal as well. Suffice it to say that the HIV hypothesis of AIDS has offered nothing but predictions — of its spread, of the availability of a vaccine, of a forthcoming animal model, and so on — that have not materialized, and it has not saved a single life.\n\nAfter ten years involved in the academic side of HIV research, as well as in the academic world at large, I truly believe that the blame for the universal, unconditional, faith-based acceptance of such a flawed theory falls squarely on the shoulders of those among us who have actively endorsed a completely unproven hypothesis in the interests of furthering our careers. Of course, hypotheses in science deserve to be studied, but no hypothesis should be accepted as fact before it is proven, particularly one whose blind acceptance has such dire consequences.\n\nFor over twenty years, the general public has been greatly misled and ill-informed. As someone who has been raised by parents who taught me from a young age never to believe anything just because \"everyone else accepts it to be true,\" I can no longer just sit by and do nothing, thereby contributing to this craziness. And the craziness has gone on long enough. As humans  as honest academics and scientists  the only thing we can do is allow the truth to come to light.\n\nMarch 3, 2006\n\nThe Best of Rebecca V.

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 2 years old\n\nLabour MP Sarah Champion asks equalities minister how victims will have access to support if only helpline shuts in March\n\nA helpline for victims of online revenge porn is to shut next month after the government cut its funding, according to a Labour MP.\n\nThe helpline was lauded by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling, who said he wanted victims to know the government was on their side.\n\n'They didn't know they were victims': revenge porn helpline sees alarming rise Read more\n\nIn the past year it has taken 2,500 calls from women and men who say they were victims of revenge porn – the sharing of indecent images without consent – a crime the director of public prosecutions says is contributing to the record number of prosecutions for violence against women and girls.\n\nSarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, challenged Justine Greening, minister for women and equalities, over the funding cuts in the Commons on Thursday.\n\nShe said: “Some 20% of 13- to 21-year-olds have had unwanted pornographic images sent to them, and 5% of them have had indecent images shared without their consent.\n\n“Why is the government cutting the funding to the revenge porn helpline … and how will you ensure that the victims have access to bespoke support when you are shutting the only helpline in March?”\n\nGreening replied that no announcement had been made yet.\n\nThe Guardian understands the helpline has been in talks with the government for months about its future funding but has failed to receive any commitment of support.\n\nIt was set up by Laura Higgins, online safety operations manager at the South West Grid for Learning. Revenge porn became a criminal offence in April 2015 after a campaign by Maria Miller, the Conservative MP for Basingstoke, and Higgins.\n\nThe then equalities minister, Nicky Morgan, said the helpline would provide essential free legal advice on how to have pictures removed from the internet.\n\n“Circulating intimate photos of someone without their consent is never acceptable, and we need to educate people to the dangers of sending intimate images, and to the hurt that sharing them causes,” she said.\n\nMore than 200 people have been charged and tried for revenge porn since the law was introduced.",
  "latent_29588": "George Carlin would definitely consider alleged billionaire and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump a misogynist and a racist, the late comedy legend’s daughter insists.\n\nKelly Carlin made the comment during an interview with comedian Karith Foster, who is working with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Education, that was posted as a podcast and a video on Thursday. Foster was speaking with the daughters of George Carlin, Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce about the state of comedy today and censorship.\n\nDuring the conversation, Kelly Carlin described how her father believed that it was his job in comedy to find the line and to cross it, but there aren’t a lot of lines left to cross today. “So, therefore, we get someone like Donald Trump running for president,” she said.\n\nAfter explaining her theory about how political correctness develops ― that it comes from a good place but is “not good for democracy in the end” ― Carlin said: “This is why we got Trump. He’s not politically correct. It is refreshing. He says what’s on his mind. It’s not pleasant to listen to, but this is America and politicians don’t speak.”\n\nIn that case, Foster asked if Carlin thought her father would support Trump?\n\n“Oh, God no. No, no, no, no, no,” Carlin responded. “My dad would see him for who he really is, which is misogynistic, and racist, and all that kind of stuff. I mean he, he’d love the freak show of it all because – it is a real freak show. He loved the freak show aspect of American politics.\n\n“But, my dad didn’t vote,” Carlin continued. “He stopped voting in ’72 when McGovern broke his heart. You know, he’d be a San.. he’d love Bernie Sanders. My dad was very progressive. You know, so, but that’s, that’s my take on it. It’s an interesting mixing of progressive ideals with fascist tactics and political incorrectness in general.”",

I appreciate discovering recipes that are a hit with my whole family (it’s never awesome to be in the kitchen for hours and then be the only one eating what you made because you feel too guilty to toss your efforts into the waste receptacle (doesn’t that sound better than garbage can?).\n\nThis recipe makes a big batch which is great since it reheats really well. That’s my favorite way to eat it; crisped over a skillet and served with a pickle. I’m not sure why but I crave pickles with plov.\n\nWe’ve been looking for a great beef plov recipe for a L-O-N-G time! Plov is originally an Uzbek dish, but every Ukrainian I know makes and loves plov and this is more the Ukrainian version. P.S. I do have a chicken plov recipe posted here (if you wanted a quicker plov recipe).\n\nMY LATEST VIDEOS\n\nI discovered this recipe through Olga’s Blog. Guess what, she’s a nurse too! I guess nurses make good food ;), or maybe we just happen to have a lot in common. Olga is such an inspiration. I don’t think I would have ever gotten to know her if not for blogging. Olga your recipe was deeee-licious. My husband (being Mr creativity) tossed in some coriander which added a nice floral somethin’ somethin’. It’s a new favorite in our house!\n\nIngredients for Beef Rice Pilaf:\n\n1 1/2 lbs Beef chuck, beef sirloin or good quality beef stew meat\n\n1/3 cup canola oil, or extra light olive oil (not extra virgin)\n\n2 medium onions, finely chopped\n\n3 medium carrots, cut into matchsticks or grated\n\n1 tsp salt for the meat and veggies + 1 1/2 tsp salt for the rice\n\n1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 tsp paprika\n\n1 tsp cumin\n\n3-4 bay leaves\n\n1 3/4 cups hot water for braising meat\n\n3 cups long grain rice (Basmati or Jasmin rice work great!)\n\n4 cups hot water when cooking rice\n\n1 head of garlic\n\n1 tsp ground coriander\n\nHow to Make Beef Rice Pilaf:\n\n1. Trim beef of excess fat and sinews (aka the chewy stuff), pat the meat dry with a paper towel and chop into 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces.\n\n2. Preheat your dutch oven (or your large soup pot with a heavy bottom), to high heat. Once it’s hot, stir in your 1/3 cup canola oil. Once oil is hot, add chopped meat and saute uncovered 7 min over high heat until meat is browned, stirring every minute or so so it doesn’t scorch to the bottom of the pan.\n\nNote: it’s important to preheat the dutch oven first for the meat to sear over very high heat, otherwise it will juice out and become dry.\n\n3. Reduce heat to medium and Add chopped onion, stirring often until onion is softened (5 minutes). Stir in sliced carrots, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 3-4 bay leaves and continue to cook over medium heat 5 minutes until carrots are softened.\n\n4. Add 1 3/4 cups hot water, cover & simmer over medium/low heat 45 min or until meat is tender.\n\n5. Meanwhile, rinse rice until water runs clear, then drain and set aside (this gets rid of the starch so you won’t end up with a sticky rice). Did I ever tell you I love my OXO strainer ? This thing is so versatile (from sifting flour, rinsing and draining, to wearing it as a helmet and chasing your toddler around the house?\n\n6. Spread rice over the meat and add 4 cups hot water. Sprinkle the rice with 1 1/2 tsp salt (DO NOT STIR), bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and Let cook uncovered until most of the water is absorbed (10 min).\n\n7. Cut off the head of your garlic to expose the cloves. Put your head of garlic, cut side down into the center of the rice and sprinkle the top of the rice with 1 tsp ground coriander\n\n8. Poke 7-10 holes through the rice to allow steam to escape to the surface, reduce the heat to low, then cover and cook an additional 15 minutes or until rice is cooked through. Remove the garlic head and bay leaves and stir everything gently to combine and you’re done.\n\nYou should make it. As soon as possible.

  "latent_29735": "A major impasse to Congress coming to a deal to keep the government funded past Friday was overcome on Wednesday, with signals from the White House that it would continue to pay Obamacare subsidies that Democrats wanted explicitly guaranteed in the funding legislation being negotiated. Earlier in the day, House Speaker Paul Ryan said appropriating the payments wouldn’t be in the funding bill.\n\nDemocratic leaders issued statements Wednesday afternoon that seemed to confirm reports that the White House had offered assurances to lawmakers that the payments would continue, at least in the short-term, despite President Trump’s previous suggestions that he would use them as leverage to force Democrats to negotiate on dismantling the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“It is good that once again the president seems to be backing off his threat to hold health care and government funding hostage,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, adding that there other issues still being resolved in the government funding negotiations.\n\n“I am pleased that the White House confirmed what I’ve been asking for: that they will uphold their commitment under the law to continue making cost sharing reduction payments,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in his own statement.\n\nHouse Republicans sued the Obama administration in 2014 over the subsidies, which were being made out of the Treasury Department, alleging they were illegal because they were not explicitly appropriated by Congress. A federal judge agreed last year but allowed them to continue while her decision in favor of the Republicans was appealed by the Obama administration.\n\nThe payments became a flashpoint in the current government funding battle after Trump, earlier this month, speculated that if he withheld the payments Democrats would come to the table on replacing Obamacare. Dems responded by making the payments a priority in their funding negotiations, though this week some Democrats were waffling on whether they would shut down the government over them.\n\nThe payments subsidize insurers for keeping out-of-pocket costs down for low-income consumers, as mandated by the ACA. If eliminated, it’s anticipated that insurers would be forced to jack up premiums to make up the revenue shortfall or withdraw from ACA exchanges entirely, risking a collapse of the individual market.\n\nEven though the government funding crisis over the payments appears to have been averted, that still doesn’t answer questions about their longterm fate, specifically where the lawsuit is concerned.\n\nSince Trump was elected, it has been unclear whether the Justice Department under his administration was going to continue to defend them, and a pause on the legal proceedings was granted by the appeals court until May for the parties to figure out their next move.\n\nHoyer, in his statement, pointed to the current legal uncertainty and argued that it was now “incumbent upon House Republicans to withdraw their lawsuit that seeks to block these payments.”\n\nA top insurer group echoed his desire for a more action to be taken on cementing their longterm fate.\n\n“We continue to need clarity,” Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in an email to TPM in response to the Dems’ statements.\n\nMeanwhile, some Republicans pointed to the legal case as reason for the White House not to continue the subsidies.\n\n“The Constitution provides that ‘No money may be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.’ Congress has made no appropriation for Obamacare cost sharing reduction payments,” Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said in a statement. “Therefore, we believe making these payments without congressional approval is both clearly illegal and unconstitutional, as the district court held in House v. Price.”",

These violations are happening regardless of whether it’s Bicycle Safe Passage week or not. And those drivers should have a consequence when they endanger cyclists.”\n\nThe data release comes four days after a hit-and-run driver fatally struck cyclist Matthew von Ohlen, 35, who was traveling in a bike lane in Brooklyn at the time of the crash.\n\nThe driver remains at large.\n\nAfter the crash, the city came under criticism from advocates at Transportation Alternatives, who said police officers on Sunday went to the street where von Ohlen was killed to issue summonses to cyclists.\n\nEat it.

  "latent_30034": "Turkey has recalled its ambassador from Vienna amid a deepening diplomatic row.\n\nForeign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday (21 August) he was angered that people were allowed to rally in support of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organisation by the Turkish government and features on the EU's list of terrorist organisations.\n\n“Unfortunately, the ground on which our bilateral relations and cooperation with Austria can be normally sustained has disappeared,” he said. “We cannot be two-faced like them, we are against all kinds of terror.”\n\nHe accused Austria of refusing to allow a \"peaceful march\" in support of Turkish democracy in the wake of the foiled coup.\n\nBut he gave no details, and the Austrian police told this website it wasn't aware of any bans on demonstrations.\n\nA pro-Erdogan rally took place in Vienna on 16 July, with roughly 4,000 people reportedly taking part.\n\nAustria’s foreign minister Sebastian Kurz defended the right of demonstrators to protest and display loyalty with their homeland. But he said they should stop short of \"importing the political conflict to Austria\", after some demonstrators attacked the garden of a Turkish-Kurdish restaurant.\n\nThe mayor of Wiener Neustadt, a small town near Vienna, later asked residents to remove Turkish flags from their windows.\n\nAnother row erupted when a news ticker at Vienna airport earlier this month carried claims from Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstroem that Turkey had legalised sex with children. The allegations were denied by Turkey and refuted by legal experts.\n\nWorsening relations\n\nRelations between Austria - home to some 300,000 people of Turkish origin - and Turkey went downhill after last month’s coup attempt.\n\nChancellor Christian Kern angered Ankara when calling accession talks with Turkey a \"diplomatic fiction” earlier this month and said the EU needed \"an alternative concept\".\n\nHe also said the Turkish citizens protesting against the coup in Austria were ”radical”.\n\nCavusoglu replied by calling Austria the “capital of radical racism”.\n\n\"During the coup and afterwards, instead of supporting Turkey they have done the exact opposite,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nEU not abandoning Turkey\n\nThe EU relies on Turkey to stop thousands of asylum seekers and migrants from travelling to Europe, enshrined in a migrant-swap deal signed in March this year.\n\nDespite rising diplomatic tension, EU leaders insist that the deal must continue. But the government's post-coup crackdown has worried critics that Turkey is moving away from democracy and rule of law.\n\nThe European Commission’s president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month rejected Austria's call for the EU to end membership talks with Turkey, warning it would be a grave mistake.\n\n\"I don't think it would be helpful if we were to unilaterally end negotiations with Turkey,\" he told German public broadcaster ARD, adding that such a decision can only be made with unanimity from all member states.\n\nTurkey’s ambassador to the EU, Selim Yenel, told this website earlier this month that he hoped EU-Turkey relations would improve when leaders travelled to Turkey and saw the situation with their own eyes.\n\nThe European Parliament’s Elmar Brok, chair of the foreign affairs committee (Afet) and Kati Piri, the parliament’s rapporteur for Turkey, started an official visit on Tuesday.\n\nGermany’s European affairs minister Michael Roth will pay a visit to Turkey later this week.",
  "latent_30071": "The Murderer learned a valuable lesson today; fire hurt.\n\nHe let out a gurgling, pained moan as he trudged through the flaming attraction, the Springtrap suit's mechanical feet clanking on the floor beneath him. The searing pain of what was left of his dried, rotten, mangled carcass turning to ash was as great as when the springlocks of what was now his seemingly eternal prison failed on him. He briefly pondered the irony of his situation; he, the child murderer who had inadvertently imprisoned his victims within what were effectively mobile iron maidens, being left to the same fate; but now, he was being 'freed' in a far more painful manner than the children had been.\n\nHe was going to die in a fire.\n\nBut he refused to accept that. The exit was in sight. \"I will be free,\" the Murderer thought, putting out a hand to open the door once he reached it, \"Free to continue my work.\"\n\nThe second he thought that, a support of the building fell from the ceiling, slamming into Springtrap's legs and causing the animatronic to fall, as the undead presence inside let out a screech of anger, horror and pain. Refusing to give in, despite the animatronic's fragile legs having been rendered inoperable by the impact, he began crawling along the floor towards the exit. He didn't get very far, however, before his vision started to blur in and out, and it wasn't very long after that that they appeared.\n\nOne by one, the Phantoms surrounded the burning animatronic; first Balloon Boy, then Mangle, then Foxy, then Chica. They simply stared down at the broken, dying wreck, unmoving and unblinking, before the Phantoms of Freddy and the Puppet appeared, looming in front of Springtrap. The Phantom Puppet slowly knelt down, staring at the terrified murderer.\n\n\"You should have learned by now,\" it said calmly. \"Did you really think that, after all you've done, you were going to escape alive?\" It continued, tilting its head to the side. Springtrap couldn't respond, for the Murderer's vocal cords had been torn to shreds when the springlocks had failed. The Phantom Puppet, expecting a reply, suddenly burst forward into Springtrap's face. \"ANSWER ME,\" it screeched, and Springtrap quickly shook his head. Out of the corner of his eye, he swore he could see a damaged, slumped Freddy suit of indiscernible color next to Phantom Freddy, head turned towards him; but it was gone as quickly as it came.\n\n\"I thought so,\" the Phantom Puppet said, and Springtrap's head snapped back to it. The Phantom slowly stood up, head hanging down to look at the animatronic. \"Enjoy your last moments, murderer. For there won't be anyone to SAVE YOU.\"\n\nIn less than a second, all of the Phantoms had disappeared, leaving the burning Murderer to die.\n\nThe Springtrap suit was holding up remarkably well against the flames, but they were licking in through the many holes in the suit, and the Murderer's remains weren't so fortunate. He could already feel what was left of his body crumbling to dust as he noticed a small Freddy figurine a few feet away. He shakily reached over and grabbed it, and his old lust for death and destruction returned; In a garbled scream of rage, he raised the figurine into the air, preparing to throw it to the floor, to see just one more thing ruined by his hands.\n\nHe never got the chance. The remains of the Murderer burned away, leaving only the animatronic eyes. The Springtrap suit became lifeless, dropping the figurine and shutting down on its side with a dull thud. The figurine landed back in its original position, unharmed.\n\nThe scene was unchanged when the auctioneers came to salvage what was left.\n\nAuthor's Note: Wrote this short story for the latest Monthly Contest on the FNaF subreddit.

  "latent_30108": "Brett Kilroe made his living making other people visible. As an art director in the music industry for more than two decades, he was responsible for the visual design and branding of acts ranging from Kings of Leon and Foo Fighters to Missy Elliott and Taylor Swift. The iconic cover of Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s solo début, “Return to the 36 Chambers,” featuring the rapper’s face on a public-assistance I.D. card? That’s Kilroe’s work. The wildly different, equally striking English and American covers of the Strokes’ album “Is This It”? Those are his, too. An album is about a certain sound, of course, but it’s also about a certain look. Just as the nose informs what the tongue tastes, the eyes help shape what the ears hear. That’s where Kilroe came in. “He would create the world, the whole back story,” the photographer Dan Winters, a longtime friend and collaborator of Kilroe’s, told me recently.\n\nWhen Kilroe was given a diagnosis of Stage IV colon cancer, late in 2011, he and Winters embarked together on a more personal project. In the course of the next four years, Winters photographed Kilroe whenever the two were together: at Kilroe’s apartment on Avenue A and at Winters’s beach house off the coast of Georgia, in hotel rooms and hospitals. Early on, there was hope that the cancer might go into remission. “It was a document of this journey, and the destination wasn’t known,” Winters told me. “But we knew we wanted to document it.”\n\nThe pictures here, culled from hundreds that Winters took, form a portrait of a man enduring illness and illness’s savage progression. In closeup, Winters observes Kilroe’s scarred torso just after the insertion of a titanium port to deliver chemo directly to his liver, where the cancer had metastasized; he photographs Kilroe’s shorn scalp, where a radiation burn formed, like a crop circle, after the cancer found his head. In one image, from 2014, Kilroe stands against a wall in his underwear, his hands clasped protectively at his groin. His torso, caressed by shadow, is beautiful, still strong with muscle; the bionic bulge of the chemo port presses up through his right pec. A mesh hood delicately encases his head, giving him the uncanny look of one of Robert Mapplethorpe’s dungeon subjects, calm with the authority of desire. But the hood is a medical tool, not a sexual one, there to administer radiation to the skull.\n\nKilroe was forty-one when he got the diagnosis. He grew old in the space of half a decade. The temptation can be to avert the eyes from such a terrible transformation, to help preserve the dignity of the sick, or to try to lessen one’s own distress. Winters’s pictures, suffused with the tenderness and affection that mark friendship’s special love, are a promise not to abandon his friend by turning away. It takes bravery to do that kind of close looking, just as it does to allow oneself to be looked at. “I fully saw Brett, and I’m grateful for that,” Winters told me.\n\nHe also allowed his friend to see himself. Winters showed Kilroe all but the final few pictures; they continued to work on professional projects together during Kilroe’s illness, and remained creative partners through and through. Winters recalled taking one photo, included here, of Kilroe standing in the garage door at Winters’s beach house, holding his chemo bottle. He was struck by the beauty of the light: “I remember saying, ‘This is really amazing, Brett. You’re going to love this.’ ” It felt strange to respond to the moment aesthetically, but Kilroe knew what he meant. “We’re going to look back at these and be glad we made these pictures,” he told Winters.\n\nEarlier this year, Kilroe was moved to Sloan Kettering, where he underwent further treatment before being placed in palliative care. Winters and his wife were constantly at his bedside, along with other shared friends; for the last nine days of Kilroe’s life, Winters slept on the couch in his hospital room. On March 24th, the group spent the day in silence, breaking late in the afternoon to sing “Two of Us,” by the Beatles: a song about going home. Just after they finished, Kilroe stopped breathing. He was forty-five years old. An hour later, Winters took his last picture of his friend. It’s of his hand, fingers open, poised to let go.\n\nDan Winters’s photos will be on display as part of the exhibit “Windermere: A Celebration of the Life and Work of Brett Robinson Kilroe” at A+E Studios in New York City, June 5th and 6th.",

He has a haunted look, reinforced by black prison overalls with reflective tape on the shoulders and cuffs.\n\nDavydenko could be labeled as a loser in many ways. The 31-year-old is a drug addict, serving time for robbery and assault. He's serving his third stretch in a Siberian prison.\n\nBut Davydenko is about to become a winner in at least one way. If all goes well, he will soon be declared cured of one of the deadliest forms of tuberculosis.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Konstantin Salomatin/for NPR Konstantin Salomatin/for NPR\n\nIn the last decade, Russia has found itself contending with new strains of TB that are resistant to many drugs and hard to cure. For years, prisons were considered to be one of the most dangerous pockets of drug-resistant TB in Russia and a source of the disease in the general community. In 2002, more than 79,000 inmates had active TB infections, and drug-resistant forms were present in about 50 percent of chronic cases.\n\nBut the Russian prison system has been working to change that. About a decade ago, it got together with the nonprofit Partners in Health and set up a clinic at a Siberian prison specifically aimed at treating tuberculosis among inmates.\n\nThe facility is called Medical and Penal Institution Number One. And, against long odds, it's making progress against drug-resistant TB. The rate of infection has dropped seven-fold, and the death rate has fallen to single digits, Alexander Leshchyov, the deputy warden, says.\n\nThere's no hiding the fact that Medical and Penal Institution Number One is a prison. It's surrounded by high brick walls, coils of razor wire and watch towers.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Konstantin Salomatin/for NPR Konstantin Salomatin/for NPR\n\nBut as penitentiaries go, Medical and Penal Institution Number One isn't the worst. There's a bakery, clean dormitories and a small cafe that serves as a visiting area. There's even a theater, where inmate singers are practicing for a yearly talent show with some of the other nearby prisons. In the yard, a warden points out a bas-relief mural, sculpted by an inmate artist.\n\nInmate Davydenko first came here in 2001 after he contracted TB in another prison. \"I was losing weight, had the sweats, coughing — in short, all the symptoms. They found it was TB, and they sent me here,\" he says.\n\nPrison officials say Davydenko had a typical strain of tuberculosis that responds to normal treatment, and that he was cured by the time his sentence was up in 2002. But Davydenko went back to a life of drugs and crime that quickly landed him back in jail.\n\nWhen Davydenko came back here, six years ago, the doctors again found TB, which he may have picked up in pretrial detention. The strain was a little worse than the one he had the first time, but it was still susceptible to the most commonly used anti-TB drugs. This time the treatment took a year, and Davydenko was declared cured again but kept under observation, as he served out his term.\n\nBut in 2011, a routine scan found TB again. This time it was drug-resistant, and Davydenko faced a longer, more arduous treatment with fierce side effects.\n\nThe key to curing TB in prisonsers is getting each patient to take responsibility for his own health, Warden Leshchyov says. That's not easy. \"It's a very complicated moment that we call compliance,\" he says. \"It is such a simple thing, but it's incredibly difficult to acquire it.\"\n\nDavydenko's history — his drug addiction, his crimes, his repeated stints in prison — read like a textbook example of why it's so hard to get someone like him to take care of himself.\n\nThe experience of being treated for the disease can have a positive effect on an inmate's rehabilitation, Leshchyov says. \"Davydenko is an absolutely creative person,\" the warden says. \"During the treatment there comes a turning point [when] the treatment changes not only the body but a person's soul.\"\n\nDavydenko agrees that he has come to feel responsible for himself and others. \"When you get ill, the responsibility is on you, so that other people don't get sick — your family and neighbors and so on,\" he says.\n\nDavidenko has been through 17 months of a 20-month treatment, and he says he's feeling better now. He's scheduled to get out of prison in about 2 1/2.\n\nBut he seems hesitant to say he's on the path to rehabilitation.\"You see,\" he says. \"I'm in here for the third time.\" He wonders if anyone will believe he's changed. \"I'm already 31,\" he says. \"I should think about what to do next. I don't know.\"\n\nPrison officials say they have hopes for Davydenko. They say that inmate patients, who've received the full spectrum of treatment, have a much better chance, not only of recovering their health, but of recovering a productive place in society.",

She was 48 years old.\n\nAccording to an obituary posted to the website of Pembroke College – University of Oxford, where she taught as a Retained Lecturer in Italian, Owen had been in declining health for the last year. Despite her illness, she continued teaching up until recently.\n\nAn expert in medieval Italian literature, Owen received a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. She was also a renowned artist and printmaker, who recently staged an exhibit of prints inspired by the Cantos of Divine Comedy.\n\nOwen and Yorke were partners for 23 years and had two children together, a son named Noah and a daughter named Agnes. Despite Yorke’s superstar status, Owen lived an extremely private life and was rarely seen in public with the Radiohead singer.\n\nThe couple split in August 2015 and the demise of their relationship heavily influenced Radiohead’s latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool.\n\nBelow, watch Radiohead perform “True Love Waits” during a concert in Paris earlier this year:",

Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute.\n\nAs of June there were 709,303 personal bankruptcy filings this year, down 7.9% from the same period a year earlier, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute and the National Bankruptcy Research Center.\n\nFilings in June were up 4.3% from a month earlier, though monthly tallies aren’t adjusted for seasonal swings. “The broader perspective suggests less of a concern,” said Ronald Mann, a law professor at Columbia University. “Filings were still lower than last year’s torrid rate.”\n\nDeclines so far this year are a positive indication that the flood of consumer filings has slowed. In 2010 there were more than 1.5 million personal bankruptcy filings — the largest number since Congress overhauled the system in 2005 to make it more difficult for Americans to walk away from their debts.",
  "latent_30976": "Israel has reacted with a sense of vindication since South African Judge Richard Goldstone retracted accusations of Israeli war crimes during its war with Hamas in Gaza two years ago.\n\nMr. Goldstone, who headed a panel of the United Nations Human Rights Council that made the accusations in more than 500 pages worth of reports in 2009, wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece published Friday that Israeli inquires into the reports' allegations have made it clear that its army didn’t intentionally target Gaza civilians. He shifted criticism to the militant Islamist group Hamas for \"heinous\" acts of shooting rockets at Israeli cities and for refusing to investigate itself.\n\nThe Goldstone report was widely seen in Israel as unjust and aimed at isolating the Jewish state as a pariah while negating its right to defend itself from rocket attacks. And although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the United Nations to consign the report to the \"dustbin of history,\" it isn’t likely to be forgotten any time soon.\n\nPalestinians who had encouraged the UN to refer the report to its judicial arm accused Goldstone of caving in to pro-Israel pressure over the report. Israeli commentators, meanwhile, called the South African justice’s article a \"PR coup\" and an \"earthquake.\"\n\n\"The most serious of accusation was that Israel deliberately killed Palestinian civilians,\" said Dore Gold, a former Israeli United Nations Ambassador who debated Goldstone in 2009. \"It was like a blood libel for the Israel Defense Force, and contributed directly to the global effort to delegitimize the Jewish state. This is an important turning point.\"\n\nFresh Gaza incursion brewing?\n\nMr. Goldstone’s retraction comes at a time when rising violence in Gaza and southern Israel has prompted talk in Israel of a need to repeat Israel’s offensive against Hamas that was the focus of the report.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the sides traded attacks in the worst spate of violence since the 2008-2009 war, in which some 1,400 Gazans were killed. The March 22 killing of four civilians by an errant Israeli mortar shell showed that the narratives of the two-year-old war haven’t changed: the Palestinians accused Israel of targeting civilians while Israel accused militants of cynically using non-combatants as shields.\n\nWhile Israeli officials rushed to claim victory on Sunday, analysts expressed doubt it would spur any greater sympathy for Israel by the international community in a future conflict.\n\n\"It’s more of a moral triumph than something that changes the relations between Israel and the UN or between Israel and the international community,’’ said Shmuel Rosner, an Israeli columnist for the Jerusalem Post. \"The United Nations is a body with an instinctive tendency to investigate Israel and to blame Israel, and I don’t think that that tendency will be different because of [Goldstone's] change of heart.\"\n\nA spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Sunday that the Palestinian Authority will still press for international efforts to prosecute war crimes from the Gaza war.\n\nDespite Israel’s vilification of the Goldstone inquiry – it sees the UN Human Rights council as anti-Israel – its army has responded to criticism of its handling of non-combatants.\n\nNewspaper commentators said the number of misconduct inquiries would not have been as large had it not been for international pressure. Combat units now have Arabic speaking officers to liaise with civilians and humanitarian agencies.\n\n\"We have learned lessons. The process of debriefings, inquiries, and investigations, ultimately lead to these things,\" says an Israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Did [the Goldstone report] contribute? I’m sure it has.\"",
  "latent_30996": "A push by supermarket giant Coles to reshape Australia's free-range egg market through a dramatic reduction in space for hens has been dealt a blow, with two key animal welfare groups questioning whether the eggs are genuinely free range.\n\nThe new Coles standard, which the egg industry is spending millions of dollars to meet, allows for one square metre per hen. This is 10,000 hens per hectare, almost a seven-fold reduction in space from the voluntary guidelines of 1500 hens per hectare. As there is no legal standard, industry observers expect Woolworths and Aldi to follow Coles, leading to a supermarket-driven redefinition of free range.\n\nBut the RSPCA, which has applauded Coles for dumping its house brand cage eggs and endorses its barn-laid eggs, wants more scientific evidence that hens are not harmed by the ''dramatically increased'' stocking densities in its intensive free-range systems, with 30,000-hen sheds common.\n\nThe Coles standard, to be featured on egg cartons within weeks, allows for inside densities of 12 birds per square metre but every hen is within nine metres of an outdoor ''pop hole''.",

They are now looking for three men.\n\nHeather Quast and her friend 21-year-old Eric Russom were on the Jordan Parkway when they were both stabbed. Relatives of Russom say they had arranged to meet three men who wanted to buy marijuana.\n\nPolice say the attack happened in a field off the parkway at about 4100 South. Russom told his family that one of the men pulled out a fake gun, and then another pulled out a knife.\n\n\"When the people attacked them, Eric tried his best to keep heather behind him; and when she tried to run, they wanted money,\" Russom's mother said.\n\n\"When [Heater] tried to run, they went after her,\" Russom's mother continued. \"Eric got slashed many times in the process. He let the purse go when he saw heather fall, and he took his shirt off, and he tried to save her life.\"\n\nHeather Quast\n\nQuast was stabbed in the stomach, and Russom was stabbed in the face, near his eye.\n\nQuast and Russom were taken to Intermountain Medical Center in critical condition. Once there, Quast died.\n\nPolice say Russom's injuries are serious but not severe. His family says he could lose his eye, but the pain he feels from Quast's death is much worse because he couldn't save her.\n\n\"As soon as my brother knew what was going on, my brother started fighting with the people,\" brother Joseph Russom said. \"They pulled out a knife, and he told Heather to run, and he didn't know that she got stabbed.\"\n\nFamily members say Russom and Quast had been living along the Parkway. Quast's grandmother, Sharlene Nolan, says the teen's parents asked her to leave home because she was doing and dealing drugs.\n\nNolan says Quast was a good girl who loved music. She says Quast started hanging out with the wrong crowd. \"She was doing really good, then just got with the wrong crowd,\" Nolan said. A neighbor who knows Quast and Russom said, \"She was a good girl. She really was. A little confused, a little mixed up, but it's a shame that they live on the river like they do.\" Nolan thinks Russom may know the men responsible for Quast's death.\n\n\"My daughter says they feel that the kid knows who they were, because he didn't get hurt but was carrying a wad of money,\" Nolan said. \"Knowing Heather, she's like her mom. She'd fight and put up a fight before she let them take the money.\"\n\nHeather is also survived by her parents, Rachelle and Jerry Quast, and sister Amber, who is just 18 months apart. Heather was to turn 19 years old in July.\n\nMeanwhile, police are looking for three males in their late teens or early-20s; one of them has a tattoo on his neck.\n\n\"Everybody that is available is out here helping us right now, trying to help us catch these people,\" said Taylorsville police Detective Shannon Bennett. \"It's very concerning to us. We want to find these people and get them off the street.\"\n\nOfficers are talking to Russom, whom they say is cooperating with them. He is now out of the hospital and helping investigators look for evidence at the scene of the crime.\n\nAnyone with any information on this case should call police at 801-743-7000.\n\n------\n\nStory compiled with information from Sandra Yi, Shara Park and Randall Jeppesen.\n\n×\n\nPhotos\n\nRelated Stories",

But come Star Trek Beyond, she’s nowhere to be found. Now we know why.\n\nOn the latest episode of the official Star Trek podcast, Simon Pegg answered the question. The real world answer was, basically, that co-writers Pegg and Doug Jung thought that they would “underserve” her character. Pegg also pointed out the fairly obvious point that killing her was a terrible option. No clue why that was something that might have happened, but, yes, it would have been bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We thought rather than have Carol Marcus be not used to a reasonable capacity, let’s just not include her, have her be alive, in canon, and be ready to come back at any time,” he concluded.\n\nThey did try to give a reason for her absence. “I think we had some lines to explain her absence in one of the initial drafts that had her going off to start work on the Genesis project and do sort of very, very early research on that,” Pegg went on to explain. “But it didn’t make it into the final cut.”\n\nCan I just say, as nice it would be to have her back, let’s not bring back Carol Marcus in a movie to do the Kelvin universe’s take on Genesis.

  "latent_31812": "With her oversized glasses and geek-girl enthusiasm, Lauren Bird, 22, a recent New York University grad, epitomizes a certain corner of online culture. Once a week, on a YouTube channel run by the Harry Potter Alliance, she posts a webcam video from her bedroom in Astoria, talking in a rapid-fire, fangirl way, using her love for Potterdom to change the actual world.\n\nThe future of civic engagement might wind up looking like this: A blend of fact and fiction, channeled toward a cause. If so, its model is the Somerville-based alliance, which connects the feverish online world of “fandom” to what’s known, in Internet jargon, as “IRL” — In Real Life.\n\nThe alliance was launched in 2005 by Andrew Slack, then a recent Brandeis graduate and aspiring comic who had discovered, in a series of post-collegiate jobs — at a summer camp in Winchester, a Boys and Girls Club in Cambridge — that the Harry Potter books, filled with themes of social justice, spoke strongly to kids from all backgrounds. The books had already inspired an online world of young, engaged, creative fans, who developed fan fiction and videos and met up IRL for “Wizard Rock” concerts and Quidditch competitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlack’s brainchild was to channel that enthusiasm into activism, to appeal to kids who weren’t into politics.\n\nGet Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\n“A lot of these kids are finding no access point to engage and no one willing to speak their language,” Slack told me. “I put everything into the framework of Harry Potter.” His first post declared that the world needed a real “Dumbledore’s Army” — like the student-led movement in the books — to alert the world to intractable problems.\n\nSlack first worked to raise awareness of climate change and genocide in Darfur. Over time, the alliance branched out, raising money to send underprivileged kids to camp and donating books in New York, Mississippi, and Rwanda. A 2010 campaign for Haiti earthquake relief, in conjunction with Partners in Health, raised $123,000, enough to fill five airplanes with supplies.\n\nThe alliance has also registered more than 1,000 young voters at “Wizard Rock the Vote” events, and taken part in phone banks for ballot questions: This month, members made 3,000 calls on behalf of marriage equality in Maine, and 900 calls for the DREAM Act in Maryland.\n\nSlack is hardly the first person to use the power of the entertainment industry for good works. But pop culture charity is often top-down, or filled with one-time bursts of celebrity-driven energy. I came of age with “We Are the World.” “American Idol” used to raise millions with a telethon. MTV is using its “Jersey Shore” cast to raise money for Hurricane Sandy relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes the Harry Potter Alliance different is that it’s user-generated, since “fandom” isn’t about consumption as much as participation. A fan world is a particularly strong draw, Slack says, for kids who feel mildly ostracized in school but embraced by geek culture online. (Harry Potter Alliance leaders make frequent, reverent reference to a community called the Nerdfighters, led by young-adult author John Green and his brother Hank.)\n\nSo the culture is a part of the process: This year’s phone banks, for instance, were accompanied by live-streamed videos by big names from the Potter fan world, and linked to a “House Cup” competition that earned points for members’ favorite houses in Hogwarts.\n\nAs Slack grows older — he’s in his 30s now, oh my! — the organization is adding new, younger faces. Bird joined as a video blogger, along with Julian Gomez, a 19-year-old from Florida who gained national attention for one video, in which he announced that he’s undocumented.\n\nSlack once worried that the interest in the alliance would wane when new Potter books and movies stopped coming out. But the ranks are still growing — fed, Bird suspects, by kids who grew up reading the Potter books and longing for the day they could join up online. And fans of other cultural phenomena, from “Glee” to “Doctor Who,” find affinity with the Potter universe: When the Hunger Games movies came out, the alliance worked with Oxfam on a “Hunger is Not a Game” campaign.\n\n“I tend to think of the Harry Potter fandom as the Beatles of fandom,” Bird told me. Could the Harry Potter Alliance be the Woodstock of the Millennials?\n\nJoanna Weiss can be reached at weiss@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @JoannaWeiss.",

All bound-up angst and wiry tension, Oberst was a guy with all the ideas and opinions in the world, but still unformed in terms of star power.\n\nThat has changed. With the aid of evocative video projections and a crack band — including keyboardist Laura Burhenn of Georgie James and The Mynabirds — he now presides over an epic rock show that spans a diverse discography. A career artist at 31, Oberst displays confident showmanship that's serious, even strident at times; naturally, he's not one to let the day's bombing of military targets in Libya go by without a few choice words to open \"Old Soul Song\" and the raging \"Road to Joy.\"\n\nThis year's The People's Key finds Oberst looking outside himself for far-reaching ruminations on humanity's place in the world, and that broad, searching quality makes the record a nice fit for the neighborhood-filling sound here. But the more obtuse explorations on The People's Key aren't sacrificed for the sake of expediency: Denny Brewer's album-opening theories about UFOs and life on earth open and close Bright Eyes' concert at SXSW's Auditorium Shores in Austin, Texas.

It adds up to many tens of millions of dollars in philanthropy: human services, education, arts, and health care,” said Governor Charlie Baker, who added that “it’s a shame his very gentlemanly and old-fashioned manner and kindness won’t be with us anymore. My wife said one time that he was a ‘sweet man,’ and I thought that was exactly right.”\n\nMr. Cutler was a musician who became a patron of the arts, an entrepreneur whose success deepened his community activism. His philanthropy addressed hunger and health care, education issues and Jewish causes — and even the cost of holiday lights for trees along the Commonwealth Avenue Mall. “People said, ‘Why did a Jewish couple put the lights on Commonwealth Avenue?’ The answer was because we care about the city,” he said in 2010, after his wife died.\n\n“Boston has lost a true philanthropic leader, and the lights will be a bit dimmer on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall with his passing,” Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston said in a statement. “We will work to ensure his legacy continues to shine a light on the City of Boston.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Cutler and his wife, who lived in the Back Bay, supported numerous causes, including the Greater Boston Food Bank, for which he cochaired the $35 million fund drive to construct a new building that opened in 2009. “If not for Teddy Cutler, there wouldn’t be a new food bank,” said Catherine D’Amato, the organization’s president and chief executive. She added that “thanks to his vision, we are able to feed over 140,000 people a month and provide nearly 48 million meals a year across Eastern Massachusetts. He believed everyone has a right to three meals a day.”\n\nA donation from the Cutlers was the lead gift toward restoration of the Majestic Theatre at Emerson College, where Mr. Cutler formerly chaired the board of trustees. In addition, he helped launch the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of New England and served on the boards of institutions including Combined Jewish Philanthropies, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Boston Ballet, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Although his influence extended to Israel — he raised funds and awareness for a food bank there, too — his greatest affection outside of his family was for his home. In 2011, the Massachusetts Cultural Council presented its Cultural Philanthropy award to Mr. Cutler’s family charitable trust.\n\n“We’re doing it here in the City of Boston because I happen to love the City of Boston,” he told WBUR-FM last year as he prepared for the Outside the Box festival. Mr. Cutler personally donated millions to cover most costs for the festivals, and until a couple of weeks ago was contemplating whether he could stage another one this summer.\n\nTheodore Cutler grew up on Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester, the son of David Cutler and the former Mary Baron. Though he was one of only two children, Mr. Cutler grew up in a large extended family of Russian immigrants, among them his parents, who arrived in the United States in the early 1900s.\n\nHis father was in the fruit business, and Mr. Cutler “would get up with him at 4 in the morning and go down to the market and get his wares for the day and set up the store,” said his daughter, Ellen Cutler Calmas of Brookline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Cutler soon turned to music, and though he insisted his talents were modest, he was called Smiling Ted when he sang and played bass for a cowboy band. Performing with his friend Jerry Benard in a group called the Benard Brothers, Mr. Cutler was known casually as Ted Benard, a name and reputation that stuck long past his playing days. For decades, he met people who insisted he had performed for their birthdays or bar mitzvahs.\n\nFor Mr. Cutler, music was a way to get him through Emerson College, from which he graduated in 1951 and to which he credited his future success. “When I told my dad I wanted to go to college he cried. I said, ‘Why are you crying?’ He said, ‘Because I can’t afford to send you to college.’ And I said, ‘Don’t worry about it, I’ll work my way through college,’ ” he recalled in a 2013 interview with Scott Mercer for the Boston Neighborhood Network that is posted on YouTube.\n\nMr. Cutler expanded his business from just performing to booking other bands, and then he and Irwin Chafetz, a friend from childhood, helped pioneer the charter tours industry with their travel companies, including American International Travel Service, which became a top New England travel agency.\n\nA subsequent travel business, GWV International, eventually folded into Interface, a business in which Mr. Cutler was partners with Sheldon Adelson, another friend from their Dorchester days. That partnership also included the Comdex trade shows, expositions for computer dealers. Mr. Cutler, Adelson, and their other partners eventually purchased the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas at the end of the 1980s and sold Comdex a few years later for more than $800 million.\n\nMr. Cutler told the Globe in 2015 that his wife initially suggested that they turn their attention to philanthropy. “She said, ‘Why don’t we help other people who have not been so lucky,’ ” he recalled, “and from that day on I’ve not taken a paycheck.”\n\nMr. Cutler married Joan Harriet Berman in 1953, after meeting her at a bridal shower for a mutual friend, and he liked to tell the story of how afterward he brought her to New York City for another social engagement. “On the way back, I said, ‘You know, I’m probably going to marry you,’ and she said, ‘Shut up and keep driving.’ I chased her and chased her,” he recalled for her obituary, when she died in 2010.\n\nMr. Cutler “adored his family,” his daughter said. “He lived to make his family’s life better. He was interested in every aspect of what was going on in his grandchildren’s lives. They, and my brothers and I, and our spouses, were always the center of his life.”\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Mr. Cutler leaves his two sons, Robert and Joel, both of Boston; eight grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 12:45 p.m. Sunday in Temple Israel in Boston. Interment and shiva observances will follow.\n\nMr. Cutler and his wife were sought after in philanthropy circles as much for their geniality as their generosity, and many were happy to just be at his side when he walked into a room.\n\n“When I was with Teddy, it was like being with God’s nephew — you were instantly credible and welcome,” D’Amato said. “If you were with him, you must be OK.”\n\nHis faith, and the Jewish concept of tikkun olam — the shared responsibility to repair the world — were “extremely important to him,” his daughter said. “It helped define who he was.”\n\nReflecting in 2003 on his success as a businessman, a philanthropist, and a family man, Mr. Cutler said: “If God could ask, ‘What do you want?’ I’d say, ‘Please take care of somebody else. I’m doing just fine.’ ”\n\nBryan Marquard can be reached at bryan.marquard@globe.com",

Josie, who grew up on the Autism spectrum had never had a traditional birthday party that many of us take for granted.\n\n“Being Autistic, I’ve always had difficulty making and keeping friends. I can’t help but feel disappointed when everybody my age goes out with friends or has a big party. It makes me feel like I'm not worth getting to know,\" Josie said. \"To me, birthdays should always be a big deal, no matter if you're one or eight or 15 or 37, 62 or 103! Birthdays are a marker of your life; you've made it another year, a little older, a little wiser.\"\n\nBut Saturday, she enjoyed the presence (and presents!) of many people around her age with with a party at Oaks Amusement Park. Lord of the Rings costumes optional - but preferred by Josie.\n\n\"My mom and my grandparents... strived really hard over the years to make my birthday special, but the friend aspect was not so much. So it was mostly just my family,\" Josie said.\n\nLaura Wolfenson, who's with the organization \"RISE\" and works with Josie on life-skills, helped make the party happen. The word got out about her party, and a group of friends and strangers arrived to celebrate - and make up for the party Josie never had.\n\n\"I've never seen her smile as big as she is now, part of the reason I get teary eyed,\" said Wolfenson. \"Lots of love, lots of people... it's really amazing.\"",
  "latent_32021": "Donald Trump’s “empty apology” tour pleading for forgiveness from the minority groups he demonized during this campaign made a new stop Tuesday night. This time he attempted to woo Latino voters by appearing on Sean Hannity’s Fox News “immigration special” to announce he was open to “softening” his plan to deport all 11-plus million undocumented immigrants. Shockingly, Trump even stated that some of the undocumented immigrants are “great people.” (Of course, he noted some were “really horrible.”)\n\nThis follows Trump’s attempt to gain support with the African-American community over the last few nights with his bizarrely worded plea: “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs.” He added, “What the hell do you have to lose?”\n\nAfter hearing that speech, I’m really praying Trump doesn’t try to reach out TO Muslim Americans. I can just picture him delivering an equally bigoted sales pitch to my community: “Muslims, why not vote for me?! After all, I’m practically Muslim: I don’t drink alcohol and I’ve had three wives. Plus, I love the hummus. And I understand your community. I have had many conversations with people driving my taxicabs and at the deli. Add to that we share another common trait: We both treat women really badly—you cover them up and I call them ‘dogs’ and ‘pigs.’ So why the hell not vote for me!”\n\nBut the real reason Trump shouldn’t reach out to the Muslim community—even though Muslims could play a deciding role in certain key swing states like Florida, Ohio, and Michigan—is that there’s nothing he can say to persuade us to support him after all the hate he has sent our way.\n\nNow to be clear, the Muslim-American community is not monolithic. There are some Muslims supporting Trump. In fact, I debated the head of “Muslims for Trump”—an organization I believe boasts a membership of one—on CNN and MSNBC. And there are some Muslims who have problems with Hillary Clinton for various reasons, primarily tied to her hawkish views. But few Muslims I know are supporting Trump—and I know a lot of Muslims.\n\nWhile there’s no recent polling of Muslim-American voters, I’d predict that Trump’s support in our community is in the single digits—the same support Trump is now seeing from the African-American community. (Keep in mind that African Americans make up about a third of the Muslim community in the United States.)\n\nI doubt Trump is surprised or frankly cares that Muslims are overwhelmingly opposed to him. If he did, he wouldn’t have made demonizing Muslims a staple of his campaign from the start.\n\nEven before Trump’s infamous call in December for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” he had been stoking hate versus our community. It first began when Trump fabricated a claim that “thousands” of Muslims cheered in New Jersey on 9/11—a tale so tall that even cheerleader in chief Rudy Giuliani conceded it was not accurate.\n\nFrom there Trump said he was open to special ID cards and a database to register all Muslims in America. He has called for profiling of Muslim Americans. And just a few days ago on Fox News, Trump declared that Muslim Americans know about terrorists but are not speaking out, adding, “if they’re not going to help us, they’re to blame also.”\n\nThe truth—something Trump ignores when demonizing minority groups—is that Muslim Americans have been working closely with law enforcement to prevent terror attacks. We all recall that the FBI had investigated the Orlando gunman before his attack. Want to guess who had tipped off the FBI about him that triggered that investigation? A Muslim-American member of the community concerned by his alarming rhetoric.\n\nHere’s the thing that Trump doesn’t get about minorities, be they African American, Latino, Muslim, LGBT, Jewish, LGBT, you name it: If you pivot on a policy issue that hurts our community, in time we might forgive you. But when you intentionally demonize us for political gain, we will never, ever forget that.\n\nDoes Trump really believe that Latinos—whom he has demonized from Day 1 of his campaign—will suddenly support him because he met briefly with a few Latino leaders or now says that he’s open to “softening” his deportation plan? That a few speeches to white audiences about how much he cares for African Americans will erase memories of him defending his supporters beating up black protesters? Or his racist birther campaign against Preisdent Obama? And on and on and on.\n\nAs we minorities know, Trump wouldn’t be reaching out to any of us if he were winning in the polls. Trump does not truly “regret” his words demonizing our respective communities. Trump’s only regret is that there are not enough white supremacists to elect him president.\n\nSo Trump, don’t waste your time reaching out to Muslim Americans. We don’t want a seat on the Trump train. We would rather walk than share a ride with the bigots sitting on it.",

  "latent_32717": "In 1953, columnist Henry McLemore made it clear that he hoped to be dead and gone before \"the future\" arrives. What was McLemore so concerned about? All those damn flying machines — 20 million, in theory — that would be buzzing around by the year 2000.\n\nMcLemore was upset by the predictions of one Major Alexander P. de Seversky, who made his name in the U.S. during World War II with a book called Victory Through Air Power. In the postwar world, de Seversky predicted that the skies would soon be filled with millions of helicopters. But McLemore was having none of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a syndicated column that appeared in American newspapers on October 12, 1953, McLemore — a man who's best remembered today for his hate-filled promotion of the idea that Japanese-Americans should be forced into camps during World War II — was convinced that the civilian-piloted helicopters of tomorrow would lead to disaster. And McLemore was pretty happy that he wouldn't be around to see it.\n\nI am very grateful for Major Alexander P. de Seversky. The man is a great comfort to me. Whenever I feel sad about not being able to be around to celebrate New Year's Eve in the year 2000, or to see the Kentucky Derby of 2051, or to hear a crooner sing \"I Believe\" for the billionth time in 2053, I always think of the Major. Well, not so much the Major, as the predictions for the future which he gives out on all sunny or overcast days. The Major's tomorrow is one that makes me happy that I will be out of it all, gliding about on my wings, looking for a Heavenly milk and honey stand that sells \"All You Can Drink for 15 Cents.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe well respected de Seversky, much like the aviators who would come before him, always had his eye on the future. McLemore pokes fun at de Seversky's constant stream of new predictions by giving his latest an absurdly high and random number — and labeling it a bulletin of things to come.\n\nLast week (on a sunny day) the Major issued Bulletin No. 222,441 on Things to Come. It dealt with what will be happening in the skies 50 years or so from now, and it is a pretty terrifying picture that it paints. For one thing, he said, that come 2000 A.D. would be 20,000,000 helicopters over America, \"hopping around like fleas.\" Figuring five people to a helicopter, that will still leave something like 100,000,000 folks on the ground, and I'd like to ask Major de Seversky what they'll be doing. Hopping won't be enough. That's for sure. The comparatively few helicopters we have now occasionally cause the skies to sound like a giant cake mixing bowl. With 20,000,000 helicopters stirring around, you can bet there will be at least one baby in a million of them, and you don't have to have the imagination of the Major to visualize them throwing things out and down. With a million babies dropping things, small states like Rhode Island and Vermont will be lucky to survive the obliteration on the first Labor Day weekend. And such nice states, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLemore then gets into one of the most common concerns raised by people about the prospect of flying cars (or in this case, personal helicopters): If people are such terrible drivers on the road today, what makes us think they'll be any better in the air?\n\nWhat about accidents? The Major says electronics will make them impossible. He can tell that to the Man in the Moon, who, by the way, the Major says we will be able to reach in three and a half hours. The same sort of people who are driving automobiles today will be at the wheels of helicopters and a little thing like radar isn't going to stop them from banging into the helicopter in front of them at red lights, or making the wrong hand signal when banking into Milky Way Drive or Celestial Circle. Anyone who works in the garden on a Sunday afternoon will be crazy, what with helicopter fenders and tail lights raining down. The only creatures who'll be safe are moles, and perhaps turtles and armadillos who own tin hats. Parents, particularly mothers, won't get much sleep what with children dating in helicopters. They won't close their eyes until they hear something land on the roof and they won't know then if what has laded is all in one piece. With all the travel by air — and the Major says the car will be as obsolete as the horse and buggy — there are bound to be drive-in hamburger stands in the sky. People will demand them. How would you like to be hit by a carhop who has slipped and fallen 20,000 feet? Or by a double-dip chocolate float? The Major predicts that mail and freight will be shot around the world in guided missiles. These wouldn't be very nice epitaphs, would they? Here lies Joe, a perfect host, Until he got hit by Parcel Post. Here rests a cousin of Georgie Jessel, Taken away by an Air Mail Special Yes, you can have the Major's year 2000.\n\nMcLemore is really only remembered here in the 21st century for being a despicable bigot. \"Personally, I hate the Japanese,\" he wrote in 1942. \"And that goes for all of them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo even though we don't have 20 million personal helicopters dotting our skies, let me agree with just one of McLemore's statements: we're pretty happy you didn't live to see the future either.\n\nIllustration: The 1942 commuter airplane of tomorrow by industrial designer Richard H.
