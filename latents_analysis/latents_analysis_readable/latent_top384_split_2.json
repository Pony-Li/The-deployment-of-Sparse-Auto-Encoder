Responsible national action and effective international cooperation are therefore required for strengthening nuclear security to prevent vulnerable nuclear material falling into hands of non-state actors,\" First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations Abhishek Singh said.\n\nSingh, in a statement on the annual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the UN General Assembly here yesterday, said India has consistently supported IAEA's important role in facilitating national efforts to strengthen nuclear security and in fostering effective international cooperation.\n\nHe said as part of implementation of the arrangement with the IAEA concerning India's voluntary contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund, the services of Indian cost-free expert in information security are being provided to the Division of Nuclear Security of the IAEA.\n\nSingh noted that the universal adherence to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials (CPPNM) and early entry into force of its 2005 Amendment would go a long way in strengthening global efforts in the area of nuclear security.\n\nThe amended Convention would make it legally binding for states parties to protect nuclear facilities and material in peaceful domestic use, storage as well as transport.\n\nSingh said India is party to the CPPNM and is amongst the countries which have ratified the 2005 amendment to the Convention.\n\nSingh emphasised that India's commitment to harnessing the benefits of nuclear energy for electricity production while according the highest priority to nuclear safety and security.\n\n\"India will need to rapidly raise the energy production to meet its growing energy requirements to achieve its developmental goals. Nuclear energy is an essential component of our energy basket,\" he said.\n\nUnderscoring India's commitment to implementing the highest standards for safety of its nuclear power plants and associated fuel cycle facilities, Singh said India will continue to participate and assist the IAEA Secretariat in its endeavour to enhance nuclear safety through the cluster of measures it has formulated in the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety.\n\nSingh said the agency has an important role in allaying misapprehensions in the public and member states about the safety of nuclear power plants taking into account the current advances in relevant design and technology areas.\n\nAs part of India's commitment to implement the highest standards for the safety of Indian nuclear power plants, several steps have been taken to organise peer reviews at national and international level, Singh said adding that a \"follow up mission\" of the IAEA Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) to India for Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) units took place in February this year.\n\nSingh stressed the crucial role nuclear energy plays in achieving the objectives of India's sustainable economic growth.\n\nHe said the country is at the same time extensively engaged in development of nuclear technologies in diverse fields extending beyond nuclear power, including isotope applications for improved crop varieties, crop protection and post-harvest technologies, radio-isotope applications for diagnostic and therapeutic uses in health care and technologies for safe drinking water.\n\nSingh noted the importance attached by India to IAEA's work in the fields of nuclear science.\n\n\"We contribute to these activities through participation in the Technical Meetings and coordinated Research Projects and also support the IAEA's programme in nuclear fusion,\" he said.\n\nSingh said the agency's programme and achievements in relation to nuclear applications in food and agriculture, human health and nutrition, water resources management, protection of the environment and industry make a valuable contribution to meeting the needs of the developing countries.\n\n\"India is highly appreciative of the IAEA's efforts in cancer management, and in particular the Programme on Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). India would continue to support agency activities in these areas, including by offering service of experts and training fellows in reputable institutions in the country,\" he said.\n\nSingh told the UN General Assembly that the first unit of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, which achieved its first criticality in July last year, is now operating at close to its full rated power of 1000 MWe.\n\nThe second unit is in an advanced stage of commissioning and construction of the 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is nearing completion at Kalpakkam and is expected to achieve first criticality in the next six months, Singh said.",
  "latent_110": "It looks realistic. But it can look so much better. Words like Nvidia GTX 580 and Radeon 6990 are terms that are about to get heaps more popular.\n\nSeveral years ago, tech journos like me would revel in benchmarking hardware using the latest games. Far Cry, Call of Duty 2, and Crysis were all so good that you felt compelled to play them at their best settings using the latest hardware. But that all ground to a halt. What happened? And could Battlefield 3 be responsible for re-igniting a demand for the latest computing components?\n\nIf you read most technology magazines back then, you'd have seen heaps of computer component reviews - principally graphics cards, motherboards and processors. One of the main reasons one would need to know about these would be because you'd need to have the latest to play the latest games. This is why hardware manufacturers always try and succeed in the gaming market. It's huge. Or at least it was.\n\nOne of the first games of recent times that we got excited about was Far Cry (early 2004). Before that, Unreal Tournament 2003 had come to pretty much represent the definitive level of video games and if your PC ran that using the best settings, then it was something of a beast. Having come out in late 2002, however, it was feeling a bit long in the tooth. Then early teasers of Far Cry grabbed everyone's imagination. Its use of High Dynamic Range lighting wowed everyone as it represented a huge step towards the cinematic gaming goal that developers and hardware makers were aiming for. It was set on a beautiful tropical island with amazing colours and details. It was so amazing, many people spent time going for little walks just to admire the scenery rather than shoot the bad guys. I did that. You could play it at lower settings with the special effects turned off, but that felt like a travesty and was missing the point of the game.\n\nTo illustrate just how far PCs were ahead of consoles back then, remember that later in 2004, Halo 2 (whose graphics looked generations behind Far Cry) was launched on the original Xbox. Doom 3 appeared on PC around the same time and while that wasn't quite the success we hoped it would be, it too was a hardware-punishing game that set new standards for realistic gaming on the PC (quick aside - Half-Life 2 appeared in November that year and mercifully showed developers that a stunning-looking game didn't have to use a monster computer to look its best.)\n\nBut after a year or so of getting used to Half-Life 2's high framerates and high detail settings (and allowing the not-so-early adopters to catch up with their system upgrades), another game appeared which would spark not just a new wave of upgrades but the largest media franchise of all time: Call of Duty 2. I reckon it took just a few minutes of playing that game before anyone would realise its brilliance. It was by far the most realistic and cinematic game to date and essentially let us re-enact World War II. We used it for a computer benchmark for years, such was the punishing toll it took on graphics cards.\n\nBut just when you thought that you couldn't possibly need to upgrade again, up popped the stunningly-beautiful, Oblivion in early 2006. This amazing Dungeons and Dragons-ish role playing game was another one you could lose yourself in for very many hours and the idea of turning off all the amazing realistic graphics effects felt like sacrilege. Mercifully there was a bit of a break until we needed to upgrade again after this and, well, then things changed.\n\nI reckon the real peak of the last round of triumphant PC gaming came with November 2007's Crysis. Crysis was the follow up to Far Cry and so expectations were enormous. It didn't disappoint. It looked phenomenal and offered stunning gameplay thanks to the protagonist's nanosuit which could power-up and turn invisible. But there wasn't a computer invented that could play the thing with all effects turned on. Hardware eventually did catch up but this coincided with a few things happening.\n\nCrysis is arguably the first game (or one of the first) that hit a graphical level which didn't really need to be bettered. How much more real did you really need a game to look?\n\nIt was also a time when the Xbox 360 and PS3 were really making huge steps into becoming the most profitable games platforms and they both exhibited graphical levels that could match the PC (which had traditionally been capable - at least potentially - of trouncing the performance of consoles). The consoles could play Crysis. They'd later show us that they could also play drop dead gorgeous-looking games like Red Dead Redemption, Halo: Reach and Uncharted. Why should anyone focus mainly on a PC anymore? Why keep having to pay for expensive upgrades and stress over whether a game would work on your particular PC when you knew the best games would just work on the consoles?\n\nWhatever the reasons, we've spent the past four-or-five years experiencing the \"consolization of games\". Virtually all PC games plateaued at a level where consoles could also play them comfortably: they look great and developers haven't felt the need to push boundaries beyond what consoles can handle. Gears of War (one of the Xbox 360's first big hits) looked great back in 2006. Halo: Reach might look far superior, but it all uses the same hardware - it just shows what you can do when you don't rely on brute force of the hardware to improve graphics and instead tighten up your coding.\n\nI haven't felt like I needed to upgrade my PC graphics since Crysis. Back then an Nvidia 9800 would do it. I've used the same chipset since.\n\nBut for the first time in years, I think PC games are about to step ahead once more.\n\nThe recent Witcher 2 needed a mighty computer to play it at its best although you could still have a great experience with older hardware. But good as it was, it didn't get the masses out buying it.\n\nMore recently, at a launch event for Battlefield 3, the host's fleet of one-year-old hardcore gaming PCs was deemed unsuitable by publisher Electronic Arts as they weren't powerful enough to show the game off to its full potential.\n\nEA had a point. The teaser trailers of actual gameplay from Battlefield 3 are stunningly realistic and represent an amazing technical achievement whether you like shooter games or not. Here's a screenshot below.\n\nBattlefield 3. You could be watching a film.\n\nBut when I installed the game, my water-cooled Nvidia 9800 GTX SLI graphics cards were dismissed by the game as inadequate. Turns out they were right. These were state of the art just a few years ago.\n\nA hardcore gamer setup of water-cooled twin 9800 GTX graphics cards in SLI. Or as we call them today, \"old hat.\"\n\nBut while the technology has well and truly superseded those cards, there's been no compelling reason to buy into it. The 9800 GTXs have handled everything I've thrown at them. Until now. Thanks to Battlefield 3, here's what I'm seeing...\n\nI've barely noticed the past few generations of graphics cards. Now... I'm fascinated to see what's available.\n\nI can just about achieve smooth gameplay with the cards parallel processing together. A single 9800 GTX chugs and jerks along though. And that's with all settings dialled down to minimum...\n\nI haven't seen such depressing performance for years. It's great!\n\nI've decided to stop playing the single player part of the game - it's been widely-described as a technology demo anyway, so there's no point in grinding through the mediocre storyline if you're not going to admire the visuals along the way - at the best quality possible.\n\nGreat graphics, worthy of any console. This is the lowest playable quality the PC version of BF3 can muster.\n\nBut the multiplayer is downright outstanding. Reviews are starting to appear but they're all going to have very high scores indeed. I'm going to be spending a great deal of time on this game and so looking at second rate visuals is just not going to cut it. The game might not be perfect as a whole, but it's got it where it counts.\n\nAsking around the Good Game office, they're using top-of-the-line cards accross the board. Other game and tech journos have agreed that now is the time they'll upgrade their computers. This will be great news to umpteen hardware brands who will finally be able to think about selling $500 components to the general public again - not just ultra-enthusiasts and competitive overclockers.\n\nIt can't be underestimated what the long term effects of this will be. If a huge sector of gamers upgrade their PCs then there will be a boom in computer and component sales. It should also push the PC back in front of the consoles meaning that we should see next-generation consoles sooner rather than later. From a media point of view, there should be more advertising and hopefully a boom in tech publishing... which helps drive the technology industry in return.\n\nCertainly, having the same level of gaming performance for the past five years has had some great benefits. If you bought your first Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 today, you could go and binge on old or second-hand games and pick up absolute gems like Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto 4 and Halo: Reach for a fraction of their original prices and be safe in the knowledge that you were playing a game that still looked awesome.\n\nBut it's time to move on. Hopefully, Battlefield 3 will be the spur. If not alone it could be helped by Oblivion's successor, the imminent Skyrim. Whatever the case, the component manufacturers are feeling very optimistic right now, as are tech publishers. Gamers, meanwhile, are spoilt rotten for choice, whatever platform they prefer. But the future is that bit brighter for PC gamers, in my humble opinion.",
  "latent_141": "Now 4 US copyright holders have spoken out, including the president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights -- RFK’s daughter, Kerry Kennedy\n\nPublished 2:38 PM, November 10, 2012\n\nMANILA, Philippines - Long is the saga of Sottogate, yet allegations against Senator Tito Sotto continue.\n\nNow 4 US copyright holders have spoken out, including the president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights: RFK’s daughter, Kerry Kennedy.\n\nAll this began again the other day, when Sarah Pope, Janice Formichella, and Peter Engelman issued a joint statement alleging that Sotto had “infringed on our intellectual property rights and plagiarized.”\n\nTheir protest was swiftly dismissed by Sotto and his staff, who, according to GMA News, “questioned its authenticity, pointing out that it did not even have an official letterhead.”\n\nThis, after Sotto’s chief of staff, Hector Villacorta, reportedly said they would address the issue only after the aggrieved parties complained.\n\nComplain they have, in no uncertain terms. Yet when Formichella wrote about the issue in Ms. Magazine, Sotto churlishly said: “She is pathetic. She is just riding on to get famous.”\n\nWhen Engelman wrote a statement, he was ignored completely. And when Sotto was asked about his alleged plagiarism of Kennedy’s speech, our Senate Majority Leader replied: “The people who think this is plagiarism should think again. I did not copy it, I translated it. Do they know the spelling of ‘copy’ and ‘translate’? They have low IQ!”\n\nAnd so I present to Messrs Sotto and Villacorta this fourth complaint. On official letterhead. From someone who knows the spelling of copy and translate, and undeniably needs not ride on to get famous. Such is Ms Kennedy’s track record in continuing her father’s legacy.\n\nKerry Kennedy's letter to Senator Vicente Sotto\n\nComplaint\n\nWhat now? Kennedy’s complaint, along with that of the other 3 writers, will be added to next week’s case before the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges.\n\nIt is being filed by a long list of concerned Filipinos, who are trusting the mechanisms of our democracy. They know that too often we let wrongs rouse us, tire us, and retire into forgetting. Their case, at the very least, will reveal the true mettle of the Senate as it scrutinizes one of their own.\n\nSo grab your popcorn; the curtains are being drawn open. There will be doubt cast over the authenticity of these letters, though journalists from respected Philippine news organizations will have already contacted the parties involved to confirm them. There will be assertions that plagiarism isn’t a crime, though this case is a question of Senate ethics; besides, Justice Secretary Leila De Lima has already said that plagiarism is indeed a criminal offence under existing Philippine law and under the Cybercrime Act.\n\nThere will even be conspiracy theories that this is a surrogate attack regarding other issues, such as the RH Bill, though such inevitable overlaps can’t diminish the validity of the plagiarism allegations and the clarity of Sotto’s transgressions.\n\nAnd there will be aspersions cast on those who continue to speak out against Sotto, though they’ve only ever sought comment, discussion, and the due process before the appropriate judging body; nothing ever wrong with holding our leaders accountable and seeing something through to the proper end.\n\nIt’s now up to us—to demand honesty, transparency, and accountability from the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges. Sotto may have threatened his critics with the draconian defamation section of the Cybercrime Act, but even censorship can be less insidious than our inattentiveness, cynicism, and short-memories—what certain politicians count on for longevity. The committee must know we’re behind them.\n\nFor theirs is no enviable mandate. The onus is on them to prove they can act justly, serving our democracy and not themselves or each other. (Remember: As Senate Majority Leader, Sotto is also an ex-officio member of the committee, comprised of his workmates.)\n\nTheir company of seven is the conscience and soul of that august body, tasked with “all matters relating to the conduct, rights, privileges, safety, dignity, integrity and reputation of the Senate and its Members.”\n\nWe should let them know we care. I urge you to email the committee members if you agree that Tito Sotto’s conduct abused those rights and privileges, made a mockery of the dignity and integrity of the Senate, and endangered its reputation.\n\nTheir chairperson is Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, and the other committee members are Senators Miriam Defensor Santiago, Gregorio Honasan, Loren Legarda, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Lito Lapid, and Joker Arroyo.\n\nIt’ll take you barely a minute.\n\nEven feel free to \"sottocopy\" the handy statement below to their email addresses (taken from the official Senate website): Alancayetano@yahoo.com; miriam@miriam.com.ph; gringobhonasan@gmail.com; loren@lorenlegarda.com.ph; inquiry.bbmoffice@gmail.com; sen.litolapid@senate.gov.ph; office_sen_jokerarroyo@yahoo.com\n\nHonorable Senator:\n\nI am one of thousands of concerned Filipino citizens protesting the disreputable conduct of Senate Majority Leader Tito Sotto. I call on the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges to address this important issue of ethics, integrity, and accountability. I believe Senator Sotto’s speeches unethically plagiarized and illegally infringed on intellectual copyright laws in the Philippines and in countries with whom we are connected through the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\n\nI believe Sotto’s subsequent denials insulted the intelligence and dignity of Filipinos everywhere, and that his threats to censor his critics with the Cybercrime Act constitute an abuse of power and an attack on free speech. I believe that the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges has the right, the mandate, and the courage to censure their colleague.\n\nI believe in Philippine democracy, and call on you, the leaders we elected, to ensure its proper, just, and ethical function. - Rappler.com\n\n(The author is a freelance writer.

  "latent_212": "Greetings from Miami, Florida, the gorgeous home of South Beach, LeBron and Wade, Pat Riley and the Miami Mafia, David Caruso’s sunglasses, the strongest coffee in America, Crockett and Tubbs (both semi-retired), my media nemesis Papi Le Batard (he calls me the “Great Houdini”), Ryan Tannehill and Giancarlo Stanton, Dan Marino’s empty Super Bowl trophy case (sorry, I had to), an even emptier state-of-the-art baseball stadium, The U Part 1 and Part 2 (that’s right, we’re making a Part 2!), the world’s highest percentage of knockout women who happen to be walking small dogs, and, of course, Jalen Rose’s two best friends, Juwan Howard and the four-pound lobster tempura at Prime 112.\n\nIt’s an amazing city, one of those places that makes you feel like you’re walking around a 24-hour movie set. It also has just about nothing in common with Indianapolis, a lovable city in its own right for an entirely different set of reasons. In fact, they barely have any direct flights between Indy and Miami, just a bunch of connections through Atlanta, Houston or wherever. It’s like the airlines decided, “Why the hell would anyone fly from Indianapolis to Miami unless it was for the NBA or the Indy 500?”\n\nI planned on writing off Game 2 and the NBA lottery for Wednesday, figuring I could bang the piece out on my two flights (Indy to Atlanta, then Atlanta to Miami). One problem: I forgot to charge my laptop. What a rookie mistake. Jesus. Instead, we’re audibling to the Self-NBA Mailbag! Because the Grantland email page that forwards me reader emails has been broken since last weekend. (As soon as we fix it, I’ll post something on my Facebook page.) So I’m going to attempt to GUESS your questions. Unlike always, these are not actual emails from actual readers.\n\nQ: Cleveland just won the NBA lottery for the third time in four years. Does this mean that God doesn’t hate Cleveland anymore?\n\nA: Or, you could say that He hates Cleveland so much that He gets bored just having them flounder or lose in agonizing ways, so occasionally, He sprinkles in a little extra hope just so He can squash it later. I would keep my guard up, Cleveland.\n\nQ: You mentioned on TV that “we need new rules” after Cleveland won the lottery again. What are those new rules?\n\nA: I barely remember this because I was trying so diligently to avoid becoming the first ESPN talking head to say “motherf—er” on live TV. No offense, Cleveland fans. I’m happy for you. Lord knows you suffered enough over the past 50 years, and you certainly deserved some extended Ping-Pong luck after getting shanked by LeBron four summers ago.\n\nFor me, this was about the failure of rewarding a relentlessly incompetent organization. I ranked the Cavs last in Tuesday’s Lottery Karma Rankings for basketball reasons only. They wasted seven LeBron years and never found him the right help (or came up with a smart long-term plan to build around him). They went through three coaches and two GMs since 2009 … including the same coach twice (one year into a five-year deal, no less). They had four top-four picks in three years and thought Kyrie Irving and Dion Waiters could coexist. They vowed to make the playoffs 12 months ago, then proceeded to unleash the strangest collection of front-office moves in recent league history — here’s a team that spent five picks renting Luol Deng and Spencer Hawes so they could get swept in Round 1, and they couldn’t even make the playoffs.\n\nThe NBA treats franchises like Cleveland the same way absentee billionaire fathers treat their screwup sons — just keep buying them stuff and throwing money into their accounts and everything will be fine, right? (In real life, that same screwup son is ruining the Knicks for 13 straight years.) I just hate the mentality of repeatedly enabling poorly run franchises with the league’s best incoming talent.\n\nHere you go, Cleveland — I bought you another Ferrari, try not to crash this one!\n\nAnd by the way, it’s not just the Cavs. Minnesota just made its 10th-straight lottery. Sacramento just landed its sixth-straight top-seven pick. Washington made the 2014 playoffs only after landing the no. 5, no. 1, no. 6, no. 3 and no. 3 picks from 2009 through 2013. I can’t accept that we created a professional basketball league in which …\n\nA. The same incompetent teams get rewarded — repeatedly, over and over again — for being incompetent.\n\nB. The same team in a 30-team league can win the no. 1 overall pick three times in four years.\n\nC. We refuse to put any rules in place to temper A and B.\n\nQ: Is this response ever going to end? Can you tell us what those “new rules” would be?\n\nA: Sure …\n\nRule No. 1: Once you win the no. 1 overall pick, you can’t win it again for four years.\n\nIf four years is good enough for an Olympic cycle or a presidential term, it’s good enough for the same team getting the no. 1 pick.\n\nRule No. 2: No team can get two top-three picks in a three-year span.\n\nIn other words, anyone who landed a top-three lottery pick in 2012 or 2013 would have been ineligible for 2014’s lottery drawing. We’d toss their Ping-Pong balls out and everything. So on Wednesday, the Cavs would have been stuck at no. 9, Orlando would have been relegated to fourth or lower, and everyone else would have had better chances.\n\nRule No. 3: You can trade future Ping-Pong ball combinations to any other potential lottery team.\n\nI’m suggesting this one for three reasons: It’s easier than it sounds, it would be an incredibly fun wrinkle for the Trade Machine, and the Cavaliers absolutely would have been dumb enough to do it last February (saving us from the stupidity of them winning another no. 1 pick).\n\nHere’s how it would work: There are 1,001 Ping-Pong combinations in all. The worst team gets 250 of them (25 percent), then the numbers start dwindling from there by record. The Cavs had 17 combinations, giving them a 1.7 percent chance at winning the lottery. So let’s say the NBA made the following rule: You can include your future Ping-Pong combos in any trade, but it has to be either 50 percent of them or 100 percent of them. And let’s say Philly and Cleveland were discussing their Spencer Hawes deal in February, and Philly said, “Instead of that additional second-round pick, we want your 2014 Ping-Pong ball combos.” And let’s say Cleveland agreed.\n\nHow would that have affected the 2014 lottery? Cleveland would have been stuck in its spot (ninth overall), with no chance of advancing. Philly would’ve jumped from 199 to 216 Ping-Pong combos (a 21.6 percent chance for no. 1), eventually winning the no. 1 pick with Cleveland’s Ping-Pong combo. And then, we could have made fun of Cleveland for being dumb enough to trade their Ping-Pong combos just so Spencer Hawes could help them NOT make the playoffs. See? Everyone wins!!!!!! Well, except for Cleveland fans.\n\nBut if those three rules get voted down, then let’s at least add this one …\n\nRule No. 4: If any NBA team wins the lottery for the third time in four years, the team’s representative isn’t allowed to celebrate in any way.\n\nWhat are they allowed to do? Nothing. They just have to stand there stoically and soak in their own shame. No fist-pumping, no smiling, nothing. At least give me that.\n\nQ: Were the 2014 Thunder finished from the moment their team doctor said, “Serge is out for the playoffs”?\n\nA: Yeah, probably. I thought they could compete because of Durant and Westbrook, but they lost their athletic advantage. Think about the 2012 Thunder when they fell behind 2-0 to the Spurs, then swept the next four games — that team had Durant, Westbrook, Ibaka AND Harden, and Kawhi Leonard wasn’t close to being Sugar K. Leonard yet. The difference in quickness/athleticism/explosiveness was actually kind of startling. Two years later, we’re down to Durant and Westbrook on one side and a blossoming Kawhi on the other. So much for OKC’s massive quickness/athleticism/explosiveness advantage. Throw in the Popovich/Brooks coaching mismatch and OKC’s inability to find a lineup that can score and defend at the same time, and it’s looking bleak for OKC. So bleak that I’m not even going to bring up the You-Know-What trade again.\n\nQ: When Ibaka got knocked out for the playoffs two days after you wrote that “What if this is OKC’s last shot?” column, did any OKC fans blame you for jinxing the team?\n\nA: Of course! They sent me hundreds and hundreds of emails about it! And not just that, but at least 25 still-bitter Sonics fans thanked me for ruining Ibaka’s season, too. Who knew I had the powers to tear Ibaka’s calf muscle? Could I just keep doing that to people? Am I like the Carrie of sports columnists? Miami fans — I would definitely NOT dump a bucket of pig’s blood on my head during Game 3 or Game 4 of the Eastern finals.\n\nQ: Are you disappointed that Milwaukee didn’t win the lottery, followed by Arn Tellem refusing to show them Joel Embiid’s medical records and bullying them into taking someone else?\n\nA: I was really looking forward to that! I love when Arn Tellem goes Frank Underwood on us. No way Milwaukee could have taken Embiid without knowing if the stress fracture in his back totally healed. I’d totally back Tellem’s candidacy in the 2016 presidential election. Anyone who could pull off this Embiid/medical records thing just 10 months after getting New Orleans to spend $44 million on Tyreke Evans probably just needs to run our country. By the way, Embiid’s back is fine. I watched him work out last week.\n\nQ: Wait … what? You watched Joel Embiid work out last week?\n\nA: Yes — at a secret location in Santa Monica. He wasn’t playing against anyone, just going through a two-hour workout with Will Perdue. Here’s what I can tell you: He moves around as effortlessly as a 7-foot Serge Ibaka; he’s such an athletic freak that he’s one of those “still going up as he’s finishing the dunk” guys; his freakish wingspan might make Jay Bilas pass out; he has been playing basketball for only four years (which seems impossible); he gave up a world-class volleyball career; he has 3-point range; he can shoot jump-hooks with both hands already; he couldn’t have seemed more coachable/agreeable/likable; he’s a hard worker with a goofy sense of humor; his voice is just a touch Mutombo-y (deep with a heavy African accent); and his friends call him “Jo-Jo.” And again — his back seemed totally fine.\n\nNews flash: As I said on TV before the lottery, Embiid was always going first. None of these teams was passing on him. Repeat: none of them. The amount of smokescreening going on in April and May was high comedy. We keep hearing his back is really screwed up, this could be another Oden situation … Just stop it. This was like sitting at a fantasy football auction next to someone who kept claiming that he wasn’t going to pay big money for a QB … and then, two hours later, he’s bidding $49 for Aaron Rodgers. The truth is, Wiggins and Parker never separated themselves enough this season to warrant anyone saying, “We’re passing on a potential franchise center with a good chance of becoming the 7-foot Serge Ibaka.”\n\nQ: Should Bucks fans take it personally that Tellem planned on freezing them out for Embiid?\n\nProbably a little. It’s sad that Milwaukee turned into the new Clippers, right? A.k.a. the Team Nobody Wants To Play For? At least they have Mallory Edens, who won the Internet on Tuesday night and looms as either the next Jeanie Buss, the next Oprah, the first female president or whatever else she wants to do. Poor Jeanie has to be freaking out like Bette Davis in All About Eve. (Only Wesley Morris and Charlie Pierce got that joke; I don’t care.)\n\nQ: What could have happened at the 2014 NBA draft lottery that would have inspired the worst rom-com of the last 20 years?\n\nIf Embiid and Mallory fell for each other on lottery night, followed by Embiid demanding that only Milwaukee could see his medical records (so they’d take him second), then Tellem turning evil and trying to break them up, followed by some sort of Romeo and Juliet scenario developing and Embiid and Mallory going on the run. They’d definitely call this rom-com either The Love Lottery or Drafting My Heart, and it would definitely star Jennifer Lawrence as Mallory and Michael B. Jordan as Embiid. If we could CGI Godzilla destroying an entire city, couldn’t we CGI Michael B. Jordan into a 7-foot center?\n\n(By the way — stay away from this fake movie, Omar Epps. You’re too old. Your 15-year run of sports movies is over. It’s Michael B. Jordan’s time now.)\n\nQ: Can you give us four more predictions for the 2014 lottery?\n\nSure! I’ll even throw on my Clairvoyant Bill hat for you …\n\nPrediction No. 1: Utah tries like hell to trade up for Jabari Parker.\n\nI’m almost positive that Jabari is the first Mormon who can be described like this: “A little bit of Paul Pierce and a little Carmelo offensively, only if they were more fun to play with, and they were trapped in Rudy Gay’s body if Rudy needed to go gluten-free and hire a personal trainer.” Hey, Sam Hinkie, you love collecting assets like Leo DiCaprio collects models. And you’re not crazy about taking Jabari, anyway — what if Utah flipped you no. 5 for no. 3 and no. 23 and threw in Alec Burks plus a first-round pick-swap in any of the next three years? Would that do it? Any interest? Any?\n\nPrediction No. 2: Orlando happily jumps on Dante Exum.\n\nAnd not just because he might be really good, but because that could ignite Victor Oladipo’s career. He’s not a point guard and he’s too small to defend certain 2-guards … but if he could defend point guards and play 2-guard offensively? Boom! I love the Exum-‘Dipo backcourt.\n\n(Important note: I’m making all Exum judgments so far based on 3 a.m. viewings of him on YouTube as well as the ravings of the Grantland office’s international basketball expert, Danny Chau, who loves Exum as much as I love both of my children combined.)\n\nPrediction No. 3: If the Celtics don’t trade their pick, they’re taking Shawn Marion 2.0 (a.k.a. Aaron Gordon).\n\nThat’s right, Matrix 2! (Whoops, that movie sucked — bad nickname.) What about … The Re-Matrix? I believe that Gordon is destined to become this year’s Russell Westbrook — a.k.a. the crazy-competitive, crazy-good athlete who doesn’t seem to have an official position yet, only the more teams work him out and watch tape of him, the more they fall in love with him. I’m worried about Utah taking him fifth if they can’t trade up for Jabari. Don’t tell anyone.\n\nPrediction No. 4: Out of the Lakers (no. 7), Kings (no. 8) and Charlotte (no. 9), two of those three teams will trade out of those spots for an “impact” guy.\n\nIn my opinion, here are the “impact” guys who could be pried away for the right price: Rajon Rondo, Al Horford and Paul Millsap (the biggies would take major prodding though); Brook Lopez (the biggest risk/reward guy out there); Greg Monroe and Gordon Hayward (would need to be a sign-and-trade); Arron Afflalo and Nik Pekovic; David Lee (VERY available); Ersan Ilyasova, Ryan Anderson and Thaddeus Young (not for a top-10 pick, but as part of a bigger deal); Dion Waiters (intriguing); Harrison Barnes (intriguing!); Ricky Rubio (intriguing!!!); and just for the hell of it, Ty Lawson (INTRIGUING!!!!).\n\nIf you’re the Lakers, would you flip no. 7 and Nash’s expiring for Lopez and Lopez’s still-healing foot, then roll the dice that you just landed a top-five center for two years? If you’re the Nuggets, wouldn’t you have to consider Isaiah Thomas, Ben McLemore, Derrick Williams’s waivable contract and no. 8 for Lawson? If you’re Charlotte, wouldn’t you shop that no. 9 straight-up for Al Jefferson’s old buddy Millsap, or maybe Monroe or Afflalo? I think two of those teams are making a move.\n\n(And what’s Rubio worth, for God’s sake? Would you give up any pick from no. 8 through no. 12 for him? What if Orlando traded no. 12 for Rubio, then drafted Exum and went with the Exum-Oladipo-Rubio backcourt? What if the Grizzlies offered Mike Conley and no. 22 to Minnesota for Rubio and no. 13, then signed Pau Gasol — reuniting the Gasol hermanos! — bringing us two big steps closer to my dream of seeing Team Spain as an NBA team? You’re right, I need to give the Trade Machine a break. For at least 12 hours, anyway.)\n\nQ: Speaking of Memphis … what the hell is going on in Memphis???\n\nA: We see it happen with professional sports franchises every so often: You have a sports-savvy, overly ambitious executive who doesn’t have nearly enough money to purchase his own team (in this case, Grizzlies CEO Jason Levien) sniffing out an available franchise, then slapping together an ownership group hinging on someone else fronting the bulk of the money (Grizzlies owner Robert Pera). Usually, the ambitious executive smartly picks a sugar daddy who doesn’t know what he’s doing – or even better, might eschew the day-to-day responsibility of running the team – allowing the CEO to “run” the team without owning it.\n\nOnly one problem: If the sugar daddy owner decides to get more involved, the CEO is eventually screwed. First the owner starts spreading his wings a little more, then a little more (and in Pera’s case, so much more that he reportedly started promising playing time to different players). At some point, he starts butting heads with the ambitious CEO. Everyone else in the organization picks sides. Ultimately, there’s a major disagreement that concludes with the owner saying something like, “Hey, where’s YOUR money? I’m the one who owns the team – why are you telling ME what we should do?” That’s usually when the CEO starts packing his office and becomes “former CEO.” Which is what happened to Levien, who earns some blame since he has abruptly left three different NBA franchises now (twice on bad terms). He’s no victim.\n\nAnyway, the Grizzlies made that owner/CEO breakdown seem even more dysfunctional than usual, as Chris Ryan gleefully broke down on the Triangle today. (If you do anything, listen to our friend Chris Vernon pick apart interim GM Chris Wallace in a local radio interview. Chris Wallace is the Michael Myers of NBA GMs — he literally CANNOT die even if you chop his head off.) But there’s a method to Pera’s madness. As I first reported on Monday, Pera wants to trade for Chicago’s Tom Thibodeau and give him a Stan Van Gundy/Pistons-type deal. That’s why Pera allowed Dave Joerger, the current Grizzlies coach, to interview for Minnesota’s job. Memphis wants Thibs. And Chicago knows that Thibs will always be miserable there after the Ron Adams firing and the Deng trade. So I’m throwing $100 on the following three-transaction parlay: Joerger goes to Minnesota, Thibs gets traded to Memphis for a future pick, Chicago hires Fred Hoiberg to replace him.\n\nQ: For three months, Jalen vowed on NBA Countdown that you guys would be eating shrimp cocktail at St. Elmo’s during the Eastern Finals … and you kept disagreeing with him. You were wrong, as always. Did that St. Elmo’s dinner ever actually happen?\n\nA: (Nodding shamefully.)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAmyBKG07g\n\nQ: You were there for Game 2 in Indiana — was there any point when you said to yourself, “Holy shit, Miami’s three-peat might be going out the window?”\n\nA: Not really … but there were a few times when you thought, Man, Miami is gonna have to dig deeeeeeeeeeeeeep here. The Heat prevailed because of their on/off switch (turned to “ON — FULL TILT”), their defensive A-game (swarming at times), the reliable brilliance of LeBron and Wade (22 points in the fourth quarter), Chris Andersen’s terrific contribution off the bench (is Birdman the best amnesty guy ever?), and unexpected stink bombs from Paul George and David West (an unlikely 9-for-32 combined).\n\nStill — Lance Stephenson missed an 8-footer that would have given Indy a five-point lead with under six minutes to play (and ignited the crowd, too). When it happened, I remember thinking, If Lance makes that shot, this is suddenly the most important 90 seconds of the season for Miami. Instead, Miami stepped on the gas pedal, LeBron and Wade took over, Wade accidentally kneed Paul George in the head and ruined him for the rest of the game (yet another “accidental” injury at the hands of Dwyane Wade, right?), and the Pacers blew a terrific chance to steal Game 2. Nobody on the Pacers played particularly well other than Stephenson (outstanding for three quarters, gassed in the fourth). Meanwhile, the Heat threw the kitchen sink at them, knowing they had three days’ rest before Saturday’s Game 3. And they barely won. I don’t mean for this to come up like an awkward SportsCenter integration, but would you go “GOOD SIGN!” or “BAD SIGN!” for that one? (That’s Good Sign/Bad Sign, Presented by Dick’s Sporting Goods!) I’m leaning toward “BAD SIGN!”\n\nQ: So what did that just mean? Are you saying Miami is in trouble?\n\nA: Not necessarily. Starting on Saturday, this series moves into every-other-night mode, which helps the younger Pacers more than Miami. Can the Heat crank that on/off switch to “ON — FULL TILT” three more times? Can they make it easier by stealing a home game without LeBron and Wade doing much, maybe with their role players unleashing one of those 16-for-26 3-point performances that happens for them every so often? We definitely know they’ll play one more A-game, and we know LeBron has one of those 44-10-9 ass-kickings coming. If the role players come through one time, they’ll finish the series off in five or six.\n\nBut if not? They’re flirting with a dangerous Game 7 return to Naptown, against a team that feels exceedingly comfortable playing them, setting up a potentially frightening repeat of what happened in the 2002 Kings-Lakers series. (Remember that one? Crazy Kings crowd? The Lakers tapping into every ounce of their reserve gas tank? Overtime? Peja air-balling the game winner?) You know what’s really helping Miami? Indy’s decrepit bench, which chop-blocked the Pacers in Game 2 thanks to Luis Scola (absolutely atrocious), Evan Turner (DNP), Chris Copeland (DNP), C.J. Watson (0-for-4) and Ian Mahinmi (just six shaky minutes). Only Rasual Butler came through (two 3s), and he was washed-up three years ago — after Butler hit his second 3, we had to restrain Jalen from slipping on his old no. 5 Pacers jersey and sitting on Indy’s bench to see if Frank Vogel would have put him in next.\n\nIf Indy blows the Eastern finals, blame LeBron first because it’s always near-impossible to win a series when you don’t have the best player in the series. But after that, blame last summer’s trade with Phoenix for Luis Scola — the Pacers gave up Gerald Green (who blossomed into a Sixth Man of the Year candidate), Miles Plumlee (suddenly a valuable big man) and their 2014 no. 1 pick (which could have been later packaged with Danny Granger’s expiring for someone better than Turner). They also pushed D.J. Augustin out the door, only to watch him belatedly become a genuine asset in Chicago.\n\nOf course, Indy’s bench let them down last spring, too. Why can’t Frank Vogel get anything out of his benches? Does he rely on his starting five too much? When you think of how someone like Gregg Popovich might have coached this team, there’s an alternate regular-season universe for these last two Pacers seasons that includes dozens of different lineups, more month-to-month rest for Hibbert and West, fewer minutes for the starting five as a whole, infinitely more small-ball experimentation, and those random nights when Pop says, “Hey, Patty Mills, you’re playing 40 minutes tonight” (only in this case, it’s Augustin or Watson). Indy’s inability to develop a bench these past two years probably cost them a Finals trip. It’s a shame. Unless you’re a Miami fan.\n\nQ: Do you think Kevin Love will get traded before the draft? Who has the best chance to get Kevin Love right now?\n\nA: Yes, he’s getting traded before the draft. That’s when they will get the biggest haul for him. The suitors, in descending order from “least likely” to “most likely”:\n\nL.A. Lakers: Could offer the no. 7 pick, the chance for Love to come home, and the chance for him to be reunited with his girlfriend (the actress Cody Horn). I don’t know how any of this helps Minnesota. And also — if you’re Kevin Love, you’d really want to play with Kobe for two years on a poorly owned team with no other assets? Why not just stay in Minnesota one more year, then sign with the Lakers in 2015?\n\nGolden State: Reportedly made Klay Thompson untouchable, which makes no sense because (a) he should be VERY touchable, and (b) you should want to flip David Lee and Thompson for Kevin Love every day and twice on Sunday. If they want to expand the deal with Harrison Barnes and Kevin Martin, that’s fine, too. Love and Steph Curry on the same team? Come on. Actually, why am I helping the Warriors? Definitely keep Klay Thompson! Best 2-guard in the league!\n\nPhoenix Suns: They have a bunch of decent assets (the nos. 14, 21, 28 and 29 picks, Alex Len, the Morris twins, etc.) but no headliner. They’d have to package multiple picks to move up to no. 5 (Utah) and no. 7 (Lakers). Not likely. (More likely for them: Al Horford.)\n\nHouston Rockets: Have to be mentioned because of Flip Saunders’s friendship with Kevin McHale, and because Love absolutely loved playing for McHale. But they’d have to convince Chandler Parsons to agree to a sign-and-trade, something they couldn’t do until July (after the draft). No way Parsons wants to live in Minnesota — he wants to be famous too badly. He’d rather attend Hollywood red-carpet premieres and become the next Bachelor. (I’m not even kidding.) So what if they sign-and-trade Parsons to the Lakers for whomever they took with the no. 7 pick (not inconceivable), deal Omer Asik for another first-rounder, then package those picks with other assets (future picks, Terrence Jones, etc.) for Love? Unlikely … but not impossible, right?\n\nChicago Bulls: For Taj Gibson, no. 16, no. 19 and the rights to Nikola Mirotic. Not sure that’s enough for ’Sota. Also: That trade chews up the Bulls’ cap space, and, by proxy, their July chances for Carmelo. I can’t get a feel for the Bulls — I mean, that’s the same team that gave Luol Deng away in January, then claimed publicly that they weren’t quitting on the season. Huh???? It’s also the same team that plays in the third-biggest TV market in America and could sell for $2 billion tomorrow (not a misprint), only they operate their business like they’re stuck playing in Indiana or Milwaukee. Keep getting dem checks, Jerry.\n\nBoston Celtics: They have a war chest of assets, including two 2014 picks (no. 6 and no. 17), two 2015 first-rounders (their own and an unprotected Clippers pick), two unprotected Brooklyn first-rounders (2016 and 2018), a pick swap from Brooklyn in 2017 (unprotected), a $10.3 million trade exception, Keith Bogans’s waivable-ASAP contract ($5.1 million, perfect for trade match), Brandon Bass’s deal (expires in 2015) and two decent young players (Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk). They can accommodate ANY Kevin Love trade. Oh, and they have Brad Stevens and one of the league’s most respected organizations, as well as the team that keeps celebrating its players and welcoming them home even after they retire. That too.\n\nThe most logical offer: Both 2014 picks, both 2015 picks, Sullinger, Bogans and Bass’s expiring for Love. That’s four first-rounders (including the no. 6 pick). If they pulled it off, they’d have to move quickly on Houston’s Asik, even if it meant taking Jeremy Lin’s contract as the price for Asik — conceivably, they could absorb Asik with the aforementioned trade exception and absorb Lin’s deal with their cap space — which helps Houston because they need to dump the Lin/Asik contracts to pursue Carmelo. You tell me: Could you compete in the East with a starting five of Love, Rajon Rondo, Asik, Jeff Green and Free Agent 2-Guard TBA? And could you make the Finals with a Big Three of James Harden, Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony? YES AND YES! Let’s do this!\n\n(And if all of this happens, followed by an unhappy Celtics season and Love and Rondo bolting in 2015 to sign with the Lakers and Knicks, respectively, then I’m moving to England and throwing myself into the Premier League. No farewell column, no good-bye party, nothing. I’m out. Nice knowing you.)\n\nUnfortunately …\n\nCleveland Cavs: It all depends on whatever Bat Signal LeBron is sending them. If they truly believe they can bring LeBron home this summer or next summer — remember, he can always opt back into his Miami contract for one more season, then leave after the 2015 Finals — then here’s what the Cavs SHOULD do:\n\nStep No. 1: Trade the no. 1 overall pick, Anthony Bennett and an unprotected 2015 first-rounder to Minnesota for Kevin Love. That’s a MONSTER offer. Boston wouldn’t be able to trump it from an upside standpoint. And by the way, ’Sota could flip that no. 1 pick to Philly for no. 3 and no. 10, take whomever’s left between Wiggins and Parker, then have the no. 10 and no. 13 picks as well, plus Bennett! That’s a RESET button and then some.\n\nStep No. 2: Pull Miami’s old Udonis Haslem trick — renounce Anderson Varejao’s rights (for more cap space), then re-sign him in July for a longer deal.\n\nStep No. 3: Bring LeBron home.\n\nYour 2014-15 Cavs (potentially): LeBron, Love, Kyrie, Varejao, Tristan Thompson, Jarrett Jack, Dion Waiters and their choice of three ring-chasing veterans who would commit murder to play on that team. A little more palatable than that 2014-15 Heat roster … right?\n\n(The good news for Celtics fans: Cleveland will probably screw this up. And somehow end up winning the 2015 lottery, of course. Enjoy the three-day weekend.)",
  "latent_232": "I have seen the light and I believe that Haxe awesome – why don’t you want to use it?\n\nAlright, you probably heard about Haxe (some people are annoyingly fanatic), maybe even used it at some point in the past (it probably sucked).\n\nBut you don’t know Haxe – it has changed, you have changed, let’s talk.\n\ntl;dr: Haxe is a better JavaScript\n\nCommon misconceptions\n\nIt ranges from \"it’s too complicated for me\" to \"it offers a Flash/Java-like write once, run anywhere?\". Let’s clear those:\n\nHaxe isn’t too complicated\n\nHaxe the language used to be rough around the edges, that’s not the case anymore. The language has been greatly refined to become a real jewel: easy to approach, rewarding to master.\n\nPeople inexperienced in Haxe that we hire in my company become proficient enough in a few days/weeks. This is nothing compared to the difficulty to getting familiar with large projects and libraries codebases.\n\nYou can read a fantastic primer of Haxe language features here. Indeed there are a few really advanced topics but you don’t need them to get the best out of Haxe quickly.\n\nBut not all targets are equal\n\nNot every target are easy to use – you probably should not look into C#/Java/C++ targets unless you are really good in these languages and you are really looking to leverage Haxe’s cross-targets compilation.\n\nOtherwise, targeting Flash, JavaScript or PHP is comfortable.\n\nHaxe isn’t like Flash or Java\n\nHaxe is native to the platform you target: no VM, no Flash-like API.\n\nIn general, Haxe code is transpilled (source to source compilation), into the target platform’s language: JavaScript (browser, nodejs), C++, PHP, Java, C#, etc.\n\nHaxe includes a minimal, well tested, crossplatform API, centered around common application logic needs (http requests, Xml, Json, binary streams, files,…) but otherwise you are supposed to use the target platform’s native API.\n\nIn short, if you target JavaScript in the browser you will use the DOM. Haxe will just be a better JavaScript with a few built-in helper classes.\n\nBut OpenFL/Lime/NME/Flambe…?\n\nOpenFL (forked from NME which still lives in the shadow of OpenFL) is an abstraction, offering a Flash-like API on all supported platforms.\n\nLime is the platform abstraction powering OpenFL. It offers an openGl-like API and provides the tools needed to create mobile apps. You can use it directly if you’re hardcore.\n\nFlambe is another library and toolchain to target HTML5 and Flash (browser and AIR) using a single original API.\n\nThose libraries and tools are leveraging the Haxe language and compiler, but they are completely optional and independant from Haxe.\n\nAlso to be completely honest, OpenFL still has not reached the stability/performace/ease of use that would make it advisable to everybody (especially if you’re not ready for C++ debugging). On the other side, Flambe is a very stable option.\n\nMy precious productivity\n\nJavaScript is my first professional language since 2001, then ActionScript 1, 2 and 3 since 2002, C# since 2005. That’s a lot of investment in tooling, libraries, workflow that you are supposed to risk for an unclear benefit.\n\nThis is a very reasonable reaction, and the cost of changing languages is real and should be carefully weighted: new tooling, new libraries, porting possibly a lot of code… it add up quickly.\n\nAs anyone I felt too productive to switch to Haxe although I had followed closely the language since its creation in 2006. I only really got into Haxe around 2012.\n\nSwitching\n\nSome individuals and companies, like Massive Interactive, created more or less from scratch an entire ecosystem of libraries needed to do serious development. So you don’t have to: Haxe now has all the signals, mvc, unit-testing, mocking, code coverage libraries you can wish for.\n\nIt’s always impressive to present big successes like TiVo or Prezi, porting huge codebases to Haxe. Those were carefully planned risks (Prezi still prefers a native iOS client) and they were thankfully a big success. But that’s extreme switching.\n\nFor the rest of us there has to be a low friction first project to get started.\n\nMy personal reasons were to play a bit with crossplatform 2D mobile games and to have a better JavaScript for the web.\n\n2D games\n\nStarling – easy to use when targeting Flash/AIR,\n\nFlambe – popular for web games (and AIR mobile) and marketing websites (mix with DOM elements),\n\nOpenFL, HaxeFlixel, HaxePunk – crossplatform mobile games.\n\nA better JavaScript\n\nThe most important for me: Haxe is simply a better JavaScript/CoffeeScript/TypeScript/etc. The language is just a fantastic match with JavaScript, the generated code is clean, smart and efficient.\n\nUsing existing libraries is simple: either in an untyped fashion (aka JS as usual) or in a typed way, with special definitions for the compiler.\n\nBut there’s a catch\n\nSome aspects of Haxe aren’t for the faint of heart: if you just want to follow the trend and copy and paste instructions without too much thinking from blog posts and detailed tutorials, Haxe is probably not for you.\n\nTooling for instance is a bit hit-and-miss. There are many editors offering Haxe code completion, but none will really have the maturity of ActionScript 3 tooling for instance. Stick with the most popular options (FlashDevelop, Sublime Text, IntelliJ) but take the time to test different editors. I’d say FlashDevelop is probably the most complete option but I’m a bit biased and that’s a Windows app 😉\n\nThat said, if you’re up for a rewarding challenge find yourself a mentor, hang out in the IRC channel, and ask questions on the mailing list.",
  "latent_425": "After decades of perfect role models and girl-power action heroines, mainstream pop-culture is finally moving on to a more nuanced age of celebrated female characters. Just take a look at Shonda Rhimes shows, The Hunger Games, and flawed superheroes like Jessica Jones. This year, one of the most exciting examples is Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nThe original six movies gave us two iconic sci-fi heroines, Padme Amidala and Leia Organa. But like most Hollywood franchises, developed female side-characters were thin on the ground—especially compared to the wealth of male roles like Boba Fett, Qui Gon Jinn, Yoda, Jabba the Hutt, Chewie, and the droids.\n\nCaptain Phasma—a towering, armor-clad captain of the First Order—is a true rarity in Hollywood. She’s a female villain who is neither a femme fatale nor a foil for a female hero. Even her appearance is revolutionary: a metallic stormtrooper outfit that staunchly avoids the impractical “boob plate” armor favored by so many video game designers and comic book artists.\n\nSpeaking to Variety, actress Gwendoline Christie mused on her career trajectory from Game of Thrones‘ Brienne of Tarth to Captain Phasma. “I don’t think many female actors get the opportunity to play a part where they’re not having to think about the way their face looks,” she said. “It was great as an actor to work on your skills—that it isn’t about holding your head so you look beautiful.”\n\nEven in supposedly gritty and realistic action movies, attractiveness often outweighs authenticity for female characters. One of the most egregious examples this year was Elizabeth Olsen’s turn as Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron, for which Joss Whedon told Olsen to keep her face calm during action sequences. Scarlet Witch is fueled by anger and grief throughout the movie, but her facial expressions were deemed too unattractive for slow-motion shots.\n\nIn a similar vein, Jessica Alba admitted that she was told to cry less realistically in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. “The director was like, ‘It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry?'” According to Alba, the director ordered her to make her face “flat” during a death scene, and said that tears could be added later with CGI. The role earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress.\n\nCaptain Phasma circumvents the issue of looking pretty on camera, as well as another common problem faced by so-called “strong female characters”: the debate over whether she provides a positive role model for young girls. As a captain in the villainous First Order army, her role is comparable to a character like Darth Maul. She’s not wholesome hero, but definitely a fun choice if you’re an 8-year-old kid playing Star Wars with your friends.\n\nThe Force Awakens still includes traditional heroines like Rey and Leia, but the presence of Phasma (and Lupita Nyong’o‘s alien character Maz Kanata) adds a satisfying new dimension to the Star Wars universe. We all need a bad role model, now and then.\n\nPhoto via Star Wars",

  "latent_967": "$150 Million Locked On the Ethereum Network — How to Protect Yourself\n\nComplexity Is the Enemy of Security\n\nMason Blocked Unblock Follow Following Nov 7, 2017\n\nParity is an Ethereum implementation written in Rust, spearheaded by the very talented cofounder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood. The implementation provides an easy to use GUI for creating multi-sig wallets. The multi-sig contract that underpins this functionality was found to have a vulnerability on July 19, 2017 that resulted in a loss of $30 million. On November 7, 2017 a second vulnerability was found in the wallet contract that resulted in a lockup of $150 million in Ether. While Ethereum does not offer a simple solution for high security wallets, there are a few steps you can take to prevent falling victim to such an attack.\n\nThe bug report filed by the “attacker”\n\nIn a traditional production software environment, we’re able to deploy code to a public interface such as a website. If the code does not appear to carry the functionality we hope it does, what happens? Perhaps no one notices, perhaps a few people complain, at the end of the day we can update the code and the minor nuisance is resolved. In the world of Ethereum, once we deploy a piece of code it is there forever, for everyone to see and play with. In an ideal world, only you have access to this code, in the world of blockchain everyone has access to it. This means that if a piece of code is deployed to the Ethereum network, its in most cases not possible to update it.\n\nA Conversation With the “attacker”\n\nIf we put $1 million in Ether into a smart contract and the smart contract is found to contain a vulnerability, a few things may occur. It may go unnoticed, it may go noticed by a hacker who decides to exploit it, or it will be uncovered by the contract owner and they will be able to recover the funds. In this case it was exploited by an individual claiming to be “researching” the previous Parity hack.\n\nThe “attacker”\n\nSo how can we protect ourselves?\n\nKISS Principle — Keep it simple stupid\n\nMost smart contracts introduce vulnerabilities by attempting to account for corner cases and optimizations. The first Parity vulnerability was due to an attempt to optimize the amount of gas used during execution. The current Parity vulnerability was due to the inclusion of new, untested library functionality. A manageable smart contract will contain the minimum amount of functionality necessary to complete the task. Introducing code to optimize a premature solution increases the complexity of the contract, thereby reducing the security.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nIn common software development as well as smart contract development it can be convenient to overlook adequate unit tests. When code is non-revocable once it reaches production, a higher level of diligence is required. As a rule of thumb, your smart contract should contain adequate unit tests to verify the functionality of your smart contract as well as the corner cases.\n\nSmart Contract Audits\n\nAny smart contract that is sent to production should undergo a security audit. A good smart contract security auditor will have experience building real-world smart contracts, a wealth of projects on GitHub, and will share a check list of the common vulnerabilities that they look for. Ensure the auditor can engage in conversation about the various attack vectors associated with your smart contract. This may not seem like a formal approach, however the industry is still very young and this is how it operates at the moment.\n\nFollowing these guidelines can help reduce the risk and anxiety associated with sending smart contracts to the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nTest, Audit, Deploy.",
  "latent_1276": "Comedian Eddie Izzard has claimed he suffered a homophobic tirade from a fellow Crystal Palace football fan at the FA Cup final and was labelled a ‘f***ing disgrace’.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who is not gay but describes himself as transgender, said he was verbally ‘attacked’ during his side’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.\n\nIzzard, who is an associate director at the Premier League club, claimed a fan told him he was ‘a disgrace to the Crystal Palace team’ before others in the 88,619 crowd stepped in to defend him.\n\n'F***ing disgrace': Crystal Palace fan Eddie Izzard, pictured at West Ham United's Upton Park last month, said he was verbally ‘attacked’ during his side’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on Saturday\n\nBig day out: Crystal Palace supporters in the stands during the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium in London on Saturday. There is no suggestion anyone pictured in the photographs of fans was involved in the incident\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed's Emily Ashton, Izzard said of the incident in London: ‘Someone [verbally] attacked me and was exceedingly horrible. He said I’m a disgrace to the Crystal Palace team.\n\n‘I was wearing a Crystal Palace shirt, he said “You’re a f***ing disgrace”, and I went \"Hey, what the bloody hell are you saying?” and all the other Palace fans came out and said “Hey, back off, man”.\n\n‘And I just thought it was actually rather positive, because only one guy was screaming homophobic abuse at me rather than 20 or an entire section of an audience.’\n\nHe revealed what happened while speaking to students in Birmingham as he visits 31 cities in Britain to urge young people to register to vote for Britain to remain in the EU in next month’s referendum.\n\nIzzard, who came out as transgender in 1985, also told how a man had recently been arrested near his home for screaming homophobic insults at him, adding: ‘I’m still living with this abuse.’\n\nVocal support: Palace fans are seen during their side's match against Manchester United, which they lost 2-1\n\nBuoyant mood: Palace supporters perform the Poznan celebration in the stands during the final at Wembley\n\nA spokesman for Palace LGBT group Proud and Palace said: 'The cup final was one of the proudest days in our club's history so to have it marred by the incident is deeply saddening.\n\nStudent tour: Izzard made a public apperance at Reading University on Tuesday as he admitted that he thinks the EU is difficult and too bureaucratic\n\n‘We are, however, cheered by the news that several Crystal Palace fans stepped in to support Eddie.\n\n‘Eddie is truly “one of our own” and to the fans who spoke up in the face of homophobic or transphobic abuse we send our sincere thanks. We hope that any member of the CPFC (Crystal Palace Football Club) family could count on their fellow fans for the same support.’\n\nIzzard - who is the son of a BP accountant father and a midwife mother - is known for keeping his romantic life private, although it was revealed in 2010 that he used to date director Sarah Townsend after they he met at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1989.\n\nThey dated from 1999 until 2002 but were never pictured together and he never named her.\n\nIn 2013 he said he had recently been beaten up by bigots in both London’s Leicester Square and New York’s Times Square, and battered by thugs in Cambridge for wearing a dress in 1996.\n\nSpeaking about being transgender in March, Izzard told BBC Three: ‘I’ve got boy genetics and girl genetics. We get obsessed by it in humanity. No matter what sex or sexuality, how you self-identify, or who you fancy, matters not one whit – what do you do in life? What do you make? What do you add to the human existence? That’s what matters. I don’t know why, it’s just the genetic cards I’ve been given.\n\n'A lot of people have said very nasty things to me, have fought me in the streets… but f*** them.’\n\nHe added at the time: 'I do like my nails and they've been knocked about a bit so I'm getting my nails re-done. I use it as a badge of identity. I am a transgender guy. I came out 31 years ago.’\n\nHe said 'You’re a f***ing disgrace', and I went 'Hey, what the bloody hell are you saying?' Eddie Izzard\n\nMeanwhile, Izzard admitted at Reading University on Tuesday that he thinks the EU is difficult and too bureaucratic but urged young people to vote to stay in and ‘make it work’.\n\nThe Labour supporter said he is a British European who wants the younger generation to have the same opportunities he did when he travelled around Europe in his youth.",
  "latent_1378": "EISENSTADT, Austria/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Austria said on Friday 71 refugees, including a baby girl, were found dead in an abandoned freezer truck, while Libya recovered the bodies of 105 migrants washed ashore after their overcrowded boat sank on its way to Europe. Almost 100 more were missing and feared dead.\n\nBoth tragedies were a result of a renewed surge in migrants fleeing war and poverty that has confronted Europe with its worst refugee crisis since World War Two.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration said it estimated a third of a million people had crossed the Mediterranean so far this year to wash up in southern Europe.\n\nAlmost two-thirds had arrived in Greece and most of the rest in Italy. At least 2,636 had perished in the attempt.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said European Union leaders were ready for an emergency meeting, if necessary, to discuss the refugee crisis. The White House urged Europe to crack down on traffickers and ensure that migrants’ human rights were protected.\n\nIn the latest disaster off the coast of North Africa, a vessel packed with an estimated 400 migrants sank on Thursday after leaving Zuwara in Libya. The port is a major launchpad for smugglers exploiting a security vacuum in a country with two rival governments.\n\nLacking navy ships, Libyan officials were searching for survivors with fishing boats and inflatables provided by locals. About 198 people had been rescued by noon, officials said.\n\n“The boat was in a bad condition and people died with us,” said Ayman Talaal, a Syrian survivor, standing next to his daughter. “We have been forced into this route. It’s now called the grave of the Mediterranean Sea.”\n\nThe migrants were from sub-Saharan Africa, Pakistan, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh, a security official said. Many appeared to have been trapped in the hold when the boat capsized.\n\nLocal officials and residents were putting bodies into red bags on a beach littered with shoes, trousers and other personal items from drowned migrants.\n\nSTARVED OF AIR\n\nMost migrant deaths have happened at sea. The gruesome find of a truckload of corpses in Austria highlighted the danger faced by those who make it across to southern Europe but depend on trafficking gangs to ship them north toward more affluent countries like Germany.\n\nA motorway patrol discovered the abandoned truck near the Hungarian border on Thursday, probably at least 24 hours after it had been parked there. The refugees appeared to have been dead for up to two days and fluids from the decomposing bodies were seeping from its door.\n\nA Syrian travel document was found among the victims, but more time is needed to determine whether people of other nationalities were on board, Hans Peter Doskozil, police chief for the province of Burgenland, told a news conference.\n\nThe back door of the truck was not locked but secured shut with wires. Its refrigeration system showed no signs of having been switched on and there were no vents to allow fresh air inside, Doskozil told Reuters. The victims had been wearing light summer clothes.\n\nOf the 71 dead, 59 were men, eight were women, and four were children, including a girl estimated at one to two years old and three boys aged roughly eight to 10.\n\nHungarian policemen arrest a Syrian migrant family after they entered Hungary at the border with Serbia, near Roszke, August 28, 2015. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\n\nHungarian police said they had arrested four men - three Bulgarians and an Afghan - and had questioned roughly 20 people after conducting house searches.\n\n“We expect that this is the trace that will lead us to the perpetrators,” Doskozil said, making clear that the people being held were not the ringleaders of the trafficking gang.\n\nAuthorities were transporting the bodies to different Austrian morgues. A Reuters witness saw one truck carrying around 10 bodies entering a Vienna forensics center.\n\nRefugees and migrants have been sweeping north through the Balkans. Thousands of Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis have crossed from Serbia into EU-member Hungary, where authorities said more than 140,000 had been caught entering the country so far this year.\n\nHungary, which is part of Europe’s passport-free Schengen zone, is building a fence along its border with Serbia to contain what it calls a threat to European security, prosperity and identity.\n\nIt plans to tighten laws next week to curb migration pressure on the country. That includes using the army, if necessary, to help police near the southern border, lawmaker Gergely Gulyas of the ruling Fidesz party said.\n\nHungarian police said 10 Syrian migrants were injured when a van driven by a Romanian suspected of human trafficking overturned en route for Budapest.\n\nIn Greece, coastguards said they had rescued more than 1,600 migrants making their way to Greek islands near Turkey over the past three days.\n\nPolice in Sicily detained 10 people on suspicion of multiple homicide and aiding illegal immigration after 52 migrants were found suffocated in the hull of a boat this week.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said survivors said they had been beaten to force them into the hold, and then had to pay money to smugglers just to come out to breathe.\n\nOne of the survivors, an Iraqi orthopedic surgeon, said he had paid 3,000 euros ($3,400) to come up on to the top deck with his wife and two-year-old son.\n\nLast week, 49 people died in another boat’s hold after inhaling poisonous fumes, and on Wednesday 21 people are thought to have died after a dinghy with 145 on board got into difficulty, UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.",
  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nI have three kids, aged 6, 9, and 14. They have been brought up with video games on multiple platforms: PS1, PS2, Gamecube, Wii, Xbox360, Wii, Xbox Kinect, Game Boy, DS, web games, and PC games. There is no lack of games in our house, nor opportunities to play them. Last Saturday, this event occurred which tells me that the air might be changing, at least in our house.\n\nI walked into the living room, and my three kids were sitting on the couch. The oldest one was playing a game on her Android Phone. The middle one was playing Temple Run on my iPad. The littlest one was playing Fruit Ninja on my Kindle Fire. The Xbox 360 was turned on, but it was in the Netflix app (where it spends most of its time), playing a Disney Channel show.\n\nSince our broken Wii now sits in the upstairs family room, and is never used, I said out loud, \"girls, I think we need a Wii U to replace our Wii\". The middle one looked up and me and said \"Dad, we DON'T need another game console\", and then went back to her game of Temple Run.\n\nMy oldest girl is a gamer a heart. Just last year she played Skyrim and Dragon Age all the time, but lately that has changed. She plays games on her phone, and when her and I play together, it's usually a game of Risk on the iPad.\n\nThese kids have been exposed to every type of game imaginable, yet they have all gravitated towards mobile. When they Xbox360 does get used for games, it is to play Fruit Ninja Kinect, an XBLA game. My brother has two boys, aged 7 and 4, and they play Minecraft constantly, another XBLA game.\n\nI asked a friend of mine with three boys within the same age range as my girls last night, just to make sure this was not an isolated incident. He told me that, indeed, while his teenage son does still play some Xbox shooters, the majority of the game playing in his house is Minecraft on XBLA, or iPad games, with an occasional web based MMO thrown in for good measure. I asked him if they want a Wii U. He told me:\n\n\"Steve, I don't even think they know about the Wii U\".\n\nThese anecdotes are not just from American kids. My sister lives in Germany and her daughter (12) told me \"all the boys in Germany play Minecraft constantly\".\n\nPersonally, I find myself playing more and more on the iPad than anywhere else. Lost Cities is my new favorite game, but just recently it was The Machine Bride Of Pinbot table in Pinball Arcade for the iPad, and before that, Dragon Fantasy.\n\nWhen the Wii U is released, I will probably buy one fairly quickly. I will tell myself that I'm buying it to replace my old Wii, but in reality, I still get a huge charge of energy from buying a new console. In the last decade, I've always told myself that the console I'm buying is \"for the kids\". However, this time I'll be fooling myself. Buying a Wii U will be for me. I will buy it because I want to grab onto a bit of that magical feeling of opening a game console for the first time. However, If I think I doing it for any other reason, I'll only be lying to myself.",

It’s better here because I feel more involved and have played a bigger part.\n\n“That said, I won the under-20 World Cup with Brazil which was very important to me.”\n\nThat U20 World Cup win with his country in 2011 aside, Coutinho has been left frustrated by his experiences in major events.\n\nHaving moved to Inter from Vasco da Gama in 2010, the midfielder was an unused substitute in their Italian Super Cup win over Roma a few months later.\n\nA knee problem meant he had to sit out the FIFA World Club Cup final against TP Mazembe, while he wasn’t in the squad when the Italian side beat Palermo to win the Coppa Italia later that season.\n\nIn the one showpiece occasion in which he did appear, Coutinho played only the final 11 minutes as Inter lost the UEFA Super Cup to Atletico Madrid.\n\nMoving to Anfield has seen more near misses, from the title challenge of 2014 to last season’s semi-final defeats in both domestic knockout competitions.\n\nThe FA Cup loss to Aston Villa came on Coutinho’s only previous appearance at Wembley, and he recalls: “It was a difficult moment because we were so close to the final and we made it 1-0 but then the score was turned around and it was a frustrating moment for us.\n\n“But now we have a chance again so I hope we all can give our best so we won’t let this chance get away.\n\n“You need to win trophies to be happy, not just here but at any club.\n\n“For you to be happy and feel confident and make history as every player wants to make, you need to win titles and this can start on Sunday.”\n\nHaving further improved his fitness with a man-of-the-match performance in Thursday’s Europa League win over Augbsburg, Coutinho will be among the first names on Klopp’s teamsheet against City.\n\nHowever, despite his urge for greater involvement, the Brazilian has featured for only 74 minutes of Liverpool’s run to the Capital One Cup final.\n\nAfter playing 56 minutes in the third round against Carlisle United, his only other appearance was at Stoke City in the semi-final first leg which was aborted after 18 minutes with the hamstring problem that threatened his Wembley involvement.\n\nCoutinho, though, was integral in Liverpool’s sensational 4-1 Premier League win at City in November, a result that highlighted both the potential of Klopp’s tutelage and some glaring weaknesses in Manuel Pellegrini’s Etihad outfit.\n\n“We did well in that game as the manager asked – we had a great game,” says the 23-year-old.\n\n“I hope we carry on following up what the manager asks so we can improve each time and get good results.\n\n“We’re a new team that’s been developing and we have many young players. But we also have experienced players so we try to learn every day.\n\n“Wembley is a big occasion for us. I hope it’s the beginning of a good period for Liverpool.”\n\nCoutinho could be one of three Brazilians starting for the Reds at Wembley, with Roberto Firmino a fixture in attack and Lucas Leiva flitting between central midfield and, latterly, a centre-back role.\n\n“We always get together as friends when we have a day off, then we meet in one of our homes or go out for dinner together as we do in our Brazilian families,” he says.\n\n“Have I learned any Scouse words? I’ve heard about them and the guys joke about it but it’s still a bit difficult to understand when people from here (Liverpool) speak but we’ll try it little by little.”\n\nCoutinho’s form last season was a rare high point of a difficult campaign for Liverpool and earned him a place in the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nIt also caught the attention of Brazilian great Pele, who was complimentary of his compatriot ahead of a visit to Anfield last April.\n\n“It’s always good to hear nice things from great players who made history like Pele,” says Coutinho.\n\n“I also heard good words Steven Gerrard, which means a lot to me and gives me confidence to carry on working and always want to do a little more.”\n\nA little more and Coutinho could be celebrating his first silverware with Liverpool this weekend.",
  "latent_1739": "Denial of the Holodomor (Ukrainian: Заперечення Голодомору, Russian: Отрицание Голодомора) is the assertion that the 1932–1933 Holodomor, a man-made[1] famine in Soviet Ukraine,[2] did not occur[3][4][5][6] or diminishing the scale and significance of the famine.[7] This denial and suppression of information about the famine was made in official Soviet propaganda from the very beginning until the 1980s. It was supported by some Western journalists and intellectuals.[4][8][9][10] It was echoed at the time of the famine by some prominent Western journalists, including Walter Duranty and Louis Fischer. The denial of the man-made famine was a highly successful and well orchestrated disinformation campaign by the Soviet government.[3][4][5] According to Robert Conquest, it was the first major instance of Soviet authorities adopting the Big Lie propaganda technique to sway world opinion, to be followed by similar campaigns over the Moscow Trials and denial of the Gulag labor camp system.[11]\n\nOnly in the post Soviet era, independent Ukraine has officially condemned the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. The causes, nature, and extent of the Holodomor remain topics of controversy and active scholarship, including the debate over whether or not it constitutes genocide.\n\nSoviet Union [ edit ]\n\nCover-up of the famine [ edit ]\n\nThe Soviet leadership undertook extensive efforts to prevent the spread of any information about the famine by keeping state communications top secret and taking other measures to prevent word of the famine from spreading. When Ukrainian peasants traveled north to Russia seeking bread, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov sent a secret telegram to the party and provincial police chiefs with instructions to turn them back,[12] alleging Polish agents were attempting to create a famine scare. OGPU chairman Genrikh Yagoda subsequently reported that over 200,000 peasants had been turned back.\n\nStalin's wife, Nadezhda Allilueva, learned about the famine from Ukrainian students at the technical school she was attending. Allilueva complained to Stalin, who then ordered the OGPU to purge all the college students who had taken part in collectivization.[13]\n\nSoviet head-of-state Mikhail Kalinin responded to Western offers of food by telling of \"political cheats who offer to help the starving Ukraine,\" and commented, \"Only the most decadent classes are capable of producing such cynical elements.\"[6][14]\n\nIn an interview with Gareth Jones in March 1933, Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov stated, \"Well, there is no famine\", and went on to say, \"You must take a longer view. The present hunger is temporary. In writing books you must have a longer view. It would be difficult to describe it as hunger.\"[15]\n\nOn instructions from Litvinov, Boris Skvirsky, embassy counselor of the recently opened Soviet Embassy in the United States, published a letter on January 3, 1934, in response to a pamphlet about the famine.[16] In his letter, Skvirsky stated that the idea that the Soviet government was \"deliberately killing the population of the Ukraine\" \"wholly grotesque.\" He claimed that the Ukrainian population had been increasing at an annual rate of 2 percent during the preceding five years and asserted that the death rate in Ukraine \"was the lowest of that of any of the constituent republics composing the Soviet Union\", concluding that it \"was about 35 percent lower than the pre-war death rate of tsarist days.\"[17]\n\nMention of the famine was criminalized, punishable with a five-year term in the Gulag labor camps. Blaming the authorities was punishable by death.[6]\n\nFalsification and suppression of evidence [ edit ]\n\nThe true number of dead was concealed. At the Kiev Medical Inspectorate, for example, the actual number of corpses, 9,472, was recorded as only 3,997. The GPU was directly involved in the deliberate destruction of actual birth and death records, as well as the fabrication of false information to cover up information regarding the causes and scale of death in Ukraine.[18] Similar falsifications of official records were widespread.[6]\n\nThe January 1937 census, the first in 11 years, was intended to reflect the achievements of Stalin's rule. It became evident that population growth particularly in Ukraine failed to meet official targets—evidence of the mortality resulting from the famine and from associated indirect demographic losses. Those collecting the data, senior statisticians with decades of experience, were arrested and executed, including three successive heads of the Soviet Central Statistical Administration. The census data itself was locked away for half a century in the Russian State Archive of the Economy.[19][20]\n\nThe subsequent 1939 census was organized in a manner that certainly inflated data on population numbers. It showed a population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match the numbers stated by Joseph Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that March. No other census in the Soviet Union was conducted until 1959.\n\nSoviet campaign in the 1980s [ edit ]\n\nThe Soviet Union denied the existence of the famine until its 50th anniversary, in 1983, when the worldwide Ukrainian community coordinated famine remembrance. The Ukrainian diaspora exerted significant pressure on the media and various governments, including the United States and Canada, to raise the issue of the famine with the government of the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the Soviet government admitted that some peasantry died, it also sought to launch a disinformation campaign, in February 1983, to blame drought. The head of the directorate for relations with foreign countries for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), A. Merkulov, charged Leonid Kravchuk, the chief ideologue for the Communist Party in Ukraine, with finding rainfall evidence for the Great famine. This new evidence was to be sent to the Novosti press centers in the U.S. and Canada, denouncing the \"antidemocratic base of the Ukrainian bourgeois Nationalists, the collaboration of the Banderists and the Hitlerite Fascists during the Second World War.\"[21] Kravchuk's inquiry into the rainfalls for the 1932-1933 period found that they were within normal parameters.[22] Nevertheless, the official position regarding drought did not change.\n\nIn February 1983, Alexander Yakovlev, the Soviet Ambassador to Canada, in a secret analysis \"Some thoughts regarding the advertising of the Ukrainian SSR Pavilion held at the International Exposition \"Man and the world\" held in Canada\" put forward a prognosis for a campaign being prepared to bring international attention to the Ukrainian Holodomor which was spearheaded by the Ukrainian nationalist community. Yakovlev proposed a list of concrete proposals to \"neutralise the enemy ideological actions of the Ukrainian bourgeoise nationalists\".[23]\n\nBy April 1983, the bureau of the Soviet Novosti Press Agency had prepared and sent out a special press release denying the occurrence of the 1933 famine in Ukraine. This press release was sent to every major newspaper, radio and television station as well as University in Canada. It was also sent out to all members of the Canadian parliament.[24]\n\nOn July 5, 1983 the Soviet Embassy issued an official note of protest regarding the planned opening of a monument in memory of the victims of the Holodomor in Edmonton[25] attempting to smear the opening of the monument.\n\nIn October 1983, the World Congress of Ukrainians led by V-Yu Danyliv attempted to launch an international tribunal to judge the facts regarding the Holodomor. At the 4th World Congress of Ukrainians held in December 1983, a resolution was passed to form such an international tribunal.[26]\n\nFormer Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk recalled that he was responsible for countering the Ukrainian Diaspora's public education campaign of the 1980s, marking 50 years of the Soviet terror famine in 1983: \" In the early 1980s many publications began appearing in the Western press on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of one of the most horrific tragedies in the history of our people. A counter-propaganda machine was put into motion, and I was one of its wheels.\" The first book on the famine was published in Ukraine only in 1989, after a major shake-up that occurred in the Communist Party of Ukraine when Volodymyr Ivashko replaced Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and the Political Bureau decided that such book could be published. However, even in this book, \"the most terrifying photographs were not approved for print, and their number was reduced from 1,500 to around 350.\"[27]\n\nThe United States Congress created the Commission on the Ukraine famine in 1986. Soviet authorities were correct in their expectation that the commission would lay responsibility for the famine on the Soviet state.[28]\n\nUltimately, as President of Ukraine, Kravchuk exposed the official cover-up attempts and came out in support of recognizing the famine, named the \"Holodomor\".[29] as genocide.[22]\n\nDenial outside the USSR [ edit ]\n\nWalter Duranty [ edit ]\n\nAccording to Patrick Wright,[30] Robert C. Tucker,[31] Eugene Lyons,[32] Mona Charen[33] and Thomas Woods[34] one of the first Western Holodomor deniers was Walter Duranty, the winner of the 1932 Pulitzer prize in journalism in the category of correspondence, for his dispatches on Soviet Union and the working out of the Five Year Plan.[35] While the famine was raging, he wrote in the pages of The New York Times that \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\", and that \"there is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation, but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition.\"[32]\n\nDuranty was well aware of the famine. He said in private to Eugene Lyons and reported to the British Embassy that the population of Ukraine and Lower Volga had \"decreased\" by six to seven million.[36] However, in his reports, Duranty downplayed the impact of food shortages in Ukraine. As Duranty wrote in a dispatch from Moscow in March 1933, \"Conditions are bad, but there is no famine... But—to put it brutally—you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.\"[37]\n\nDuranty also wrote denunciations of those who wrote about the famine, accusing them of being reactionaries and anti-Bolshevik propagandists. In August 1933, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna called for relief efforts, stating that the Ukrainian famine was claiming lives \"likely... numbered... by the millions\" and driving those still alive to infanticide and cannibalism. The New York Times, August 20, 1933, reported Innitzer's charge and published an official Soviet denial: \"in the Soviet Union we have neither cannibals nor cardinals\". The next day, the Times added Duranty's own denial.\n\nBritish journalist Malcolm Muggeridge (who went hopefully to live in the New Civilization in 1932, but soon became disillusioned) said of Duranty that he \"always enjoyed his company; there was something vigorous, vivacious, preposterous, about his unscrupulousness which made his persistent lying somehow absorbing.\"[38] Muggeridge characterised Duranty as \"the greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of journalism.\"[39] Others have characterized Duranty as \"the number one Useful Idiot for Lenin first, and later for Stalin.\"[40]\n\nCampaigns were launched in 1986 for the retraction of the Pulitzer Prize given to The New York Times. The newspaper, however, declined to relinquish it, arguing that Duranty received the prize for his reporting several years before the occurrence of the famine.[41] While conceding that Duranty's coverage of the famine has since been \"largely discredited\", the Times noted that: \"Duranty's cabled dispatches had to pass Soviet censorship, and Stalin's propaganda machine was powerful and omnipresent. Duranty's analyses relied on official sources as his primary source of information, accounting for the most significant flaw in his coverage - his consistent underestimation of Stalin's brutality.\"\n\nSome historians consider Duranty's reports from Moscow to be crucial in the decision taken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to grant the Soviet Union diplomatic recognition in 1933.[42] Bolshevik Karl Radek said that was indeed the case.[4]\n\nBy prominent visitors to the USSR [ edit ]\n\nProminent British writers who visited the Soviet Union in 1934, such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, are also on record as denying the existence of the famine in Ukraine.[5][43]\n\nIn 1934 the British Foreign Office in the House of Lords stated that there was no evidence to support the allegations against the Soviet government regarding the famine in Ukraine, based on the testimony of Sir John Maynard, a renowned famine expert who visited Ukraine in the summer of 1933 and rejected \"tales of famine-genocide propagated by the Ukrainian Nationalists\".[citation needed]\n\nThe height of denial was reached during a visit to Ukraine carried out between August 26 and September 9, 1933, by French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot, who denied accounts of the famine and said that Soviet Ukraine was \"like a garden in full bloom\".[3] The day before his arrival, all beggars, homeless children and starving people were removed from the streets. Shop windows in local stores were filled with food, but purchases were forbidden, and anyone coming too close to the stores was arrested. The streets were washed. Just like all other Western visitors, Herriot met fake \"peasants\", all selected Communists or Komsomol members, who showed him healthy cattle.[44] Herriot declared to the press that there was no famine in Ukraine, that he did not see any trace of it, and that this showed adversaries of the Soviet Union were spreading the rumour. \"When one believes that the Ukraine is devastated by famine, allow me to shrug my shoulders\", he declared. The September 13, 1933 issue of Pravda was able to write that Herriot \"categorically contradicted the lies of the bourgeoisie press in connection with a famine in the USSR.\"[45]\n\nThe lack of knowledge of the famine was observed by English writer George Orwell, who commented that \"huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English Russophiles\".[46] In 1945, Orwell wrote, \"[I]t was considered equally proper to publicise famines when they happened in India and to conceal them when they happened in the Ukraine. And if this was true before the war, the intellectual atmosphere is certainly no better now.\"[47] Nigel Colley has written on the influence of the Ukrainian famine, and the Holodomor denial of Duranty, on Orwell's book Animal Farm.[47]\n\nDouglas Tottle [ edit ]\n\nIn the 1980s the Soviet Communist Party approached the Canadian Communist Party to engage journalist Douglas Tottle to prepare counter-propaganda materials under the title \"Fraud, Famine and Ukrainian Fascism\". Before final publication, the official reviewers of the tome in Kiev suggested that the name of the book be changed, as stated in their explanation \"Ukrainian fascism never existed\".[25][48]\n\nIn 1987, Tottle published his controversial book as Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard, in which he asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are \"fraudulent\", and \"a creation of Nazi propagandists\".[49] His book, published by Progress Publishers in Toronto, appeared around the same time Ukrainian Communist party leader Volodymyr Shcherbytsky publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987. As a result, the book was subsequently withdrawn from circulation.[50] In a review of Tottle's book in the Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, published by the pro-Communist Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, Wilfred Szczesny wrote: \"Members of the general public who want to know about the famine, its extent and causes, and about the motives and techniques of those who would make this tragedy into something other than what it was will find Tottle's work invaluable\" (The Ukrainian Canadian, April 1988, p. 24).[51] Some of Tottle's material appeared in a 1988 article in the Village Voice, \"In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right\".[52]\n\nIn 1988 the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine was set up to establish whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, however he ignored the request. While the commission was organized along judicial lines, it had no judicial power to compel witnesses to attend or testify. However Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission,[53] held between May 23–27, 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.[54]\n\nModern politics [ edit ]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe issue of the Holodomor has been a point of contention between Russia and Ukraine, as well as within Ukrainian politics. According to opinion polls, Russia has experienced an increase in pro-Stalin sentiments since the year 2000,[55] with over half viewing Stalin favourably in 2015.[56] Since independence, Ukrainian governments have passed a number of laws dealing with the Holodomor and the Soviet past, with the latest being the \"Decommunization laws\" of 2015.[57] The Russian government does not recognize the famine as an act of genocide against Ukrainians, viewing it rather as a \"tragedy\" that affected the Soviet Union as a whole. A 2008 letter from Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko asserted that the famine \"was not targeted at extermination of any single nation\", and accused Ukraine of exploiting it for political ends.[58] In November 2010 a leaked confidential U.S. diplomatic cable revealed that Russia had allegedly pressured its neighbors not to support the designation of the Holodomor as a genocide at the United Nations.[59] According to another leaked document, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described Israel's recognition of the Holodomor as \"historical revisionism\".[60]\n\nDenial literature [ edit ]\n\nIn 2006, the All-Ukrainian Public Association \"Intelligentsia of Ukraine for Socialism\" published a pamphlet titled \"The Myth of the Holodomor\" by G. S. Tkachenko. The pamphlet claimed that Ukrainian Nationalists and the US government were responsible for creating the \"myth.\" Russian publicist Yuri Mukhin has a published a book titled \"Hysterical Women of the Holodomor\", dismissing Holodomor as \"Russophobia\" and \"a trump card of the Ukrainian Nazis.\" Sigizmund Mironin's \"Holodomor in the Rus\" argued that the cause of the famine was not Stalin's policies, but rather the chaos engendered by the New Economic Policy.[61]\n\nRussian state media ran several articles denying the severity and causes of the Ukrainian famine.[62]\n\nUkrainian law [ edit ]\n\nOn November 28, 2006, Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed a law recognizing the 1932–1933 Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. The voting figures were as follows: supporting the bill were BYuT—118 deputies, NSNU—79 deputies, Socialists—30 deputies, 4 independent deputies, and the Party of Regions—2 deputies (200 deputies did not cast a vote). The Communist Party of Ukraine voted against the bill. In all, 233 deputies supported the bill—more than the minimum of 226 votes required to pass it into law.[63][64]\n\nA draft law \"On Amendments to the Criminal and the Procedural Criminal Codes of Ukraine\" was submitted by President Viktor Yushchenko for consideration by the Ukrainian Parliament. The draft law envisaged prosecution for public denial of the Holodomor Famine of 1932–1933 in Ukraine as a fact of genocide of the Ukrainian people, and of the Holocaust as the fact of genocide of the Jewish people. The draft law foresaw that public denial as well as production and dissemination of materials denying the above shall be punished by a fine of 100 to 300 untaxed minimum salaries, or imprisonment of up to two years.[65] The draft law, however, failed to receive support from incoming President Viktor Yanukovych, who, following his inauguration in 2010, declared: \"it would be wrong and unfair to recognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide against one nation\"—this among a number of actions seen as his pursuing a more Russocentric policy.[66] However, in 2011 he stated: \"Terrible years of totalitarianism have been a spiritual catastrophe: numerous churches were demolished, hundreds of thousands of peasants, workers, and intellectuals were physically eliminated or sent to the Gulag camps, almost every Ukrainian family suffered,\" and in 2012 affirmed: \"This crime has changed the history of Ukrainian people forever. It has been one of the severest challenges of Ukrainians. Holodomor not only killed people, but also had the purpose of causing fear and obedience.\"[67]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nVideo resources [ edit ]\n\nHarvest of Despair.

  "latent_1808": "Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony is the last he would complete. He never lived to finish his Ninth (although he came agonisingly close to completing the finale, music that's still shamefully little heard in concert halls), so the Eighth is the summation of his symphonic journey. And what a summit the Eighth is! Bruckner himself said when he finished the work's gigantic, revelatory finale: \"Hallelujah!… The Finale is the most significant movement of my life.\" Themes from all of the work's huge movements sound together at the end of the symphony, a moment that burns with what Robert Simpsons calls a \"blazing calm\". It's the end point of a 75-minute (well, up to 100-minute, if you're conductor Sergiu Celibidache…) symphonic journey, and it's one of the most existentially thrilling experiences a symphony has ever created. Bruckner's achievement is to make you feel, when you get there, that the whole experience of the piece is contained and transfigured in this crowning coming-together of symphonic space and time, and that the work's sublime darknesses - like the terrifying abysses of dissonance in the first movement, the kind of music that conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler described as Bruckner's \"battle of demons\" - and its equally transcendent light, like the climax of the slow movement, are simultaneously vindicated and vanquished by the sheer, breathtaking magnificence of this music, the last symphonic coda that Bruckner would ever compose.\n\nBut Bruckner's journey to the work's first performance, by the Vienna Philharmonic in 1892, was as tortuous as the music is (sometimes) serene. He finished a first version of the piece in 1887, and sent it to the conductor Hermann Levi, \"my artistic father\", who had already conducted the seventh symphony with huge success in Munich. Levi rejected the piece, saying it was basically unperformable; Bruckner was wounded, but returned to the piece to effectively recompose it over the next few years. And instead of the weak-minded naif who never got over people's criticism - as Bruckner is sometimes described - his revision amounts to a much deeper act of recomposition than simply answering Levi's concerns. The first movement ended in 1887 with a major-key triumph; in 1892, the audience heard instead music that winds down in minor-key desolation with a repeated, exhausted, death-rattle of a sigh in the violas. Bruckner himself wrote about this desperate moment, the only time in his life that he composed a symphonic first movement that didn't end with a fanfare of fortissimo power: \"this is how it is when one is on his deathbed, and opposite hangs a clock, which, while his life comes to its end, beats on ever steadily: tick, tock, tick, tock\". The other movements were also subtly but profoundly recalibrated; the effect is an intensification and sharpening of focus of Bruckner's musical ideas.\n\nSo all should have been set for the greatest night of his life at the premiere. And while the Musikverein was full of the great and good, including Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf and Johann Strauss, and with Bruckner's partisan supporters out in force, the naysayers were there as well. Brahms thought of Bruckner's works as \"symphonic boa-constrictors\", and the critic Eduard Hanslick - who left before the symphony's finale - wrote grudgingly, \"In each of the four movements, especially the first and third, some interesting passages, flashes of genius, shine through - if only the rest of it was not there! It is not impossible that the future belongs to this nightmarish hangover style - a future we therefore do not envy!\" Just as well he didn't stay till the end, Bruckner thought; he would only have become \"even angrier\".\n\nToday, Bruckner's Eighth should still be controversial. This is a piece that is attempting something so extraordinary that if you're not prepared to encounter its expressive demons, or to be shocked and awed by the places Bruckner's imagination takes you, then you're missing out on the essential experience of the symphony. If you think of Bruckner only as a creator of symphonic cathedrals of mindful - or mindless, according to taste - spiritual contemplation, who wields huge chunks of musical material around like an orchestral stone mason with implacable, monumental perfection, then you won't hear the profoundly disturbing drama of what he's really up to. That unsettling darkness is sounded right at the start of this symphony. Instead of setting out on a journey in which the outcome is certain, in which everything is its rightful place in the symphonic, tonal, and structural universe, Bruckner builds his grandest symphonic edifice on musical quicksand. The Eighth starts with an unstable tremor of a semitone in the violas, cellos, and basses, which turns into a snaking, searching, chromatic collection of fragments. It's not so much a theme as a series of atomic musical explorations, and all of them in the wrong key. This is a symphony 'in' C minor, and yet in the early stages of the first movement, that home key is confirmed more by how much Bruckner avoids it instead of how much he inhabits it. You can describe the progress of this whole opening movement in terms of sonata forms and second and third themes and the other trainspotting jargon of the symphonic rulebook, but that scarcely relates to the experience of living inside this music, which is what you will feel happens when you hear it. One special moment to listen out for: the cataclysm at the centre of the movement that results in one of the emptiest, most desolate musical landscapes Bruckner, or anyone else, ever conceived: a single flute that somehow survives the onslaught to play a remnant of the orchestral tutti over tolling, funereal tattoos in the trumpets and chromatic sighs in the basses.\n\nAll of this intensity invites a search for meaning. Bruckner's music is open to our imaginations, and he even suggested possible interpretations himself for the symphony. In a letter to the conductor Felix Weingartner, he said that the scherzo, which comes second in this symphony (the first time Bruckner places the scherzo before the slow movement in a symphony) is a portrait of the figure of \"German Michael\", a bucolic rustic from German folk tradition. The somnolent, radiant, harp-haloed trio section of the scherzo depicts Michael dreaming, Bruckner says.\n\nThe opening of the finale is inspired by the Cossacks, as the Russians had recently visited the Austrian Emperor, to whom the Eighth is dedicated; this movement also features 'the death march and then (brass) transfiguration. Bruckner doesn't talk about the slow movement, but the adagio, the third movement, is the huge, generous heart of the symphony; a consoling, palpitating dream in D flat major whose opening is the closest Bruckner ever came to an evocation of the erotic; yet that bodily experience is transfigured into a blindingly radiant climax that seems to speak for the universe rather than mere individual figures.\n\nOr maybe that's just me: you will make up your own mind, because the power of this piece can't be limited by any single interpretation, whether that's Bruckner's words, or the vision a particular conductor has of this symphony. But as you listen to that awe-inspiring but intimate, visionary but coherent finale - whose drama again can't be explicated by the crude pigeonholes of musical rules and regulations; instead, its \"form\" is phenomenological, something you just have to experience - I think you should hear the darkness as much as the \"blazing calm\" of the coda. It's in its acceptance of doubt, darkness, and despair that this symphony achieves its real glory.

  "latent_1952": "Experts say the projected cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has gone up another trillion dollars, but the general sound we hear from Congress isn’t outrage. More likely it’s the sound of crickets.\n\nCrickets most definitely from the empty chairs at the House Veterans Affairs Committee, a clear majority of which didn’t bother to show up Thursday for a full panel meeting on Capitol Hill regarding the “True Cost of War.” Granted, Congress had just adjourned until mid-November that morning, and most members had one foot out the door before 10 a.m., itching hard to hit the campaign trail in their home districts. They do have priorities, you know.\n\nYou could practically count the number of members who bothered to show up on one hand, and they were all Democrats. Three congressmen not on the committee sat in, including Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), one of the few GOP war critics in Congress, who sat noticeably in front of 25 empty committee seats. But within an hour or so, all were gone but Chairman Bob Filner (D-Calif.), looking lonely across from the sizable (but definitely not standing room only) audience of mostly veterans’ advocates all too used to the feeling of talking to a wall.\n\nThe media presence also appeared close to nil – save for me and another guy at the end of a very long, empty table, and perhaps one blogger somewhere in the crowd.\n\nThe hearing certainly didn’t generate the atmospheric drama as say, a Hill visit by Stephen Colbert, but testimony by the morning’s key witnesses was dramatic, if not foreboding, and much more critical than much of the hoo-hah that passes for “the people’s business” in Congress these days.\n\nAccording to researchers Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, authors of The Three Trillion Dollar War, their 2008 estimates for the long-term cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were too conservative; in fact, they were way off. They pointed specifically to the cost of veterans’ care, which they revised up from $717 billion to $934 billion – nearly $1 trillion in health and disability costs alone!\n\nWhy? Stiglitz and Bilmes estimated two years ago that 30 to 33 percent of returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans (fewer than 400,000) would have sought care in the Veterans Administration (VA) health system by 2010. But as of March, more than 565,000 such veterans have already been treated by the VA. They hadn’t expected to reach that number until 2016.\n\nAnd that figure is likely much higher today. According to Paul Sullivan, director of Veterans for Common Sense (VCS), new patients average some 9,000 a month. Taking that into account, there could be closer to 620,000 new vets in the system today.\n\nAs a result, estimates for long-term medical care were revised up from $284 billion to $348 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Stiglitz and Bilmes estimated two years ago that between 366,000 and 398,000 returning vets would have filed disability compensation (cash) claims by 2010, when in fact, more than 518,000 have already filed such claims. So, the researchers revised their estimates for long-term disability costs from $388 billion to $534 billion.\n\nFurthermore, estimates for disability payments through Social Security went from $43 billion to $52 billion.\n\nThis is just a snapshot of course. These figures, Stiglitz and Bilmes point out, do not include costs to Medicare or military TRICARE for Life or active duty health care spending, which has gone up a staggering 167 percent since 2001. They don’t include vet-related costs to state and local governments, the GI Bill, home loan guarantees, job training services, and expanding VA facilities and programs due to increased demands.\n\nBottom line, 2008 estimates for the costliest of veterans’ care – medical, disability and Social Security payments – had to be revised up 25 percent based on current trends, said Stiglitz, a 2000 Nobel Memorial Prize winner. “The new book should be called the ‘Four to Six Trillion Dollar War and Increasing,’” he told the committee. “We will be getting a full assemblage of numbers in January. What is clear … the total cost is substantially higher.”\n\nSuch news should have the effect of a bugle blast on the Congress. Or at least induce queasiness, suggested Winslow Wheeler, budget analyst for the Center for Defense Information.\n\n“When Bilmes and Stiglitz originally estimated the cost of the $3 trillion dollar war, everybody gagged, especially the advocates who said the war would be near ‘self-financing,’” he told Antiwar.com. “Now, they need to gag a little harder. We should too.”\n\nOne would think that for all of the marching, praying and campaigning against unwieldy federal spending and the debt, there might be a much broader discussion over whether our increasingly unpopular wars are worth the cost.\n\nIgnorance is prevailing instead, said Filner. “It’s like looking at the homeless, no one wants to look at it. I don’t think Americans want to know the true cost of war.”\n\nMembers of Congress certainly have a hard time with it. Filner noted that Congress is just getting down to compensating World War II vets caught up in atomic testing [.pdf] and Vietnam veterans suffering from the effects of Agent Orange. “This is a disgrace … an abrogation of our fundamental responsibility as a Congress,” he said, noting “the system we have makes it much easier to send our troops into harm’s way … than to care for them when they get home.”\n\nIn their original report, Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University, and Bilmes, who teaches public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, assessed the long-term costs of the war based on operations continuing through 2017. They did this in an attempt to show the American public that aside from the Goliath budget for the Department of Defense – $680 billion for fiscal year 2010 alone – and the terribly expensive operational costs of the war – more than $1 trillion since 2001 – there are a range of long-term hidden and often overlooked costs like veterans’ care, and the economic and social costs of the war.\n\n“Long-term veterans’ costs as they are now are beginning to approach the cost of what we spend in actual combat operations,” said Bilmes. “We know at least at the minimum, the veterans’ costs will be higher than what we expected.”\n\nOver the last nine years, more than 2.1 million Americans have served more than three million tours of duty and 1.25 million veterans have returned home. Long-term costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts can be expected to be higher than previous conflicts because of 1) higher survival rates for injured soldiers, 2) higher instances of Post Traumatic Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health ailments, 3) more vets applying for benefits and 4) more generous benefits over all, Stiglitz and Bilmes told the committee.\n\nHere’s is some language that the Tea Partiers – none of which, by the way, were pressing into the Veterans’ Affairs Committee room Thursday – might understand. According to the Stiglitz-Bilmes team, “the U.S. debt rose from $6.5 trillion to $10 trillion between 2003 and 2008, before the financial crisis. At least one-fourth of that debt is directly attributable to the wars,” and that doesn’t include the “unfunded liabilities” wrapped up in caring for veterans.\n\nThat would include someone like Robert Warren, 20, who is recovering from a bomb blast he survived in Afghanistan in May, shortly after he arrived in-country. According to a Washington Post feature on Sunday, Warren has a piece of shrapnel in his carotid artery and a large portion of his skull removed by doctors so that he might survive. He has severe brain injuries that affect his long-term memory and other cognitive skills. He has years of rehabilitation ahead of him; he just became a father.\n\nRobert Warren (Photo by Marvin Joseph)\n\nWarren joins the rest of the 20 percent of service members who are estimated to have incurred some level of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the battlefield and survived. The “signature wound” of the current war, science is still trying to catch up with the how to best diagnose TBI, how to heal it, and how to integrate soldiers back into their lives while they are forced to live with it. And it is expensive, according to lawmakers present at Thursday’s hearing – Congress has already approved $1.2 billion in TBI-related funding. Next month, according to the Post, the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda will open a $65 million TBI unit, which will only be able to care for 20 severely damaged individuals at a time.\n\nAnd the injuries keep coming. According to Sullivan at VCS, a total of 92,384 servicemembers have been wounded or were medically evacuated due to injury or illness since the war began. And it will certainly increase, with 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and 50,000 still in Iraq today.\n\n“The scale of our financial commitment to providing for veterans is huge,” said Stiglitz and Bilmes. “But at present, the U.S. has no provision for how it will pay for this long-term liability.”\n\nSeveral Democrats have thought this through before. They think that if the country is going to send its men and women off to a bloody war, it should at least be able to pay for it. The “Share the Sacrifice Act,” which would incorporate a temporary tax to offset the costs of the war, has seen different incarnations, but has so far failed to get off the ground, mainly because Republicans see it as a Democratic ploy to end the war and most Democrats are too scared to push it.\n\nSo now Filner says he will be proposing a “Veterans Trust Fund,” to be paid for with a “surcharge,” dedicated to ensuring these astronomical costs will be paid, despite hard times and changing political winds. One veterans’ advocate sitting in the audience Thursday pointed out that while Congress has indeed been attentive to their needs – VA appropriations have increased from $90 billion to $125 billion in the last four years – there is no guarantee that a shift in party control this November won’t give way to “extremists that want to cut back and then privatize VA under the smokescreen of cutting the debt.”\n\nHere’s an idea – how about ending the wars? Several (failed) attempts were made in July by members to start withdrawing troops now (instead of 2011 – what’s the difference?). Most “experts” are increasingly framing operations in Afghanistan as hopeless, and with Muqtada al Sadr on the ascent in Iraq, we’re likely not too long for that place either. Why not save a few skulls (and a lot more money) in the meantime? Then we can concentrate on the billions in lifetime costs we’re already obligated to pay.\n\nIf a kid repeatedly broke his bones climbing trees, his father wouldn’t take on a part-time job just to pay for the medical bills, he would tell the kid to stop climbing the damn trees and come home.\n\nWe need to get our men and women out of the trees and back home, and then we can start the healing.\n\nRead more by Kelley B.

  "latent_2058": "A black former West Covina police officer sued the city and four of his white ex-supervisors Tuesday, alleging he was fired after a little more than a year on the job for complaining that he was harassed because of his race and was called “big black ghetto cop” and “the black kid.”\n\nJoshua Volasgis’ Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit names as individual defendants Lt. Ronald Allen, Lt. Kenneth Plunket, Sgt. Houston Clements and Sgt. Brian Prizzi. The suit alleges racial discrimination and harassment, retaliation and failure to prevent harassment and discrimination.\n\nA representative for West Covina City Attorney Kimberly Hall Barlow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Volasgis performed his duties in an “exemplary fashion” after being hired by the city in June 2016. He claims that throughout his employment, his supervisors told him his main focus should be to “stop blacks in West Covina” because he had “free reign over the black community because plaintiff does not have to fear any allegations of racial bias.”\n\n“Almost immediately after being hired, plaintiff began to be harassed because of his race,” his suit states. “Plaintiff was subjected to inappropriate racial comments, jokes and slurs concerning his race on a daily basis.”\n\nIn addition to calling him “big black ghetto cop” and “the black kid,” the supervisors told him that the next time a burglary occurred, they would send him to the scene without a badge, meaning that no suspect would see him so long as he did not smile, according to his court papers.\n\nHis bosses also told Volasgis that he “would not like it if (they) called plaintiff (the N-word),” and they spoke to him in a “slave-era dialect,” the complaint alleges.\n\nVolasgis says he complained about the remarks and the alleged mistreatment, but the comments and harassment only increased.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges that Allen told him, “Remember who you are and what you are,” and Plunket told him, “Reputation means a lot here and we are like a small family.”\n\nAfter telling Volasgis that he had a “stack of blank internal affairs investigations in my office with your name on them,” Clements warned the plaintiff, “Keep pushing it,” the suit alleges.\n\nVolasgis alleges he was wrongfully suspended April 28 in connection with an incident in which a suspect struck two officers while reaching for a box cutter. Volasgis, who was fired Aug. 28, says he was told he lost his job for “failing to satisfactorily meet the requirements of probation.”\n\nVolasgis alleges he actually lost his job for coming forward with his complaints about his supervisors’ conduct toward him.",
  "latent_2082": "August 20, 2013 at 12:21 PM\n\nBy Brian Nemhauser\n\nBrian Nemhauser is full-time father and Director of Product Management, and a part-time founder of HawkBlogger.com. His wife could not stand hearing one more thing about the Seahawks, so now he pours all his passion for the team into his blog. He is a regular guest on the Dave “Softy” Mahler show on Sports Radio KJR (950 AM). Follow him on Twitter at @hawkblogger.\n\nLeadership in the NFL is overrated. A bad team will not become good due to having great leaders in the locker room. A good general manager evaluates players on talent, cost, and ability to sustain performance (think age and durability). Keeping an older, more expensive, leader over a younger and cheaper player of similar talent is a surefire way to limit the flexibility of a front office.\n\nMichael Robinson is a popular player on a very popular Seahawks team. He is a recognized leader in the locker room, where his teammates voted him special-teams captain last year. Yet he may also have played his last game as a Seahawk.\n\nRobinson began his career with the Seahawks in 2010 as part of the massive roster turnover orchestrated by general manager John Schneider and coach Pete Carroll in their first season in Seattle. San Francisco had cut Robinson, and the Seahawks picked him up a day later. A punishing fullback who has earned Pro Bowl accolades on the field, Robinson is also the charismatic creator off the field of The Real Rob Report – a behind-the-scenes video series on YouTube. Seattle rewarded Robinson’s performance with a two-year, $5 million contract extension in 2012. The combination of great play and likability has made Robinson a fan favorite. But the combination of cost and age (30) make him vulnerable.\n\nIt is hard to fault people who ignore the financial side of the NFL. Fans want to see great football, not examine balance sheets. Turning a blind eye to the dollars and cents, however, will leave you susceptible to shock when a player you love is shown the door. He may be healthy and playing well, but the NFL is a fixed economy with a salary cap and roster limit. Robinson’s salary of $2.5 million in 2013 makes him the third-highest paid fullback in the NFL, and the 32nd-highest paid back overall, according to OverTheCap.com. He is the 16th-highest paid Seahawk, and his salary is more than double players like Bobby Wagner and Golden Tate; more than triple players like Brandon Browner, Russell Wilson and K.J. Wright; and more than quadruple someone like Richard Sherman. Consider that when debating how much Robinson’s leadership is worth.\n\nThe Seahawks are set to spend over $13 million on the backfield in 2013 between Robinson, Marshawn Lynch, Christine Michael and Robert Turbin. That is fourth-most in the NFL, according to OverTheCap.com. Robinson’s $2.5 million salary contains no guarantees for 2013, meaning he can be cut with no impact to the salary cap. That is a lot of money to spend on a player that was on the field only 32 percent of the time in 2012, according to FootballOutsiders.com snap count data. Robinson only played around 30 more snaps than J.R. Sweezy, a part-time guard last season. The use of schemes like the read-option, and the increasing use of three-receiver sets decreases the need for a fullback even more. That is without injured Percy Harvin in the lineup, who will take more snaps away when he lines up in the backfield on occasion.\n\nCarroll may have the reputation of an easygoing player’s coach, but he and Schneider have proven to be ruthless when it comes to pruning their roster to keep it affordable and young. Past leaders like Lawyer Milloy, Lofa Tatupu and Matt Hasselbeck were all shown the door. If leadership was not a concern back then, when the team identity was still forming, it certainly is not now when players like Wilson, Max Unger, Red Bryant, and Kam Chancellor patrol the locker room. Carroll is not going to establish any one leader on the team. His goal is to create a roster full of leaders. Every player who pulls on a Seahawks uniform is expected to uphold the values of the franchise, and if a player needs a leader to stay in line, he will not be a Seahawk for long.\n\nNone of this is to say Robinson is certain to be cut before the season begins. The front office will not cut talent just to save money. Affordable young players must be available who can perform at a similar level. That is why Derrick Coleman’s strong performance at fullback and on special teams matters. It is why the recent news of receiver Phil Bates getting snaps at fullback matters.\n\nSeattle knows what is has in Robinson. He is terrific fullback, and a great public face for the franchise. He is also expensive and aging. Which characteristic ends up deciding his fate will be one of the more fascinating story lines to watch through the rest of the exhibition season. One thing is certain: Leadership will have nothing to do with it.\n\nWant to be a reader contributor to The Seattle Times’ Take 2 blog?

I've got a MacBook, an iPhone and I'll be first in line for a new iPad when it hits the shelves.\n\nBut I'm also a foodie with time on his hands. So what better way to show appreciation for my much-loved Apple products than to create a tasty sculpture in the form of Apple's venerable leader?\n\nAnd with Apple's latest blockbuster product launch just around the corner, I figured that my iPad Launch Party would be the perfect place for the unveiling. You ARE going to an iPad launch party, aren't you?\n\nSteve's piercing gaze and strong personality\n\nmake him a natural choice for bold food pairings. Steve's piercing gaze and strong personalitymake him a natural choice for bold food pairings.\n\nI figured that cheese was a great medium for food carving, and would go well with many a tasty meal.\n\nMozzarella has the right consistency, is pliable when melted slightly, and its pasty-white color matches the skin tone of many a computer geek like Steve and myself.\n\nSee below for directions on how to create your own Cheese Head and for three tasty recipes that go perfectly with Steve Cheese.\n\nCreating His Steveness\n\nIf you're going to create your own tasty CEO goodness, make sure you've got some good pictures to reference while you carve. I used the one above, along with one or two profile shots so I could get the full 3D effect.\n\nStart out with a few of those big blocks of mozzarella cheese. You can hold them together with toothpicks or chopsticks that have been neatly clipped.\n\nNext up, carve out the basic human skull shape. Don't worry too much about the details yet — just go for the large feature areas. Map out where you're going to put the eyes, nose and chin. A paring knife — I'm a fan of this one — works great for this type of work and for the detail work to follow.\n\nThe nose and ears require detailed carving, so work on those separately. You can attach them with glue made of gobs of slightly melted cheese. In fact, as you progress, those melted cheese blobs should be applied liberally to give the head its smooth, human look.\n\nFinally, apply the beard and hair using a flat spoon filled with ground pepper. Be careful with this step — it's a pain to remove specs of pepper once they've stuck to the cheese.\n\nNow that your Steve is carved and ready to go, choose from one of the following three delicious recipes to complete your meal. Please follow the recipes carefully — you should resist the temptation to throw Steve onto your barbecue at all times.\n\nRecipe #1: Apple Cheese Plate\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head\n\nAssorted gourmet cheeses such as brie, camembert or stilton\n\nCrackers\n\nFruit\n\nThe cheese plate allows your guests to get a good look at Steve's entire head. This recipe is a great one to choose if your sculpture has few imperfections. Simply mount the head on a base of partially-melted cheese and arrange various food items around the edges.\n\nGuests will be reluctant to take a carving out of your masterpiece, so you might have to be the first to dive in. I recommend starting with a nose or an ear — that way your guests will know you mean business. The pepper adds some zing to the somewhat-bland mozzarella.\n\nRecipe #2: Spicy Steve Nachos Supreme\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head\n\nJalapenos\n\nTomatoes\n\nSour Cream\n\nOlives\n\nTortilla chips\n\nSteve has been known to be somewhat \"spicy\" to his underlings, especially around product launch time. What better way to celebrate this personality trait than with hot 'n spicy nachos?\n\nThe preparation is simple — line a cast-iron pot with tortilla chips and rest Steve comfortably on top. Garnish with tomatoes, jalapenos and olives.\n\nBe sure to show off Steve to your guests at this point, since he'll be unrecognizable soon enough.\n\nYou'll want Steve to melt quickly without burning the chips, so bake covered at 375 degrees until the cheese is bubbly.\n\nRemove glasses and serve with a side of sour cream and/or salsa.\n\nRecipe #3: iPad Thai\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Steve Jobs Cheese Head\n\n1 Large serving Pad Thai. Recipes found here\n\nTired of waiting for your new iPad? This tasty iPad Thai will tide you over, and it costs a lot less too.\n\nSimply prepare Pad Thai the way you usually do — any variation will be fine. Arrange the noodles on an attractive platter, while leaving room for Steve in the middle. Mount Steve in a well of noodles and provide a knife for those guests who'd like a little cheese with their fusion cuisine.\n\nMore Info\n\nI'll be serving iPad Thai at our iPad launch party — how about you?

Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – Sober was the morning after Iowa’s caucuses in 2008 at Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign headquarters where, that year, she finished third, and several factors in the race appeared to be breaking against her.\n\nClinton lost that round to then-senator Barack Obama of Illinois in a state with a population that is almost entirely white. She lost big among young women and men alike, in cities and their suburbs.\n\nObama – the first African-American seriously considered for the presidency – was hailed by Democratic party elders as viable in a general election. Several forces thus conspired against a Clinton nomination: a broad, diverse and enthusiastic Democratic coalition backing her rival; unassigned “super delegates” to the Democratic National Convention flocking to his cause, considering him a winning candidate against the Republicans; significant endorsements from the Democratic Party establishment; and the continued presence of several other candidates in the primary race – former North Carolina senator John Edwards chief among them – who were earning roughly 15 percent of the total vote in early voting states.At the end of the day, after competing in all 50 states, Clinton nevertheless won 48% of all pledged delegates to the Democratic convention that year. Obama won 47%. She won the popular vote, but Obama took the nomination with a majority of super delegate support from the party establishment.Despite facing a formidable Obama coalition backed by significant donors and establishment support, Clinton’s support was also broad and competitive – and is even more so today as she enters a contest far less contentious with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.All the factors that broke against Clinton in 2008 are breaking for her in 2016. Clinton’s support in Iowa’s cities and suburbs on Monday night proved robust; voters from minority groups that in 2008 supported Obama are now firmly in her camp; and she maintains virtually absolute support of the party establishment, with Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, earning no endorsements from his colleagues.Should Clinton perform merely as well as she did in 2008, she is on track to win both the popular vote and the pledged delegate count – plus the requisite number of super delegates to clinch the nomination.And her leads, according to polls, in key delegate-rich states such as Florida, Texas, California, New York and Illinois suggest that won’t be necessary.Sanders’ surge in Iowa reflects a flirtation with socialism within the Democratic Party – a flirtation with a specific brand of liberalism that has ebbed and flowed for decades.That is a significant story, but different from one that suggests Sanders has a considerable shot at winning the Democratic nomination.What concerns leadership in the Democratic Party is not those who voted for Sanders in Iowa, or those who will vote enthusiastically for him in New Hampshire next week.Their concern is with voters who voted against Clinton.Iowa provided the party with its first batch of hard data, and the numbers confirm that Clinton has a credibility problem.According to exit polls, fully one quarter of Democratic caucus-goers voted based on which candidate they deemed most honest and trustworthy – Clinton earned 10% of those voters to Sanders’s 83%.Those numbers in Iowa are reflected in national polls, and they will affect her performance in New Hampshire, and the states to come immediately following: South Carolina and Nevada. But, perhaps more significantly, the question is a top consideration for independent voters in all general elections.Whether or not Bernie Sanders is a realistic alternative, Democrats may begin to concern themselves with Clinton’s own electability in November, with numbers suggesting that the base of their own party views the front-runner with skeptical eyes.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Jeremy Corbyn’s strong performance during the election campaign must not disguise the fact that the party lost a contest that was “easily winnable”, a former senior aide to Tony Blair has warned.\n\nTwo more weeks and Labour would have been in power, says shadow chancellor Read more\n\nPeter Hyman, the former prime minister’s head of strategic communications, said that Corbyn deserved significant credit for an effective campaign and an ability to energise young voters.\n\nHowever, he told the Observer that this success should not hide the fact that the party fell to a third successive loss and had been boosted by an “incredibly strong protest vote”.\n\n“Of course Jeremy Corbyn did better than anyone expected in this election, including many in the Labour party,” he said. “He deserves credit for running a far better campaign than Theresa May, but there has also got to be some realism about this. Labour has lost a third election in a row and it was an election that, with the right people and programme, was easily winnable.\n\n“If you think the Tory majority was only [small] and May fought a terrible campaign, this should have been an election that Labour won. It is like a football match where you are 5-0 down, you claw it back to 5-4 and claim you won the cup. Well we haven’t won the cup. We have done better than expected, but we are not in power. None of the policies that people want from that manifesto are going to be implemented.”\n\nExtensive plans were drawn up before the unexpectedly strong performance for a comprehensive, two-year review of the party’s purpose and policy platform. Moderates now fear that Corbyn’s strong showing, which saw him secure the party’s highest vote share since 2001, will disguise Labour’s shortcomings.\n\nMany moderates spoke out in the immediate aftermath of the election result to praise Corbyn, with Lord Mandelson among those to say the Labour leader had managed to deliver a political earthquake. Senior figures, including Chuka Umunna and Angela Eagle, are now understood to be happy to return to the frontbench.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chuka Umunna and Angela Eagle, both former opponents of Jeremy Corbyn, are believed to be happy to return to Labour’s frontbench. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian\n\nHowever, others in the party are starting to break cover to suggest that Corbyn narrowly failed to defeat a Conservative party that ran one of the worst campaigns in British political history. Writing in the Observer, Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley who has been critical of Corbyn, says that opponents of the leader will now divide into three groups. Some would “jump on the team Corbyn bandwagon”, while some will “remain a thorn in his side”.\n\n“The group I will be in is the one that recognises that we didn’t win this election but we are on the way to winning the next one if we get it right,” she writes. “I will never be a blinkered cheerleader of anyone (ask my kids) and while I got his electability half wrong I would be doing him and the country a disservice by donning the white robes of worship and ignoring my concerns.”\n\nHyman accepted that there was an appetite among the public for less austerity and funded investment in public services, but urged the party to now try to combine “the idealism and fresh politics which Corbyn tapped into with a proper programme for government”.\n\n“We’ve still got a huge mountain to climb,” he said. “Credit to Corbyn in terms of fighting a better campaign. Credit in terms of energising young people. But it all has to be coupled with a genuine realism – we have lost.\n\n“The sort of ‘one more heave’ approach – more of the same next time will push us over the line – would be completely misguided. Spending more money is not the whole answer to lots of problems. It has got to be money and fresh thinking. If we want to improve education in the university sector, it is obviously popular to say we will get rid of tuition fees, but that is not a programme – that is not a policy prospectus. It is a single piece of spending.\n\nPlay Video 0:12 Corbyn celebrates great election night with one of worst high fives of all time - video\n\n“We have to see this for what it was – an incredibly strong protest vote for Labour. It is not yet the public saying they want Labour in power. We’ve got to work out seriously and not be carried away with the result.”\n\nHe spoke after Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor and critic of Corbyn, said that Labour missed an “open goal” by losing the election. He said Labour had secured an “OK result” by increasing its share of the vote and securing 262 seats.\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We haven’t won that election. We shouldn’t pretend that this is a famous victory. It is good as far as it’s gone but it’s not going to be good enough. I’ve never known a more beatable prime minister than Theresa May – brittle, I think. Very, very wobbly and shaky indeed.”",
  "latent_2537": "Spread the love\n\nMorton County, ND — In return for heroically de-escalating a situation in which an employee of the Dakota Access Pipeline pointed a loaded AR-15 at bystanders, Brennon Nastacio is being charged with a felony — and has been placed on the Morton County Sheriff’s most wanted list.\n\n“I am being charged with a Class C Felony for Terrorizing Kyle Thompson,” Nastacio, a Pueblo Native American with two children, told Native News Online. “I protected him and they (Morton County) are treating me like a criminal. Now I have to pay all sorts of legal fees and I don’t have the funds for that.”\n\nVideo captured Nastacio attempting to calm Thompson — who falsely presented himself in Standing Rock as one of the water protectors opposing the pipeline — out of a rampage, and potentially worse.\n\nNastacio and other water protectors, who were all unarmed, held Thompson at bay until Bureau of Indian Affairs police arrived to place him under arrest. Shortly afterward, local law enforcement picked him up and the FBI took the man into custody for further questioning — but the Morton County Sheriff’s Department astonishingly refused to press charges against Thompson, claiming he’d acted in self-defense — and nothing came of the FBI’s interaction.\n\nOn October 27, a white truck sped toward peaceful water protectors near Highway 1806’s Backwater Bridge — its driver holding an AR-15 rifle. Out of grave concern the man might be intending to shoot someone, one of the protectors attempted to reach into the vehicle to stop it — but the man veered the truck and began speeding at a group of witnesses.\n\nOne witness told The Free Thought Project the driver nearly hit them and several other bystanders as they tried to divert the truck from the road and prevent it from reaching the densely-populated camps.\n\nAfter receiving an alert about the incident, security from one of the pipeline opposition camps — to be clear, not the police, but unarmed individuals tasked with ensuring no weapons are brought into the encampments — quickly drove to the scene and ran the rogue truck off the road to protect everyone’s safety.\n\nBut the driver immediately jumped out of the vehicle brandishing the loaded rifle and a 9mm pistol at security and bystanders on the scene — but the small group managed to corral the man into a nearby pond.\n\n“You can’t kill all of us,” one person told the armed man. “You’re just going to make things worse.”\n\nThat’s approximately when Nastacio stepped up, waded into the water, and tried to convince the armed man to hand over his weapon and not harm any of the water protectors.\n\n“I kept telling Kyle I would make sure nothing happened to him if he gave me his gun. I was trying to protect him and everyone in camp. Right now with all this police violence in the media, I knew that cops could aim to kill. I didn’t want him to get shot. I just wanted him to give up the gun,” Nastacio told Native News.\n\nIt wasn’t until after Bureau of Indian Affairs made the arrest that witnesses discovered documents in the truck identifying the gunman as Kyle Thompson — Dakota Access Pipeline employee — and a log sheet linking the Chevy truck to Knightsbridge Risk Management, which helps run security for the company.\n\n“I now understand that Thompson was run off the road before me arriving at the scene and he is a DAPL worker,” Nastacio explained. “At the time I didn’t know any of those details. I just knew that I wanted to keep everyone safe.”\n\nMorton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier painted a deeply flawed account of events — disputed plainly by witness video and testimonials — describing Thompson, a U.S. Army veteran, as the victim in the incident, since he was forced to draw the weapon against advancing water protectors with knives.\n\nAlthough Nastacio did, indeed, have a knife in his possession, video clearly shows it remained on his hip throughout the encounter with Thompson — and the only clear threat to anyone was the Dakota Access employee.\n\nIn fact, the hero worried for the safety of thousands of people camped at Standing Rock — particularly given the number of women, children, and elders present.\n\n“My son came to camp with me in August,” Nastacio explained. “All I could think about was his and everyone at camps safety. That’s why I went towards Kyle when folks called me, even though all I had to defend myself and everyone was a knife.”\n\nFor his courageous role in stopping a rifle-toting pipeline employee from acting violently against water protectors, Nastacio now must fund a legal defense against charges — for which a GoFundMe campaign can be found here — and faces a possible stint behind bars, given the notoriously biased criminal justice system. A petition to North Dakota State Attorney Allen Koppy to have all charges against Nastacio dropped has nearly reached its goal.\n\nMeanwhile, the gun-wielding pipeline employee remains a free man and will not have to suffer the consequences for his aggression against peaceful people.\n\nNastacio defused the situation without employing violence — and said he wouldn’t hesitate to act again in defense of the innocent:\n\n“I would do it all over again. I protected everyone including Kyle. Now I need people to help me with the fees I have to pay for being a hero.”",

Their exact numbers are unclear, as the bulk of them are undocumented.\n\nAlthough Turkey and Armenia are frequently at loggerheads in the international arena, these tensions are not high on the agenda of the thousands of Armenians who come to Turkey for a better life. For many, the quest for better living standards prevails over politics and nationalism.\n\nTansu Ciller, a former Turkish prime minister, said there were 30,000 undocumented Armenian citizens living in Turkey in 2000. Former Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul put the number at 40,000 in 2005, while Yasar Yakis, who held the foreign affairs post the following year, estimated there were 70,000.\n\nRELATED: Q&A: Turkey looks beyond 'Armenian genocide' debate\n\nLast Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey retained the right to deport the estimated 100,000 non-Turkish Armenian nationals working in Turkey. The statement came hours before a European Parliament vote on a resolution calling for Turkey to recognise the 1915 mass killings of Armenians as \"genocide\".\n\nThis is not the first time the Turkish president has commented on undocumented Armenian immigrants following public disputes between the two countries. He made a similar statement in 2010 in reaction to the lobbying activities of the Armenian diaspora.\n\nInside Story - Debating genocide\n\nTensions between Armenia and Turkey date back to the break-up of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, when Turkish authorities decided to expel Armenians from their homes in eastern Anatolia to Syria.\n\nAnkara agrees that many Armenians died in the ethnic fighting and the deportation process that ensued between 1915 and 1917, putting its estimate at 300,000 casualties. Armenia says 1.5 million died in what it calls a genocide, an accusation denied by Turkey. The centenary of the mass killings will be commemorated on April 24.\n\nBaruyr Kuyumciyan, the community editor of Agos newspaper published in Turkey, told Al Jazeera the number of Armenian immigrants in Turkey has been exaggerated.\n\n\"Turkey is a transition point. Some of the Armenians just pass by Turkey and continue to Europe,\" he said. \"Since they enter on a tourist visa and leave through illegal ways, only their entry is recorded. Thus, the data is misleading.\"\n\nThe Turkish government allows citizens of its Asian neighbours to enter the country freely. As a result, citizens of neighbouring countries with lower standards of living, such as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia come to Turkey to make a better living, entering without visas or on tourist visas and then overstaying those visas.\n\nDavit Khachatryan, the 26-year-old vice principal of Turkey's de facto Armenian school, has been living in the country for two years and possesses a residency permit.\n\n\"I didn't decide to come here overnight. My parents have been here for 14 years now. I am a law graduate with a master's degree, but there were no jobs in Armenia,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"I earn $600 a month, which is more than twice the money I would earn in Armenia. Families living here would go back if they could earn the same money back in Armenia.\"\n\nTo get a residency permit as Khachatryan did, immigrants must convince Turkish authorities that they have enough resources to live in Turkey by presenting high-value bank deposit slips, which immigrant families rarely have.\n\nA 57-year-old teacher told Al Jazeera, on condition of anonymity, that she came to Turkey nine years ago and has been living in the country since then without a legal status. A mother of three daughters, she has not been back to Armenia since entering Turkey.\n\n\"My husband and I have come here because of financial difficulties. He is free to go back and forth to Armenia as he owns property back home. I can't,\" she said. \"He was a military officer with the Soviet army and our life was good. Then he retired and the economic situation in Armenia worsened. Now, two of my daughters are married. One is married to a Russian and they live in France. The other one is here with a Turkish citizen. Things are better.\"\n\n[Armenians] know what to expect and how much money they are going to earn [in Turkey]. Most of them don't start a brand new adventure. Turkey is not a mysterious place for Armenians. Baruyr Kuyumciyan, community editor of Agos newspaper\n\nA number of immigrants told Al Jazeera that they preferred Turkey as a destination because it is close to Armenia and life in Turkey is cheaper than in Europe. Since Ankara has kept its border with Armenia closed since 1993, in reaction to the territorial conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Armenians generally enter Turkey through Georgia.\n\n\"I came here with my wife 10 years ago and never left. My two kids were born in Istanbul at an Armenian hospital. I haven't come across anything that wasn't good here,\" a 39-year-old leather worker told Al Jazeera.\n\nA couple of community hospitals in Istanbul help illegal immigrants with their health issues, immigrants told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, a vast majority of the immigrants are women who work as domestic workers, babysitting, cooking and cleaning. Five female Armenian immigrants told Al Jazeera they earn between $450 and $700 a month through such work. Men mostly find jobs at factories and workshops that pay less, they said.\n\nWhile some immigrants told Al Jazeera they have no interest in politics or Turkish-Armenian relations, they get uncomfortable when Turkish authorities threaten to deport undocumented Armenians.\n\n\"I haven't faced any problems in Turkey. Political issues do not interest me. I'm here to earn my [living],\" a 30-year-old Armenian who works for a family told Al Jazeera.\n\nNano Madoian, a 31-year-old with a residency permit who also earns her living through house work, has been in Turkey since 2003. \"At first, it was hard to live here, as we did not speak Turkish, but now all is well,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"When a leader says they are going to deport us, we get stressed out, but we go on with our lives. What else can we do?\"\n\nAccording to Kuyumciyan, Armenian citizens who came to Turkey and stayed were people with prior experience there, \"or their relatives or friends have been to Turkey before\".\n\n\"They know what to expect and how much money they are going to earn. Most of them don't start a brand new adventure. Turkey is not a mysterious place for Armenians,\" he added. \"Armenian immigrants live in a closed community without much interaction with the other parts of the society, including Turkish-Armenians. Female Armenians mostly work at Turkish-Armenian homes doing housework, but there is not much social connection.\"\n\nRELATED: The Kardashian factor and the G-word\n\nThe de facto Armenian school hidden under the church was set up in 2008 and grew as more immigrants came from Armenia over time. The diploma it provides is recognised in Armenia.\n\nStudents studying at this secondary school cannot officially enrol in minority schools in Turkey, as they have to be Turkish citizens with minority status to do so. They can only be guest students and receive an education without getting a diploma at the end of their studies. All teachers are immigrants from Armenia and the language of instruction is Armenian, since almost none of the children speak Turkish.\n\nTurkish authorities know about the de facto school but tolerate it. Turkey's Directorate General of Foundation recently even provided food supplies to the school, although the textbooks are brought from Armenia.\n\n\"The school is funded through donations from benefactors as well as contributions collected from the families of the students studying at the school,\" Principal Heriknaz Avakyan told Al Jazeera. \"The number of students increases every year and we have serious issues with the building, both in terms of its size and the conditions we have to work in.\"\n\nAvakyan told Al Jazeera that there are no windows in the school building and it gets quite stuffy: \"We want to move to a regular building. Students do not see the sun studying here.\"\n\nFollow Umut Uras on Twitter: @Um_Uras",

They're quietly trying to soften, if not kill, some of the more controversial provisions.\n\nLobbyists for Big Finance are working hardest to neutralize the so-called Volcker Rule, which would force big banks to spin off their lucrative proprietary trading operations, in which they invest their own capital in speculative deals.\n\nThe measure — named after its proponent, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker — seeks to prevent big banks from betting against trades they made on behalf of their customers, a popular practice until the financial crisis exploded in 2008.\n\nFor example, big investment banks such as Goldman Sachs sold customers overvalued mortgage bonds even as they bet secretly that those bonds would default.\n\nFinancial lobbyists also are working to soften requirements that Wall Street firms put more \"skin in the game\" by retaining more mortgage bonds on their books to guard against shoddy lending. They're also trying to undercut the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThrough Republican lawmakers who will soon hold leadership positions in the U.S. House of Representatives, big banks are backing proposals that could lead to its being defunded or subject to conditions that weaken it.\n\nThe financial sector is also pushing to have the bureau headed by a board rather than a strong single leader.\n\n\"Taken all together, these are all proposals that were considered (by Congress) and rejected ... these don't look like proposals that were designed to help the agency do better, but rather proposals designed to gut it,\" said Travis Plunkett, the director of legislative affairs for the Consumer Federation of America. \"This agency hasn't opened its doors yet, and already the House Republican leadership is carrying a lot of proposals that Wall Street and big financial interests have offered to eviscerate the consumer agency.\"\n\nBig global banks already succeeded in softening new global rules that would have required banks to set aside considerably more funds in reserve to guard against future losses — generally called capital requirements or loan-loss reserves.\n\nThis happened at international banking negotiations held earlier this year in Basel, Switzerland. There, powerful banks weakened a proposal for a new international standard governing how much banks must keep in reserve.\n\nThese big banks also pressured global regulators to back off a mandatory requirement that would have forced banks to set aside even more capital during good times, on the premise that economic booms lead to excessive risk taking. This so-called countercyclical reserve requirement is now voluntary.\n\n\"I think the answer is they (global regulators) caved in to the pressures of the industry,\" said Morris Goldstein, a former top economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"I'd like to say that things are more positive, but I have to say a lot of the momentum is fading. ... I think on the whole, we're losing steam.\"\n\nImplementing the Volcker Rule falls to the newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council, whose members include regulators over banks, stock and commodities markets. Big Finance argues that the new rules are job killers.\n\n\"We believe that the Volcker Rule is in fact harmful to the ability of the United States to sustain vibrant capital markets and ... to create private sector jobs,\" David Hirschman, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, wrote to the council. \"In its current form, the Volcker Rule will likely add to regulatory uncertainty for banking entities and will hurt the global competitiveness of the financial services industry at a time when growth is most needed.\"\n\nVolcker wrote a letter to the council, urging regulators to stand pat.\n\n\"Clear and concise definitions, firmly worded prohibitions, and specificity in describing the permissible activities will be of prime importance for the regulators,\" he wrote. \"Bankers and their lawyers and lobbyists will no doubt search for and discover seeming ambiguities within the language of the law.\"",
  "latent_2847": "IT’S either the biggest Washington scandal you’ve never heard of, or an anti-Muslim witch hunt pushed by far-right conspiracy theorists.\n\nEither way, the arrest of Imran Awan, a former IT staffer for Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has finally brought the under-the-radar story into mainstream.\n\nSince 2010, the Pakistani native has worked for Wasserman Schultz, the former head of the Democratic National Committee who was forced to resign last year after internal emails released by WikiLeaks showed the DNC favouring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over socialist rival Bernie Sanders during the primaries.\n\nThe 37-year-old from Lorton, Virginia, was arrested at Dulles Airport on Monday night by “law enforcement officials from multiple federal agencies”, Fox News reported.\n\nAwan, who had been attempting to fly to Pakistan after earlier wiring $US283,000 to two individuals in that country, was charged with one count of bank fraud. Awan was sacked by Wasserman Schultz on Tuesday.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the bank fraud charge, which related to a home loan application filed by Awan and his wife and was not connected to computer services he and his family performed for House Democrats.\n\nBut his lawyer, Chris Gowen, told Fox News he believed the charge could be a “placeholder”.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities have been investigating whether Awan double-billed the house for computer equipment such as computers, iPads and monitors. Gowen said six months of federal investigation into the IT work in the House had “turned up nothing on procurement”.\n\nAwan and his relatives worked for more than two dozen House Democrats, most of whom cut ties with the group after the criminal investigation was revealed in February, according to Politico. Awan himself, despite being barred from the House IT system, continued to be employed by Wasserman Schultz until this week.\n\n“Mr Awan previously served as a part-time employee but his services have been terminated. No charges, evidence or findings from the investigation have been formally shared with our office, so we cannot comment on them,” her spokesman David Damron said in a statement.\n\nIn May, Wasserman Schultz raised eyebrows when she used an unrelated House committee hearing into the annual police budget to threaten the chief of the US Capitol Police with “consequences” if equipment seized in the investigation was not returned to her.\n\nGowen said in a statement that the bank fraud charge stemmed from a “modest real estate matter” and the “attacks on Mr Awan and his family began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives”.\n\nHe said Awan was an American citizen and “this outrageous political prosecution” was forcing his children to live in squalor in Pakistan. “[We] are confident that Mr Awan will soon be able to clear his name,” the statement said.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House called for a “thorough investigation” into the matter. “I do think it is something we should fully look into and there should be a thorough investigation,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.\n\nWhile news of the criminal investigation attracted little mainstream media attention prior to Awan’s arrest, right-wing websites and pro-Trump media such as The Daily Caller and WorldNetDaily have been covering the story extensively.\n\n“Soon after this guy Imran started working for Debbie Wasserman Schultz all of his relatives appeared on the payroll and they collected $US4 million, very unusual,” Luke Rosiak, reporter with The Daily Caller, told Fox News earlier this week.\n\nWorldNetDaily, which described the story as “the biggest scandal you’ve never heard of”, asked whether someone was “blackmailing one of the top members of Congress in plain sight”, arguing Awan had “access to any and all of the sensitive, and/or confidential, information in her congressional computer system, including any material that could be politically embarrassing, as was the case with the DNC emails”.\n\nBuzzFeed, which first broke the news of the investigation in February and cited one politician as saying they were “concerned that they may have stolen data from us, emails, who knows”, earlier this week described wider speculation of espionage and blackmail as “unfounded conspiracy theories”.\n\nGowen told BuzzFeed claims the Awans had access to sensitive information “may be the single most ridiculous accusation”. “He didn’t even have a security clearance,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to make it out to be like these guys were the top secret computer people. They were literally the guys who installed Word and Excel on your computer, set up your email on your computer. They had no access to any confidential document ever — it’s a completely ridiculous statement.”\n\nA preliminary hearing in the bank fraud case is scheduled for August 21. Awan was released under “high-intensity supervision”, must wear a GPS monitor, abide by a curfew and cannot travel beyond an 80km radius of his home.\n\nfrank.chung@news.com.au",

This is bad. It just doesn’t make any sense to have this “knee-jerk” reaction everytime we see someone with a fever. You need to look at your patient and as with everything we do we need to think about why we are doing it….\n\nJust because paracetamol is cheap and has a good safety profile doesn’t mean we should be thinking about it any less than any other drug we administer. If we were talking about giving TPA to lower fever, then we’d be really be considering the evidence as its expensive and has huge effects we wouldn’t want.\n\nNow FOAM is a great medium to discuss these ideas and get people to consider different viewpoints and think about their practice.\n\nWhat are we talking about?\n\nFever is a preserved physiological response to a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious triggers, which induce, by different methods, upregulation of the thermostatic setpoint in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, finally resulting in fever. We’re talking about these patients presenting to the ED with a fever, in whom we suspect an infective cause.\n\nWe’re not talking about patients with hyperthermia due to environmental factors, use of recreational drugs or malignant hyperthermia, as these involve different pathophysiology, requiring rapid cooling, for which paracetamol doesn’t work.\n\nWhats going on?\n\nThermoregulation is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism that maintains body temperature within a tightly regulated range. The ability to internally regulate body temperature is known as endothermy and is a characteristic of all mammals and birds.\n\nIn humans, the central processing center controlling the thermoregulatory set-point is the hypothalamus.\n\nThe core body temperature is tightly regulated around a set point by homeostatic mechanisms under normal physiological conditions.\n\nHow are we defining fever?\n\nA threshold value of ≥38.3°C has been recommended by several societies for the diagnosis of fever. – WHO\n\nThere is a female hormonal-induced variation and a diurnal variation. So, Mackowiak and colleagues found that the mean temperature was 36.8°C, with a range of 35.6 to 38.2°C, the temperature being lower in the morning than in the evening. Mackowiak PA, Wasserman SS, Levine MM: A critical appraisal of 98.6°F, the upper limit of the normal body temperature, and other legacies of Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich. JAMA 1992, 268:1578-1580.\n\nHow are we recording fever?\n\nThe core temperature is important as a core to peripheral temperature gradient is common in critically ill patients, especially in those who are hypovolaemic, have a low cardiac output or are peripherally vasoconstricted.\n\nWe want a core temp…. this would be pulmonary artery catheter ideally, but more commonly in the ED we use either tympanic or oral.\n\nSo what are the potential benefits of fever?\n\nEffects on infectious agents – Human pathogens grow under optimal temperatures of 35-37C. Above that, in vitro studies have shown reduced growth of pathogens. Prescott LM: Microbiology. Boston, MA: WCB/McGraw-Hill; 1999.\n\nThey have also found a progressive rise in the activity of antimicrobial agents dependent on temperature – i.e. the hotter the patient, the better they work.

In Nobel Lectures: Physiology or Medicine 1922–1941. Elsevier, New York, 1927: 159–169\n\nEssentially – gave malaria to patients paralysed with neuroshyphilis to make them spike a temperature. This temperature caused resolution of symptoms in 33% of cases i.e. no longer paralysed – the patient was then treated with quinine which cured their malaria.\n\n“he tried in 1917 the inoculation of malaria parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called general paresis of the insane), caused by neurosyphilis, at that time a terminal disease.It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis.”\n\nIn real patients…..\n\nHigher survival in patients who developed fever on the day of bacteraemia.\n\nReduced mortality in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with fever >38C.

Ahkee S, Srinath L, Ramirez J: Community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly: association of mortality with lack of fever and leukocytosis. South Med J 1997, 90:296–298.\n\nAdditionally\n\nIf you give patients paracetamol you take away your ability to see if they develop a fever (+ removes a SIRS criteria – they might not get the sepsis 6 etc..)… and its crucial for determining the management plans of patients in the ED where you have a not forgetting we have a limited time window to do this.\n\nFever can lower your a NEWS score by 1 which removing it can reduce there response obtained and the frequency of observations. Paracetamol does nothing to treat the underlying cause, and may only delay diagnosis…….\n\nWhat are the problems of having a fever?\n\nFever is believed to be harmful, especially in patients with life-threatening illnesses, because febrile responses are known to increase the metabolic rate, minute ventilation, and oxygen consumption.\n\nResponse – The conservation of a metabolically costly response across a broad range of animal species suggests that the response probably has an evolutionary advantage.\n\nBottom Line\n\nParacetamol in fever may not be the simple answer that we are all looking for in patients with an infection. Blindly administering it to patients who are systemically well may infer mild harm to patients, of course if the patient is feeling unwell as a result of the fever then it may infer a significant amount of benefit.\n\nThe HEAT study just out in the NEJM didn’t show any benefit to routine administration to ITU patients with a fever secondary to an infection with the length of ITU stay or in mortality. What we need is a prospective trial of ED patients looking at the administration in our ED cohort with patient centered outcomes, hopefully we’ll find out soon…..\n\nRob",

  "latent_3087": "RTÉ has defended itself against strong criticism of an interview with drug smuggler Michaella McCollum that it broadcast on Sunday in a last-minute change to programme schedules.\n\nThe interview with the 23-year-old Dungannon woman, who was released from prison in Peru last Friday, drew 550,000 viewers.\n\nRTÉ said it had “received 83 calls and emails offering feedback on the programme” by yesterday afternoon, although it did not say how many of these were negative.\n\nThe interview has been widely attacked on social media for its lack of hard questions and for allegedly glamorising McCollum.\n\nShe told interviewer Trevor Birney, who also produced and directed the programme, that she had been “naive, young and insecure”.\n\nMcCollum was arrested, along with Scottish woman Melissa Reid, in August 2013 when the two were caught trying to board a flight from Lima to Madrid with 11kg of cocaine in their bags.\n\nShe had been on an extended stay in Ibiza when, by her own account, she became involved with drug traffickers who flew her first to Majorca and then on to Lima to act as a carrier for €2 million worth of cocaine into the European market.\n\nFollowing her arrest, she lied about the circumstances, alleging she had been held at gunpoint and that her family’s lives had been threatened if she did not co-operate with the smugglers.\n\nRTÉ’s soft-focus interview followed the modern media template of the public confessional. Similar performances of repentance, remorse and redemption have been enacted by so many celebrities, sportspeople and politicians in recent years that the rituals have become boringly predictable.\n\n“I made a decision in a moment without thinking,” McCollum said, acknowledging that “I could have caused a lot of harm to people”.\n\nCircumstances\n\nBut we did get “What’s the last 48 hours been like for you?”; “How important for you was it to have your mother there?”; and “Did you know your hairstyle became news?”\n\nThe interview concluded with McCollum expressing the hope she could “be a help to young people” in the future.\n\nMcCollum was originally imprisoned for six years and eight months, and the courts in Peru have yet to set out her parole conditions, including how long she will be required to remain in the country.\n\nTherefore, it is possible she felt constrained in what she could say. That does not excuse the failures of the programme, produced for RTÉ’s Factual Department by a team from Belfast-based production company Below the Radar Films.\n\nIn response to questions from The Irish Times, RTÉ stated that “neither Michaella McCollum nor any member of her family was paid for the interview. Nor did RTÉ make any contribution to any fund relating to Michaella McCollum”.\n\nThe broadcaster did not respond to questions on whether it had agreed with Below the Radar on what questions should or should not be asked.\n\nMicro-celebrity\n\nThere is no doubt her bankability has been enhanced by the broadcast, with talk of chatshows and book deals.\n\n“Michaella has gone from slammer to glamour following her release, and we very much doubt that we’ve seen the last of her on our screens,” blared the inevitable press release from bookmaker PaddyPower, offering odds on which reality TV show McCollum would turn up on first.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are currently imprisoned around the world for trafficking.\n\nMurders are regularly committed in Ireland in connection with the lucrative business of illegal drugs.\n\nMany lives are wrecked by addiction. Most of those addicted, convicted or killed are less photogenic and less articulate than McCollum. Does her story shed light of any sort on the broader issues?\n\n“From what I could see, you had this quite vulnerable young woman who now looks like she’s been schooled in how to do an RTÉ interview,” says Gary Broderick, addiction counsellor with the Saol Project in Dublin.\n\n“They didn’t seem to want to explore the difficult questions.”\n\nBroderick points to the debate now opening up in Latin American countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, and in European countries, such as Portugal, about new ways to manage drug use beyond blanket criminalisation. “You don’t see that discussed or debated on RTÉ,” he says.\n\nRTÉ cited Sunday night’s high ratings as vindication, arguing that they showed “the significant public interest in the story”.\n\nWhether the public interest is best served by programmes of this calibre is quite another matter, though.",
  "latent_3286": "At the Nike Hoops Summit in Portland, Ore., this past April, NBA scouts packed the Rose Garden to watch homegrown American phenoms such as Austin Rivers, Anthony Davis, and Michael Gilchrist. But that night, it was 6-foot-9 Congolese forward Bismack Biyombo who stole the show, recording the first triple-double in Hoops Summit history with 12 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 astounding blocks. With his freakish 7-7 wingspan, relentless motor, and innate poise, charm, and charisma, Biyombo soon catapulted from being a virtual unknown to a projected lottery pick in this June’s NBA draft.\n\nBiyombo was born in August 1992 in Lubumbashi, a city of 1.5 million at the Congo’s southeastern tip, across the Kafue River from Zambia. At 16, he played his first professional basketball for one season in Yemen, then moved to Europe, where he quickly became a force in Spain’s ACB League, playing for Team Fuenlabrada. Last week, Biyombo spoke to Grantland’s Davy Rothbart from his agent’s office in Vitoria, Spain about his NBA dream, his favorite books and movies, and the kind of woman he hopes to find when he comes to America.\n\nWhat were your hopes when you headed to Portland for the Nike Hoops Summit?\n\nBismack Biyombo: I just wanted to play ball and enjoy the week. What I said to myself is: “This is my first visit to the United States. People need to know, who is Bismack?” So I step off the plane and [World team] Coach [Roy Rana] says, “Are you tired? You better get some rest and practice with us tomorrow.” And I said, “There is no way — I’m here to play ball.” When I first stepped on the floor my first day there, I let people know who I was. Every minute of every game, all I want to do is leave my name on the floor.\n\nAfter that first practice, Coach came and talked to me and said, “The way you practice, all-out, made everyone want to practice that way. When you stepped on the floor, things changed on the court.” So I just practiced that way all week. And when it was time for the game, I was just like, “I’m gonna put everything on the floor and play my game.”\n\nGrantland: Did you have a sense during the game that something really special was happening?\n\nBiyombo: I just wanted to try to help my team win the game, and to be the leader of the team. At the end of the day, I think the coach had a lot of faith me. We lost, but I felt like I had played my game and put everything on the floor, so I felt good. But I had no idea that something bigger had started. Not at first.\n\nGrantland: When did you realize that your life had changed based on just this one game?\n\nBiyombo: [Laughs] After the game, as soon as I got in the locker room. Someone told me I had the first triple-double in [Hoops Summit] history, and I was like, “Wow.” They said, “Kevin Garnett had 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 9 blocks, so you’re the first to do that.” I just couldn’t believe it. I said, “OK, I had an amazing game, I know that, but you’re telling me that’s the first time ever?” I talked to my agent, Igor [Crespo], and he said, “That’s true. You’re the first one to make it.” I had wanted to put it all on the floor, and at the end of the day something really special happened. That was a pretty good time, right after the game, and all that week. After I get back home and talk to Igor, he says that a lot of things have changed. Suddenly a lot of people want to know something about me. I go back home and sit down with my parents, and Igor calls me and gives to me some news. He says people are talking about me and NBA teams are interested in me for the draft. I was like, “WOW! That’s really tight!” Yeah, I was really surprised. And it’s been fun. All of these guys I’ve been looking up to, I’ll be playing against them now.\n\nGrantland: Who are your favorite players?\n\nBiyombo: Hakeem Olajuwon, this is my favorite player. But there are two others I idolize in the way they play the game. Kevin Garnett — I like the way he wants to win every game. Every time he’s on the floor, he plays intense and plays hard. When he’s not on the floor, you can see the team missing him. On the other hand is Kevin Love. Some of the time people say, “You’re crazy man. Why you’re taking about Kevin Love? The reason why I say Kevin Love is that I love him, I love the way he plays the game. He’s smart; he knows where to be to get the rebound. He’s the best guy at grabbing the rebound over anyone. Watching him, that makes me learn something. At the end of the day, I’m never gonna be Kevin Love, I’m never gonna be Kevin Garnett, and also I’m never gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon. At the end of the day, I’m just gonna be me. Which means, I’m just gonna take some things from each of them, and that’s gonna make me a little better.\n\nGrantland: Let’s talk about some of your interests off the court. What do you like to do when you’re not playing basketball?\n\nBiyombo: It takes me time to learn a language, so I take all my free time now to work on Spanish. I watch Spanish movies, I read Spanish books, and I do language exercises. During the season, if I’m not practicing basketball, I’m practicing Spanish.\n\nGrantland: How many languages do you speak?\n\nBiyombo: I speak five languages: English, Spanish, French, and two languages from the Congo, Lingala and Swahili. Lingala is what people speak in Kinshasa, the capitol, and Swahili is what we speak at home in Lubumbashi, which is 2,000 kilometers south.\n\nGrantland: Did you grow up speaking English?\n\nBiyombo: I learned English in school. And after school, three times a week, my dad took me and my brother to some extra school. At the beginning, I didn’t want to learn it, but my dad said it’s an obligation for me to learn English. He said it’s sure gonna help me in the future. At first it was frustrating. But my parents kept telling me how important it was and that it would get easier. Two months later I was speaking English. I was kind of surprised. When I came here [to Spain] I was like, “How can I learn this new language?” Well, I worked at it, and six months later I was speaking Spanish.\n\nGrantland: Is it hard to be so far away from home and your family?\n\nBiyombo: For sure. It’s hard. But what I’m doing right now, it’s something that I like. And in my opinion, if I’m doing something that I like, it should also take something away from me. You’re not always gonna be in a situation with everything around you just the way you’d like, a lot of times you’re gonna be missing something, too. I miss my family — a lot sometimes — but what I’m doing right now is for my life and for my future, so for me there’s no problem about it. I just keep practicing and doing my thing.\n\nGrantland: Your dad played basketball in the Congo. Did he inspire you to pick up the sport?\n\nBiyombo: [Laughing] No! He played ball but he wasn’t that serious. My uncle played ball, too, but he also wasn’t that serious. But my uncle said I could be good, so when I was 14 I started practicing like crazy and getting good numbers in my city league. I talked to my dad and said I wanted to start a professional career, and he told me straight: “No!” [Laughs.] And I say, “Why?” And he says, “You got to finish school.” I didn’t give up. I tell him I’m ready for basketball full-time and he says, “Nope. We already talked about this.” So I go to my mom. I think, I’ll try her instead. But she says no, too. So I spend another couple of years in school, and then when I’m 16, my mom and my dad say the time is right and they let me go off and start my career.\n\nGrantland: Because of your size, your maturity, and your leadership abilities, there’s been some argument about your actual age. Some people have suggested that you might be as old as 23 to 26, which could potentially have an effect on where you’d be picked in the draft. How old are you?\n\nBiyombo: This is a question I have faced from when I first came to Spain. Nobody knows about me, so people are quickly like, “Who is Bismack? Who is this guy? Where did he come from?” Now, some people ask me if I can look them in the eye and say I’m really 18. I can look anyone in the eye and tell them that. If they want to believe me, they can believe me, and if they don’t want to believe me, they don’t have to. I’m not President Obama, I’m not gonna hold up my birth certificate in public to show to the world. But we show it to the teams who are looking at me, and we show them X-rays and passports and other documents that prove to them my age.\n\nGrantland: What kind of music do you listen to? What’s your favorite?\n\nI’m not President Obama, I’m not gonna hold up my birth certificate in public to show to the world. But we show it to the teams who are looking at me, and we show them X-rays and passports and other documents that prove to them my age.\n\nBiyombo: Let me tell you the truth: I don’t have one favorite. On my iPod is music from around the world. I have 5,000 songs, and it’s really all over the map — Spanish music, American music, Arabic music. I don’t really speak Arabic, only a little bit, but sometimes I just get the urge to listen to Arabic music, so I put it on. I like pop music, I like R&B. Growing up, I had three little brothers and three little sisters. I did a lot of babysitting. And sometimes I put on Congolese music and we’d dance in the living room. But the problem is, most of the Congolese music that my dad likes is corny. It’s so old, it’s from like 20 years ago. The only [Congolese] singer I really like is Madilu System. You can find his music on YouTube.\n\nGrantland: What kind of movies do you get into?\n\nBiyombo: I love going to the cine! Every weekend I go. Last weekend I saw the new X-Men. I liked it. My favorite character is Wolverine because he’s so fearless. But I’m not a fan of a lot of action movies. When there’s too much action, I think it’s actually kind of boring. It’s the same story every time. I’m more into a quiet movie where I can pick up something deeper. I like character and story. I just watched a movie called The Innocent. That’s the kind I really like.\n\nGrantland: What about books? Got any favorites?\n\nBiyombo: Yeah, I do. My favorite is a Spanish book that my agent gave to me, La Buena Suerte by Alex Rovira. The book says that you can be born with a little luck, but you also have to work hard to create your own luck. You can’t just wake up and expect to have money in the house. You can’t just wake up and expect that when you’re 18, people are gonna say, “Hey, we’re gonna draft you into the NBA.” You have to work for it. You have to create your own opportunities.\n\nTwo years ago, when I first stepped in Spain, nobody knows who is Bismack. I worked like crazy all season. In the summer, [my agent] Igor says, “Are you gonna go home?” And I say, “No, I’m gonna stay here and work out and improve my game and do my best to get better.” It was tough — I was away from my friends and family for two years. I was homesick. All my teammates had gone home. But I knew I had to stay and work hard. You can be lucky, but if you don’t work hard, you don’t get that opportunity to be in a better situation. If I hadn’t worked hard, I wouldn’t have played that good at the Nike Hoops Summit, and if I hadn’t played good at the Hoops Summit, I’m not so sure we’d be talking right now. Every time I step on the floor, I try to remember the things I learned from that book and really go for it.\n\nI also have a favorite Congolese book — Sur les ailes du Temps. The guy who wrote it, Bernard Tchibambelela, he was away from his hometown when he was writing this book. A lot of the book is about the feeling of being homesick. It’s something I can relate to.\n\nGrantland: Do you have a girlfriend?\n\nBiyombo: Yeah, for sure! I met her at a house party, hanging out with some friends. She lives in Madrid. But now is the NBA draft, and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I came back from [the Hoops Summit in] Portland so excited, but also sad because I know that moving to the U.S. means maybe leaving my girlfriend. We’ve been together 6 or 7 months. We say “I love you” to each other. And I invited her to move to America with me. But she’s young — she’s 18, same as me — and she might want to stay in Spain with her family. If she doesn’t want to move, I told her I understand, that’s no problem, but the United States is like another world, and being there for the first time is gonna be difficult. I need someone next to me. If she’s not gonna come, I told her I’m gonna have to catch up with someone over there. It was hard to tell her that, but I’m not gonna lie to her and say, “I love you,” and keep things going and then she finds out I’m doing something wrong. I like to talk to people face-to-face and be honest. Sometimes that means people want to punch me out, but at least, hey, they know the truth. I don’t want people to say, “Oh, this guy lied to me.” I want them to say, “I have respect for him.” So I talk straight to people. That’s just the way I am.\n\nGrantland: Well, then, let me ask this on behalf of America’s women, in case you wind up single: What are the most important qualities you look for in a girlfriend?\n\nBiyombo: Personality. I don’t want a girlfriend that if you say yes, she says yes, and if you say no, she says no. I like a girl who has her own mind about things and has a lot of respect for herself, and the people around her, and the people around you. Personality, humor, confidence, that’s what I look for. After that, if she’s beautiful, that’s OK, too.\n\nGrantland: The first thing you need when you enter the NBA is the perfect nickname. Do you already have any in mind? Or do you need the hookup?\n\nBiyombo: [Laughing.] I have a lot of nicknames. Growing up my friends, my brothers, and my cousins always called me “Master.” They were being sarcastic, I think, because I am always bossing them around. So, when I first step in the League in Congo, my teammates hear my brothers call me that, and they start to call me “Young Master.” Then I keep growing, and they take the “Young” away, so I’m just “Master” again. Now when I go home and show up at the court, they still call me Master.\n\nIn Spain, one day when I was walking to the gym, [former teammate Esteban] Batista called me\n\n“‘La Pantera” — “The Black Panther.” He just made it up that second but the name stuck. At my agent’s office, I walk down the hallway and everyone says, “La Pantera, La Pantera.” I like it — “The Black Panther” — that’s my favorite.\n\nThen in Portland at the Hoops Summit, my teammates were calling me all kinds of nicknames! They called me “Big Mac” and I was like, “What? What is this, Big Mac?” Then one guy was like, “We want to call you ‘Big Smack.'” So I said, “OK, you can call me ‘Big Smack.’ I can roll with that.” They had all kinds of nicknames for me, a different one every day. Kevin Pangos, the Canadian, one time he said during practice, “Dude, you’re the fuckin’ ‘Business,’ man. That’s your new name.” I asked why. He said, “Dude, when you’re on the floor, you’re all business. We’re gonna call you ‘The Business.'” Soon everyone was calling me “The Business.” It’s amazing how fast you can get a nickname. When I’m in the League, I think I’ll have no choice. People will call me something, and I’ll just have to go with it.\n\nGrantland: A lot of teams are giving you serious consideration in the draft. There’s easily 10 or 12 cities where you could wind up. Let’s play a game: I’ll say the name of a city and you say the first word that comes to mind. Any word you want — just the first word that pops into your head. Cool?\n\nBiyombo: Cool.\n\nGrantland: OK, here we go. Washington, D.C.\n\nBiyombo: No.\n\nGrantland: OK. Detroit.\n\nBiyombo: Detroit? Yes.\n\nGrantland: Toronto.\n\nBiyombo: Yes.\n\nGrantland: Houston.\n\nBiyombo: Yes.\n\nGrantland: Wait. Hold on. Do you know anything about these cities? Or are you just randomly saying “Yes” and “No”?\n\nBiyombo: When the teams come over here to work me out, I learn about every city so I’m prepared to meet with them. I take a lot of time to learn everything I can about the city and the team, so I know what’s going on. I do a lot of online research.\n\nGrantland: How will it feel at the draft to be on stage with David Stern, shaking his hand?\n\nBiyombo: That’s very, very big to me. I am always watching a lot of the old Drafts and thinking, one day that’s gonna be me. And now that day is coming! Step by step, we’re moving toward that day. It’s gonna be a very big honor. I’m so excited — I can’t wait ’til that time.\n\nLook, I had good parents who cared for me, and were always there for me and trying to help me. They made sure I got a good education. But I look around Congo at all of the young guys who didn’t have what I had. I’m sure a lot of people know stories about Africa and how things go. But soon, I’ll have the chance to be in a good situation, and one day I’d like to help a lot of young guys have the same chances I had with education and basketball. I’ll keep growing as a player and as a person, and then one day I can help kids in Congo by building more schools so the kids from where I’m from will have a better chance in life.\n\nDavy Rothbart is the creator of Found Magazine, editor of the Found books, author of the story collection The Lone Surfer of Montana, Kansas, and a frequent contributor to public radio’s “This American Life.” He’s also the founder of an annual hiking trip for inner-city kids called Washington II Washington.",

If your answer is ‘rarely’ then congratulations: welcome to the majority.\n\nThe tiled home screen isn’t a bad idea. It’s a good one.

  "latent_3329": "The International Trade Practice Center on Bloomberg Law® provides in one comprehensive, time-saving resource.\n\nBy Brian Flood\n\nSnuggies, the sleeved fleece coverings, should be classified as blankets for tariff purposes, not like robes or priestly vestments, a federal trade court ruled Feb. 10 ( Allstar Mktg. Grp., LLC v. United States , Ct. Int’l Trade, 13-00395, 2/10/17 ).\n\nThe court rejected the Justice Department’s argument that Snuggies are apparel and so should be subject to higher duties than blankets. The judge found it important that Snuggies open in the back and don’t have closures.\n\n‘The Blanket With Sleeves!’\n\nSnuggies are polyester fleece knits with sleeves that the manufacturer says keeps users warm while letting them use their hands freely. Beginning in late 2008, the product, and its infomercials, became a pop culture phenomenon, and the Snuggie was featured on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Oprah, Ellen and The Today Show.\n\nJudge Mark Barnett of the Court of International Trade held that Customs and Border Protection was wrong to classify Snuggies as garments. The judge noted in his opinion that the product is marketed as a blanket, rather than as clothing. For example, the packaging describes the Snuggie as “The Blanket With Sleeves!,” he said, and depicts consumers “in the types of situations one might use a blanket; for example, while seated or reclining on a couch or bed, or outside cheering a sports team.”\n\nThe addition of sleeves was not enough to turn the Snuggie into clothing, Barnett said. They simply allow the Snuggie “to remain in place and keep the user warm while allowing the user to engage in certain activities requiring the use of their hands,” he said.\n\nNot Like Priests’ Robes\n\nThe judge rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to compare the Snuggie to priestly vestments or scholastic robes, which also have wide-armed sleeves and flow loosely around the body. Barnett said that unlike robes, the Snuggie opens in the back, and unlike ecclesiastical garments, it don’t have closures.\n\nThe ruling means that instead of paying 14.9 percent duties when bringing Snuggies into the U.S., importers will only have to pay 8.5 percent duties.\n\nRepresentatives from Allstar Marketing Group, which imports and sells the Snuggie, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoseph M.

  "latent_3550": "Contact: Natalia Lima, nlima@aldf.org, 201 679 7088\n\nSacramento, CA — The national nonprofit Animal Legal Defense Fund is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator(s) responsible for locking a small dog in a crate and setting him on fire. At 12:30am January 21, neighbors reported a trash fire outside the Oak Plains Masonic Lodge on 3010 Becerra Way, near Watt and Marconi avenues. The fire turned out to be a burned dog, who may have been heard whimpering or howling before Sacramento Metro Fire District firefighters arrived on the scene and realized the fire was actually a burning dog in a dog crate.\n\nAccording to media reports, the dog’s wounds were catastrophic. “It was a small dog, in a small crate that was burned beyond belief,” said Metro Fire Captain Michele Eidam. The fire department is working with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department to investigate this heinous crime.\n\nUnder California Penal Code § 597(a) any person convicted of maliciously and intentionally maiming or killing an animal can be imprisoned for up to three years in county jail and/or fined $20,000 for felony animal cruelty. In California, it is at the district attorney’s discretion whether animal cruelty is charged as a felony. Intentionally killing a dog is against the law in all 50 states.\n\n“Our hearts break for this poor dog, who must have suffered agonizing pain from this sadistic act,” said Stephen Wells, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “Animal abusers are usually repeat offenders—against animals and humans—and this perpetrator poses a grave threat to the community.”\n\nAnyone with information that might lead to the arrest and conviction of the person(s) responsible for the killing of this dog should call the arson tip line at 916-859-3775.",
  "latent_3665": "July 2014 marks the end of the 2013/14 competitive Dota 2 season, culminating with The International. In this post I will go through the stats for the month, with graphs and other interesting tidbits. This includes both the pro scene and the pub scene. For pros I rely on datDota, but focus on highlighting trends and changes from previous months. For pubs I compare my data with my data from the previous month, and will go through the changes in pick rate for every hero, and present them to you with a short explanation with the biggest gainers/losers for the month.\n\nPros – Landscape and Tidbits\n\nOut of the 180 professional games played this month, 172 of them were part of The International. The other 8 games were at the start of the month in SEA for the DotaTalk DatBet Championship. The 180 games is down heavily from last month’s 440. While other games were played, datDota only counts games they consider to be at the professional level. Data for complete picks are available on datDota, or in the monthly image from Anasteria. Anasteria always cuts off a lot lower than datDota, often resulting him in having a skewering amount of low tier games in his lists.\n\n– There were 18 heroes this month that were a Top Pick (over 40% P/B)\n\n– Promoted to Top Pick this month: Void, Skywrath, Tinker, Shadow Shaman, Earthshaker, Nature’s Prophet, Enigma, Wraith King.\n\n– This is the first time that Faceless Void, Skywrath Mage, Tinker and Earthshaker have been a Top Pick (Data only includes the past 19 months.)\n\n– This is Enigma’s 2nd Top Pick, the last being way back in December 2012.\n\n– Demoted from Top Pick this month: Invoker, Treant, Enchantress, Rubick, Shadow Demon.\n\n– Tinker was predominately banned, with about 4 bans for every pick. Lycan was 7 bans per pick.\n\n– 6 heroes were neither banned nor picked this month: Huskar, Spirit Breaker, Bloodseeker, Phantom Lancer, Keeper of the Light, Crystal Maiden.\n\n– Lycan returns to being the most contested hero in the pool, which brings an end to the 9 month streak of having a different #1 hero each month, which started in October with Naga Siren.\n\n– The above graph also nicely illustrates the fall Batrider had this month, dropping to 56%\n\n– You can also see the exact point Lycan shot up; I wrote an article here at the end of his massive boost in March. It would seem that it March really was the month to boost Lycan into the scene for a long time, going on five months now.\n\nPubs – Winners and Losers\n\nLast Month, we saw a massive shift in pick rates for heroes with a recently released Immortal as well as a boost for popular heroes at The Summit. The following table is the list of heroes who are being picked more in all pub games for July.\n\n– Skywrath, Void and Razor lead the charge, likely as a result of their similar shift in the pro scene. Or as I joked last month; “Pubbers have a bad case of Mono”.\n\n– Other popular TI4 heroes were bumped up a notch, with Earthshaker gaining ground as he asserts his position as the most popular support hero for pubs.\n\n– Phoenix, Terrorblade and Ember Spirit have been dropping in popularity ever since the major 6.80 nerfs, however Ember managed to gain in popularity this month, after a few months of heavy drops.\n\n– Tinker appeared in about 6% of pubs 2 months ago, this month he appeared in 13% as he continues to rise (17th most popular hero this month).\n\n– Brewmaster always turns up as a big winner in the actual % graph. He’s an incredibly unpopular hero who gains strongly, who is now 18% more popular than last month. Interesting to see Meepo in there too.\n\n– Ever since Counter Helix was changed to PRD, Axe has been dropping every month. Where as all the Immortal heroes increased in pick rate last month, it appeared that the Immortal just canceled out most of Axe’s decline. His pub win rate also took a hit, and is this months biggest pick rate loser. He will continue to fall steadily unless he is buffed next month. Rightfully so too, I don’t bother with him much anymore. His early jungling, cutting, and lane dominance all took a heavy hit\n\n– Popular Pub heroes like Invoker and Pudge fell as people flocked to TI4 heroes.\n\n– Many heroes who received an immortal last month also dropped, which is just a fallout from the surge last month.\n\n– Ultra-Unpopular heroes fell this month; the 9 least popular pub heroes all fell slightly. Such as Beastmaster, Chen and Visage.\n\n– Terrorblade (-9%) and Phoenix also continue to fall (as reasoned when I spoke about Ember Spirit)\n\n– Finally, Treant and Dark Seer lost some players. Probably as neither hero was as popular at TI4 as they’ve been in the past.\n\nSummary\n\nA massive drop in pro scene games as caused by TI4, while there was a similar amount of pub games this month as last month. A massive surge in pro heroes in the middle of a patch suggests to me the patch is still breathing, and the big pro gainers this month should be mostly left alone to see how the scene deals with them over time. Although it is evident that some heroes need to be changed as they are continuing their long term trends of being very (un)popular, such as Huskar, Medusa, Lycan, and Doom.\n\nI intend to do a similar article to this each month, so keep an eye out for that. In the mean time I’ve linked my previous two articles below. Additionally, instead of referencing Darude – Sandstorm over and over, here’s a fairly solid song with a similar ‘Dota 2 connected name’; Pheonix – Lisztomania.\n\nFor non-noob Dota 2 tips, follow @ZotaTips\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nPrevious Feature – What I think Ice Frog should do after TI4, and I’m not talking about simple hero buffs/nerfs.\n\nPrevious Stat Article – Analysis of Anti-Mage, and how his pub win rate hit an all time low of 40.6%, and what could be the best way to help prevent this.\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_3746": "-- If Domonic Biggi has learned anything as the day-to-day overseer of a third-generation Oregon food business, it's that the American palate is fickle.\n\nThat so-yesterday trend of infusing everything with chipotle? Over.\n\nHoney and garlic on the other hand? Not going anywhere.\n\nThe jury is still out, meanwhile, on the current bacon boom.\n\n\"Our business is certainly faddish,\" said Biggi, executive vice president of\n\n. \"We're always looking for that next hot flavor profile.\"\n\nBiggi\n\n(pronounced bee gee)\n\nthinks he's now cornered the industry's next big thing in wasabi, the sinus-snapping green paste most often associated with sushi.\n\nIn late December, the company\n\n, formerly based in Florence, for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition made Beaverton Foods the nation's largest wasabi producer, according to the company.\n\nIn Biggi's mind, the move was a natural for a business that for eight decades has thrived in the margins and niches of American tastes.\n\n\"Five years ago, there were no sushi houses at all in Beaverton,\" Biggi said. \"Now there are about 100.\"\n\nHe acknowledged what he called \"perhaps a slight exaggeration,\" before adding, \"Clearly, wasabi isn't going away.\"\n\nThe purchase won immediate applause from food-industry analysts.\n\n\"They've grown by adding logical things to their core products and making these new things equally as important,\" said Jack Plunkett, CEO of\n\n, a Houston-based market research firm. \"Branching into wasabi strikes me as a very forward-thinking and logical thing to do.\"\n\nAt the company's 72,000-square-foot\n\nin Hillsboro\n\n, the wasabi inventory purchased from Pacific Foods is cleaned and washed. The same type of machines used to process the company's popular lines of horseradish then grind the wasabi into paste for distribution to restaurants, specialty food stores and hotels.\n\nWith inventories now beginning to dwindle, Biggi expects the first 40,000-pound container of fresh wasabi roots to arrive from China by late summer or early fall. He is in talks with a Canadian grower in hopes of finding a source closer to home.\n\nMost consumers of the product, he said, are tasting real wasabi for the first time. Biggi estimated that well over 90 percent of all products now marketed as wasabi are actually horseradish powder mixed with oil and artificial color.\n\nNot that there is anything wrong with horseradish, mind you. That's the product, after all, that his grandmother, Rose Biggi, used to found Beaverton Foods\n\n.\n\nShe ground it at home, bottled it and took it into Portland to sell, Biggi said. One of her first customers was Eve Meyer, the wife and business partner of fledgling food magnate Fred Meyer.\n\nBiggi paused, smiled and added, \"Grandma always said Eve was the brains of that outfit.\"\n\nWith Rose having laid the foundation for what is now the largest specialty condiment manufacturer in the United States, the company's product line has continued to evolve and expand.\n\nIn the 1950s, for instance, Gene Biggi, Domonic's father, saw the rising popularity of Chinese food in the United States. He responded by developing the first shelf-stable wet and extremely hot Chinese mustard.\n\nUntil that time, gourmet mustards came only from nations such as France, Germany, Poland, Canada and England. The words fine mustard and America never made it into the same sentence, much less the same sandwich.\n\nThe late James Beard heralded the arrival of not just U.S. mustards, but Beaverton Foods' mustards in particular, with a 1975 article that shook the specialty food world.\n\n\"I came across three particularly good mustards (and some excellent horseradish) that came from Beaverton, Ore.,\" he wrote. \"They reminded me of the heartening success story that lies behind their production.\"\n\nTwo decades later, the company pulled another coup, when Gene Biggi, introduced what he insisted was the nation's first honey mustard.\n\n\"People in the industry laughed at dad at the time,\" Biggi said. \"But honey mustard, obviously, is now pretty much everywhere.\"\n\nGrowth has been consistent, both through increased sales of the original Beaver Brands products and more recently through acquisition of the Inglehoffer, Napa Valley and Tulelake labels.\n\nThe company recorded $24 million in gross sales last year, Biggi said, and has seen annual increases of between 5 and 8 percent each of the past three years.\n\nLooking ahead, Biggi doesn't expect acquisition of Pacific Farms' wasabi line to prove a game-changer. Continued success, he said, means keeping a vigilant eye, and nose, out for hot new flavor profiles and filling niches far too small to pencil out for industry giants.\n\n\"I make a nice living telling grandma stories,\" Biggi said. \"At the end of the day, that's what we do -- we make a little profit and tell some grandma stories.\"\n\n--",

  "latent_3832": "At its April 1st meeting, the Columbia City Council approved the purchase of a Lenco Bearcat armored personnel carrier with a price tag well over $200k. $36,505 of the cost was to be covered by asset forfeiture funds.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with asset forfeiture, I’ll try and explain it in a proverbial nutshell. Before I do that, it is important to thank the policy analysts at Americans for Forfeiture Reform for their work on this subject. Without them, I doubt many people would be talking about the evils of asset forfeiture. For those who would like to learn more, AFR has a very informative website.\n\nIn a nutshell, as promised, asset forfeiture is the means by which the government circumvents the 4th, 5th, and 10th Amendments to the United States Constitution to steal property from its citizens as it makes unreasonable seizures without due process and overrides the Missouri Constitution. If property is suspected to have been used in the commission of a crime or gained as the proceeds of illegal activity, that property can be seized by the government. More on that later.\n\nThere are two problems with asset forfeiture. First is the problem of where the money goes. Second is the problem of how the money is taken.\n\nArticle IX, section 7 of the Missouri State Constitution states:\n\nAll interest accruing from investment of the county school fund, the clear proceeds of all penalties, forfeitures and fines collected hereafter for any breach of the penal laws of the state, the net proceeds from the sale of estrays, and all other moneys coming into said funds shall be distributed annually to the schools of the several counties according to law.\n\nSo, according to the Missouri Constitution, moneys confiscated via asset forfeiture is to be sent to the schools. With this being the case, how are law enforcement agencies in Missouri able to pay themselves from these funds?\n\nThe answer is a federal loophole known as equitable sharing. Equitable sharing basically works like this. When local law enforcement finds some good stuff while investigating a crime, they take it and process the forfeiture through the federal government. Most law enforcement agencies have federally deputized officers who can process the forfeiture. Sometimes it’s merely a matter of paperwork. When this happens, the feds take a small cut of the proceeds and give the rest back to the participating law enforcement agencies. This allows for an end-run around the Missouri State Constitution. The money is effectively laundered through the Department of Justice.\n\nHere is what Americans for Forfeiture Reform has to say about equitable sharing:\n\nInitiated in 1986, the Equitable Sharing Program was designed to foster cooperation between state and federal law enforcement agencies in the war on drugs. Few states had forfeiture laws at the time and state and local agencies that participated could receive a portion of the income generated from federal forfeitures. Since then all 50 states have passed either civil or criminal forfeiture laws and now the equitable sharing program serves not only to foster cooperation, but as a way for state and local law enforcement agencies to circumvent their own state forfeiture statutes. Once local law enforcement hands a case over to the feds, state law ceases to apply. This means that police departments in California, North Carolina, and Nebraska do not have to convict a person before taking their property. Agencies in Hawaii stand to receive as much as three times the amount of money from a forfeiture processed in federal court than they would if done through their own court system. State mandates to avoid policing for profit, such as in Missouri where forfeiture proceeds are supposed to be deposited in a fund for education, are bypassed as well.\n\nInstead of going to schools, the money is funneled back to local police, either as grants or as cold, hard cash. As Columbia’s Police Chief Ken Burton described it, it’s like “pennies from heaven.”\n\nI’d argue that these funds are really pennies from hell, usually stolen from citizens, but we’ll get to that later.\n\nNot only are the forfeiture funds not going to our school children, the equitable sharing process sets up a system of policing for profit which further degrades our local political system that should be answerable to the people. Funding is one way the people of a community possess to maintain local sovereignty and control or support of local law enforcement. When law enforcement uses equitable sharing of forfeiture dollars to self-fund, the community loses one check and balance and the police have a perverse incentive to prosecute profitable crimes or wait to act until certain crimes become profitable.\n\nCase in point: Columbia’s infamous Kinloch Ct. S.W.A.T. raid. One of the main problems with this raid was that the police supposedly had reliable intelligence from a confidential informant who stated that there was a large amount of cannabis at a residence. The police waited 8 days after the warrant was issued to kick in the door with guns-a-blazin’, shooting two dogs in front of a small child only to find a small amount of cannabis and no cash.\n\nSo why the delay? While it was explained away as a staffing problem, the real reason was likely the hope of finding piles of cash. If the police know there is a big pile of drugs at a dealer’s house and they send S.W.A.T. in immediately, all they find is the drugs. If they wait a week, hopefully the drug dealer has sold enough of his product to amass a big pile of cash — cash that can be used to buy cool new Department of Homeland Security toys and tools like the Lenco Bearcat.\n\nThere’s just no money in rape and murder these days.\n\nWe’ve established that there is a problem with where the money goes. It’s not going to our school children as directed by our state constitution and it establishes a means of self-funding for law enforcement, circumventing local control and creating perverse enforcement incentives. Now let’s tale a look at how the money is taken in the first place.\n\nTo keep things simple, let’s divide asset forfeiture into two categories — criminal asset forfeiture and civil asset forfeiture.\n\nCriminal asset forfeiture is when property is seized by and forfeited to the government when the owner of such property is convicted of a crime. There are some reasonable arguments that can be made in support of this system. When a person is convicted of a crime, forfeiting property can be part of the punishment. Of course we’ve discussed the problem with self-funding above, but when we look at it as punishment, regardless of where the money goes, it seems to make sense. When a profitable criminal gets out of jail, they should not be able to go home to a mansion purchased with the proceeds of his/her criminal activity.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is the real problem. In a civil asset forfeiture proceeding, a citizen does not need to be convicted of a crime to have their property taken by the government. In fact, the accused doesn’t even need to be tried and acquitted. All that really needs to happen is an arrest, justified or not, and the government seizes property.\n\nSince the forfeiture is made in civil court, the old “innocent until proven guilty” protection that we all learned in 6th grade does not apply. Cases are literally made against the property and read like, “United States of America v. United States currency in the amount of $638,202.00 et al.” To get their property back, property owners must hire a lawyer to argue for the innocence of their property, which is assumed in civil court to be guilty. Sound absurd? Well, it is absurd.\n\nThe case listed in the preceding paragraph as to do with property taken from a local Columbia business owner during a raid executed by the Boone County Sheriffs Department. Kevin Bay, co-owner of a local business, BoCoMo Bay, was suspected of a crime. Once arrested, the charges against Mr. Bay were quickly dropped, but not before several million dollars worth of cash, precious metals, collectible coins, and collectible firearms were seized and made subject to civil asset forfeiture.\n\nRead about Kevin Bay’s ordeal HERE.\n\nThat’s right. Mr. Bay was arrested, never officially charged with a crime, yet faces a lengthy federal court battle to have his rightful and legal property returned to him. This is theft, plain and simple.\n\nWhile it might be worth it, although a hard stone to chew, for Mr. Bay to spend tens of thousands of dollars to get his millions returned, if he is successful, imagine a case where only $10,000 worth of property is seized. Why would a victim if civil asset forfeiture spend $20,000 in legal fees fighting for the return of $10,000. In these cases, the only choice is to forfeit the money.\n\nThis happens all the time. Click here to see a raid where a grandmother’s $5000 dollars was seized because someone in her house had a crack rock and pipe in his pocket. That money is gone, no matter what.\n\nAt last week’s Columbia City Council meeting, the council approved the use of $36,505 of asset forfeiture funds to purchase an APC for the CPD. Here is the council discussion regarding the purchase during which Michael Trapp leads the charge for accountability in the use of the vehicle. Asset forfeiture gets a mention during the discussion, but comes up later, in a meaningful way.\n\nDuring the public comment portion before the vote, Keep Columbia Free’s Treasurer Elect addresses the council.\n\nKeep Columbia Free President Mark Flakne also addressed the council.\n\nAnd it looks like someone on the council heard us. At the end of the meeting, Councilperson Laura Nauser asked for a staff report on the use of asset forfeiture dollars in the City of Columbia. She expressed an interest in starting a public discussion centered around asset forfeiture to see if it is something that our community wants to use as a source for funding police.\n\nWe have also heard from another councilperson, who shall remain nameless for the time being, who said that he is open to the idea of championing asset forfeiture reform in Columbia, especially with the passage of the 911 tax which will allow for the return of funds to the city that can be used to replace forfeiture funds.\n\nPlease help educate your friends and family about civil asset forfeiture. Sadly, the majority of folks in Columbia and across the country simply have no idea what asset forfeiture is. Thanks to Americans for Forfeiture Reform and other groups like the Institute for Justice, people are waking up to this practice and overwhelmingly finding themselves to be repulsed by it.\n\nRead about some of the forfeiture cases being handled by the Institute of Justice HERE\n\nNow is the time to call your councilperson and let him/her know in no uncertain terms that it is time to end the use of asset forfeiture to fund our local police. We should fully fund our police department through traditional means. Using asset forfeiture as a funding mechanism, while technically legal, is a morally abhorrent practice. We should all be demanding local sovereignty, government accountability, and local control of our law enforcement.\n\nShare on Facebook",

Throughout the band's career, new tunes would be played to death when they first broke them out, that was how the band developed and shaped the song until they found a nice groove with it and learned how too jam it out. Kinda like live rehearsal. We heads were a very understanding bunch.\n\nHowever, they were building from the momentum of the Dec 92 comeback shows. Maybe Garcia was going to stay healthy for a while and the band would take off again.\n\nDuring this show, old standards like Shakedown, Dire Wolf, Hightime, Cumberland, Fire on the Mountian were all very well played. Match those with excellent versions of Same Thing, Piccaso, and Wave to the Wind (superb version), and this show offered a look at where the band could go. The Cassidy>UJB> Cassidy combo not only well played but in a great spot, provided us with the thought that maybe finally the band could \"mix-up\" song placement and take some songs and explore their potential. The post drums were even given a jolt with the Gloria.\n\nAccross the board, a superb show at a time when those were becoming rare.\n\nDefinatlty check this show out,a top 3 show from 1993. - May 5, 2006Check it out\n\nReviewer: BigRobStud - favorite favorite favorite favorite - April 7, 2006\n\nSubject: Scarlet Fire!?!?!?!

Sorry, but just b/c they played Picasso>Fire or Cassidy>Uncle>Cassidy, if they don't play it well (which I don't really think they did), it doesn't do much for me. The Wharf Rat is so mired in flubs, it is virtually unlistenable.\n\nI don't often agree with Tito (as many of my reviews will point out), but I do agree with him that Phil singing High Time, and a lot of the Dead repertiore that he chooses to play with his solo band is an abomination. Sorry Phil, I love ya, but it may be time to either hang it up, or start looking for some different material. dmilks -- October 21, 20055/27/93\n\nReviewer: budfox - favorite favorite favorite favorite - May 23, 2005\n\nSubject: Cal Expo 93' This is a great show. Strong Shakedown opener. The tuning into Dire Wolf lets you know its going to be a good one. The Pop and Twang Garcia has and the pace of the tune sound more like 83'. BIODTL more of the same. Masterpiece is excellent I agree it could be the the one of the best versions for the Dead, except Bobbys voice was too shot.But Garcia's solo is one of the best ever. In 93 the Rest of the Band really tapped into a groove that just sustained those peak moments in a Garcia Solo sequence better than any other year. Cumberland is awsome Jerry really displays those Banjo skills.The Promised Land is among the best of the 90's Jerry is cooking and Vince's piano playing is excellent I always felt that Vince had the chops he just made poor choices. That summer and particularly the Expo shows he had really started to Improve.\n\nSecond Set starts of with a forgetable Picasso but leads into a nice Fire. Wave to the Wind is Sick. May not be a great song but I guess it was Phil's way of tricking the Band into Playing that mid-seventies Eyes Jam Cause when he's not singing thats what you have (at least this version). It has some of the best Jamming of the night. Garcia's almost in seventies mode jazzy uptempo playing all the way through. Cassidy is great too. Very good jam into an excellent UJB the seque back to Cassidy isnt executed perfectly but all in all they pulled it off pretty nice.Post Drums Other One- Wharf Rat -Sugar Magnolia- Gloria is superb a real treat.

This sounds like the source of the 2 or 3 tapes I've had/have, and there's something I don't like about the mix. I've heard plenty of shows from here (the archive) that sound fantastic TO ME that still garnered criticism FROM OTHERS of the audio quality. There's a slight, for lack of defining word, grittiness in the overall sound of this show. Ironically, I think that's exactly what gives the sound its personality, and deflects attention from the lack of audience in the mix.\n\nHowever, the combination of setlist and execution in this show make it a must-have. I already wrote a review for this show in Deadbase '93. I will say no more. - March 12, 2005first review written today?",
  "latent_3858": "Josh Bryan is an American living in Copenhagen, where he helped to launch a recent Amnesty International report on discrimination against transgender people in the European Union. Below, he tells his story how strict Danish legislation has left him trapped in a system that doesn’t recognize his true identity while demanding that he surgically change his body.\n\nMy story is about being stuck in two legal identities. I live in Denmark, a country that prides itself on its liberalism and welfare for its citizens. However, the Danish legislation is very strict when it comes to transgender people – people whose gender identities don’t align with the legal gender they were assigned at birth – and that is why I’m now trapped in the system.\n\nI’m originally from the U.S., and I grew up in Kansas. I knew from a very early age that I was transgender. I also learned quickly that being transgender was not very acceptable. So I stayed hidden, waiting for the day I could finally transition and be myself.\n\n“ They told me they didn't have the authority to change my information. This was because I had not been castrated. ”\n\nIn 2007, I married my Danish wife and moved to Denmark. This was before I had completed my transition, and that turned out to be a fatal decision. In 2010, I had finally saved up enough money to complete my transition and update all of my American paperwork: my passport, my birth certificate and my name. I was so happy and thought that everything would be smooth sailing from there, but I was very wrong.\n\nWhen I went to update my Danish paperwork with immigration officials in Denmark, they told me they didn’t have the authority to change my information. This was because I had not been castrated. Denmark has a law stemming from the 1930’s that requires transgender people to be surgically castrated to obtain legal gender recognition. For those who cannot afford to pay for the surgery themselves, there is also a demand to have a psychiatric diagnosis in order to be considered ‘transsexual’ and therefore eligible for surgery in the public health care system. It takes years and is an extremely humiliating process.\n\nI found that very surprising, because I’ve always considered Denmark a more liberal country than the U.S. And it puzzled me that the immigration authorities here could not just update my information because I’m here based on my American identity. It’s really absurd.\n\nWhen I apply to have my residency extended here, they make me fill out a form and use a name that doesn’t exist in the U.S. I have to sign the paperwork in a name that doesn’t belong to me! Yet, they still grant me permission to be here. Denmark is now the only country in the world that does not recognize my American identity.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, having two identities causes a tremendous amount of problems in my life. Anytime I need to pull out my identification, whether that is going to the bank, going to the doctor, using my credit card at the store, going to my children’s school, I am outed on a daily basis. And it hurts. I’m not ashamed of being transgender, but it’s not really something I wish to explain to complete strangers on a daily basis. It is a complete violation of my right to privacy. I’ve moved on in life, but the system won’t let me be me.\n\nI haven’t seen my family in the U.S. since 2010 because frankly, I’m afraid to travel. Danish immigration authorities cannot give me a clear answer on how I can safely re-enter the country, because my passport and residency reflect two different identities. Things you normally take for granted like owning a house or a car, I cannot do. I cannot own anything in my real name. I cannot be my wife’s husband in Denmark. I cannot earn money in my name. When I have to pay taxes in the U.S., I literally have to send a document from Denmark that confirms that Josh Bryan is really Josh Bryan. I have to out myself to the U.S. tax agency, to my home country, because of being stuck in this legal limbo. It would be funny, if it wasn’t my life.\n\nDenmark rejects my American identity, my passport, and my birth certificate. It makes me feel like they reject me as a human being. Despite having two identities, I feel like I have none. I’ve been haunted my whole life by having the wrong name and the wrong body. I used to hide who I was by choice, but now I’m forced to.\n\nSo why go through all this mess? Why not just comply with the castration demand?\n\nFor me, it’s simple. I’m taking a stand against being diagnosed with a mental disorder and against the castration demand.\n\nFirst, I refuse to be diagnosed as having a mental condition. Transgender people aren’t crazy. I’m not crazy. I know exactly who I am, and I always have. It’s purely physical what I had to fix. Let me put it this way: what other ‘mental’ illness can be fixed with surgery and hormones?\n\nIt stigmatizes the entire community of transgender people to put a label on them that they are not right in the head. It leaves us with no rights in the health care system. And it leaves us without the opportunity to have treatment with informed consent.\n\nAs for the castration demand, it is a complete slap in the face to any parent out there. I don’t care to have the reproductive organs inside of me, and someday I will have those removed. But it will be my decision.\n\nNo government authority should decide over someone’s body or who is fit to be a parent. Denmark does not have the right to stop people from starting a family and have invasive, medically unnecessary surgery. I wouldn’t want my children, my future grandchildren, or any child out there to have to choose whether to be themselves or to have a family in life. There is absolutely no medical justification for this demand, and it needs to be abolished immediately.\n\nDenmark’s (and most of Europe’s) outdated laws are violating our human rights on so many fronts: the right to privacy, integrity, health care, and the right to family. And it needs to stop now.\n\nI could never have written these words without the support of Amnesty International. Their report on transgender rights has highlighted the struggles I face every day. And most importantly, they have given the transgender community a platform to speak about the violation of our human rights.\n\nFor me, it’s been life-changing to be a part of this publication. I’ve felt very voiceless and ignored these last few years. Amnesty has given me the opportunity to use my voice, and it’s lit a fire in me. I will speak out from now on. So let me start by saying this to Denmark, especially to the Danish politicians:",
  "latent_3972": "TokuChris Webmaster, Administrator\n\n@TokuChris Join Date: Oct 2011 Location: Denver, CO Posts: 4,667\n\nSan Diego Comic Con 2015 on Friday, July 10th. We were invited by Saban Brands to meet the cast and to interview Chip Lynn, the executive producer of Power Rangers Dino Charge. Chip was gracious enough to answer some of our questions and tell us some amazing stories.\n\nThe audio will be released on Saturday, August 8th. Below is the transcript. We apologize for the audio quality (it's not the best) which is why we've included the transcript as well. You can tell when listening to the audio just how excited Chip Lynn is to be part of the Power Rangers franchise and how much he adores the cast and crew of Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n\nPlease enjoy the following interview.\n\n--------------------------\n\nTokuNation: What’s the raw feeling like to be back with the franchise?\n\nChip Lynn: it’s really awesome. It’s really awesome. You know what, I started with the pilot back in 1991, 1992, or something like that. I started off as the production manager. And then I eventually wrote it, and then I eventually directed it, and then I eventually became the story editor, and then the producer … I kind of did the nuts and bolts as well as I did the creative part. And so now, to be in charge of the creative and the nuts and bolts, is really amazing. But what makes it simple – well not simple but much more doable, because I’ve worn a lot of hats – is that I work with this crew in New Zealand who has been doing it for 10 or 12 years. And they’re the people who now and then do Lord of the Rings – I mean these people are REALLY good. And so I can imagine something like this episode that’s playing right now (there’s a monitor behind us playing episodes) – episode one – which is REALLY ambitious. And when I wrote it people said “Well of course it’s good - because you can’t make it – it’s too expensive”. And I said “Well but maybe I can” and so eventually they said “Okay go ahead and try”. And I tried and it turned out to be okay, right? It’s a pretty good episode.\n\nTokuNation: A lot of the fans they love it because – and especially after the last four years but I don’t want to get in to anything like that but – it’s (Power Rangers) a splice of the Super Sentai footage and the original footage created for it. So a lot of fans were talking about before everything started, “Oh how much footage is going to be original, how much footage is going to be Super Sentai?” and you managed to pull off a first episode with ZERO Super Sentai footage. There was nothing from Kyoryuger in that first episode. It was all homemade so to speak.\n\nChip Lynn: Pretty cool, huh?\n\nTokuNation: That was amazing.\n\nChip Lynn: It might happen again.\n\nTokuNation: Trust me – everyone is amped up for it.\n\nChip Lynn: Good!\n\nTokuNation: The Internet last night blew up from the trailer that got put up for the reason of Season one and Super Charge you know everyone … I know you can’t speak much on it and I don’t want to ask any questions too much on it but we see the image of the character that was the Zeltrax reborn form and they (the fans) tried to find the footage in Super Sentai and they couldn’t find any footage to match that scene and so they start blowing up about that.\n\nChip Lynn: Really? God, you guys are amazing I tell ya. You are astonishing. The work you’ll go through to try and figure things out – which is wonderful! But it just means I have to keep my guard up and not tell you anything because I can say a syllable wrong and you guys will start guessing. But I love it I think it’s really amazing.\n\nTokuNation: It’s one of those things where…you see, I’ve been a fan for years and involved in the (fan) community for 6 or 7 or so years and through our site for 3 or 4 years…and this is the strongest I’ve seen the franchise especially with Dino Charge’s premiere and everything … and we’ve only had 8 episodes and there’s already fans calling it one of their favorite seasons of all times – and we’ve only had 8 episodes. And like you said in the panel last night that’s not even the tip of the iceberg in the sense of what’s coming.\n\nChip Lynn: Oh! I’ll tell you a funny story. So I’m the Executive Producer right? So all day long my job is to A) guide the show creatively and B) my job is to handle some problems, right? Okay, so I bring the cast over from the States. And they arrive and they’re in their hotels and we’re looking for a place for them to stay and they’re working out with the stuntmen, and everything is going smoothly and suddenly I get word that the Rangers all want to meet with me. And I’m like “Okay” and they say “They have a request”. And I’m like OH MY GOD you know? Like already they want something… I said how can this be? I cast such nice people how can they already have demands? So they show up in my office. And they say “We just wanted to have a few minutes of your time cuz there’s something that we all decided we want”. And I’m like oh no, the worst is when they call come together in force.\n\nTokuNation: (laughing) It’s started already!\n\nChip Lynn: You know what they wanted? They said they all want this to be the best season out of all 23 seasons.\n\nTokuNation: Wow…!\n\nChip Lynn: And they all wanted to know what they could do. And of course it was shocking of because I was programmed to think they were going to want something FROM me but what they really wanted was to give something TO me. It was so touching and I told that story over and over because it was just phenomenal. It shows from what they do and when I go to the set and I see them interacting with the crew and I see how excited they are. And even when we built the sets I would bring them in and – oh wait no that’s not true. When we built the sets I would tell them all “Okay you guys, please…don’t go on any of the sets. Don’t step inside the sound stages and see what they’re doing. And at the very end the person who designed them, whose name is Tracey Collins, I want Tracey to have the honor of introducing you to your sets.\" And so they did that, none of them went in. And sure enough the day came when all the sets were built. And they were all lighted and and Tracey got to show them around and they were like awestruck.\n\nTokuNation: That’s awesome.\n\nChip Lynn: And it was really really cool. And I tried to make it – I’m a kind of a warm and fuzzy person and I’ve tried to make it a warm and fuzzy experience for them. And I think that it’s worked because they are all you know … Some of them weren’t really so familiar with Power Rangers before and others were huge fan boys and girls. Like Yoshi of course is huge but the other ones maybe didn’t know so much about it. I wanted to make sure that they understood that what they’re joining is not just a season – they’re not just working for 9 months or a year – they’re working for something that will kind of follow them for the rest of their lives. And I said every scene you do, you’re creating something that the fans are going to watch for the next 20 or 30 years. You’re going to be at conventions signing autographs. So you want to create something that you’re proud of. And that means if you want another take? You whisper in the director’s ear, “I want another take please”. And if you have an idea of how your character would handle a situation or you think that I wrote it wrong? You’re welcome to come to me before we shoot and offer your suggestion. And they may not all be taken and the director may say that we don’t have time to do another take. But it’s your responsibility to watch out for the legacy of your Ranger. And if you find something that you think can be improved upon, you need to speak up. And it gave them that license to do that, and so they did it. And it’s special. It’s really, really special.\n\nTokuNation: That’s so awesome. So! Let me ask you one last question. And I know you can’t give away too much but maybe just a tid bit for the fans who are really big in to Kyoryuger and are curious about a few things. And again you have to forgive fans because they dig through computer listings for toys and things like that. The Deathryuger character. Managed to match something with the toys called the Talon Ranger. Any hint on whether that’s something we might see.\n\nChip Lynn: About the Talon Ranger?\n\nTokuNation: Yes.\n\nChip Lynn: Uhh….well…what can I say? I’ll give you a clue, but I can’t give you an answer.\n\nTokuNation: Oh hey that’s fine, we love clues.\n\nChip Lynn: For people who are really familiar with Kyoryuger, they’re going to understand we have to use as much footage as we can. The elements that are in the footage a lot you simply have to use. We don’t have to use them the way that Sentai did, but we have to use them none the less. So I can’t say yes or no, but I can say things that are in the footage a lot we are going to use. But I can tell you that they’re going to be used differently than the Sentai.\n\nTokuNation: Cuz I’ll tell you that the fans have already come up with a monster that was the Deathryuger was in the ship in the prison in the first episode. I mean, fans are watching. They’ve already dissected that first—\n\nChip Lynn: I know, I know they have. And I’ll tell you that some of the reasons that they’re seeing things like – some of the things they’re seeing in the jail cells will come up in episodes. And when I put in the jail cells I knew it was going to be cool idea, right? But it was a HUGE task to ask of the monster department to have (the prison). Because you know it used to be they have to dress three people in monster costumes and they have to come to the set and for the day they maintained three costumes. Now, every time we shoot in Sledge’s ship, they have to dress twenty monsters and that’s seven times the work. They have to make sure the costumes look good, that there’s enough of them, and as the season goes on the monsters get eliminated and they have to somehow come up with replacements. So it was a real challenge and not a single complaint. And the crews were phenomenal and not ever a single complaint because they read the scripts, and they met me, and they realized “Hey wow this guy really wants to make this, and this is a really good story, so I’m on board”. And that’s what they’ve decided since day one. But I will say this – be careful, because some of the monsters you see on the ship are space-fillers and some of them are clues on what will come up. So don’t read too much in to everything you see.\n\nTokuNation: Chip – thanks for taking the time to talk.\n\nChip Lynn: It was my pleasure. I really wish you the best of luck with all that.\n\nBONUS!\n\nAfter our interview had finished, Chip was just so excited to be talking about the show and the time he spent on it, he continued talking. I turned the mic back on and caught, in my opinion, a quote that summarizes the type of person he is. It's a powerful quote, gives us some insight in to Haim Saban's interaction with the show and production, and just gives you hope as a fan of Power Rangers that the show is truly in the best of hands right now.\n\n“You know there’s a lot of different things you can do with the time in your life. I always tell the writers that you can write a show that kids will watch. But why not write something that if you’re going to give them a half hour of their Saturday you gotta do something responsible with that. Show them something that is wonderful. Don’t really teach them a lesson or preach – but show them an example of something nice. Because in the end you can be proud of that. If you just show a bunch of action and a bunch of crap, at the end of the day you’re going to take home a paycheck and say at least I made a buck. It’s at least worth that money to say I made something that I’m proud of and that kids will remember. That’s what Haim Saban always says. He wants episodes with enough heart and humor that when kids go from being 5 years old to 25 they still remember it. And that’s a formula that not everybody gets. He brought it from the beginning with Mighty Morphin and he pushes me every single day. When he sees an episode that’s missing one of those elements he’s the first one to send me an E-mail and say ‘This should have been that and that should have been this’. He’s a huge fan but he’s also a strong critic. And I enjoy that you need somebody able to say that’s great. So the fact that you’re here is actually doing me a favor, I’m not doing you a favor. And that’s wonderful.” - Chip Lynn\n\nTokuNation founder Kickback with Chip Lynn, SDCC 2015\n\nMP3 of the Interview direct download:\n\nClick here to download!

It shows from what they do and when I go to the set and I see them interacting with the crew and I see how excited they are. And even when we built the sets I would bring them in and – oh wait no that’s not true. When we built the sets I would tell them all “Okay you guys, please…don’t go on any of the sets. Don’t step inside the sound stages and see what they’re doing. And at the very end the person who designed them, whose name is Tracey Collins, I want Tracey to have the honor of introducing you to your sets.\" And so they did that, none of them went in. And sure enough the day came when all the sets were built. And they were all lighted and and Tracey got to show them around and they were like awestruck.: That’s awesome.: And it was really really cool. And I tried to make it – I’m a kind of a warm and fuzzy person and I’ve tried to make it a warm and fuzzy experience for them. And I think that it’s worked because they are all you know … Some of them weren’t really so familiar with Power Rangers before and others were huge fan boys and girls. Like Yoshi of course is huge but the other ones maybe didn’t know so much about it. I wanted to make sure that they understood that what they’re joining is not just a season – they’re not just working for 9 months or a year – they’re working for something that will kind of follow them for the rest of their lives. And I said every scene you do, you’re creating something that the fans are going to watch for the next 20 or 30 years. You’re going to be at conventions signing autographs. So you want to create something that you’re proud of. And that means if you want another take? You whisper in the director’s ear, “I want another take please”. And if you have an idea of how your character would handle a situation or you think that I wrote it wrong? You’re welcome to come to me before we shoot and offer your suggestion. And they may not all be taken and the director may say that we don’t have time to do another take. But it’s your responsibility to watch out for the legacy of your Ranger. And if you find something that you think can be improved upon, you need to speak up. And it gave them that license to do that, and so they did it. And it’s special. It’s really, really special.: That’s so awesome. So! Let me ask you one last question. And I know you can’t give away too much but maybe just a tid bit for the fans who are really big in to Kyoryuger and are curious about a few things. And again you have to forgive fans because they dig through computer listings for toys and things like that. The Deathryuger character. Managed to match something with the toys called the Talon Ranger. Any hint on whether that’s something we might see.: About the Talon Ranger?: Yes.: Uhh….well…what can I say? I’ll give you a clue, but I can’t give you an answer.: Oh hey that’s fine, we love clues.: For people who are really familiar with Kyoryuger, they’re going to understand we have to use as much footage as we can. The elements that are in the footage a lot you simply have to use. We don’t have to use them the way that Sentai did, but we have to use them none the less. So I can’t say yes or no, but I can say things that are in the footage a lot we are going to use. But I can tell you that they’re going to be used differently than the Sentai.: Cuz I’ll tell you that the fans have already come up with a monster that was the Deathryuger was in the ship in the prison in the first episode. I mean, fans are watching. They’ve already dissected that first—: I know, I know they have. And I’ll tell you that some of the reasons that they’re seeing things like – some of the things they’re seeing in the jail cells will come up in episodes. And when I put in the jail cells I knew it was going to be cool idea, right? But it was a HUGE task to ask of the monster department to have (the prison). Because you know it used to be they have to dress three people in monster costumes and they have to come to the set and for the day they maintained three costumes. Now, every time we shoot in Sledge’s ship, they have to dress twenty monsters and that’s seven times the work. They have to make sure the costumes look good, that there’s enough of them, and as the season goes on the monsters get eliminated and they have to somehow come up with replacements. So it was a real challenge and not a single complaint. And the crews were phenomenal and not ever a single complaint because they read the scripts, and they met me, and they realized “Hey wow this guy really wants to make this, and this is a really good story, so I’m on board”. And that’s what they’ve decided since day one. But I will say this – be careful, because some of the monsters you see on the ship are space-fillers and some of them are clues on what will come up. So don’t read too much in to everything you see.: Chip – thanks for taking the time to talk.: It was my pleasure. I really wish you the best of luck with all that.After our interview had finished, Chip was just so excited to be talking about the show and the time he spent on it, he continued talking. I turned the mic back on and caught, in my opinion, a quote that summarizes the type of person he is. It's a powerful quote, gives us some insight in to's interaction with the show and production, and just gives you hope as a fan ofthat the show is truly in the best of hands right now.“You know there’s a lot of different things you can do with the time in your life. I always tell the writers that you can write a show that kids will watch. But why not write something that if you’re going to give them a half hour of their Saturday you gotta do something responsible with that. Show them something that is wonderful. Don’t really teach them a lesson or preach – but show them an example of something nice. Because in the end you can be proud of that. If you just show a bunch of action and a bunch of crap, at the end of the day you’re going to take home a paycheck and say at least I made a buck. It’s at least worth that money to say I made something that I’m proud of and that kids will remember. That’s what Haim Saban always says. He wants episodes with enough heart and humor that when kids go from being 5 years old to 25 they still remember it. And that’s a formula that not everybody gets. He brought it from the beginning with Mighty Morphin and he pushes me every single day. When he sees an episode that’s missing one of those elements he’s the first one to send me an E-mail and say ‘This should have been that and that should have been this’. He’s a huge fan but he’s also a strong critic. And I enjoy that you need somebody able to say that’s great. So the fact that you’re here is actually doing me a favor, I’m not doing you a favor. And that’s wonderful.” - Chip LynnMP3 of the Interview direct download: Attached Thumbnails\n\n[ \"Like\" us on Facebook!]| [@TokuNation on Instagram] | @TokuNation on Twitter! ] __________________",
  "latent_3994": "by T. Mack\n\nHappy New Year, geeks! It’s 2016 and things are off to a beautifully geeky start with a new episode of Sherlock airing yesterday. Cumberbitches (or the “Cumber Collective” if you prefer) like me wait years for new episodes of this show and it always ends up being well worth the wait. This year’s The Abominable Bride is no exception.\n\nThis latest entry in the BBC series, Sherlock, finds our heroes working a case in the late nineteenth century. There are many familiar faces surrounding them and an intriguing mystery that seems impossible. So, basically, it’s the Sherlock we know and love dropped in the characters’ more traditional and classic setting. There are period costumes! Yes, please! And Sherlock utters a couple of classic lines that have previously been worked around but never quite uttered exactly in the series before. Squeee!\n\nThe thing about this is that unlike most movie previews these days, the marketing for this didn’t give away much as far as plot was concerned. That ended up being a terrific asset so I’m inclined to follow suit and give very little plot away. I will say that this episode throws back to the previous three seasons of the show in very fun and some incredibly surprising ways.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Sherlock or have simply checked out an episode in the past, I don’t really have to tell you that this show is always excellently put together and extremely well-acted. I will report, however, that this episode, while clearly removed from the others, does not end up feeling nearly as useless or throw-away as the Hound of the Baskervilles episode back in the second season (s02e02).\n\nIf you’re a fan of Sherlock Holmes, either as a literary character or as a film and television staple, you should watch this. If you’re a fan of this particular series, you should watch it immediately (or immediately watch it again if you have already). If you’re a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch or Martin Freeman, I shouldn’t have to tell you to watch this. If you’re a fan of quality television and movies, this is also for you. You know what? Whoever you are, just watch it!\n\nRating: 5 SHIELDS!\n\nThe Abominable Bride will have a limited run in theaters here in the states. It is showing in select theaters this Tuesday and Wednesday, January 5th and 6th. I’ll be heading to the showing on the 5th. Yes, I’ve already watched it. Yes, the tickets are darned near $20. What’s your point?\n\nIf you’re not up for paying the price of a steak dinner to see the show, you can wait until the encore showing on PBS Masterpiece on January 10.\n\nAre you a fan of Sherlock Holmes? What is your favorite iteration of him, character based on him or story featuring him? Will you be heading to theaters to see this latest installment of the superb BBC series? Let me know in the comments.",
  "latent_4163": "by\n\n[Have you been over to yesterday’s post to enter the giveaway yet? Heather is giving away a full series of her online cooking classes–that’s 24 classes!! Plus bonus materials galore. Go ahead and enter–but then come back here for this fantastic recipe!]\n\n[These burgers were so good, I actually tried to learn PicMonkey for them! What do y’all think–too basic? Yea or Nay to the superimposed caption?]\n\nAlthough Toronto is renowned as a multicultural city, one of the few culinary chasms is Mexican food. Oh, sure, there are Mexican restaurants here and there, but they are far outnumbered by Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Malaysian, Thai, Hungarian, Ethiopian, Fusion, and about 47 other cuisines I can’t think of at the moment. Then again, since Toronto is pretty much across the continent (about 3700 kilometers or 2300 miles) from Mexico, the scarcity makes some sense.\n\nWhen The HH and I were first dating, we seemed to land at one particular Mexican place called Hernando’s Hideaway fairly often. Dim, cavernous, and located below street level, it’s one of those “great place to meet a paramour” dive-cum-bars that’s frequented by univesity students, coworkers on Thursday evening, out-of-towners, and. . . .the HH and me. It was the type of establishment where the quality of the food is often masked by the poor visibility, like a stop sign that suddenly seems to jump out at you if you drive in a snowstorm.\n\nThe HH and I, however, loved it there. We’d sit in a just-wiped vinyl booth beside the dark, unreflective walnut paneled walls, gazing at each other with newfound infatuation as we shared fully loaded nachos with guacamole, refried beans smothered in cheese, burritos, carafes of intensely dark red wine (ah! I remember the days of wine. . . ), and whatever else struck our fancy. Despite the dim surroundings (perhaps it was the starry look in our eyes that illuminated the tabletop), we’d savor every mouthful. Of course, none of it was authentic–bordering on fast-food, in fact–and we’d likely turn our noses up at the fare today. But back then, it served to ignite a love of Tex Mex cuisine (and got our own romance moving along in the process).\n\n[My burger, with dijon, sauerkraut, sprouts and sriracha on a gluten-free bun.]\n\nI don’t usually post Mexican dishes precisely because I have so little experience in that area, but these burgers are a bit of a fusion dish that evoked a pleasing taste of the southwest right here in my wintery Toronto kitchen. This is one of three burgers that Heather offers in her cooking classes (a full series of which I am giving away here!). These burgers were incredibly easy and quick to prepare, and I loved that they were baked rather than fried (though Heather does offer instructions for pan-frying, too).\n\nThe hardest part was waiting for them to cook, as the aroma of browning onion and chili wafted through the kitchen. Once done, they provided a perfect sandwich filling with a crispy exterior and moist, robust inside. Not overly spicy, they were nonetheless incredibly flavorful. I enjoyed mine in a gluten free bun from Aidan’s; the HH used a wholegrain bun and added a sprinkling of cheese over his sauerkraut and sprouts.\n\nAs we munched away happily, the conversation went something like this:\n\nRicki: How do you like it?\n\nHH: Oh these are pretty good [chew chew]. Actually, these are really tasty [chomp, chomp]. You know, these are delicious! I really like these [masticate, masticate]. You should make these again! [Gets up to serve himself another–bun, cheese, sprouts and all.]\n\nWell, whenever I hear the triumvirate of “good, tasty, delicious” from the otherwise reticent HH, I know I’ve got a winner on my hands!\n\nWhether or not you’ve liked Tex Mex food in the past, I hope you give these burgers a try. They’re a perfect quick dinner that may just ignite a little spark of North American-Mexican fusion love in you, too.\n\nPrint This!\n\nSpicy Black Bean Burgers reprinted with permission from Healthy Eating Starts Here 1 1/2 cups cooked black beans (14 oz can, or 1/2 cup dried beans fully cooked) 1 carrot, grated 1/2 red pepper, finely diced 1-2 cloves garlic, pressed 2 green onions, diced 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 Tbsp nut/seed butter (almond, sunflower, tahini, etc) 1-2 tsp chili powder1/4 tsp sea salt or Herbamere, to taste The beans must be fully cooked before you begin. Soak them overnight (8 hours) in lots of water, then drain and rinse. Add enough water to cover them by 2 inches, and gently boil them with NO salt. You can add a bit of kombu (seaweed) to the cooking water while they boil for improved digestibility. Black beans will take about 1-2 hours to cook. If you’re using canned beans, just drain and rinse them. If you can find a can that doesn’t use salt, that’s ideal. The burgers will have better texture if you let the beans dry out a bit in a strainer. You can either pulse the vegetables and parsley in a food processor, then add the beans to lightly pulse, or mash the beans and stir in the grated/chopped veggies if you don’t have a food processor. A blender won’t work because it needs liquid to puree. Stir in the nut/seed butter and spices (or pulse in the food processor) to combine, then the rolled oats. You may want to add more nut/seed butter for stickiness or rolled oats for texture and dryness. Taste for seasoning, and add salt to bring the flavors together. Form the mix into burger shapes. Lay them on a baking sheet (ideally lined with parchment paper so they don’t stick), and bake for 30-40 minutes at 300-350 degrees F. You can also fry the burgers to cook them more quickly. Add a bit of oil to the pan and cook about 10 minutes on the first side. Flip, and cook another 5-7 minutes.

  "latent_4196": "Michael Barbera could face court martial for 2007 deaths of unarmed brothers as witnesses testify about possible cover-up\n\nThe two unarmed Iraqi brothers posed no threat as they herded cattle in a grove where a US army reconnaissance team was hidden one day seven years ago. But Michael Barbera, then a staff sergeant, took a knee, leveled his rifle and killed them anyway, a prosecutor said Wednesday as a preliminary hearing opened in the soldier's case.\n\nThe first boy was shot in the back, the prosecutor, Captain Ben Hillner, told an investigating officer considering whether Barbera should face a court martial in the March 2007 slayings. The second boy was shot in the chest as he raised his hands in the air, he said.\n\nBarbera, 31 and now a sergeant first-class based at Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorff-Richardson, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder in a case that raised concerns about a possible cover-up. Two years after the killings, army criminal investigators looked into the case, but commanders decided to give Barbera a letter of reprimand instead of a court martial.\n\nIt was only after a Pittsburgh newspaper, The Tribune-Review, published an investigation about the matter in 2012 that the army took another look. The story described how some of Barbera's fellow soldiers remained troubled that he was never prosecuted, and it prompted calls from Congress for the army to review the matter.\n\nAs the preliminary hearing began Wednesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, south of Seattle, Barbera's attorney, David Coombs, called the allegations baseless and highlighted the lingering questions about why it has taken so long to bring the case to court.\n\nHe alleged that the newspaper's \"hit piece\", which won an investigative reporting award, and congressional pressure had improperly influenced the army's decision to file charges against Barbera last fall.\n\nBarbera's fellow soldiers didn't begin to come forward to report concerns about the shooting until 2009, and a criminal investigation was conducted then. The matter was \"somehow put to bed by administrative action\", Hillner said in his opening statement.\n\nHillner did not elaborate on that decision by commanders at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where Barbera was then based.\n\nCoombs, who represented Chelsea Manning, the army private convicted of leaking a massive trove of information to Wikileaks, argued in his opening statement that even though the soldiers' rules of engagement required them to report violations, it was two years before any raised concerns.\n\nFurthermore, he said, the reporter who wrote the stories, a former marine named Carl Prine, was only too ready to believe what Barbera's former comrades told him.\n\nPrine and his wife are on the witness list. Quickly after Prine contacted Barbera via Facebook in 2011, Barbera called and told Prine's wife something to the effect of: \"For your own personal safety, you need to tell your husband to back off the story,\" Hillner said Wednesday.\n\nThat's the basis of another charge against Barbera, conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. He's also accused of trying to get a fellow soldier in 2009 to tell investigators that the dead boys might have been wearing suicide vests.\n\nThe shootings came in the village of As Sadah, in Diyala Province. Barbera was the leader of an eight-man reconnaissance team that had planned to remain secreted in the grove for two to three days monitoring possible enemy activity.\n\nAfter the brothers were killed, Barbera's group also killed their cousin, who approached the scene along a footpath. No charges were filed in that killing. The first witness to testify Wednesday, former army medic Andrew Harriman, fired the shot that killed the cousin and said it appeared the man had been reaching for a weapon.\n\nHarriman testified that he didn't see where Barbera was shooting when he fired five or six shots that day, and that he only learned after the fact from another soldier, Private First Class Dary Fink, that Barbera had killed two unarmed boys.\n\nHarriman testified that because he didn't see whom Barbera was shooting at, or even the bodies, he didn't report the issue. But he said he believed he urged Fink to do so.\n\nNevertheless, Harriman also testified that he believed his immediate commanders would have swept the matter under the rug even if he had reported it right away.\n\n\"I believe they would have, yes, covered it up. They had all kinds of shady dealings,\" he said. The victims were identified as Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15; his brother Abbas, 14; and their cousin Muhamed Khaleel Kareem al-Galyani.",
  "latent_4337": "Chick-Fil-A president Dan Cathy sparked a social media firestorm among gay marriage supporters and opponents after taking a public stance on the divisive issue this week.\n\nSpeaking to Christian news site Baptist Press, Cathy called Chick-Fil-A \"guilty as charged\" in response to past criticism of its position on same-sex marriage; he said the company is \"very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit.\"\n\nCathy later added: \"We intend to stay the course. We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles.\"\n\nMany customers and offended observers took to Twitter to blast the chicken sandwich fast food chain. Online cooking show host Hilah Johnson posted a YouTube video on how to make a homemade \"Chick-Fil-Gay\" sandwich and avoid shopping at the chain. Actor Ed Helms of The Office and The Hangover tweeted that he would begin a boycott:\n\nChick-Fil-A then used its Facebook Page on Thursday to respond to the criticism.\n\n\"The Chick-Fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect – regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender,\" read a post that received more than 47,000 Likes and 10,000 comments in a matter of hours. \"Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\"\n\nWhile some of the Facebook comments were critical, many backed up Cathy's comments against gay marriage or deemed the issue irrelevant to where they'd spend their money.\n\nChick-Fil-A isn't the first food company to wade into gay rights issues on social media. On the other side of the debate, Oreo posted a pro-gay rights message to its Facebook Page last month and drew a massive — if mixed — response.\n\nIf a brand you like takes a public stand on gay marriage via social media — pro or con — does that affect your loyalty to it?

  "latent_4417": "Craig Mitchelldyer-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"We're going to be active in the trade market and free agency.\"\n\nThese were the words of Cleveland Cavaliers' general manager Chris Grant to media members on June 28th, following the 2013 NBA Draft.\n\nNow, days into free agency, where exactly is this activity?\n\nSo far, Cleveland's only confirmed free-agent meeting has been with Los Angeles Lakers forward Earl Clark.\n\nHardly a move to excite the season ticket holders.\n\nWhile there's no doubt the Cavs would like to preserve cap space for the 2014 free-agent class, those words from Grant did spark some excitement among a fanbase that had to sit back and watch a lottery-bound team for the past three years.\n\nSo what can we realistically expect from the Cavaliers on the free-agent front?\n\nHere are some notable players who might come at a reasonable deal whom Cleveland could pursue.\n\nEarl Clark, F, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nWe might as well start with Clark, as he's definitely the most likely thus far to end up in Cleveland.\n\nTheSportingNews.com reports that the Cavaliers met with the 25-year-old forward on Tuesday and scheduled another meeting for Wednesday.\n\nClark played under now Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown briefly last season and had his best statistical year. In 23.1 minutes a game, Clark averaged 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds while playing three different positions.\n\nAt 6'10\", his best spot is probably at power forward, but he could also play small forward at times and showed an improved three-point shot last season.\n\nI smell a classic two-year deal with a team option in the second for Clark, should Wednesday's meeting go well.\n\nPossible Contract: Two years, $5 million (team option in second year)\n\nDarren Collison, PG, Dallas Mavericks\n\nIn their search for a backup point guard behind Kyrie Irving, the Cavs may turn to a former starter, says Sam Amico of Fox Sports Ohio.\n\nAt 25 years of age, Collison isn't exactly the veteran point guard whom Irving can learn from and grow with, but he would be a great option for the second unit.\n\nIn four seasons in the league, Collison has started 219 of his 296 games. He owns averages of 12.1 points and 5.2 assists in 29.5 minutes of play.\n\nBeing a starter for much of his career, it will be interesting to see if Collision accepts a reserve role given his age.\n\nI compare him to former Cavalier point guard Ramon Sessions, a fringe starter in the league who would accept a backup position if the money was right.\n\nSessions signed a two-year, $10 million deal with the Charlotte Bobcats last summer. I expect Collision's deal to be in that neighborhood as well if he signs with the Cavs.\n\nPossible Contract: Three years, $14 million\n\nDorell Wright, SF, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nThe Cavs need to do something, anything to address small forward this offseason.\n\nA player like Wright could be an option.\n\nAt 27, he brings a combination of experience and potential to the position, if only until next summer's free-agent class. Wright played in 79 games for the Sixers last season, averaging 9.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in 22.6 minutes as a reserve.\n\nHe's a solid three-point shooter who can spot up from behind the arc whenever Kyrie Irving or Dion Waiters drives to the basket. At 6'9\", he has good defensive potential and length to shoot over smaller defenders.\n\nHis signing would also allow the Cavs to move Alonzo Gee to the bench, where he should be much more productive.\n\nIn terms of money, I expect another one- or two-year deal to keep their salary cap flexible.\n\nPossible Contract: Two years, $6 million\n\nChris Copeland, SF, New York Knicks\n\nAnother option for Cleveland at small forward may come from a less traditional route.\n\nCopeland was a rookie last season after playing his college ball at the University of Colorado. Never mind that there was a six-year break in-between.\n\nCopeland spent some time playing professionally overseas before signing with the Knicks last season. Now 29, Copeland isn't your traditional second-year player but still has the energy of a college kid.\n\nIn just 15.4 minutes a game with the Knicks last season, Copeland averaged 8.7 points and 2.1 rebounds while shooting 42.1 percent on three-pointers.\n\nHe has excellent size at 6'8\" and would help space the floor for the Cavs on offense.\n\nNew York would like to bring him back, but they're limited financially. The Cavs should come in with a strong first-year salary, with a team option for a second.\n\nPossible Contract: Two years, $7 million (team option in second year)\n\nGreg Oden, C, Training Room\n\nThe Cavs need some insurance at center with the oft-injured Anderson Varejao still on the roster.\n\nTyler Zeller should be better, but Cleveland needs a third guy to step in if needed.\n\nThis is where Oden comes in.\n\nDespite not playing in an NBA game in nearly four years, Oden is still just 25 years old and, we assume, still 7' tall.\n\nThis is enough to take a gamble on, despite all of those knee surgeries. Other teams have reportedly been interested in Oden, and the Cavs may have to offer more than their comfortable with to get him to sign in Cleveland.\n\nWhile names like Andrew Bynum and Nikola Pekovic will likely demand big money, it's possible Oden could turn out to be the better value when it's all said and done.\n\nPossible Contract: Two years, $4 million",

Officials said he is facing charges of patronizing prostitution.\n\nLong, who has been on the school board for a year, resigned amid the allegations.\n\nAccording to an affidavit of probable cause, Long contacted a woman via text messages and inquired about paying for sex.

  "latent_4490": "Wolfgang William Van Halen (born March 16, 1991) is an American musician who is currently the bassist for Van Halen, having replaced Michael Anthony in 2006. He is also the former bassist for the heavy metal band Tremonti. At 27 years old, he is the youngest member of Van Halen.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nNamed in homage to the classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, he is the son of guitarist Eddie Van Halen and actress Valerie Bertinelli, and the nephew of drummer Alex Van Halen. Wolfgang has said that he did not know his father was a famous musician until he \"started picking up CDs and saw his [Eddie's] picture on them\".[2]\n\nFollowing the completion of the 2007/2008 Van Halen tour, Van Halen headed back to school, hoping to graduate in the summer of 2009; he would graduate one year later in 2010. Van Halen appears as the bassist for Van Halen in Guitar Hero: Van Halen.[3]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nVan Halen had an indirect impact on his father's career from the very beginning of his life. The instrumental \"316\" refers to his birthday. For a 13-year period ending in 2004, Eddie Van Halen collaborated with Peavey on a line of guitars, the Wolfgang series, named after his son.[4] In 2008, his father named a custom guitar after him, the Fender EVH Wolfgang.[5][6]\n\nVan Halen started his musical career as a drummer. He often watched his father rehearse, and at times would try to play his uncle Alex's drum kit, whereupon the latter would give him a few lessons. Van Halen started playing drums at the age of nine, mostly self-taught with only few lessons from his uncle, and got his first drum set from his father as a present for his tenth birthday. Some time later he moved on to guitar and bass. He can also play keyboards and \"figure things out by ear\".[2] Van Halen later began actively participating in the band. He also made guest appearances during some dates of Van Halen's 2004 tour, appearing during his father's extended guitar solo spot and playing \"316\" with him.\n\nIn late 2006, in an interview with Guitar World, Eddie Van Halen confirmed that his son would replace Michael Anthony as Van Halen's bassist.[7] Wolfgang first toured with Van Halen in his new capacity in 2007.[8] In August 2010, Van Halen announced that they would record a new album, with Wolfgang playing bass.\n\nIn early 2008, Van Halen appeared on the cover of the April issue of Guitar World with his father, in the magazine's first father-son issue.\n\nHe recorded his first album with Van Halen, A Different Kind of Truth, in 2011. The album was released on February 7, 2012.[9]\n\nOn September 10, 2012, Alter Bridge and Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti announced that Van Halen would be filling in for Brian Marshall as bassist for the first tour of Tremonti's eponymous band.[10] Tremonti's first album, All I Was, was released on July 17 of that year. Van Halen became an official member of Tremonti in 2013, replacing previous bassist Brian Marshall.[11] He appears on the band's 2015 studio album Cauterize and its 2016 follow-up Dust.\n\nIn a February 2015 interview with the National Museum of American History, Eddie Van Halen indicated that Wolfgang is working on a solo album.\n\nMusical style [ edit ]\n\nVan Halen started playing the bass as his father started asking if he wanted to play with him. Van Halen first viewed bass as \"an easier version of guitar, but as soon as I started playing it I realized how wrong that was\", but stated that his experience with a guitar made it easier for him to deal with the instrument. His style was described by Eddie as a \"rhythm bassist, like I'm a rhythm guitarist and a bassist put together.\" When he first began playing bass, his inspirations were Les Claypool of Primus and Justin Chancellor of Tool. He also enjoys Chris Wolstenholme of Muse, John Entwistle of The Who, Jack Bruce of Cream \"and all of the classic players\".[2]\n\nEquipment [ edit ]\n\nMost of Van Halen's basses are custom-built, and are based on his father's Frankenstrats and EVH Wolfgangs by Fender Master Builder and EVH engineer Chip Ellis. Two of them, one red and one blue, have Fender Jazz Bass shaped bodies and are loaded with active EMG pickups and electronics. These were used for the Van Halen 2007–2008 North American Tour. For the A Different Kind of Truth Tour in 2012, Ellis built Van Halen 3 more basses, another Jazz bass based on his father's black-and-white Frankenstrat, and two based on his father's EVH Wolfgang guitar. Both are satin black, while one has silver stripes and one has yellow stripes similar to his father's \"Bumblebee\" Frankenstrat. All three feature Fender N3 Noiseless pickups.\n\nFor amplification, he uses EVH 5150s and Fender Super Bassmans. He uses one Super Bassman on the clean channel to provide a clean low end, while another Super Bassman and the 5150, both on channel 2, provide an overdriven sound on top of the clean Bassman. For effects,Van Halen uses an MXR EVH signature Flanger and Phase 90, MXR Fullbore distortion, Strymon TimeLine delay, Electro-Harmonix POG, and Way Huge Pork Loin overdrive, and a Dunlop Cry Baby bass wah.\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nwith Van Halen\n\nwith Tremonti\n\nCauterize – 2015\n\n– 2015 Dust – 2016",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 12, 2016, 7:13 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 12, 2016, 7:13 PM GMT By Keith Wagstaff\n\nIn the future, drones could patrol the skies, hunting for other drones. They might not need lasers or advanced technology to do it — instead, they could simply use a net.\n\nResearchers from Michigan Technological University's HIRoLab have created a \"drone-catcher\" that ensnares rogue unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by shooting out a net.\n\nIt's similar to a system developed by Tokyo police to stop drones that fly into restricted airspace. The Japanese UAV is a little different because it flies with a net hanging underneath it.\n\nHIRoLab's drone actually launches a net. It can fly autonomously or can be flown by a pilot.\n\nLike the Japanese drone, the UAV from HIRoLab doesn't let its prey drop to the ground, instead carrying it until it can reach a secure area.\n\nMo Rastgaar, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Michigan Technological University, got the idea after he heard about the quadcopter that crashed on the White House lawn last January.\n\n\"I thought, 'If the threat is a drone, you really don’t want to shoot it down — it might contain explosives and blow up,'\" he said in a news release. \"What you want to do is catch it and get it out of there.\"\n\nResearchers have filed a patent for the drone-catching system.",
  "latent_4535": "“My name is DireNecessity and I’m small.”\n\n“Hello DireNecessity!”\n\n“I’ve always been small. Even on those occasions when I was a member of an alliance, we were small. These days, I’m so small I’m in an NPC corp. And you know what? I like it. For the foreseeable future, I’m staying small. It suits me. Eat that colossals!”\n\n::gasp::\n\nWhen Small, Navigate\n\nArctic Terns are abundant long-lived birds featuring gray, white and black plumage. Eating mostly fish and small marine invertebrates, Arctic Terns are famous migrators, flying from their northern Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctica coast and back again each year. For Arctic Terns nesting in Iceland, that’s a 70,900 km round trip. The long journey ensures that these birds see two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet.\n\nIf a diminutive 105 g bird can navigate both arctics, you, an immortal pilot, can navigate New Eden. What’s more, if it suits you, you can navigate it small, with style, like the Arctic Tern.\n\nWhen you’re small, you get to define your own goals. If you’re a sweet summer child like the Arctic Tern, you’ll pursue summer year around. If you’re an immortal pilot entranced with the law like me, you’ll often traverse highsec. When small, discovering you can’t blithely do what you want, where you want, when you want in New Eden is not humiliation, rather, it’s accepting that EVE is a dangerous place you must negotiate. Each player chooses for themselves how to steer EVE’s hazardous shoals. Whether danger originates from menacing NPCs (like all powerful CONCORD) or malevolent players (Grrr Pandemic Legion) makes no difference. Small players navigate to thrive.\n\nWhen Small, be Realistic\n\nCCP has made attacking *and* defending Citadels community endeavors – it takes a team. Attackers, being attackers, have the initiative, leaving immobile Citadel defenders incontestably cooked without similarly sized defending team since Citadels, compared to the mobile ships attacking them, aren’t that terribly powerful (especially in highsec with Citadels’ limited offensive options). Consequently, Citadels’ current instantiation befuddles appealing small activities like reasonably wealthy pigheaded Citadel owners putting up a stout defense because they don’t have, or are unwilling to assemble, the required defending team.\n\nAccordingly, for a reasonably wealthy pigheadedly small player such as myself, Citadels’ hold limited appeal. If CCP could find a way to balance Citadels enabling competitive asymmetric game play, tossing opposing team player groups and pigheaded smalls onto the same grid, I’d be enthusiastic about participating. As such a Citadel owner, I’d be happy simply giving as good as I got which, in isolation, Citadels currently aren’t able to do (again, especially in highsec). This is a big ask, however, since balancing Citadels around my pigheadedly small play style would also turn them into overpowered monsters when utilized with defending teams. So I don’t ask. Instead I play the game we actually have.\n\nWhen Small, Know Your Neighborhood\n\nBeing a long time manufacturer, Summer 2014’s Crius expansion required adaptation. Pre expansion, congestion slowed production as jobs waited their turn in the queue. Post expansion, the queue was replaced with a congestion driven ‘system cost index’ premium. The change proved earth shattering. Pre expansion, convenient manufacturing locations could compete with other locations but work proceeded slowly. Post expansion, convenient locations grew a price premium, meaning work proceeded at speed but ballooning expenses could drive those locations into infeasibility.\n\nTo remain competitive, I moved operations three times. First to a still convenient location not far from my hub but not yet exploited. Others, facing the same dilemma, eventually moved in as well ruining the party. Second, to a rather inconvenient location many jumps from my hub. No others followed and I soon discovered why, the painful commute impaired the pleasure. What I needed was ‘convenient but unpopular’. What I needed was lowsec.\n\nAppropriate lowsec location was soon scouted out. A delicious little spot stunningly close to a hub but behind a riffraff-deterring, gruesomely camped gate. Knowing there would be gate camp crashing in my future, manufactured product had to adapt. No more bulky boats or modules for me. I’d concentrate on rig manufacture only. I’d pack a briefcase full of diamonds and giggle with delight every time I scampered through the wreckage and corpses littering my ‘no riffraff’ camped gate.\n\nI appreciate the resident brigands keeping my business viable\n\nIt’s gone well. I appreciate the resident brigands keeping my business viable and occasionally we exchange friendly waves in local as I hold them at arm’s reach. But all parties must end and the other morning I faced last call. Local signified a camped gate – Russians. With business to conduct I packed 445 million worth of product in my blockade running Prowler suitcase, exited station, warping to an insta-undock and engaging the cloak. All cloaked up, I then warped to my camped gate 0 bookmark and, upon dropping out of warp, spammed the jump button to find . . . nothing happening. Tranquility and I, we weren’t commuting. Hmmm. This could be grim.\n\nI’ve had disconnects before, occasionally at inconvenient moments and even at this very gate. My last disconnect at this gate was ever so slightly post-jump leaving an unending gate jump animation followed by eventual successful re-sign on in highsec safety. This disconnect, however, was pre-jump, leaving me sitting on the lowsec side of the gate wondering if the jovial Russian jackals were mauling me. As I stared at the screen I knew the die was already cast, the narrative already written, the contract already signed, so I shut the computer down, finished my morning coffee and began my work day. At lunch I calculated out possible losses: 445 million in the hold, 153 million worth of outfitted Prowler and 1.083 billion worth of implants packed away in my character’s gorgeous head. 1 Billion, 681 Million. Grim indeed.\n\nLater, when I successfully logged back on, I saw good news. The character choice screen told me I remained undocked and still in the Prowler. The jackals hadn’t dined on me . . . yet. But where would logging back in land me and what hungry predators might I find there? Reconnaissance was required, so I logged an alt in the system first to spy local – hmmm the afternoon Western European campers appear to be on shift, we’ll wait for evening. And evening proved clear of the usual Americans. Let’s pull this trigger. Logging in my stranded pilot landed us not at the gate but rather back on our station exit insta-undock bookmark meaning, lengthy hiccup aside, business as usual. The party continues.\n\nWhen Small, Skirt Shadow\n\nWhen you’re small, you get to follow your own muse. Who’s going to know? Who’s going to care? That means, should you write an EVE story including an Austrahus Citadel, you might, despite reservations, decide for authenticity’s sake to actually deploy one. It might even look something like this:\n\nShould the muse strike you, feel free to critique my fit. Even better, toss your own up and show me how it’s done. For a small like me it wasn’t that difficult to do. An undeployed Austrahus Citadel fits in a typically equipped blockade runner’s unscannable cargo hold.\n\nIf you want to save some ISK you might purchase in Jita, haul unnoticed through the Uedama choke point on the way to your favorite out-of-the-way highsec location where you’ll deploy the beast well off plane. You might even scan down mission runners to find that off plane spot. If you don’t give public access, no one’s likely to run across it way out there and if they do, it’s going to take them no less than eight days and two wardecs to bring the beast down, all presuming they enduringly hate you and you don’t interfere with their malevolent plans. What’s more, you’ll get at least 24 hours’ notice before that first wardec goes live enabling plenty of time to decide if you’re even going to bother defending that first, terribly onerous 3 hour vulnerability window.\n\nIf you’re marginally clever (and keep in mind, I’m only marginally clever) you’ll fob the labor off on an alt making the beast even harder to find. An Arctic Tern could do this. What’s stopping you?\n\nWhen Small, don’t Whine\n\nI should also say don’t swagger but it’s too late, I already have. Both may get you noticed and when you’re small, drawing undue attention can go badly. Time, as always, will tell. Arctic Terns don’t grouse about their long commute, they just take wing and by journey’s end, span the globe. You can traverse New Eden.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

  "latent_4549": "If you're trying to cut back on meat, or giving it up all together, your lunchtime options just got way more exciting thanks to Pret's new veggie pop-up that's just opened in Soho. They've turned the Broadwick Street branch into a meat-free zone for a month-long trial, and they've added 45 (!) new vegetarian and vegan recipes to the menu. But don't panic, meat-lovers, the plan isn't to turn every single Pret into a veggie's paradise. There are iPads and comment boxes in the branch where customers can leave their feedback, so that popular items can be rolled out across all branches. Here's all the new stuff they've come up with:\n\nSmoothies\n\nOkay, they already sell fresh juices and smoothies, but these are even fresher. Choose your flavour and they'll blend it up for you at the counter. And yes, that is a protein shake (and it's surprisingly delicious).\n\nCourgetti\n\nWell, obviously. See also: cauliflower rice, which is also on the menu.\n\nOpen sandwiches\n\nDon't fancy your sandwich with two slices of bread? Try these new open sandwiches, which are all on rye bread and piled high with tasty toppings including avocado on egg and radish, beetroot and cream cheese. Just don't attempt to eat them on the go.\n\nKombucha\n\nIf you're not familiar with kombucha, here's everything you need to know about it. But, in a nutshell: it's a fermented green tea that tastes a bit vinegary, but apparently has mega health benefits.\n\nSavoury yoghurt\n\nSavoury yoghurt? Sounds wrong, but actually it's not as weird as it seems. They've basically put greek yoghurt together with some middle eastern flavours, including a mint and dukkah spice bowl, and a spicy chickpea and coriander bowl.\n\nHot protein pots\n\nIn need of a protein hit but don't fancy it in shake form? Chow down on one of these new hot protein bowls, which are filled with Pret's own baked beans, mushrooms and a poached egg.\n\nCacao and orange pots\n\nThere's loads of new sweet treats, including coconut yoghurt, a vegan chocolatey coconut bar that's basically a healthy Bounty bar, and a cacao and orange pot, which looks damn tasty.\n\nBut don't worry, they haven't given the menu a complete overhaul. There are still some old favourites, including the humble egg mayo, the falafel flatbread and the posh cheddar and pickle. But they've also added some new sandwiches, salads and wraps, including an artichoke, tapenade and olive baguette, an avocado and chipotle chickpea wrap, and a veggie New Yorker on rye bread.\n\nPret's veggie pop-up is at 35 Broadwick Street, W1F 0DH. Open throughout June.",
  "latent_4558": "X-Wing Miniature modified with an R421 ring magnet and steel ball\n\nStar Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tabletop game that’s become popular very quickly over the last few years. It’s a game that’s played on any tabletop (there’s no board), where you enact spaceflight battles using models of X-Wings, TIE Fighters and other spaceships from the Star Wars universe.\n\nIn addition to being a fun game, the tiny miniatures are quite detailed and look really great. Some folks buy them for decoration without any intentions of playing the game.\n\nModification\n\nUnlike some other games that use great looking models, such as Warhammer 40k, these X-Wing models come completed, painted and ready to play. Even so, it seems that enthusiastic gamers can’t resist modifying their ships to be just a little bit cooler than the next guy.\n\nNaturally, tiny yet powerful neodymium magnets add some extra flair to the ships. Before we describe the modification, let’s look at the stock setup.\n\nOut of the box\n\nA stock X-Wing miniature\n\nThe basic starter set for the game includes one X-Wing and two TIE Fighters. As you get more into the game, you can acquire other ships to field larger fleets, but you can play a game with just the basic set.\n\nThe models themselves are exquisitely detailed. They look great.\n\nThe base or stand has a card that snaps into place, indicating some important specs about the ship, such as firepower, agility, shields, pilot, etc.\n\nA two part, small, clear, plastic tube sticks up from the base. It holds the ship about 2 ½” to 3” above the base.\n\nThe setup is rigid. The ship isn’t able to turn, twist or bank on the stand. In fact, the plastic parts are made with “D” shaped holes, which makes sure that the ship is assembled correctly, facing forward, in one particular direction.\n\nUse the (Magnetic) Force…\n\nThe modification we’re about to describe uses a small ring magnet and a steel ball to form a kind of ball-and-socket joint. It replaces the top joint, and allows the ship to tilt or move in different directions.\n\nThis doesn’t affect game play at all. It just looks cool.\n\nMaking the Modification\n\nIn the short video below, we show how we modified one of these ships. Note: This modification permanently alters your ships. Once you choose the way of the magnetic force, there’s no going back.\n\nToo much glue is bad, because the steel ball won't seat correctly.\n\nIn that video, you'll notice that we had a nail sticking in the R421 ring magnet while we were gluing it in place. We used a nail with the point cut off. Why? Because on our first attempt, we found that we used too much glue and it flowed up through the hole of the magnet. Glue there doesn't let the steel ball sit in place. Using the nail this way helps prevent glue from flowing up through the hole.\n\nUPDATE: We should have mentioned this more explicitly in this article: hot glue stinks. In our article about adhesives, we specifically recommend avoiding hot glue. Not only is it messy, but the high temperatures can partially demagnetize a neodymium magnet.\n\nWe did it here because it was fast, easy, didn't require a lot of drying time, and there's only so long we're allowed to play with X-Wing models at work! As you can see from the photos, it's not the cleanest or neatest choice. Super glue is much more commonly used for this.\n\nWhat magnets should I use?\n\nThe most popular choice seems to be the ¼” diameter R421 ring magnet with a 3/16” diameter NSB3 steel ball. That’s a great combination. It’s strong enough to hold well and not flop around too much, yet tiny enough not to overshadow the ship.\n\nWe also tried it with a larger, ¼” diameter NSB4 steel ball. It’s a little stronger with this ball, but the ball is obviously a bit bigger in appearance. It's a matter of taste.\n\nFor much larger ships, consider bigger magnets and steel balls. R422CS-N or R622CS-N magnets are great for much bigger ships that are available. Consider 3/8” diameter NSB6 steel balls with that larger ring.\n\nThe table below shows how some popular combinations look with ring magnets going down the left side, and steel ball sizes across the top. We're focusing on X-Wing miniatures here, but model-makers of all kinds like to use these combinations of magnets and steel balls to make ball-and-socket joints. For a shoulder or hip joint, it's a great solution.\n\nNSB2\n\n1/8\" Steel Ball NSB3\n\n3/16\" Steel Ball NSB4\n\n1/4\" Steel Ball NSB6\n\n3/8\" Steel Ball NSB8\n\n1/2\" Steel Ball R311\n\n3/16\" Ring Magnet N/A N/A N/A R313\n\n3/16\" Ring Magnet N/A N/A N/A N/A R421\n\n1/4\" Ring Magnet N/A N/A N/A R422\n\n1/4\" Ring Magnet N/A N/A N/A R424\n\n1/4\" Ring Magnet N/A N/A R422CS-N\n\n1/4\" Countersunk Ring Magnet N/A N/A R622CS-N\n\n3/8\" Countersunk Ring Magnet N/A R822CS-N\n\n1/2\" Countersunk Ring Magnet N/A\n\nCan I use a sphere magnet instead of a steel ball?\n\nNo. We get asked this question a lot, but it doesn't work very well.\n\nA sphere-shaped magnet still has a north and a south pole, so it tends to stick to the ring magnet in one position. You can't rotate it a small amount and expect it to stay, since it wants to rotate back.\n\nEpilogue...\n\nSadly, we didn’t get our hands on any larger ships in time for this article. We've been told by many that the combination of the R622CS-N rings with the 3/8\" diameter NSB6 steel ball works great. I do have my eye on a certain freighter called the Millennium Falcon. She may not look like much…",
  "latent_4585": "Martin Havlat has decided to retire after 14 seasons. The 35-year-old forward was a first-round selection (26th overall) of the Ottawa Senators in 1999. He played in 790 career regular season games for the Senators, Chicago Blackhawks, Minnesota Wild, San Jose Sharks, New Jersey Devils and St. Louis Blues. He scored 242 goals and 594 points in the regular season as well as 21 goals and 52 points in 75 postseason matches. Havlat always had a knack for clutch goals, scoring 44 regular season game-winners and seven more in the playoffs, including three overtime playoff winners. He played his final game in the NHL for the Blues on Nov. 12, 2015 against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, two days after he scored his final winner in New Jersey.\n\nIt has been more than 14 months since I played my last game in the NHL. I stopped playing after two games with the St. Louis Blues, because I decided by the way my legs felt, I just couldn’t play the way I wanted to or how I was expected to. There was sharp pain on both sides of my groin from overuse and too many tears.\n\nSo I went home to figure out the next step. A few doctors checked me out, and there was hope to try to play again. I started rehab in April for the groin problems and by the end of the month, I started training, slowly building up. I was feeling better, seeing positive results. I trained this past summer like I was going to play again and had a few invitations for training camp.\n\nI was skating with my hometown Czech team, Kometa Brno, in August to test out how I felt. It was nice to be around the boys, with the jokes and the pranks, and skating in the old arena in Brno where I grew up playing. It gave me the confidence to go to Montreal, where I have gone for the last 10 to 12 years to get ready for the NHL season.\n\nI needed to know if I could do it one more time.\n\nI arrived there in early September, and pushed myself hard. I felt I was better than earlier in the year, but still wasn’t good enough for me to compete at the level I expect for myself. That’s why I decided not to follow through and try to play in the NHL anymore, once and for all.\n\nBy the time training camp came around, I still wasn’t 100 percent or to the point I needed to be to feel comfortable to give it a try. I felt so many emotions at the time. It was more frustration than anger, but in the end, I would have been angrier if I didn’t at least try to come back one more time.\n\nI’m not angry now, just happy I did everything I could.\n\nI was going to retire, but then the Kometa Brno hockey club called to see if I was interested in a comeback with them. The owner asked me to help them out and get ready for the playoffs. So I went back to Kometa. I trained with them in December, but a week before I was going to play my first game in January, those same physical issues returned. I was trying to push it too hard and I tweaked my groin again. When that happened, I knew I could finally accept it: I had to leave the game.\n\nIt would have been nice to play at home and finish my career playing in that same arena where I started as a kid. It would have been nice to play in front of my 86-year-old father, Slava, since he was my coach as a teenager. Like most of our parents, he’s a very important person in my life. He was 50 when I was born, still a young man, but a little older than usual. Everything I had was due to my Mom and Dad.\n\nMy father was my coach. The most important thing was he was hard on me, much harder on me than on anybody else on the team. He didn’t want to give me a free pass. Sometimes it wasn’t easy, but in the end, I knew it was very good for me. He always wanted and expected the best out of me. Nobody back then expected me to play in the NHL. My father always taught me that when you reach one level, you strive to get to the next level, to take things step-by-step.\n\nLooking back at my career, I think back to 1999 when I was drafted by the Senators in Boston. It was a special day, but it was just the beginning. I remember thinking just because I was drafted doesn’t mean I’m going to play in the NHL. It was only the first step.\n\nI went home and played in the Czech Extraliga for Ocelari Trinec, won a gold medal at the IIHF World under-20, and gold again four months later at the World Championship as a 19-year-old with the Czech national team. It was quite a five months. I never won another championship after that. It seems so long ago. But those championships gave me a lot of confidence when I arrived in Ottawa for training camp.\n\nI was fortunate to have had a few Czech and Slovak players around me in Ottawa, like Marian Hossa, Radek Bonk and Vinny Prospal to make me feel comfortable.\n\nThe Czech players helped me with the language, to feel comfortable, and to find good restaurants to eat at both home and on the road. But one of the best things they did for me after a few months was to take me out for dinner and tell me that I needed to work on the English language on my own. Sometimes when you have too many countrymen around you, you get lazy. They motivated me to work on it – and I did. It wasn’t only them who helped – Daniel Alfredsson always made me feel at home too – especially away from the rink.\n\nI played my first game in Boston, where I was drafted. I remember standing at the bench for the two national anthems, the Canadian and United States anthems, thinking that in a few minutes, I’m going to take my first shift in the NHL. I was so excited. I had goose bumps. I played that first game on a line with Vinny and Magnus Arvedson. Vinny was traded about halfway through that season to Florida, but he was such a skillful centre – a great passer, and the reason why I had a good start, a good first season.\n\nI finished third in the Calder Trophy voting to the winner, Evgeni Nabokov, and behind Brad Richards. I wasn’t disappointed at all. I was happy the way that first year went, but not happy about a first-round exit in the playoffs. Then, to go to Toronto for the awards ceremony and to be among all the current NHL stars and former stars was something else.\n\nWe never had to worry about missing the playoffs in Ottawa. We had a good team and I will always remember that run to the conference final in 2003 against New Jersey.\n\nEverybody waits for the playoffs, and I don’t know why I had so much success there. All you ever want to do is be at your best and help your team win. I didn’t approach the playoffs any differently.\n\nMaybe I didn’t appreciate it back then. I just loved it. I wish I could have been in the playoffs every year.\n\nIn the regular season, you’re focused on helping your team accumulate points. In the playoffs, individual games matter so much. You have to focus on the little things, like getting the puck out. Everything is bigger, more important. The city – whether it’s Ottawa, Chicago or San Jose – changed in the playoffs. The fans’ attention was at a different level. You’re thinking about the game every minute.\n\nI left Ottawa for Chicago after five seasons. Both Ottawa and Chicago will always be special places in my heart. They are great cities and good organizations, and I met a lot of great people there. It was hard to leave Chicago after three years and then playing in another conference final in 2009. Really, it was hard to leave both Ottawa and Chicago. But that’s hockey.\n\nI was lucky to have Allan Walsh as my agent as a player, and in my life as a friend. He helped me throughout my whole career, especially in the tough times. It wasn’t just me. He stands up for all his players. I will never forget that. It wasn’t just business. Still, we’re players and it’s better for the agent to fight your battles so you can focus on the game.\n\nIn Ottawa, Chicago and Minnesota, in particular, I was fortunate to have four men who believed in me in a lot: Marshall Johnston, Dale Tallon, Joel Quenneville and Chuck Fletcher. They made a difference in my life forever.\n\nLike I said, I dealt with a lot of injuries at the end and it was frustrating.\n\nHockey was my life, but the last few years, I just couldn’t play the way I wanted to play. My heart wanted to keep on going, but my body didn’t allow me to do it. I felt it was time. I know I’ve made the right decision. I had already undergone a shoulder surgery, a serious pelvic injury and other injuries, but my whole career I dealt with groin problems. I was able to manage the groin problems well enough that nobody would notice. But in the end, the damage was done. Some players never get hurt, but not me. I’m not complaining. I feel very fortunate to have had the career I’ve had.\n\nI’m not sure at this point what I want to do now that I’ve retired. I’m going to take a step back. I’m living in Boca Raton, Florida. I have two beautiful daughters; my youngest is two years old and the oldest will be five in July. Without them, it wouldn’t be the same.

My life has changed for the better.\n\nI hope they won’t play hockey too soon because right now I don’t want to be around a cold rink.

Maybe down the road I’ll want to coach, but not right now.\n\nI know when you retire people ask you about your favourite moment or memory, but for me, it’s tough to pick one. There are so many things I’m grateful for. It was a great run. Sure I had my ups and downs, but I loved the game and enjoyed too many positive things to pick one.\n\nHockey is a team sport and you can’t do everything on your own. You need to work with your teammates – your friends – to be successful. You learn you’re never alone. Sometimes you think you’re alone but there is always someone to pick you up.

  "latent_4679": "Karl Popper was a 20th century philosopher of science, best known for his work on falsifiability. He was critical of the ideas put forth by previous philosophers such as Carnap, that science works by verifying your theories through examination of the world. He said that many theories that were not scientific could be successfully verified by either making vague predictions, or through ad hoc adjustments to the theory. For example a horoscope can predict something vague like \"you will have a pleasant surprise later this week\". Then you find some forgotten money in your pocket, and the horoscope was seemingly verified to be true! However since nearly anything could have verified it, since it was so vague, this does not count as science. He was particularly critical of Freud's theory of psychoanalysis and Marx's theory of historical materialism, both of which were considered scientific by many at the time, but seemed to explain almost all sets of observable data. Instead he suggested that scientific theories must put forwards highly specific predictions, and the scientists must then work to falsify, rather than verify, the theory.\n\nKuhn was a fairly radical philosopher of science, whose major work in the 1960s, The Structures of Scientific Revolutions, claimed that science did not progress in a straightforward way by the accumulation of facts. Instead it worked by having large paradigms which governed scientific thought, such as Newton's theory of gravity. Scientists then work to try to fit nature into the scope of the paradigm. He said that scientific theories are not falsified in the way Popper described, because all theories have open problems in which the theory does not correspond with nature. Instead, as the problems accumulate, a competing paradigm emerges and scientists eventually abandon the old theory for the new one, such as Einsteins theory of Relativity, which largely replaced Newton. He said that scientists will not abandon a theory, no matter how many problems it has matching with nature, until a new competing theory emerges. Most controversially, however, he said that since the vocabulary and basic assumptions of competing theory don't talk about the same things, there is no way to directly compare which theory is better. For example, \"energy\" simply doesn't mean the same thing for Newton and Einstein, so there is no experiment you can run to decide on the properties of \"energy\", and which is more accurate. He claimed that science, like evolution, progresses towards nothing in particular, contrary to the common view that it progresses towards the Truth.",

  "latent_4931": "1. What is civil asset forfeiture?\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is a legal tool that allows law enforcement officials to seize property that they assert has been involved in certain criminal activity. In fact, the owner of the property doesn’t even need to be guilty of a crime: Civil asset forfeiture proceedings charge the property itself with involvement in a crime. This means that police can seize your car, home, money, or valuables without ever having to charge you with a crime. There are many, many stories of innocent people being stripped of their money and property by law enforcement.\n\n2. Why would we ever do this?\n\nToday, civil forfeiture is intended to give law enforcement a tool they can use to go after organized crime, including drug dealers and their organizations. While its roots in the common law are deep, modern civil forfeiture is justified primarily on the grounds that it allows law enforcement to seize the assets and ill-gotten gains of these criminals, using the property and proceeds to fight against other alleged criminals. Unfortunately, civil asset forfeiture is also used by law enforcement as a way to generate revenue, and many of its targets are innocent members of the public.\n\n3. But don’t police target only criminals?\n\nUnfortunately, no. There are many stories of innocent people having their property seized. For example, between 2006 and 2008, law enforcement agents in Tenaha, Texas, engaged in a systematic practice of seizing cash and property from innocent drivers with absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing. In Philadelphia, police seized the home of two sisters whose brother, who did not live there, showed up while trying to evade the cops. In Detroit, cops seized over a hundred cars owned by patrons of an art institute event—because the institute had failed to get a liquor license. You can be totally innocent and still be unable to stop the government from seizing your property.\n\n4. What if I’m innocent? Surely, innocent people can’t have their property taken.\n\nBeing innocent does not mean that a state has to return your property. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the “innocent owner” defense is not constitutionally required. Furthermore, even in states where you do have an innocent owner defense, the burden is typically on you. Your property is presumed to be guilty until you prove that you are innocent and that your property therefore should not be forfeited. In other words, you must prove (1) that you were not involved in criminal activity and (2) that you either had no knowledge that your property was being used to facilitate the commission of a crime or that you took every reasonable step under the circumstances to terminate such use. And all the while, the police retain your property. To cap it all off, the success rate for winning back property is low. Pragmatic property owners, however innocent, may reason that it is best to cut their losses rather than challenge the forfeiture in court.\n\n5. That’s crazy!!! This can’t happen in my state.\n\nIt might be crazy, but civil asset forfeiture happens in every state in the union. Even if the state has laws that limit it, state and local law enforcement authorities can still seize property by partnering with federal law enforcement officials in a system called “equitable sharing,” and payouts to state and local agencies have increased nearly 250% over a 12-year period.\n\n6. But everybody at least gets their day in court, right?\n\nNo. In fact, the majority of federal civil forfeitures end administratively, meaning that the property is automatically forfeited after a certain period of time because the owner of the property did not challenge the seizure. Forfeiture proceedings might be barred because of waivers procured by law enforcement officials who pressure property owners to renounce ownership of their cars, homes, or money in order to avoid facing (often bogus) criminal charges. This quid pro quo raises serious fundamental questions about the fairness of the process. And if a property owner holds out and goes to court, he or she will face an uphill, costly, and lengthy battle.\n\n7. My state has good forfeiture laws on the books, so none of this is a problem, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Federal law can do an end run around good state law. A process called equitable sharing allows local law enforcement officials to team up with federal law enforcement agents to seize property under federal forfeiture law that could not be seized under applicable state forfeiture law. Through equitable sharing, local law enforcement agencies pocket a portion of the proceeds from the seizure and the feds keep the rest. This is a way for local law enforcement to circumvent state law and continue to profit from civil asset forfeitures.",
  "latent_4940": "1973: Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” album cover featuring refracting prism.\n\n1993: Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” 20th anniversary album cover.\n\n2003: Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” 30th anniversary album cover.\n\nA 1973 album of progressive rock music named The Dark Side of the Moon, by the British group Pink Floyd, has distinguished itself on several fronts in the annals of modern music. For starters, it stayed on Billboard’s top 200 albums sales chart for 741 consecutive weeks — from March 1973 to April 1988. That’s a total period of 14 years — a longer popular presence on the music charts than any other album in the history of modern music charting.\n\nDark Side’s 1973-1988 chart run, in fact, survived four U.S. presidents – Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. Four World Cup soccer championships were played during that time, as were a dozen Super Bowls and World Series. A child that began elementary school in the fall of 1973, would have graduated high school and gone into the work world or on to college as Dark Side continued its “consecutive weeks” chart run. But there’s still more.\n\nBy May 1991, after Billboard started using its Top Pop Catalog Albums chart – a fifty-position weekly chart for older albums more than 18 months old, but falling below No. 100 on the Billboard 200 – Pink Floyd’s Dark Side held forth there as well. In fact, as of February 2019, Dark Side held the “total weeks” longevity record at something north of 1,630 total weeks — i.e., weeks on both the Billboard 200 and the Top Pop Catalog charts.\n\nStill, the album’s Billboard heroics is less than half the story, as Dark Side of the Moon, to this day — now past its 45th anniversary year (2018) — continues to be popular. Even when it came off its consecutive weeks run of 14 years in 1988, it remained a very lucrative money machine through the 1990s and beyond.\n\nBy April 1998, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified that Dark Side had sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone. By 2002, it was still selling – 400,000 copies annually in the U.S., placing it among that year’s 200 best-selling albums. By 2004, it was selling an average of 7,000-to-8,000 copies per week in the U.S. with cumulative sales worldwide then totaling over 40 million. By December 2006, the New York Times reported that the Dark Side of the Moon was still selling “nearly 10,000 copies a week.”\n\nAs of 2012, the album had sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide. At a $10-an-album “ball park” estimate, that’s roughly $500 million in gross revenue, a respectable sum that many corporations would envy. And that of course does not include Dark Side’s “share” of Pink Floyd’s concert and touring revenue.\n\nIn any case, The Dark Side of the Moon album helped make the members of Pink Floyd very rich. And as their fans well know, that’s only part of the story, as the group had other hit albums beyond Dark Side, including The Wall of 1979, which was also a giant hit and major money-maker.\n\nPink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 at Abbey Road studios in London. The group’s principal musicians at the time consisted of Roger Waters (bass, synthesizer, vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Richard Wright (keyboards, synthesizers), and David Gilmour (guitar, vocals). The title of the album is an allusion to mental illness rather than astronomy, though Pink Floyd’s music is sometimes called “space rock.”\n\nEarly 1970s: Pink Floyd members, from left: Rick Wright, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and David Gilmour.\n\nDark Side was Pink Floyd’s eight studio album, the group having originally formed in the mid-1960s, though parting ways with earlier frontman, Syd Barrett, due to drugs and mental illness.\n\nReleased in March 1973, Dark Side became an instant chart success in the U.K., Western Europe, and the U.S. It rose to No.1 on the Billboard chart on April 28, 1973 beginning its record-breaking 741 weeks on Billboard’s Top 200 album chart. The album was a key breakthrough for the group.\n\n“With the release of Dark Side of the Moon,” reported one Rolling Stone profile, “Pink Floyd abruptly went from a moderately successful acid-rock band to one of rock music’s biggest acts.”\n\nIn May 1973, when the album first came out, Rolling Stone reviewer Lloyd Grossman described it as “a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness.” He added: “there is a certain grandeur here that exceeds mere musical melodramatics and is rarely attempted in rock. The Dark Side of the Moon has flash – the true flash that comes from the excellence of a superb performance.”\n\nIn Pink Floyd’s Rock ’n Roll Hall of Fame description (they were inducted in 1996) it is noted: “The group carried rock and roll into a dimension that was more cerebral and conceptual than what preceded it.“…What George Orwell and Ray Bradbury were to literature, Pink Floyd is to popular music…”\n\n– Rock `n Roll Hall of Fame What George Orwell and Ray Bradbury were to literature, Pink Floyd is to popular music, forging an unsettling but provocative combination of science fiction and social commentary….” Describing the group’s Dark Side of the Moon, the Rock Hall added: “The album signaled rock’s willingness to move from adolescence into adulthood, conceptually addressing such subjects as aging, madness, money and time. From its prismatic cover artwork to the music therein, Dark Side of the Moon is a classic-rock milestone.” Others found Dark Side’s themes to be quite bleak, covering alienation, paranoia, and schizophrenia. “[T]he music was at once sterile and doomy,” wrote a reviewer for The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock `n Roll. But in the U.S., the Pink Floyd concert tours through the 1970s and beyond helped boost the group’s notice and album sales. One New York Times concert reviewer in 1987 wrote: “…Pink Floyd earned a singular renown in the 1970’s. The band transmuted gloom and cynicism into sumptuous anthems, taking ordinary rock tunes at s-l-o-w tempos and using long instrumental interludes for somber atmosphere…”\n\nHead Music. In the 1970s, Pink Floyd tunes became a favorite of pot smokers and drug users, and even into the 2000s the band’s music was still drawing that association. “As long as there are potheads, water beds and freshman philosophy majors,” wrote New York Times reporter Sia Michel in a 2006 review of a Roger Waters/Pink Floyd concert, “it [Dark Side of the Moon] will continue to sell thousands of copies every month.” Part of the eternal appeal of the album “is its trippy, vague seriousness,” wrote Michel. “It seems to be a concept album about the difficulties of staying sane in a corrupt modern world. It seems to encourage people to rebel. It seems to encourage people to maintain a childlike state of purity. It seems to address issues like mortality (“Time”), greed (“Money”), war (“Us and Them”) and madness (“Brain Damage”). In short, it sounds really deep when one is zonked out on drugs at 3 a.m. ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ helped create the template for what a Great Album is conventionally supposed to be: a thematic, sonically adventurous social critique with brain-frying cover art.”\n\nRecord label for shortened version (3:15) of Pink Floyd’s “Us & Them,” released as a single in March 1974.\n\n“Us & Them”\n\nOne of the songs on Dark Side – the seventh track on the album – is titled “Us & Them,” a song that runs nearly eight minutes and is regarded by many as an anti-war song. It was written by Richard Wright with lyrics by Roger Waters and it is sung by David Gilmour, with harmonies by Wright. “Us and Them” was also released as a single and for a time in March 1974, it charted just under the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 101.\n\nThe song’s origins date to 1969 as a piano and bass piece that Wright had come up with while working on a song for the soundtrack of the 1970 movie Zabriskie Point. It was then entirely instrumental, but film director Michelangelo Antonioni rejected the piece, calling it “beautiful, but too sad… it makes me think of church.” Antonioni was looking for a more raucous piece for a violent sequence in the film, and would later use another Pink Floyd song adapted for that purpose which did appear on the Zabriskie Point soundtrack and at the film’s cataclysmic ending.\n\nWright’s original piece, meanwhile, was resurrected and re-worked during the Dark Side Of The Moon recording sessions and it became the basis for “Us and Them,” with Waters adding lyrics. The finished version has hymnal organ qualities, rising choruses, and a couple of saxophone solos; one at the beginning and another toward the end of the song. “Us and Them” is one of the first times Pink Floyd made use of female backup singers – in this case, Liza Strike, Leslie Duncan and Doris Troy to sing background harmonies. The saxophone sections are played by Dick Parry. In December 2012, Roger Waters performed “Us and Them” during his set for the live U.S. hurricane benefit TV concert, “12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.”\n\n“Us and Them”\n\nPink Floyd (7:51)\n\n1973 Us, and them\n\nAnd after all we’re only ordinary men.\n\nMe, and you.\n\nGod only knows it’s not\n\nwhat we would choose to do.

Yes, ‘War’ serves as a metaphor for the separative mentality that modern day people have. But the ‘Down and Out’ stanza is about our refusal to help others in need, because we have ‘things to do.’ Pink Floyd is saying that for the money it would cost for ‘tea and a slice,’ an old man died. This song is about closed-mindedness and the majority of peoples’ inability to empathize with another’s plight, and to furthermore act on this inability, i.e. the general who doesn’t fight alongside his men.”\n\nAnother SongFacts.com writer – Aya, from Cairo, Egypt, writes:\n\n“I believe the song describes the tendency of people to partition themselves from those who are different, in cases such as war, politics, and social class. It’s definitely about war but I believe it also encompasses different races and social classes. It’s also alleged that the song was influenced by Roger Waters’ father dying in World War II…”\n\nAnd “Shane,” from Sandy, Utah, adding his point of view to the SongFacts.com forum on the song, writes:\n\n“Definitely one of the most emotional pieces on Dark Side. The sax does a lot. The lyrics are simple, but sad, powerful, and relatable. This song gives me chills.”\n\nThe final song on Dark Side – or rather, the last two songs that run together – are titled “Brain “Damage” and “Eclipse.” The lyrics of the first song have a repeating refrain that includes the album title, “I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon,” which is a reference to insanity.\n\n“Brain Damage”/ “Eclipse”\n\nDark Side Album: Ending Songs (5:54)\n\nPink Floyd, 1973 Brain Damage\n\nThe lunatic is on the grass\n\nThe lunatic is on the grass\n\nremembering games and daisy chains and laughs\n\ngot to keep the loonies on the path The lunatic is in the hall\n\nthe lunatics are in the hall\n\nthe paper holds their folded faces to the floor\n\nand every day the paper boy brings more And if the dam breaks open many years too soon\n\nand if there is no room upon the hill\n\nand if your head explodes with dark forebodings too\n\nI’ll see you on the dark side of the moon The lunatic is in my head\n\nThe lunatic is in my head\n\nyou raise the blade, you make the change\n\nyou rearrange me ‘ till I’m sane\n\nyou lock the door\n\nand throw away the key\n\nthere’s someone in my head but it’s not me And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear\n\nyou shout and no one seems to hear\n\nand if the band you’re in starts playing different tunes\n\nI’ll see you on the dark side of the moon.

The band had also called the “Brain Damage” track “Lunatic” during live performances, some recording sessions, and also when they had recorded a new suite entitled, “A Piece for Assorted Lunatics.”\n\nThe Real Insanity…\n\nThe opening line of the song – “The lunatic is on the grass” – was inspired by one of those “keep-off-the-grass” signs sometimes found at public places and well-manicured estates. Waters has said that the particular sign and patch of grass that fueled his using the phrase was at King’s College, Cambridge.\n\nThe ostensible suggestion in the tune is that those ignoring the signs and encroaching on the grass might indicate insanity, though as Waters has stated and the tune implies, the real insanity is not letting people on the grass.\n\nAuthor Jere O’Neill Surber has compared the lyrics of Dark Side’s “Brain Damage” with Karl Marx’s theory of self-alienation; “there’s someone in my head, but it’s not me.”\n\nWaters’ lyrics throughout Dark Side deal with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He is reported to have viewed the album’s exploration of mental illness as one illuminating a universal condition. Waters also indicated that he wanted the album to be a positive force – “an exhortation… to embrace the positive and reject the negative.”\n\nIn the 1987 book, Pink Floyd: Bricks in The Wall, by Karl Dallas, Roger Waters explained the meaning of the final words in the “Eclipse” portion of the song – “and everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon” – with the following:\n\nI don’t see it as a riddle. The album uses the sun and the moon as symbols; the light and the dark; the good and the bad; the life force as opposed to the death force. I think it’s a very simple statement saying that all the good things life can offer are there for us to grasp, but that the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from seizing them. The song addresses the listener and says that if you, the listener, are affected by that force, and if that force is a worry to you, well I feel exactly the same too. The line ‘I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon’ is me speaking to the listener, saying, ‘I know you have these bad feelings and impulses because I do too, and one of the ways I can make direct contact with you is to share with you the fact that I feel bad sometimes.’\n\nA lyrics poster excerpting from Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage” on the “Dark Side” album.",

Could you please take fans through exactly what happened that night and put the rumors to rest?\n\nJR: “Sure of course, you know people are mean man, some of the things that were said about me I wouldn’t say to my worst enemy.\n\n“I think it was three days after I signed with the UFC, which was my goal, I mean so many people had written me off so making a big come back and getting back to the UFC was really important to me, you know?\n\n“This is what actually happened. One of my friends had cocked the gun at the gym. We had to get back to practice, so the gun’s safety was set and it was put back in my backpack. When I get home I always unload my gun and make sure there isn’t a round in the tube, but the gun was jammed and the round would not come out of the pistol. Now this is a pretty big gun, it’s a 1911 Sig Sauer .45, I’ve only run one clip through it, so it’s not beat up or anything, it’s a brand new gun. So, I go to taking it apart, keep in mind I’m more or less a life-long gun owner, it’s not like I’m a novice. I was sitting down and putting together my UFC contract, putting the pages in order. I was watching The Bachelor (laughs) and I was eating blueberries, so I wasn’t fully concentrating on taking the gun apart like I should’ve been. So, when I took the gun apart the hammer was back, I had it on safety but for some reason my finger must’ve touched the trigger. The pistol was stuck so I had to pull on it in both directions with my hands. My hand was over the barrel, so the parts didn’t fall all over when I removed the slide. While I was trying to get the pistol apart it fired.\n\n“At first I didn’t even realize I had shot myself in the hand, all I saw was my leg. I know about the femoral artery so I was like f***. Believe it or not, the very first thought that went through my mind was Joe Silva. The reason he was reluctant to have me back is because I have been inconsistent, I pulled out of a lot of fights, and he told me that couldn’t happen anymore and then this happens. I know that’s crazy, but that was my first thought. So, I got up for some reason I was running around the house like a f***ing idiot, I was naked and with every heartbeat blood was spurting out of my leg. I must’ve been in shock because I actually sat on the couch thinking I could get it under control. As I sat there the blood was coming out of my leg with enough force to hit me in my face. It finally dawned on me that I had to wake my wife up, so I get up and open the door and I say ‘Lisa wake up, I just shot myself call 911’ and at that point I collapsed.\n\n“I was lying on the floor, and I had lost a lot of blood. The pain was gone and I started just wanting to go to sleep. That’s what happens when you’re dying, you just want to sleep. My wife, Lisa, pretty much had her fist in the hole in my leg trying to get the bleeding to stop. She (Lisa) was actually trying to get in there and pinch off the artery. At this point I didn’t think I was dying, I knew I was dying, I had accepted it. I asked Lisa to wake our son up so I could say goodbye to him. I was eerily calm, it was very weird. My son came out, now I feel horrible because of what he had to see. I was covered in blood, and my seven year old son sits down next to me. I gave him a hug. I told him that I was dying, but that I was proud of him and that I would always love him, and that I would always be with him. I can’t even imagine processing something like that at that age. He sat and watched the entire thing for over twenty minutes. He was there while the EMTs were working on me and he is up on the couch pulling his hair out. It was a f***ed up thing man, it was horrible. I’ll tell you what man during that staying alive was hard, I wanted to go to sleep and the guys working on me kept me awake. I mean honestly at that point I had made peace with dying. I was ready to go and when I finally lost consciousness I felt no worldly stress and an immense amount of love, and it was just a crazy feeling. Then I woke up in the trauma room and I was back in a lot of f***ing pain (laughs). They told me at one point my heart was beating like only 4 or 6 times a minute, it was really bad and I almost died but I made it through.”\n\nAR: Wow Joe, I am speechless. That is an incredible story, and I’m so grateful for you walking me through what must be one of the most difficult stories to tell. I really hope that after reading this that all of the rumors surrounding that night stop. I’ve got a feeling there are a lot of people out there that owe you an apology for what they may have said.\n\nJR: “Yeah dude you can’t believe some of the shit people have said to me or about me. I got a letter on my door after it happened that said ‘I wish you would’ve shot yourself in the head and your son would’ve saw that’ and on the letter was a picture they had made of me getting shot with a gun. What f***ing kind of a person would do that, you know? That’s just one example of the hundreds of terrible things people have said after this happened. I’m not saying that there haven’t been people saying positive things as well, but there are a lot of f***ed up people out there. I mean there was this one guy trying to re-create how I shot myself on YouTube, there were people saying I was trying to kill myself, and I can’t tell you how many times I read that this happened while I was trying to clean the gun. I wasn’t cleaning the gun. Nobody cleans a f***ing loaded gun!”\n\nAR: Yeah, I can’t wrap my mind around why there was so much negativity surrounding an already tragic event. Do you mind if I ask how your son is doing after being witness to that?\n\nJR: “My son has taken this very hard. He is suffering from PTSD now, but it was a delayed reaction. When I was in the hospital he kept saying to my wife ‘be honest, is my dad dead?’ he thought I was dead and that she was lying to him. He has really bad separation anxiety. He doesn’t want to leave my side. It’s really sad that he had to go through this. I have to be honest though, besides my son living through that, if there was a way to wave a magic wand and none of this happened, I was getting ready to fight and I had never been shot, I wouldn’t change what happened. This experience has had a profound effect on the person I am. It’s changed me right to the core.”\n\nAR: I can’t even imagine what an event like that can do to a person. Once again Joe, thank you for your candor. Now let’s focus on a more positive aspect of this story. From what I understand you are blowing away the doctor’s expectations and making a near miraculous recovery.\n\nJR: “I am absolutely surprising them. I was Medivacked out of here and my hand surgeon, who is the best in the country, looked at my hand, and he told my wife that I need two hands to fight and I only have one, so my career as a fighter was over. She never told me that, but I had seen my hand and it looked like something out of a fucking horror movie. Now that first day all they did was stabilize my hand and schedule the surgery for the next day. After the surgery the doctor said ‘I don’t know how it’s possible, he’s got a lot of metal in his hand, but he’ll be able to fight again.’ he wasn’t even sure how he was able to put my hand back together that well, but it was a total success. Once I knew I could fight again, I set my sights on December, but when I said that to the doctors they kind of laughed at me. Now I set my mind on December not only because the event is in Arizona, but I want to fight to prove to people that no matter what happens, you can overcome it.\n\n“The doctors are astounded by my recovery, for example, last week I had my grip strength tested. My right hand measured about 200 pounds of pressure for grip strength and my left was only at about 20 pounds, that’s horrible. Today I had it tested and it was at 110 pounds. I’m healing really fast. I was actually sparring today, I’m fucking sparring and it’s been just over a month. I also ran seven miles today, I’m doing things that they said would be medically impossible for me to do this soon after the injury.”\n\nAR: Joe, I’m sorry, did you just tell me you ran seven miles today?\n\nJR: “Yeah (laughs) yeah I did. I know it’s crazy because there was a hole blown in my leg a month ago, but yes I’m already running.”\n\nAR: Ok, wow! That is amazing. So earlier you mentioned fighting in December, is that happening?\n\nJR: Yeah actually it’s the first time the UFC has held an event in Arizona so I feel really blessed to be on the card.”\n\nAR: Do you know who your opponent is?\n\nJR: “I don’t, I really don’t. I talked with Joe Silva and he is waiting until I get my medical release from the hand surgeon and I see him Tuesday September 9th. The UFC will announce my opponent after that, but honestly I don’t care who it is. It doesn’t matter because once you come as close to dying as I have, what is there to be afraid of? There’s nothing.”\n\nThank you for reading. Please take a moment to follow me on Twitter – @LWOS_chirodoc.

  "latent_5229": "Jake Ballard has been the biggest surprise on a surprising Giants team. (AP)\n\nTrailing the Patriots by three points Sunday with about a minute to go, the Giants faced a 3rd-and-10 from their own 39. Eli Manning needed to make a play.\n\nWould he look for Mario Manningham? How about surging second-year receiver Victor Cruz? Maybe Brandon Jacobs or the speedy D.J. Ware out of the backfield?\n\nNope. Instead it was tight end Jake Ballard, an undrafted pickup out of Ohio State in 2010 and a virtual no-name heading into this season. Ballard managed to get behind Tracy White and leaped to haul in Manning's pass just before Patrick Chung intercepted it. The Giants gained 28 yard on the completion.\n\nFive plays later, on 3rd-and-goal from the New England 1, Manning found Ballard again. And again, Ballard came through, hauling in the game-winning touchdown.\n\nLast year, Ballard was relegated to the Giants' practice squad and his pro future seemed pretty uncertain -- Ballard, after all, caught just 34 passes over a four-year collegiate career at Ohio State. One of those grabs, however, showed his potential. It came on 4th-and-13 in the Rose Bowl, when Ballard went over the top of an Oregon defender to make a catch and set up a Terrelle Pryor touchdown pass.\n\nBut the emergence of Ballard -- not to mention Cruz, another undrafted find -- comes in stark contrast to some of the work done by the Giants' rivals in the NFC East.\n\nWhile New York stayed relatively quiet this offseason, allowing, among others, former starting tight end Kevin Boss to walk in free agency, teams like the Eagles opened the checkbook. Between that inaction and a rash of injuries, a huge host of people was ready to declare 2011 a lost season for the Giants.\n\nTurns out the Giants may have known something we all didn't. Boss, who inked a four-year contract with the Raiders, was benched last Sunday in a loss to Denver. Ballard, meanwhile, has 23 catches for 395 yards and three touchdowns this season, and has developed into one of Manning's most reliable targets.\n\n\"I always thought that I could be that guy,\" Ballard said Monday, according to the Associated Press. \"I didn't have an opportunity in college and last year I just battled to get on the practice squad and just got better every week. I eventually moved up to active. I always had confidence in myself and all I needed was a shot or opportunity. I am trying to make the most of it right now.\"\n\nThe Giants' climb to the top of the NFC East has been one of those classic \"Next Man Up\" tales so far, and Ballard certainly qualifies as a lead character in that narrative. New York lost first-round pick Prince Amukamara before the season to injury and have seen, among others, Ahmad Bradshaw, Justin Tuck, Osi Umenyiora, Hakeem Nicks, Michael Boley and David Baas hit the injury report as well, on top of losing valuable corner Terrell Thomas before the season even began.\n\nYet, at the midpoint of their season, the Giants sit 6-2 with a two-game lead over Dallas in the division.",

  "latent_5372": "THE white working-class men who are planning to vote for Donald J. Trump this November have been called many things: xenophobic, racist, misogynist, dangerously naïve. But even if those descriptions are true, it doesn’t mean these men were fated to be Trump supporters. Recent research in social science and history suggests that they might have been out front in the fight against Mr. Trump — if only the American labor movement weren’t a shell of its former self.\n\nWhen we think about unions, what typically come to mind are interest groups concerned with wages, benefits and working conditions. Scholars, however, have shown what everyone in politics knows instinctively: Unions are also political organizations that, under the right circumstances, can powerfully channel the working-class vote.\n\nA classic study on this subject was done by the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset. In a 1959 paper, he demonstrated that while the working class in most countries favors economic liberalism, it also displays an authoritarian streak. Using evidence from surveys, Mr. Lipset found blue-collar workers to be less committed to democratic norms like tolerance for political opponents, preference for rational argumentation over charismatic appeals and support for the rights of ethnic and racial minorities.\n\nThese tendencies, he claimed, were a function of lower levels of education and the isolation of many workers (for example, coal miners) from people who were different from them. Authoritarian attitudes also owed something to the work itself. Controversially, he suggested that manual work was at odds with the abstract thinking required to appreciate complex, pluralistic solutions to political problems.",

For the time being, Iranians will still need to apply in Abu Dhabi or Istanbul for visas for travel to the UK,' he added.\n\nYoung jihadi: A child is pictured on an ISIS-supporting Twitter feed wearing a balaclava and holding a sign saying 'God is greatest'\n\nA senior envoy was appointed as Britain's non-resident charge d'affaires last year, as relations improved after perceived moderate Hassan Rouhani was elected president. There has also been substantial progress reducing tensions over Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nHowever Mr Cameron rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis.\n\n'Britain believes in and I believe in step by step building our relationship with Iran because we need to have proper dialogue with that country.\n\n'We are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and I think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security,' the premier said.\n\n'Obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy, but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head, to rebuild that relationship.\n\n'Now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in Iraq, but I think what is happening in Iraq is certainly not a reason for not taking that step.'\n\nCharlie Cooper, an expert at the anti-extremist think tank, Quilliam Foundation, said the number of Brits signing up to fight in the Middle East would only grow.\n\nHe said: 'People are going from Britain and the EU to fight for ISIS - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will probably rise.",
  "latent_5697": "Annual off-the-record finance gathering attracts protesters from disparate groups, but they often have a similar goal in mind\n\nThe gathering outside the Westfield Marriott hotel in Chantilly included Ron Paul supporters, Occupy veterans, members of the 9/11 truth movement and Oath Keepers, a Tea Party-affiliated group comprised of military and law enforcement officers.\n\nCarrying signs with messages such as “Humanity is winning” and “Warning to secret societies: you are pissing off American patriots. We have machine guns also,” the 200 or so protesters could only be there for one event: Bilderberg.\n\nThe annual off-the-record gathering of global leaders in finance policy and national security was taking place behind chainlink fencing, No Trespassing signs and scores of local police. At the base of the driveway, the protesters congregated to denounce the meeting and shout at the occasional vehicles that entered and exited.\n\nParticipants in this year’s meeting reportedly include Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, Indiana governor Mitch Daniels, Henry Kissinger, senior officials from a number of the world’s largest banks, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a member of the Syrian National Council, among others.\n\nAccording to Bilderberg’s website, the forum is intended to foster a “broad cross-section of leading citizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and off-the-record discussion about topics of current concern especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international economy.”\n\nThe protesters were enthused by the turnout over the last two days. “The first day was already a record,” said one, Justin Wallis.\n\nAmong the most vocal participants at Friday’s rally was radio show host Alex Jones, who frequently led the demonstrators by megaphone. He argued the meeting constituted a violation of the law.\n\n“This is illegal. Government officials meeting and discussing policy with private interests in secret, or representatives of other governments, is a violation of the Logan Act,” he said, referring to a federal law first passed in 1799 that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.\n\nJones was confident the presence of protesters was having an impact on the attendees of the meeting.\n\nHe added that Bilderberg meetings allow high-ranking officials to make deals away from the public eye.\n\n“It’s mainly about big government contracts, for the big wigs,” he said. “And then the big wigs give the government people in the revolving door jobs.”\n\nPolice made at least one arrest on Friday when a young man stepped into the street, prompting condemnation from the crowd. On the whole, however, interactions between protesters and the police were peaceful.\n\n“It’s just a day of work,” said one officer, who insisted he was “not guarding anything”, but simply protecting the Marriott’s private property rights.\n\nBilderberg critics are often labeled conspiracy theorists, particularly due to beliefs that the meeting is a sinister attempt by the global elite to concentrate power and establish a global government.\n\nBut protester Max Dickstein insists the summit merits scrutiny.\n\nDickstein, from New York City, lived two blocks from 7 World Trade Center, which collapsed on September 11, though it was not struck by an airplane. His uncle was killed in the attacks. Dickstein was 12 years old at the time. Explanations for the collapse did not sit right with him.\n\n“I couldn’t really trust any narratives,” he said. “Two planes hit three buildings. That doesn’t add up to me. I felt an obligation to this movement,” he said.\n\nFor Dickenstein, the fact that so many powerful figures meet at Bilderberg in a fashion that lacks transparency leaves him wondering, “Do people at this meeting know something I don’t?”\n\n© Guardian News and Media 2012\n\n[Board room in black and white, via Shutterstock.com.]",
  "latent_5957": "Interim Director of ‘Save the Children’ UK for Ebola, Michael Von Bertele, yesterday told journalist at the Special Court that they are saddened by the criticisms levied on them for their operations at Kerry Town.\n\nThe Interim Director said 10 weeks ago, they were approached by the Department for International Development (DfID) to run the Kerry Town, and they made it clear to them that it was new to them, but however, they will try their level best to bring success to the country.\n\n‘We hope with support from WHO and UK National Health Services (NHS) we will be able to operate fully and help infected victims get proper care and hopefully get patients well and free of Ebola.”\n\nHe said the centre was opened on the 5th November and because they lacked the capacity, they had to start from scratch, to recruit staff from all over the world, which made them to start with five patients in the first week.\n\n“Four weeks now, we have 40- beds operating because we have nurses from Ministry of Health and 21 medics from the NHS. We are expecting more nurses from MOHS today, as we are on track to get the 80- beds running.”\n\nMichael Von Bertele averred that they have been discharging patients by the day and today Tuesday, they will discharge another two. We are doing all this quietly, as the lab we have is one of the best and we have started testing 150 samples a day and we will continue the upgrading, until it will increase to 300 a day.”\n\nHe said they are the only centre that accepts samples at night, so that the result can be ready by morning.\n\n“Currently we have admitted over 70 patients and presently we have 25 children and the youngest is two years old.”\n\nAlso the Interim Director averred that they are building a child care centre that was not part of the program, but they have to because there are many children that are vulnerable who need care during and after the Ebola.\n\n“Let me make this very clear to all that Save the Children is up for the fight and we will succeed as we go along.”\n\nThe Country Director of Save the Children UK, Rob Macgillivray, in his own remarks said they have never done this kind of program before, so they had to approach it step by step.\n\n‘Ebola is an unwelcome visitor, so we have to drive it out of Africa and the way we will do it is to do it with care and safely. I want to thank the Kerry Town Community as they have provided us with the highest number of employees.”\n\n‘We should always have it in the back of our minds that Ebola is not the only killer disease, as malaria, diarrhea are all killing people, so we must stand shoulder to shoulder with all to win this fight.”\n\nSpeaking about the centre for health care workers, he said the British Ministry of Defence is running it and they have treated over 20 patients from all over the country. We also want to acknowledge the support from other NGOs that have been working with us to win the fight, as 25 patients were admitted on Sunday in the centre.”\n\nThe Interim Director Michael Von Bertele said they have 250 local staff employed and they are being paid by Save the Children and also their hazard allowances to be paid by them. “We are on track to get all the 80 beds operational by end of the month as they are still employing local and international staff to work in the centre.”\n\n“I want to make it very clear that we have no regret in taking this challenge and we believe that it is in our own interest to work well and get the experience for the future. Also I want to be clear that DfID asked us to run the centre as well as President Koroma, even though they knew we had no experience before, but I want to appeal to all that we are very effective and we will continue to be until Ebola is kicked out of Sierra Leone”.\n\nTuesday December 09, 2014",
  "latent_6048": "A group of privacy advocates, who were notified by Twitter that their accounts were targeted in state-sponsored attacks, want some answers.\n\nTwitter’s decision to notify users when their accounts are targeted in state-sponsored attacks earned its share of praise. But Twitter’s silence in terms of specifics about the attacks—whether by choice or gagged by a National Security Letter—has foisted some anxiety upon those who were notified.\n\nA few of the estimated 50 recipients happened to be at the recent Chaos Communication Congress hacker conference (32C3) in Hamburg, Germany, and they commiserated not only over their mutual notifications, but also over a host of unanswered questions, foremost why were they targeted and by whom?\n\n“I mean, Twitter is pretty public, what is there to find for a state sponsored actor?” said Anne Roth, a long time privacy champion in Germany who works for the parliamentary inquiry in that country investigating the Snowden revelations and how they affect Germany.\n\nRoth, along with programmer and civil libertarian David Robinson of the Seattle Privacy Coalition, put up a website https://state-sponsored-actors.net/ that lists close to two dozen pressing and obvious questions the 32C3 gang of seven (the plea to Twitter has 30 signatories) had about their respective Twitter notifications.\n\nA request for comment to Twitter was not returned. Twitter is not alone in starting to alert users targeted by state actors. Facebook did so beginning its notification service in October, followed by Twitter on Dec 14 and Yahoo eight days later.\n\n“It’s just scary to think somebody wants to know something about me and I have no clue whether it’s the NSA, the German police or North Korea,” Roth said. Roth is no stranger to surveillance operations; in July 2007, her partner, journalist Andrej Holm, was arrested on suspicions of terrorism. Roth later learned the couple was under surveillance for more than a year and that Holm was implicated because language he used sociology publications matched patterns used by a group accused of a string of arson attacks in published rants about the attacks. Holm was released after three weeks, but Roth said they were watched for three years subsequently.\n\nLike Roth, most of the others who met at 32C3 are heavily involved in advocating for privacy and the use of online tools that would thwart surveillance efforts such as Tor. Others such as Robinson worked for privacy or digital rights initiatives such as Seattle Privacy Coalition, the French Cryptoparty and La Quadrature du Net.\n\n“It seems that most of the targets are some kind of activists (but not all), many are using Tor or are even related to the Tor project (but not all). I have no idea why I am a target.,” said Jens Kubieziel, a board member of TorServers.net who has also trained journalists and activists in privacy initiatives. “Maybe that’s enough to put me on some kind of list.”\n\nThe list of questions posed on https://state-sponsored-actors.net/ aim to cultivate answers about when the attacks happened, whether they’re ongoing, and what data the attackers were after beyond the phone numbers, IP addresses and email addresses of the targets. Those notified also want to know how the attacks were detected, what entities are behind them and more information about Twitter’s alerts, such as whether they’re manually or automatically sent, why the alert service was started now, and whether Twitter is working in concert with Facebook, Yahoo and Google.\n\nAndrea Shepard, a Tor Project committer, was also among those notified on Dec. 11 and present at 32C3. She like the others wants the mystery cleared up and wonders too whether the attackers could be after geolocation and source IP data, in addition to direct messages and possibly deleted tweets—more data than Twitter cautioned recipients of the original notification.\n\n“Twitter is frustratingly light on details other than this,” Shepard said. “What happened? What makes them believe it was state-sponsored, and if so, which state? What were they after? Most things on Twitter are public, after all. You don’t need to hack Twitter’s servers to scrape and archive someone’s tweets.”\n\nThe consensus among those who were notified is that Twitter’s silence is likely because of a gag order imposed by a National Security Letter, a powerful tool used by the U.S. government and law enforcement to compel telecommunications companies, technology providers and Internet service providers to turn over customer data. In December, a gag order on a 2004 NSL imposed upon Nicholas Merrill, owner of defunct ISP Calyx was lifted and for the first time the scope of a NSL was revealed. In Merrill’s specific case, the FBI not only sought detailed personal subscriber information, but browser history, IP addresses the subscriber connected to, email addresses, screen names and online aliases associated with the account, plus six months worth of online purchases. The FBI also sought a radius log, which includes cell tower-based tracking information.\n\n“However that [Twitter stays] quiet now does probably more harm,” Kubieziel said. “Some people suspect that Twitter might have received some gag order and isn’t allowed to say anything. However, even if it was only some bad algorithm which misjudged the situation, it would be better to tell the truth. I think it would help many of us to sleep better.”\n\nShepard put it more succinctly.\n\n“Mostly,” she said, “We just want Twitter to tell us what the heck is going on.”",

  "latent_6112": "What do venture capitalists want in an investment? If you have to ask, then you (and your business) are probably not a good candidate. And—just in case you don’t recognize it—that’s a reference to an old joke: When someone asks a Ferrari salesman how much it costs, the salesman answers, “If you have to ask, you can’t afford it.”\n\nI introduce this topic with that reworked joke because so many people say “venture capital” when they really mean “angel investors” or “outside investors.” Venture capital is very specialized. There are about 500 venture capital firms in the U.S.\n\nConsider this bar chart from the National Venture Capital Association. Notice that venture capital does roughly 4,000 deals per year, and the average is about $20-$30 million per deal. That includes initial investment and follow up. For more on this, read this article on the difference between angel investors and venture capital.\n\nAngel investment on steroids\n\nVenture capital wants all the qualities angel investors want, but bigger and better. The venture capitalists (also called VCs) focus on high returns for high risk. Just like most angel investors, they’re not looking just for a healthy company, or just dividends; they are buying percentages of ownership of companies with the intention of selling those percentages for 10, 20, 50 or more times what they originally invested. They make the money when they exit, which is what happens when they sell their share of ownership for real money.\n\nThe collection of investments a VC makes is called a portfolio. The companies they’ve invested in are in their portfolio. A successful portfolio grows at least 10x every two or three years, and that’s growth in real money, after exits.\n\nAnd it’s a hit business, so they can’t expect returns over the whole collection of companies. The winners have to pay for the losers. The National Venture Capital Association says about 40 percent of VC-backed companies fail, another 40 percent have moderate returns, and only about 20 percent are really successful.\n\nVCs invest in companies that have real possibilities for huge growth. They have to have very strong management teams. They have to be able to scale up—meaning get to high volume of sales—rapidly. They have to have something different, like a “secret sauce” or technology, that will defend them against getting eaten up by strong competition.\n\nConsider the deal size in the chart above, and think about what it takes to invest $20 million per deal. The venture capitalists (also called VCs) raise funds of hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars about every three years. It comes from larger organizations like insurance companies and university endowment funds, sometimes enterprises, and even some very wealthy individuals. Taking that money carries with it an obligation to invest that money in promising startups and emerging businesses.\n\nVenture capital is more likely looking at follow-up rounds, of more money, after the early money that invests in the beginning. Investors often talk about the “seed round” as the first few hundred thousand dollars, then “series A” comes for a few million after the seed funding has generated traction and credibility, followed by series B, and series C, each round getting bigger (meaning more money).\n\nWith investment amounts that high, the stakes are correspondingly high. So venture capital, these days, is usually involved in the later rounds, not in the seed rounds.\n\nIf you’re still not sure which funding source is right for you, or even what options are available when it comes time to secure funding, take a look at our infographic: 4 Ways to Secure Funding for your Startup\n\nDo you have questions about venture capital?

  "latent_6181": "John Farmer just posted a document from the 9/11 Commission files that strongly supports Norman Mineta's public testimony before the 9/11 Commission. Here is the link:\n\nhttp://forums.randi.org/showpost.php?p=6959886&postcount=131\n\nThe document is a Secret Service log from 9/11, and confirms that the Secret Service was tracking American Airlines flight 77 as it approached Washington on September 11, 2001.\n\nFarmer, who pursued the FOIA request for the 9/11 RADES radar data (released in October 2007) explains in his post that the radar data from 9/11 agrees perfectly with the Secret Service timeline. Farmer has the 9/11 radar data in his computer and has made it available to other 9/11 researchers.\n\nThe document was first made made public in January 2009 by NARA, along with many other 9/11 Commission files. Erik Larson posted it to Scrib in April 2009, where it may be downloaded:\n\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/14553471/T8-B16-Misc-Work-Papers-Fdr-Secret-Service-Timeline\n\nHowever, at the time, Erik overlooked the document's importance. Amazingly, it escaped notice for many months.\n\nIt may also be downloaded here (this is an easier download):\n\nhttp://bluecollarrepublican.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/t8-b16-misc-work-papers-fdr-secret-service-timeline.pdf\n\nI have just received confirmation that the handwriting is actually that of 9/11 Commission staffer Miles Kara, who was granted access to the original Secret Service documents during the commission's official investigation. Kara was not allowed to remove the SS document, however, so he copied it long-hand.\n\nNotice, this means that the 9/11 Commission had this information but chose to bury it, Why? Maybe to cover up for VP Dick Cheney? If someone has a better explanation, I'd like to hear it.\n\nI should mention, based in emails, that Miles Kara believes that Mineta arrived at the White House much later, and mistook United Airlines Flight 93 in coast track mode for AA 77. Kara also thinks that the Secret Service did not move Cheney to the White House basement until around 9:37 AM. I do not agree with Kara's timeline. In 2002, Karl Rove told MSNBC that immediately after GW Bush left the Florida classroom (i.e, at 9:16 AM) he attempted to reach Cheney by telephone, but could not because Cheney was at that moment being hustled to safety. Rove's timeline concurs with that of Richard A. Clarke (Against All enemies, p.2-5.) Clarke also has Mineta arriving at the White House sometime between 9:20 - 9:28 AM.\n\nIt is ironic that Farmer elected to post the document on the RANDI site - of all places - in the Lion's Den. From what I have heard, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over there, since it went up. In my view, it's about time that the RANDI cynics were made to eat their own ridicule. May they chow down and be transformed.\n\nFor those who need a refresher, here is Mineta's testimony:",
  "latent_6338": "Putin clarifies Trump comment and says America is the world's 'only superpower'\n\nVladimir Putin downplayed past comments about Donald Trump and spoke about the presidential election on Friday, adding that he accepted the US is probably the world’s sole superpower.\n\nLegal experts on Donald Trump: 'He lacks respect for basic norms' Read more\n\n“America is a great power. Today, probably, the only superpower. We accept that,” the Russian president said at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We want to and are ready to work with the United States.”\n\nAlluding to US-EU sanctions on Russia in response to its military actions in Ukraine, he continued: “The world needs such strong nations, like the US. And we need them. But we don’t need them constantly getting mixed up in our affairs, instructing us how to live, preventing Europe from building a relationship with us.”\n\nAsked about the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Putin again described Trump as a “flamboyant” or “colorful” man, using a Russian word – “яркий” – that can be translated with ambiguous connotations, from gaudy to striking to dazzling.\n\n“You see, it’s like I said,” Putin told his questioner. “Trump’s a colorful person. And well, isn’t he colorful? Colorful. I didn’t make any other kind of characterization about him.\n\n“But here’s where I will pay close attention, and where I exactly welcome and where on the contrary I don’t see anything bad: Mr Trump has declared that he’s ready for the full restoration of Russian-American relations. Is there anything bad there? We all welcome this, don’t you?”\n\nIn December, months before Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Putin called him “a colorful person, talented, without any doubt” and said: “It’s not our business to decide his merits, that’s for US voters, but he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race.”\n\nTrump has for months misinterpreted Putin’s comments as “a great honor” and clear praise, rather than consider the various meanings of the word.\n\n“When people call you brilliant, it’s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,” he told MSNBC shortly after Putin’s original comments.\n\nIn May Trump falsely described the comments as a compliment of his intelligence. “They want me to disavow Putin,” he said. “Putin of Russia said Trump is a genius.”\n\nTrump has proposed US-Russian cooperation regarding Syria, counter-terrorism and trade deals, and defended Putin’s record on eliminating a free press. The Kremlin and its allies have over 15 years dismantled independent news organizations, and the 2006 murder of investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya has also been linked by activists to Putin’s Kremlin. Trump told ABC in December: “it’s never been proven that he killed anybody.”\n\nThe businessman’s top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, was an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician who was fled to Russia after a 2014 revolution ousted him from office.\n\nPutin also spoke carefully on Friday about the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying he did not work much with her directly when she was secretary of state.\n\n“She probably has her own view of US-Russian relations,” he said.\n\nWho supports Donald Trump? The new Republican center of gravity Read more\n\nBut he praised her husband, former president Bill Clinton, saying: “We had a very nice relationship.\n\n“I can even say that I’m grateful to him for several moments, when I was making my entrance into world politics. On several occasions he showed signs of attention, respect to me personally and to Russia.”\n\nThe diplomatic remarks belie the cold and increasingly hostile relations between Clinton and Putin toward the end of her time in the Obama administration. In 2011, when he was prime minister of Russia and facing massive street protests, Putin accused the then secretary of state of fomenting dissent. Clinton’s state department, he said, had sent a “signal” and “support” to opposition leaders.\n\nOn Friday Putin insisted Russia does not interfere in other nation’s affairs, and that the Kremlin would be glad to work with any leader elected abroad.\n\n“We need to bring back trust to Russia-European relations and restore the level of cooperation,” he said.",
  "latent_6352": "Former U.S. Marine Mike Whiter smokes marijuana before he starts editing a video project at his home in Philadelphia.\n\nOne of the many problems with having a federal marijuana policy that’s premised on the paranoid politics of a bygone era — as opposed to the current consensus of medical science — is that many veterans who could benefit from medicinal cannabis are unable to access it. Even in the 23 states where medicinal marijuana is legal, a federal directive prohibits Veterans Administration doctors from prescribing weed to their patients — or even sharing their professional opinion about its potential utility. That’s because marijuana is still a Schedule 1 substance under federal law, a category reserved for drugs with a high potential for abuse and no known medical purpose.\n\nThis irrational policy forces many veterans with chronic pain to resort to more addictive opiate-based palliatives, while those with post-traumatic stress disorder are left without access to one of the most effective treatments for their condition.\n\nA new Quinnipiac poll finds that virtually everyone in America objects to this state of affairs. The university’s latest survey on the issue shows that American voters believe the VA should allow its doctors to prescribe marijuana to veterans with PTSD by a margin of 87 to 9 percent. On the broader question of whether all adults should be allowed to use medical marijuana if prescribed by a doctor, U.S. voters support access 89 to 9 percent. The poll finds that a majority of voters support blanket legalization of cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes by a margin of 54 to 41.\n\nThe DEA is reportedly considering removing marijuana from Schedule 1. If it doesn’t follow through, Hillary Clinton would be wise to endorse Bernie Sanders’s bill to reschedule the drug. It’s the right position both politically and on the merits.",
  "latent_6416": "The won, which has fallen about 40 percent this month alone, fell by its maximum 10 percent daily limit Friday soon after trading opened, though it recovered a bit to close at 1,710 to the dollar, compared with Thursday's close of 1,719.80.\n\nBut the recovery came at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in precious foreign exchange.\n\nThe central bank stepped in at the start of trading and spent an estimated $200 million buying won with dollars, but dealers said it would take far more than that to reverse the won's direction.\n\nThe won's drop helped push stock prices down more than 7 percent Friday to close at 350.68 points, the lowest since 1986.

''The country itself faces default, the won loses its value by 10 percent every day and nobody has great credibility with bank guarantees.''\n\nThe Finance Ministry said the nation would only have usable foreign exchange reserves of $3.2 billion by the end of the year. That compared with $6 billion reported to the International Monetary Fund on Dec. 2 and $10 billion announced Thursday.\n\nThe year-end figure is dangerously low by international standards, although higher than the $2 billion anticipated by the I.M.F. when it arranged last week's record $57 billion bailout for South Korea.\n\nThe Finance Ministry also said the South Korean Government was considering issuing its own foreign currency-denominated bonds abroad early in 1998 to secure urgently needed dollars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it was unclear how the Government would do that or when. It was also unclear whether such an offering would even attract foreign buyers, who have shown increasing reluctance to risk money in South Korea because of its plunging currency and rising debts. On Thursday, South Korea's biggest state-owned bank abruptly postponed a $2 billion bond offering because potential customers were demanding extraordinarily high rates of interest.\n\nThe postponement heightened fears that South Korea would become the first Asian nation to default on its debts since the region's financial crisis began this summer. The nation has an estimated $20 billion in foreign debt that must be paid by the end of the year and it has become increasingly unclear how it will pay.\n\nThe Government took some steps Friday to ease the crisis with little effect. The central Bank of Korea said it would pump 11.3 trillion won, worth about $6.6 billion, into the financial system to ease liquidity shortages caused by the suspension of business at 14 merchant banks.",
  "latent_6449": "A San Diego man is suing MillerCoors, claiming the company's Blue Moon beer isn't a true craft beer. NBC 7's Matt Rascon has the exclusive interview with the man behind the lawsuit. (Published Sunday, May 3, 2015)\n\nA San Diego man is suing MillerCoors, claiming the company’s Blue Moon beer is not truly a craft beer.\n\nEvan Parent claims MillerCoors deceived him by advertising their product, Blue Moon, as a craft beer produced in a small brewery when in actuality the product is made in large plants, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe product is marketed as “artfully crafted,” but, Parents says, the product does not qualify as a craft brewery product.\n\n“What this case is really about is people think they're buying craft beer and they're actually buying crafty marketing,” Parent's lawyer Jim Treglio told NBC7.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Parent says that despite the fact that MillerCoors has been brewing the beer for the past 20 years, “Defendant [MillerCoors] goes to great lengths to disassociate Blue Moon beer from the MillerCoors name. MillerCoors does not appear anywhere on the Blue Moon bottle,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nBy misleading the people who buy the beer, the lawsuit claims, they are able to charge up to 50 percent more for the product.\n\nParent said he cares about it because he is a beer aficionado and home brewer.\n\n“It matters to me because I'm a craft brew fan...I take care in where I spend my money,” Parent said.\n\nAfter learning the way the beer was made and marketed in 2012, he stopped purchasing the beer.\n\n“When someone's deceiving me into giving them my money for the wrong reasons that's upsetting,” Parent told NBC7.\n\nThe class-action suit was filed in San Diego Superior Court.\n\nA spokesperson for MillerCoors company says the lawsuit lacks merit.",
  "latent_6552": "It looks like the second quarter is going to be just another period of slow growth in the United States.\n\nDespite high hopes that gross domestic product gains might approach 3 percent, recent data indicate that the number, which will be reported Friday, will be considerably lower.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed, in its closely watched GDPNow indicator, on Thursday cut its forecast to 1.8 percent, a sharp reduction from the 2.3 percent expectation just a day earlier. Wall Street economists project the number to come in around 2.6 percent, according to FactSet.\n\nIf the Fed number is correct, that would put average growth for the first half of 2016 at just 1.45 percent, and just shy of 1.6 percent over the past four quarters.\n\nAs recently as May 31, the Fed tracker was looking for a growth rate of 2.9 percent, but that's been on a steady decline since.\n\nIt was the second time this week that the indicator fell; the first was Wednesday after durable goods orders came in lower than expected, while Thursday's reduction was based on the first release of the U.S. Census Bureau's new advance economic indicators report, which logs retail and wholesale inventories as well as foreign trade in goods.\n\nAtlanta Fed officials noted that the report showed negative impacts from exports and inventory investment.\n\nThe cut comes a day after the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policymaking arm, issued a more optimistic outlook on the economy.\n\nDespite the fairly positive FOMC language, particularly on the labor market, traders anticipate only a slightly higher chance of a rate hike in 2016 than they did before the meeting.

  "latent_6619": "(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nLast week, the Redskins announced an increase in season ticket prices at FedEx Field, noting that “General Admission ticket prices have increased for the first time in seven seasons, with most seats going up no more than 10 percent.”\n\nThis week, a team spokesman acknowledged that some “prime seat locations” were being hit with a 40-percent increase, but said that was the largest increase in the stadium.\n\nThat led to lots of e-mails to me from folks in the upper decks, who said their percentage increase was much larger than that. So here’s an explanation.\n\nWhen the Redskins removed thousands of 400-level seats to create party decks in 2011, they relocated the plan holders whose seats had been eliminated. Those plan-holders were moving from the cheapest end zone seats in the stadium — priced at $44 or $48.40 — to more expensive seats in the corners or on the sidelines. Of course, they weren’t moving by choice — their seats no longer existed, having been removed despite a season ticket waiting list the team says contains hundreds of thousands of names.\n\nAnyhow, the team promised these plan holders that their prices would not be increased until the team raised prices on other seats. So for the past two seasons, these plan holders were paying less than other plan holders located in their same rows and sections.\n\n“The past couple of years, they were getting a discount,” spokesman Tony Wyllie explained. “When they were moved [in 2011], they got upgraded and didn’t experience a price increase.”\n\nNow, however, prices are being raised, so the grandfathered price freeze no longer applies. And thus, many plan holders are seeing their per-game per-ticket price increase from $48.40 to $75.90, an increase of 57 percent. In all, Wyllie said, 806 accounts are affected by the elimination of those grandfathered prices.\n\n“The press release stated that most seats have increased no more than 10 percent,” a ticket office employee wrote to one of my readers. “In previous seasons the Ticket Office has honored the $48.40 ticket price since you were forced to move. This price would be honored until ticket prices increased. You are now paying the same price as all other season ticket holders in your section.”\n\nIt all makes sense. On the other hand, these people were not asked if they wanted to move, and could not have opted to remain in cheap seats. If the team is bragging that prices haven’t increased in seven years — meaning these people never saw price increases during their forced move — then it sort of has to acknowledge that hundreds of fans are now facing a 57-percent price increase from one season to the next. And some aren’t thrilled about it.\n\n“I find this absolutely ridiculous!” Cathy Pilkinton of South Riding wrote to me. “I was born and raised in NoVa and have been a Skins fan as long as I can remember. I have had season tickets for the past two seasons, mostly because so many people who were long time season ticket owners dumped their tickets after SO MANY LOSING SEASONS!! I really love going to the games. Especially last season, when we actually got to see a few home wins! And I cannot believe that after one (count it, ONE!) good season, Dan Snyder has allowed this much of a rate hike. It’s honestly unbelieveable. This is the reward for the loyal fans who have stuck with the Skins through so many bad seasons??…\n\n“I’m now not sure what I will do this year. My husband and I may opt to not renew our season tickets. If we do renew, we will be selling at least half our tickets to recoup some of the cost….I’m not sure what I can do about it besides dump my tickets and send a message to Dan. I WAS really excited about next season. Too bad this kinda took the wind out of my sails.”\n\nAnother fan wrote: “The comments and announcements about 10% and even 40% ticket increases don’t touch my upper level increase – in the end zone – of 57%. The removal of those seats was not my idea. This sounds like a typical Snyder maneuver to squeeze every penny he can out of his best supporters who stayed with the team this past extremely lean years. One 10-6 season does not a dynasty make. How many of my friends around my seats are seriously thinking of not renewing? I would guess as many as 15 seats in my immediate area could be turned back in….We are the fans with budgets, not the enclosed, club level or seats in the lower areas that go for over $100, as quoted in your article.”\n\n“Hard to believe,” wrote another 400-level fan. “We drive up from outside Charlottesville 10 times a year for the games….Those tickets have been in the family since Griffith Stadium.”\n\nEven some lower-level fans, whose prices are going up 40 percent, seemed unhappy.\n\n“For what it’s worth, I think this has finally tipped the scales for me,” one wrote. “After decades of great memories, I will not be re-newing our tickets. Thanks to Dan Snyder for ruining what once was a great family experience!”\n\n“Just when the Skins were making some inroads with their fans, they go and screw with the fans that have been with them the longest, through not only the good times, but more of late, the bad,” wrote another. “For me, I’m about 50/50 on dumping mine, particularly as it still includes the two backup filled pre-season exhibition shows.”\n\n“I am pretty appalled by this increase,” wrote yet another. “Just when we think that maybe the team has figured out how to treat folks, they turn around and pull this. Pretty unreal.”\n\nBelow, see a FedEx Field seating chart with examples of season ticket price increases for individual plan holders in 2013 (mouse over the image for details).",

  "latent_6736": "This past summer, the Florida Panthers joined the rush toward embracing numbers.\n\nIn August, the team hired Brian Macdonald as director of hockey analytics. Macdonald was formerly an assistant professor of mathematical sciences at West Point. Macdonald is a very bright guy. He has lent his stats-centric insight to this space on multiple occasions.\n\nStu Siegel, who once owned the Panthers, wonders whether hires such as Macdonald — comparables include Tyler Dellow (Edmonton), Sunny Mehta (New Jersey), and Tim Barnes (Washington) — have enough information to maximize their talents. It’s like hiring a superstar chef to cook for your restaurant and supplying him with mystery meat and wilted produce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There’s an arms race of getting people into organizations,” said Siegel, the former CEO and managing partner of the Panthers. “The reality is that when you talk about an arms race, there’s really no ammunition to work with.”\n\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nThe NHL is buzzing about the acceptance of advanced statistics such as Corsi, which tracks team and player shot attempts. A player who is on the ice when his team takes more shots than it allows, for example, has a high Corsi rating. Corsi approximates puck possession. Patrice Bergeron’s rating is always excellent, which means he’s driving possession while playing against first-line opponents.\n\nThe truth is there’s nothing advanced about these stats besides being global improvements over plus/minus, which should follow the dry scrape into irrelevance.\n\nA player’s Corsi rating still depends on human interpretation. Off-ice officials track shot attempts in real time from press boxes that are ZIP codes away from the sheets. Understandably, this creates messy data and variability from rink to rink, which muddies any conclusions made by analysts such as Macdonald.\n\nSiegel is chasing cleaner data. Siegel, who sold his Panthers stake in 2011, is the CEO of HockeyTech. The company’s flagship product is RinkNet, the scouting database used by most NHL teams. HockeyTech also includes ISS Hockey, the scouting service that includes the NHL, CHL, and NCAA among its chief clients, and NEXT Testing, which measures skating skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Nov. 12, HockeyTech announced its latest acquisition. LeagueStat, the program that compiles statistics for the AHL, CHL, and ECHL, is now part of the company.\n\nHockeyTech’s brands share a trait: information. Siegel’s vision is to build the quantitative side of hockey to complement the traditional qualitative wing of scouting, coaching, and institutional knowledge.\n\n“We can introduce interesting technology to gather those stats,” Siegel said. “Once those stats are gathered, then we can let the advanced statisticians go at it and see what kind of things develop. Things like Corsi and Fenwick, I personally think are stopgap measures. There’s a lot more information that’s way more meaningful than those stats.”\n\nCorsi is an upgrade over the numbers teams considered when Siegel became a part-owner of the Panthers in 2009. Siegel learned that hockey operations was signing and trading assets without much emphasis on statistics to gauge a player’s value or future production.\n\n“They were making decisions on paying people $5 million a year with information that was entirely qualitative,” Siegel said. “There were some quantitative things — goals, assists, plus/minus. That’s pretty much it. I was kind of amazed at how decisions were made.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeams such as the Panthers are using richer data now to inform their decisions. The data could be better.\n\nSiegel points to NEXT Testing, which uses radio frequency identification (RFID) chips to track player motion. The service works with the OHL and minor midget teams to run players through a 14-test program. By using the RFID chips in conjunction with timing gates, NEXT Testing captures more than 100 data points through the tests.\n\nFor example, the sensors can break down a 90-foot sprint into several segments. It measures a player’s acceleration off the line as well as his top-end speed. A drill that asks a player to skate forward and then backward notes how quickly he pivots from right to left or left to right. If he’s quicker one way, a coach might deploy him on his strong side of the ice.\n\nThe consumers of this data, as Siegel puts it, are upstream. Professional teams are continually chasing player intelligence. Such information would complement in-person viewings and video scouting.\n\nHockeyTech isn’t alone in enriching data. SportVU, which tracks player movement in the NBA, could do the same for the NHL. This would allow teams to precisely monitor variables such as shot location, shift length, and player speed. The result would be an information explosion that would be like upgrading today’s real-time stats system from a black-and-white set with bunny ears to a high-definition plasma.\n\n“We’ll get the opportunity to have precise measurements at every instant of the game,” Siegel said. “What comes out of that is going to make Fenwick and Corsi dinosaurs of the past. That stuff’s coming real soon. What will come out of that information will surprise everybody. That’s when the advanced analytics and doctorate statistics guys are really going to go to town on it.”\n\nTeams are already thinking differently. GMs are saying goodbye to heavyweights and replacing them with players who can play. Coaches are pulling their goalies earlier. Players with subpar defensive skills get mostly offensive-zone starts.\n\nThe next wave of intelligence will result in a revolution: stuff that could change the game.\n\nGMs could refuse to draft goalies in the first round because of the glut at the position. Coaches could station defensemen on their weak sides in the offensive zone to maximize one-timers. Teams could play with four forwards and one defenseman in five-on-five play. Michael Schuckers, associate professor of statistics at St. Lawrence University, thinks players such as Dustin Byfuglien who play forward and defense will be in demand because of their roster and strategic flexibility.\n\n“It may be something so drastic that no one’s even thinking about it,” Siegel said. “Maybe you have one defenseman, a midfielder, and three forwards. I don’t know what the results will be. But once the information gets here, not only will it make it more evident, but it will give teams the ability to experiment and have data to back it up. Who’s going to have the guts to experiment? We’ll find these things out.”\n\nStu Siegel wasn’t happy with stake in Panthers\n\nSiegel’s time as a team owner did not last very long. As co-managing partner of the Panthers, Siegel belonged to a group of 14 owners, who did not all agree on how the business should be run. In 2011, Siegel sold his minority share. Two years later, majority owner Cliff Viner sold the team to Vincent Viola.\n\n“There was a lot that needed to be done with the team, and I got tired of meeting with resistance from my partners,” Siegel said. “So I ended up selling my ownership stake back to them. Just wasn’t a situation I was happy to be involved with.”\n\nDuring Siegel’s watch, the Panthers hired current GM Dale Tallon. They also invested in their scouting staff. Draft picks during that time include current Panthers Erik Gudbranson, Nick Bjugstad, and Jonathan Huberdeau. Rocco Grimaldi, Florida’s second-round pick in 2011, is pushing for a full-time varsity position.\n\n“We were never going to be a cap team,” Siegel said. “We weren’t going to be able to compete effectively in the free agent market. We’d pick up a few free agents, but we’d never be the ultimate destination unless we overpaid. We really needed to build up our system and develop our own players. So we upgraded our scouting crew, knowing that was an investment in the future, and there was an emphasis on getting as many draft picks as we could and developing them properly. You’re starting to see the fruition of that.”\n\nCanadiens’ game could backfire in the long run\n\nBy their results, this has been a good first quarter for the Canadiens.\n\nThey entered Thanksgiving atop the Eastern Conference, which puts them in a strong position to make the playoffs. Max Pacioretty (10-8—18) has developed into a legitimate first-line left wing. Summer acquisitions Tom Gilbert and P.A. Parenteau are upgrades over Josh Gorges and Daniel Briere. They dumped redundant bottom-six anchors in Travis Moen and Rene Bourque. Carey Price (13-5-1, 2.34 goals-against average, .922 save percentage) is Carey Price.\n\nFor all that, the Canadiens are not a dominant team.\n\nAs of Thanksgiving, they had a plus-4 goal differential. That’s well off the pace of Pittsburgh (plus-27), the most complete club in the East. The Canadiens chase the puck more than they possess it. They’ve scored first in just eight of 23 games. The heart of their game is creating offense off the counterattack: crowding the house in front of Price, challenging point shots, and blowing the zone in hunt of odd-man rushes.\n\nAll of this is playing with fire.\n\nCoach Michel Therrien looks like he prefers a conservative approach. But going defense first isn’t safe. It requires Price to stop pucks in traffic and the defensemen to front shots, gain position on forwards, and be on the lookout for teammates streaking up the ice.\n\nThe Canadiens have the personnel to execute this strategy. Price is a top-three goalie. Gilbert, Mike Weaver, Andrei Markov, P.K. Subban, and even new pickup Bryan Allen are good at blocking shots. But it’s a high-risk formation. There are too many things that can go wrong — extended cycles, bounces off bodies — when the puck is regularly in the Montreal zone.\n\nThe Canadiens are a good team. Price and Subban are elite players. Alex Galchenyuk is growing into a committed version of Alex Kovalev. But their standing atop the East is not an accurate reflection of how good they are.\n\nProactive approach on Craig Anderson, Marc-Andre Fleury\n\nCraig Anderson and Marc-Andre Fleury would have been unrestricted next July. Ottawa and Pittsburgh would have been justified had they opted to let both goalies fight it out for their next contracts instead of re-upping them early. Both teams chose the latter. Anderson signed a three-year, $12.6 million extension on Aug. 25. On Nov. 5, Fleury signed a four-year, $23 million extension. Both teams are reaping the rewards of the faith they placed in their veteran goalies. Through 13 games, Anderson is 5-5-3 with a 2.43 GAA and .932 save percentage. Through 18 games, Fleury is 13-4-1 with a 2.19 GAA and a .924 save percentage. Both have histories of volatility, but they’ve been terrific this season. The security of having long-term deals is likely to be a factor in their performance. On the flip side, UFAs-to-be such as Antti Niemi and Viktor Fasth are playing for their next deals. Their play is not indicative of extensions of raises. Niemi is 7-7-3 with a 2.49 GAA and a .917 save percentage. Fasth is even worse: 2-5-2, 3.01 GAA, .900 save percentage. Neither San Jose nor Edmonton had much faith in their goalies. Their performance reflects their lack of trust.\n\nMartin Brodeur may not have enough saved up\n\nMartin Brodeur started 2014-15 on Friday by practicing with the Blues. Brodeur is with St. Louis on a tryout basis because of an injury to starter Brian Elliott. The Blues should not expect much from Brodeur. There was little gas remaining in Brodeur’s tank last season, when his presence kept the Devils from giving Cory Schneider the playing time he deserved. After six-plus months of not seeing NHL shots, the 42-year-old Brodeur will be in a tough position to get ready to be Jake Allen’s backup. Tim Thomas, 39 at the time, was in a similar spot after taking a year off and returning last season with Florida. Yet Brodeur’s belief in himself and his insistence to prove people wrong are pillars of what made him the best goalie ever. They are traits he shares with Thomas. We’ll see if they’re good enough to overcome the corrosive elements of aging.\n\nThis trade was a win-win\n\nIt’s hard to find a recent hockey trade that’s been as even for both clubs as James Neal being swapped for Patric Hornqvist and Nick Spaling. Neal, formerly Evgeni Malkin’s running mate, is riding with Mike Ribeiro and Calder Trophy candidate Filip Forsberg. The three forwards are Nashville’s top scorers. The shoot-first Neal had nine goals and five assists in 22 games. The Predators entered Saturday in first place in the Central, the most complete division in the league. Meanwhile, Hornqvist should be Sidney Crosby’s long-term right wing with Pascal Dupuis (blood clot) in danger of being done altogether. The right-shot Hornqvist is 5 feet 11 inches and 189 pounds, but he plays bigger than he is. Hornqvist has no fear about going to the dirty areas and hassling goalies. Hornqvist’s approach draws defensemen and forces wingers to sag down, which opens up space for Crosby to do his work. Hornqvist has 11 goals and 14 assists through 22 games. Spaling doesn’t have Hornqvist’s skill, but he’s dependable enough to earn work with Crosby and Hornqvist on Pittsburgh’s first line.\n\nLoose pucks\n\nNashville got a boost on Thursday with the season debut of Mike Fisher. The ex-Senator ruptured an Achilles’ tendon during the summer, making him unavailable for the first 21 games. The 34-year-old Fisher is a good defensive player and strong draw man. He still has some pop in his stick, too. He becomes yet another center in Nashville’s mix. The Predators were already legit before Fisher’s return . . . Alexander Khokhlachev didn’t show much in his three-game stretch with the Bruins. Khokhlachev’s line: 0-0—0, one shot on goal, 8:12 of ice time per game . . . Pittsburgh’s league-best plus-27 goal differential as of Thanksgiving is a good marker of the team’s top-to-bottom strength. First-year coach Mike Johnston preaches a sounder system than Dan Bylsma. Fleury has been airtight. Crosby and Malkin are pulling the chain. Kris Letang, Paul Martin, Olli Maatta, and Christian Ehrhoff make up the best top four in the league. If the Penguins can add depth at forward, especially given the loss of Dupuis, they’ll be tough to beat in the playoffs . . . On Thursday, Daniel Alfredsson will announce his retirement in Ottawa. Alfredsson had hoped to play one more year in Detroit, but a bad back put an end to that bid.\n\nFluto Shinzawa can be reached at fshinzawa@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @GlobeFluto .

  "latent_7014": "Can the Penguins Repeat?\n\nA hot start to the playoffs has the Steel City thinking back-to-back\n\nKyle Vandenberg Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 22, 2017\n\nImage via Fox News\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the 2016–17 season as defending Stanley Cup champions and had 12–1 odds to repeat, the fourth best chance in the league according to Bovada. After opening up a 3–1 game lead on the Columbus Blue Jackets, those odds have skyrocketed to 15–4 favorites via VegasInsider. The NHL hasn’t seen a repeat champion since the Detroit Red Wings in 1998. Now that they’ve advanced to the second round, can the Penguins be the first since then and defend their title?\n\nWhy They Will\n\nChampionship Experience\n\nNo one has won a Stanley Cup more recently than Pittsburgh, which has resulted in a roster laden with playoff success and experience. Fifteen players who have appeared in the playoffs for them this season had their names engraved on the cup a year ago, and that doesn’t count four injured players who have yet to appear through the first round. Each of them — Carl Hagelin, Chris Kunitz, Matt Murray, and Kris Letang — were critical to the Pens’ success in the playoffs last year, and Pittsburgh is hopeful that some of them will return for the playoffs this year (Letang has already been ruled out). Of those 19 combined players, 10 of them have 50 or more games of playoff experience and 5 have won more than one Stanley Cup previously. This is a team that is very familiar with the playoffs and, more importantly, with playoff success.\n\nHard to Beat\n\nThis offense speaks for itself. The high-octane Pittsburgh offense produced the league’s ​highest goal total this year (278), and were third in that category a year ago. They have remained consistently one of the highest scoring teams in the NHL. This style of offense has run many teams ragged trying to keep up, and they will surely employ this style throughout the postseason. This high number of goals also afforded them the fourth best goal differential per game league-wide. While they have suffered some injuries on defense and haven’t been all that impressive keeping the puck out of their own net, the Penguins have absolutely dominated the score sheet all year long. Add to that the fact that the Penguins have two goaltenders they feel can rely on, and it makes this team a tough out every night.\n\nWhy They Won’t\n\nThe Competition\n\nThe NHL Playoffs are nothing if not unpredictable. The Eastern Conference in particular has been competitive this year, with five teams in the playoffs gaining 100+ regular season points. Beating the Blue Jackets has Pittsburgh facing the winner of the Washington/Toronto matchup. Washington would make for a very tough opponent, having already won the President’s Trophy. There is a chance of facing the New York Rangers or Montreal Canadiens in the Conference Finals — two teams with plenty of experience and a lot to fight for — and that’s assuming they get through their respective series with the Ottawa/Boston winner. There aren’t many preferable matchups in this conference at all. And if they get to the Finals? The Western Conference hasn’t been predictable, but plenty of teams are getting hot at the right time and could be poised to steal a Cup this year. No one wants to play the hottest team in the playoffs.\n\nSuffering Through Injuries\n\nThe Penguins have handled their business in the first round despite injuries to four key players. Perhaps most notable of the four are the injuries to Kris Letang — the team’s top defenseman — and Matt Murray, who guided the team in net during last season’s cup win. For now, Marc-Andre Fleury has been effective in net. What we know about Fleury, though, is that he is anything but consistent, so the hope is that Murray returns soon enough that the team won’t feel the effect of a dip in Fleury’s production. Either way, platooning goaltenders has not always been the best way to operate a team, so Fleury’s good play raises more questions heading into future rounds.\n\nLetang’s injury may be a tougher one to overcome. There is no shortage of experience or playoff success on this defense, but Letang is by far the best defenseman the team has. Without him, they feel his absence on both ends of the ice. Letang holds down his end of the ice, but has also been a steady contributor on the score sheet throughout his career. The worst part? He’s already been ruled out for the entirety of the playoffs. There’s no replacing a guy of his talent level, so Pittsburgh is hoping they can get enough from the rest of their defensemen to get by.\n\nImage via NHL.com\n\nVerdict\n\nIt’s hard to disagree with the odds on this one. Sure, there are some injury issues. But getting through the first round in just five games allows the Pens to rest up for the games ahead. And yes, platooning goalies is a concern. But having two goalies who can perform is better than none, and right now they can have confidence in what they have. The Eastern Conference is a beast, but despite the fact that the Capitals had the best regular season record, they have struggled against a young run-and-gun team in the Leafs and have had to fight for each win they’ve gotten. The Pens had an easier matchup and as a result will get to rest up and wait for a tired team to meet them in Round 2.\n\nThe Penguins have the experience and determination to win, as they proved a year ago.

The first vessel is due to enter service in the early 2020s.\n\nDecades of work\n\nAn £859m initial development deal to build the combat ships, at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards on the River Clyde in Glasgow, was signed in February 2015.\n\nBut the project has been scaled back from an initial 13 ships to eight and hit by repeated delays, with concerns that jobs could be lost as a result.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Michael Fallon: Clyde yards to begin Type 26 frigates in 2017\n\nMr Fallon, who is visiting the BAE yard at Govan, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the announcement was a \"huge moment for the Clyde\".\n\n\"We are confirming we are going ahead with the steel cut next summer, quite a bit earlier than some suggested, of the first of the eight Type 26s that we pledged to in the strategic defence review last year,\" he said.\n\n\"This is work for the next 20 years building these eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates.\"\n\nThe defence secretary added: \"We also hope to conclude, before Christmas by the way, the negotiations on the two offshore patrol vessels that were also promised in the strategic defence and security review last year, which will help fill in the gap before the work on the Type 26 starts.\"\n\nThe promise of new Royal Navy orders to secure the Clyde shipbuilding industry was made before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.\n\nThe number of planned new frigates was later scaled back from 13 to eight in the Strategic Defence Review, with the MoD now planning to build five smaller Type 31 warships in addition to the Type 26 fleet.\n\n'Disappointing' delays\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcement but pointed out that it was not the same deal that was promised before the referendum.\n\n\"The promise hasn't been kept in full, so the number has reduced and there has been a real delay in getting this work started,\" she said.\n\nMs Sturgeon described the delay as \"regrettable\" and \"disappointing\" and said it had been a source of anxiety for the workforce at both yards.\n\nShe added: \"Nevertheless, it's a welcome announcement and I really hope now that it doesn't slip any further and that the commitment that has been made today is delivered in full.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Steel cutting will begin next year at the Clyde shipyards\n\nGary Smith of the GMB union said it was \"fantastic news\" for the upper Clyde shipyards - though he said the UK government had not delivered on all its promises.\n\nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"We were told there was going to be a 'frigate factory' built on the Clyde that would allow us to deliver ships more efficiently.\n\n\"It would perhaps have given us the facility to build ships that could be exported.\n\n\"And Michael Fallon in truth was dragged kicking and screaming to this announcement today after we exposed the fact that his government did plan to move some of the work originally planned for the Clyde, down south.\n\n\"But cutting through it all, great news for the workforce and great news for the economy in greater Glasgow as well.\"\n\nThe Unite union said the announcement safeguarded shipbuilding at the two Clyde yards \"for the next generation\".\n\n'Safeguarding skills'\n\nThe union's regional coordinating officer, Kenny Jordan, said: \"Our members have been living with uncertainty for too long and this is a testament to the lobbying and campaigning that they have done over the last two years.\n\n\"We have a workforce at Govan and Scotstoun with world-class skills who are eager to get on with the job - and eager to see more work coming in the future.\n\n\"This announcement secures the future of shipbuilding on the upper Clyde, supports skilled jobs in manufacturing and will provide opportunities for apprentices and trainees, making sure that we safeguard skills for the next generation.\"\n\nThe defence secretary said design work on the Type 31s was ongoing and he was unable to promise the work would come to the Clyde yards.\n\nBut he told the BBC that BAE systems would be in \"pole position\" to win the orders.\n\nWork on the frigates was originally due to start this year. Unions raised concerns in April that up to 800 jobs could be lost at the Clyde shipyards if there was any backsliding on commitments.\n\nThe yards currently employ more than 2,500 people, though hundreds of jobs have been lost over the past two years as BAE has reduced shipbuilding capacity.\n\nScottish Economy Secretary Keith Brown also welcomed the news as a \"tribute to the skilled and dedicated workforces at Govan and Scotstoun\", but criticised the \"continuing wait\" for the MOD's basing review in Scotland to be completed.\n\nThe Scottish government has written to Mr Fallon asking for a meeting to discuss plans for base cuts in Scotland, with sites like Fort George and Kinloss facing an uncertain future.\n\nTimeline: Type 26 frigates and the Clyde\n\n25 March 2010: BAE signs £127m contract to design Type 26 frigates for Royal Navy\n\n11 October 2010: Sixth and last of the Royal Navy's new Type 45 Destroyers launched on the River Clyde\n\n6 November 2013: Scottish Secretary warns that plans to build new Royal Navy vessels in Glasgow could be endangered by a Yes vote in independence referendum\n\n1 December 2014: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirms the UK's new warships will be built on the Clyde\n\n20 February 2015: Ministry of Defence signs £859m initial development deal on Type 26 Frigate.

  "latent_7104": "An e-mail exchange this morning with a pro-minimum-wage economics professor who not only wishes to remain anonymous but who asks that I not even quote him directly prompts the following thought about minimum-wage proponents’ belief in miracles.\n\nWorkers with a great deal of work experience earn, on average, much higher wages than do workers with no or only very little work experience. Given this reality, suppose that Congress, with the support of President Clump, enacts the following statute: \"No one with less than five years of work experience is allowed to be employed for pay.\"\n\nAt the signing ceremony for this diktat, Pres. Clump triumphantly proclaims that\n\nContrary to the predictions of naysayers and free-market ideologues, this legislation will cause no one to lose a job. Instead, it will simply give to all workers — even to 16 year olds! — a minimum of five years of work experience. There is nothing that a powerful and determined government with good intentions cannot do!\n\nImmediately, however, everyone reacts with astonishment at the stupidity of Congress and the president. Even editorialists and columnists for the New York Times observe that, as one especially famous columnist observes, “Many workers simply don’t have five years of work experience. They will remain unemployed.”\n\nIn response to this surprising opposition from their “Progressive” friends, Congress and Pres. Clump add the following amendment to the above legislation: \"Each and every worker in America is hereby decreed to possess at least five years of work experience.\"\n\nEditorialists and columnists for the New York Times breathe a sigh of relief and declare that this amendment ensures that all is now right with this legislation! It will work only good for American workers!\n\nIn contrast, editorialists for more skeptical outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal and the Orange County Register remain flabbergasted that anyone believes in such miracle-working.\n\nIf you, dear reader, think the above hypothetical is silly, recognize that minimum-wage legislation is a very similar attempt by government to work a miracle through legislative decree.\n\nIn markets in which workers are free to quit and to seek out new jobs, and in which employers — long-established and just starting — are largely free to compete for workers, each worker is worth to employers what that worker is worth. That is, in such markets, each worker’s hourly worth to employers equals the value that he or she adds each hour to his or her employer’s bottom line. A worker whose skills and other attributes enable him to add at most only $7.00 per hour to any employer’s revenues will not be hired at an hourly wage above $7.00 per hour. All such workers will remain unemployed (in the formal sector) today at the current national minimum wage in the U.S. of $7.25 per hour.\n\nSupporters of the minimum wage who insist that it destroys no employment opportunities for any workers believe in the following miracle: when government decrees that each worker shall be paid at least $7.25 per hour, all workers are thereby miraculously infused with the skills and work-experience necessary for each of them to produce for employers at least $7.25 per hour.\n\nThe only difference separating minimum-wage legislation from the above hypothetical diktat lies in the wording of the incantations. Minimum-wage statutes and regulations specify the minimum that each worker must be paid, while the above hypothetical diktat specifies the minimum amount of experience (a good proxy for skill) that each worker must possess. Both instances of sorcery pretend to miraculously alter the same reality — namely, the productivity of low-skilled workers.\n\nCross-posted from Cafe Hayek.",
  "latent_7161": "The 2008 Cory Barlog-led Mad Max Game that Never Happened\n\nMore details have emerged about the game that almost was when the director of God of War joined forces with Mad Max creator George Miller.\n\nIndie developer Dan Graf is currently achieving great things with his mobile title Rodeo Stampede - which has now passed 50 million downloads - but his career stretches back over a decade. It includes time spent not only making games, but also teaching and making films. During a recent episode of the GameHugs podcast, Graf spoke in-depth about his origins as a game developer and some of the incredible places it has taken him. One of those places included Dr. D Studios, the company founded by Mad Max creator George Miller.\n\nGraf was introduced to Miller by a fellow staff member while working at the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS) in 2008. Following the blockbuster success of his film Happy Feet, Miller had just founded Dr. D Studios, a digital animation house. During the podcast, Graf detailed how he came to work for Miller, and their initial meetings prototyping a Mad Max game. Here is what he had to say:\n\nHow did you meet George Miller?\n\nI was very lucky to get an introduction through one of the staff members at AFTRS. George wanted to meet me partially because of my background making games, but more because I was sitting in this space between games and film. And what I did for George was I showed him Shadow of the Colossus (PS2 – Team Ico). I said, “I didn’t make this, it was made by someone way cooler than me, but I hope you can see the potential here for the way film and games can converge.”\n\n[I showed it to him] because it is pure cinema, but it is interactive. It’s David and Goliath; it’s Godzilla; it’s King Kong - yet it is interactive. It has all the nuance in camera direction, score and emotional impact. So I said to him, “this is the future of games, you should do this with Mad Max.” And George said, “stay awhile, let’s have lunch.” Which then turned into dinner and at the end of it all he shook my hand and asked, “when do you finish film school?” To which I answered, “whenever you want George!”\n\nSo that was a wonderful opportunity as he offered me a job. But I forgot about games after I immediately started as I was so sure he was going to make a Mad Max game. And he invited me to some meetings where I met Cory Barlog, the God of War director, and I thought, “this is really going to happen, they are going to make this game and it’s going to be massive.” But none of that eventuated while I was there. None of it eventuated in Australia. It all happened overseas and it happened a long time after I left [in 2011].\n\nSo this was Dr. D Studios right, part of KMM?\n\nKMM [an Australian film production company] existed when I joined the company and was about 30 people. Dr. D was formed shortly afterwards, and I was shifted across to that like most other people. Then Dr. D grew from 30 people to 600 people, and that was an interesting shift to be part of.\n\nIt was always difficult for me to establish the difference between KMM and Dr. D; was Dr. D a game studio?\n\nDr. D was exclusively a film production company part owned by George Miller, part owned by a tech company called Omnilab. It was set up with a lot of ex-Animal Logic people, and I think a lot of the baggage and negative head space of people who wanted to leave behind something they didn’t like came to Dr. D and it festered. Founding a company on peoples’ disenchantment and displeasure in a different company is not going to create a good foundation.\n\nWhere to Next?\n\nLooking for a great read? Author Nicholas Abdilla has just released his new sci-fi novel Adam Exitus through Amazon and iTunes today, and it’s one for sci-fi fans. The first entry in what will be a 10-part series, it’s based on the author’s own original comic strip, and it’s reminiscent of the work of Philip K. Dick and Timothy Zahn.

  "latent_7185": "[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M867CbuPROU&w=620&h=315]\n\nLet’s start with some honesty: if you really want to ever achieve “work-life balance,” you need to come up with a new term for it. Re-brand that shit! Here’s the essential problem:\n\nRank-and-file employees hear that and think “That’s an unicorn concept fueled by buzzwords.”\n\nManagers hear that and think, “Wait, people are gonna work less? But we have deliverables to hit…”\n\nBoth sides are frustrated.\n\nVery few companies know how to get this idea/concept right, even though Towers Watson did a study on global workforces just last year that found something pretty simple and basic: if you do it right, it’s basically the third most valuable aspect of your company’s success.\n\nThink about it like this: let’s say you make $80K, give or take. Your company is really good and nice to you and understands you have a life and a family. Some Fridays, even non-summer, you’re out by 2pm. Some company comes along and gives you $100K as an offer, but you meet the person who’d be your direct boss and they seem hard-driving and Type-A.\n\nAre you going to take the extra $20,000, or stay where you are? Most people would probably stay. I would, personally. Admittedly no one is about to come along and offer me $100K after reading this blog, but you know, this is a hypothetical.\n\nSo for the first company — the one paying you $80,000 — this is a strategic advantage in a way. If you’re a good employee with organizational knowledge, your loss is a hit. (No one knows the exact bottom-line hit in terms of a specific dollar figure, but it’s a hit.) What’s more is … someone’s gonna rush to backfill you and probably whiff on the hire, and then your company’s shot in terms of effectiveness at that spot.\n\nIn this way, then, thinking about work-life balance (or whatever term you come up with) could actually be a strategic advantage for companies. Most people don’t think this way. They think they need to compete on margins or slashing headcount or customer service or marketing or CRM or whatever. They don’t think an advantage can lie within their people and how they treat their people. I don’t get this, but I’m also not a CEO and probably never will be … so what do I know?\n\nCali Williams Yost wrote this article for Harvard Business Review recently; she also wrote this book on “making what matters happen to you every day.” (A good concept, no?) The article she wrote for HBR is good, although it’s a lot of stuff to unpack about the different tests her company ran with 40 employees at another company. Here’s the broad takeaway:\n\nFind a new term (hey, we agree there!)\n\nDetermine the strategic relevance of workload in the scope of an employee’s life\n\nMake a pilot plan\n\nThe third one is a good idea, maybe even a great idea. We live in this era where we’re supposed to be testing and measuring and analyzing everything, even if people are mostly just lip-servicing that idea and not really doing it. (You can actually improve your week-to-week life with simple analytics, as an aside.) If we’re serious about data and knowledge and testing, and we’re subsequently serious about our employees, why don’t we stop and design a pilot program around their balance?\n\nThe thing is, people mostly buy into the idea that work is virtue and they want to do well there … but oftentimes they have competing commitments, like “Go to the grocery store” or “Some family thing,” and they struggle to find a way to balance the now now now focus on deliverables that a lot of managers have with the things that actually matter in life (you know: your friends, your loved ones, time with them, experiences, etc.)\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpIKXLLYYM&w=620&h=315]\n\nWe talk a lot in the modern era about finding “purpose” at work, right? Companies think they get it, but they often don’t. We often don’t even treat our employees like adults; we treat them like children and assume if they’re not at a desk, they’re slacking off. This is dumb.\n\nThink about it this way if you’re a manager, right? Do you want someone happy and generally productive working for you, or someone bitter and sad and frustrated? Probably the former, right? Well, how do you help someone be happy/productive within the context of work? It’s not that complicated: you give them freedom and you let them work on the areas where they feel strong. It’s not rocket science. Some companies get it.\n\nPoint being: your employees are your internal customers. In many ways, their happiness is more relevant than your external customers, even though most leaders/managers totally don’t get that. So if you treat your internal employees better, that can be a real strategic advantage. But I’m sure as you’re glancing at this post, you have to run to a 1:30 about Q3 margin projections, so … you probably don’t have time.",

On Friday, CNN anchor Don Lemon cut off pro-Trump guest Paris Dennard live on air, and not long after Trump tweeted, “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” Come Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus got into a heated debate with Chris Wallace on Fox News, of all venues.\n\nskip - Trump\n\nThe sense of panic and anger in the mainstream media, the conservative Fox News included, is reasonable. The accusation of “fake news” or “lying press” has an ominous precedent, tracing back to the history of the German phrase “Lügenpresse.” (At a campaign rally in October 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio, the Atlantic’s Rosie Grey even caught two Trump supporters on tape using the original German word. “Lügenpresse! That’s what you are,” one white man shouts, coaching another on how to say the term, and elaborates: “You’re all in bed with the Clintons.

In January 2015, some 25,000 protesters attended a PEGIDA march in Dresden, chanting “Luegenpresse, halt die Fresse\" (“shut up, lying press”).\n\n\"Luegenpresse\" subsequently earned the notorious \"Unwort des Jahres\" (Non-Word of the Year) dishonor given out annually by a German linguists' panel of experts.\n\nAccording to Reuters, previous non-words of the year include 2011’s \"Doener-Morde\" (Doener killings), referring to a string of neo-Nazi killings of people of Turkish origin.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close\n\nWar on the media\n\nTrump had waged war on the press throughout his presidential campaign, featuring multiple high-profile feuds including with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly and CNN, which he dubbed the “Clinton News Network.” But critics and many supporters too were dismayed when he didn’t change tune once in office. In fact, the administration doubled down on much of Trump’s anti-media rhetoric.\n\n“The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile,” Steve Bannon told the New York Times in late January. “The media here is the opposition party.”\n\nTrump’s recent rally in Melbourne, Florida primarily focused on attacking the media, after a particularly tough week which saw the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\n\n“I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news,” Trump began. “The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases.”\n\nPriebus, on ‘Fox News Sunday’ with Chris Wallace, repeated this claim, calling media reports “Total garbage. Unsourced stuff, \" and suggesting that the media doesn’t choose the right stories to cover. \"I think you should be concerned about mainstream news outlets that are acting like Washington daily gossip magazines,\" continued Priebus, who had been viewed as the Republican establishment’s representative in the Trump administration, a relative voice of reason. \"But you don't get to tell us what to do, Reince,\" Wallace shot back.\n\nCNN anchor Don Lemon too had enough of it over the weekend, telling his guest Paris Dennard, a former George W. Bush official, “Please stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story. If you don’t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don’t come on and participate. But don’t call them fake because you don’t agree with them. Go on.”\n\nWhen Dennard doubled down, insisting that \"this is a fake news story,\" Lemon cut him off and abruptly ended the segment.\n\n“OK, Paris, thank you very much everyone,” Lemon said. “Thanks everyone, thanks for watching.

  "latent_7507": "Fact: If there's one way to instantly up your burger game and join the big leagues, it's to grind your own meat.\n\nGet the Recipe Thick and Juicy Home-Ground Grilled Cheeseburgers\n\nFreshly grinding meat, whether you do it yourself or ask a butcher, allows you complete control over flavor by blending different cuts (who knows what bits and pieces are in pre-ground packaged beef?). It offers superior texture with more loosely packed patties and a more open, juice-trapping structure. Finally, it's far safer, as any bacteria and other baddies introduced to the middle of a beef patty don't have a very long time to start multiplying inside the meat.*\n\n*You can even briefly dunk the cut whole into a pot of boiling water to sterilize it before grinding.\n\nBut here's a question I get a lot: How coarsely should you grind that meat? I tested meat ground to two distinct levels with three different types of burgers to find out.\n\nThe Grind\n\nMy KitchenAid Meat Grinder Atachment comes with two different grinding plates: one about 3/8ths of an inch, and the other 1/4-inch. For this testing, I used plain beef chuck which I cut into 1-inch cubes before chilling in the freezer (along with the rest of the grinder) and running through the grinder.\n\nI started by grinding all of it through the 3/8ths-inch plate...\n\n...then re-ground half of that mix through the 1/4-inch plate.**\n\n**The photo makes it look like the coarsely ground beef was much fattier, but that was only the beginning of the coarse batch, which I then mixed together thoroughly with the rest of the grind to evenly disperse the fat. Both grinds had identical fat contents in the end, or at least as close as I could manage to get identical.\n\nTest 1: Smashed Patties\n\nFor my first test, I cooked two identical four-ounce pucks of beef using my Smashed Burger technique.\n\nThe pucks of beef were placed in a hot carbon steel skillet, then pressed down firmly with a spatula to brown before being scraped up, flipped, cooked briefly on the second side, and slipped into a bun.\n\nWhile both patties ended up juicy and fatty inside (it's hard not to when a thin patty like that sizzles in its own rendered fat), the finely ground patty had a superior crust.\n\nWith smashed patties like these, the goal is really to maximize contact between the meat and the pan in order to encourage as much Maillard browning as possible before the meat becomes hopelessly tough. Because the finely ground meat is more malleable and less coarse, you can smash it more easily, improving contact, and thus browned flavor.\n\nTest 2: Pan-Seared Fatter Patties\n\nFor this round, I formed larger six-ounce patties, which I cooked in a hot cast iron skillet, flipping the patties every 30 seconds or so until they developed a nice crust and a medium-rare interior (I measured them with a thermometer and brought them up to 125°F before pulling them out of the pan).\n\nIn this case, the coarsely ground patty won out. Both were plenty juicy, but the fine-ground patty was a little too dense for my taste—I want my burger to almost fall apart in my mouth, filling it with its warm, beefy juiciness.***\n\n***I just read that sentence again and can't decide if it's something I want or something completely ew. Probably want.\n\nThe coarse patty, on the other hand, had nice meaty chunks in it with pockets of juices that oozed as I chewed.\n\nThat's a fine looking patty right there!\n\nTest 3: Grilled\n\nThis time around I formed the same six-ounce patties (making sure to make a slight indentation in them to keep them flat as they cook) and grilled them over a bed of hot, hot coals to the same medium-rare internal temperature.\n\nI was surprised at how different the internal results of the grilled patties were from the pan-seared. I mean, I know they come out different because on a grill juices and rendered fat drain away from the patty instead of collecting like they do in a pan, but the difference was pretty striking.\n\nTasting it made the difference even clearer. Grilling simply leads to dryer patties than pan-searing, though of course there's no other way to get that smoky grilled flavor into meat.\n\nThe coarsely ground patty was the driest of the bunch, despite its pink medium-rare center.

  "latent_7564": "1.9k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nThe mainstream media is absolutely giddy that the U.S. unemployment rate has hit a “four-year low” of 7.7 percent. But is unemployment in the United States actually going down? After all, you would think that it should be. The Obama administration has “borrowed” more than 6 trillion dollars from future generations of Americans, interest rates have been pushed to all-time lows, and the Federal Reserve has been wildly printing more money in a desperate attempt to “stimulate” the economy. So have those efforts been successful? Well, according to the mainstream media, the U.S. unemployment rate is falling steadily. Headlines all over the nation boldly declared that “236,000 jobs” were added to the economy in February, but what they didn’t tell you was that the number of Americans “not in the labor force” rose by 296,000. And that is how they are getting the unemployment rate to go down – by pretending that huge numbers of unemployed Americans don’t want jobs. Sadly, as you will see below, the truth is that the percentage of working age Americans that have a job is just 0.1% higher than it was exactly three years ago. And we have not even come close to getting back to where we were before the last economic crisis. For example, more than 146 million Americans were employed back in 2007. But today, only 142.2 million Americans have a job even though our population has grown steadily since then. So where in the world is this “economic recovery” that they keep talking about?\n\nAt this point, the “unemployment rate” has become so meaningless that it really isn’t even worth paying much attention to. If you really want to know what the employment picture looks like in the United States, you need to look at the employment-population ratio.\n\nAs Wikipedia tells us, many economists consider the employment-population ratio to be far superior to other measurements of employment…\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development defines the employment rate as the employment-to-population ratio. The employment-population ratio is many American economist’s favorite gauge of the American jobs picture. According to Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist for Capital Economics, “The employment population ratio is the best measure of labor market conditions.” This is a statistical ratio that measures the proportion of the country’s working-age population (ages 15 to 64 in most OECD countries) that is employed. This includes people that have stopped looking for work.\n\nA chart of the employment-population ratio in the United States over the past several years is posted below…\n\nAs you can see, the percentage of Americans with a job fell from about 63 percent to below 59 percent during the last economic crisis. Since that time, it has not risen back above 59 percent. This is the first time in the post-World War II era that we have not seen the employment rate bounce back following a recession. At this point, the employment-population ratio has been below 59 percent for 42 months in a row.\n\nYes, we should be thankful that things have stabilized, but as you can see there has been no recovery. The percentage of Americans with a job is essentially exactly where it was three years ago. Despite the trillions of dollars that the U.S. government has borrowed, and despite the reckless money printing that the Federal Reserve has been doing, the employment situation in the U.S. has not turned around.\n\nData for the employment-population ratio from the beginning of 2008 is posted below…\n\n2008-01-01 62.9\n\n2008-02-01 62.8\n\n2008-03-01 62.7\n\n2008-04-01 62.7\n\n2008-05-01 62.5\n\n2008-06-01 62.4\n\n2008-07-01 62.2\n\n2008-08-01 62.0\n\n2008-09-01 61.9\n\n2008-10-01 61.7\n\n2008-11-01 61.4\n\n2008-12-01 61.0\n\n2009-01-01 60.6\n\n2009-02-01 60.3\n\n2009-03-01 59.9\n\n2009-04-01 59.8\n\n2009-05-01 59.6\n\n2009-06-01 59.4\n\n2009-07-01 59.3\n\n2009-08-01 59.1\n\n2009-09-01 58.7\n\n2009-10-01 58.5\n\n2009-11-01 58.6\n\n2009-12-01 58.3\n\n2010-01-01 58.5\n\n2010-02-01 58.5\n\n2010-03-01 58.5\n\n2010-04-01 58.7\n\n2010-05-01 58.6\n\n2010-06-01 58.5\n\n2010-07-01 58.5\n\n2010-08-01 58.5\n\n2010-09-01 58.5\n\n2010-10-01 58.3\n\n2010-11-01 58.2\n\n2010-12-01 58.3\n\n2011-01-01 58.3\n\n2011-02-01 58.4\n\n2011-03-01 58.4\n\n2011-04-01 58.4\n\n2011-05-01 58.4\n\n2011-06-01 58.2\n\n2011-07-01 58.2\n\n2011-08-01 58.3\n\n2011-09-01 58.4\n\n2011-10-01 58.4\n\n2011-11-01 58.5\n\n2011-12-01 58.6\n\n2012-01-01 58.5\n\n2012-02-01 58.6\n\n2012-03-01 58.5\n\n2012-04-01 58.5\n\n2012-05-01 58.6\n\n2012-06-01 58.6\n\n2012-07-01 58.5\n\n2012-08-01 58.4\n\n2012-09-01 58.7\n\n2012-10-01 58.7\n\n2012-11-01 58.7\n\n2012-12-01 58.6\n\n2013-01-01 58.6\n\n2013-02-01 58.6\n\nSo is there anyone out there that still wants to insist that the employment picture in the United States is getting significantly better?\n\nAnyone that wants to claim that “unemployment is going down” should at least wait until the unemployment-population ratio gets back up to 59 percent. Otherwise they just look foolish.\n\nYes, the Dow is at an all-time high right now. But a bubble is always the biggest right before it bursts.\n\nMost Americans understand that the Dow has been pumped up with all of the funny money that the Fed has been printing. Most Americans understand that the stock market really does not accurately reflect the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.\n\nJust consider these numbers…\n\n-The number of homeless people sleeping in homeless shelters in New York City has increased by 19 percent over the past year.\n\n-The number of Americans on food stamps has risen from 32 million to 47 million while Barack Obama has been in the White House.\n\n-According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 146 million Americans are either “poor” or “low income” at this point.\n\n-Median household income in the United States has fallen for four consecutive years.\n\nNo, the truth is that everything is most definitely not fine.\n\nIf everything is fine, then why did the Federal Reserve inject another 100 billion dollars into foreign banks during the last full week of February?\n\nThe U.S. government and the Federal Reserve are desperately trying to prop up the entire global economy. Unfortunately, the global financial system has been built on a foundation of sand and the tide is coming in.\n\nBack in 2008, a derivatives crisis was one of the primary causes of the worst financial panic since the Great Depression.\n\nSo did we learn our lesson?\n\nNo, the boys on Wall Street are back at it again as a recent article by Jim Armitage described…\n\nHistorically, stock markets, being driven by humans, have tended to have a similar length memory of catastrophes, before making the same dumb mistakes again. But it hasn’t even been five years since derivatives (on that occasion based on daft mortgages) blew up the world, and yet these exotic creatures have already returned. With a vengeance. Research from Thomson Reuters declared that banks were creating more derivatives known as asset-backed securities than at any time since before the Lehman Brothers crash. Of those, 22 percent were made up of – and forgive me the alphabet soup here – CDOs and CLOs. The very type of derivatives that exploded last time. At this stage last year, only 6 percent fell into those categories. In other words, banks are creating more of the riskiest types of the riskiest products.\n\nAt some point, we will have another derivatives crisis even worse than the last one.\n\nWhen that happens, financial markets all over the globe will crash, economic activity will grind to a standstill and unemployment will go skyrocketing once again.\n\nBut as you saw above, we have never even come close to recovering from the last crisis.\n\nSo you can believe the mind-numbing propaganda that the mainstream media is trying to feed you if you want. Unfortunately, the reality of the matter is that we have not recovered from the last major economic crisis, and another one is rapidly approaching.\n\nI hope that you are getting ready.",
  "latent_7578": "These aircraft are capable of a host of missions—long-range transport into austere fields, making airdrops, acting as refueling points on the ground, aerial tanking, and serving as medevac and disaster relief platforms, just to name a few. Yet their core mission is low-level, nighttime interdictions into enemy territory to support combat search and rescue operations. Often times, this means refueling HH-60G Pave Hawks helicopters filled with PJs along the way.\n\nThe King callsign is used pretty much exclusively by the combat search and rescue (CSAR) Hercules community. The moniker has deep roots dating back to Vietnam, and aligns with the name of CSAR Hercules crews’ mounts—the HC-130P/N Combat King or the newer HC-130J Combat King II.\n\nNew Yorkers saw an interesting visitor in the tightly controlled skies over Manhattan on Tuesday. Contacts of mine who work in the area, many of which are journos, started tweeting about a C-130 making rounds over Midtown at fairly low level. I quickly ID’d the aircraft and where it came—an HC-130 from the 106th Rescue Wing—from by the pictures I was seeing and by its telltale call sign identifier, “King 22.”\n\nThe HC-130, with its special communications and surveillance suite THAT includes a FLIR and satellite links, can also act as an airborne command post and provide communications relay and overwatch functions for search and rescue and special operations missions. The Combat Kings, and the Pave Hawks that often work alongside them as a team, are all about getting pararescuemen—often heavily armed—onto the scene, even under high-threat combat conditions, and plucking downed pilots and other key individuals out of harm's way before the enemy can snatch them. They can also provide life-saving medical treatment to their “customers” while in the air and on the ground. Think of it as the world’s ultimate emergency evacuation service. And this is where we come back to that strange display over Midtown on Tuesday. First off, the airspace over New York has been tightly controlled following 9/11. Larger aircraft buzzing the skies over the city, even on official business, is something that is normally avoided. (Case in point: the public outcry that followed a photo shoot of Air Force One flying over the city in 2009.)\n\nThere is even a ban on helicopters landing on helipads atop buildings, leaving the city with only the heliports at Wall Street, East 30th Street, and West 30th Street. The visual flight corridors that do exist over the Hudson have become more restrictive in recent years, There is even a weekend ban on helicopter operations in and out of the city—one that Mayor Bloomberg got caught breaking. Airplanes can fly over Manhattan, but at higher altitudes (above 7,000 feet)—or in some cases, 1,000 feet above the tallest object beneath the aircraft, but only with air traffic control permission and with flight following. But even this has been restricted recently, with the FAA imposing a 3,000-foot-high, two-mile wide, temporary flight restriction (TFR) over and around Trump Tower. This locks down the low-altitude airspace over the heart of Manhattan above the Hudson River on both sides on the city. So with all this in mind, it’s not as if C-130s and Pave Hawk helicopters just routinely fly low-level patterns over this most sensitive of airspace on a regular basis, and especially not on a random Tuesday afternoon. What’s more, they don’t do this specifically over the airspace that has been closed following Trump being elected President. The track of the HC-130’s flightpath over the city is telling to say the least. in that it stays perfectly within this locked-down portion of airspace—and is almost centered directly on Trump Tower.",

  "latent_8180": "With fewer than 24 hours before polls open for the 2016 US presidential election, consider this your periodic reminder that e-voting machines expected to tally millions of votes are woefully antiquated and subject to fraud should hackers get physical access to them.\n\nA case in point is the Sequoia AVC Edge Mk1, a computerized voting machine that will be used in 13 states this year, including in swing states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The so-called direct-recording electronic vote-counting system has long been known to be susceptible to relatively simple hacks that manipulate tallies and ballots. Researchers from security firm Cylance are driving that point home with demonstration hacks . The first one causes one or more votes for one candidate to count as votes for that candidate's rival. A second one alters the names as they appear on the electronic balloting screen.\n\nThe hacks work by tampering with—or more precisely, reflashing—the PCMCIA card, a storage device in the voting machine that's similar to the tiny hard drive that's used by many digital cameras. The fraud could be carried out by inserting a maliciously modified card inside a Sequoia AVC Edge machine, although the attackers would likely have to circumvent tamper-evident seals that are designed to flag such abuse. The video above shows the hack being used to alter both the public and protective counters the machine uses to count and recount results to ensure tallies are valid. The decade-old hack first came to public attention in 2007 in a research paper titled Source Code Review of the Sequoia Voting System.\n\nStuffing the digital ballot box\n\nThe Cylance demonstration came three weeks after researchers from competing security firm Symantec published a post with a similarly cautionary tone. In it, researchers reported buying an unidentified DRE voting machine. They, too, were able to hack a storage card used by the machines to effectively stuff the digital ballot box. In the report, the Symantec researchers wrote:\n\nVoters entering polling stations that use electronic voting machines are handed a chip card that they use to cast their vote. Once someone has voted, they turn the card back in to the polling station volunteer and it gets re-used by the next voter. Just like credit cards, these cards are essentially a computer with its own RAM, CPU and operating system. Which means they can be exploited like any computing device. In examining the election process for vulnerabilities, we discovered that there’s an opportunity for a hacker to modify the code put on a voter’s chip card. Anyone who knows how to program a chip card and purchases a simple $15 Raspberry Pi-like device could secretly reactivate their voter card while inside the privacy of a voting booth. We found a card reader that fits neatly into the palm of our hand and used it to reset our fake voter chip cards two different ways. In one scenario, we reset the card to allow someone to vote multiple times using the same chip card. Our second method programmed the card to allow that card to cast multiple votes. In both approaches, that attacker is stuffing the digital ballot box and casting doubt in the validity of the results from that polling station. Encryption absent on the voting machine hard drive We also discovered that there was no form of encryption on the internal hard drive of the voting machines we purchased, which were running an outdated operating system to display the ballots and record votes. These types of hard drives are similar to those used in digital cameras. The lack of full disk encryption on the internal hard drive (as well as the external cartridges) presents opportunities for hackers to reprogram and alter ballots. Potential hackers would also be unhindered by the voting machine’s lack of internet connectivity. Some types of malware, such as Stuxnet, can take advantage of air-gapped networks and vector through physical access to a machine. The lack of full-disk encryption on the DRE machine makes it easily exploitable, requiring only a simple device to reprogram the compact hard drive.\n\nSecurity experts have been quick to point out that hacking enough votes to alter an election is prohibitively hard to do. As already noted, most hacks require physical access to machines that by law are required to be monitored by election officials. What's more, machines used in US elections are extremely diverse. Taken together, these characteristics probably prevent hacks from scaling to the volumes that would be required to change the outcome of a national election.\n\nStill, the hacks might be used to alter a relatively small number of results in swing states, where outcomes have been known to be decided by fewer than a few hundred or a few thousand votes. The hacks could also be used to sow widespread distrust in the official returns and undermine confidence in the legitimacy of the election. US intelligence officials recently accused the Russian government of hacking into the computer accounts of Democratic officials and leaking e-mails that could sway voters. Republican nominee Donald Trump has long warned of an election system that's \"rigged\" against him and has rebuffed calls that he pledge to accept the results should rival Hillary Clinton receive a majority of electoral college votes. The lack of security in many of the nation's e-voting systems certainly doesn't inspire confidence.",

Видеоролики, сделанные живыми журналистами, остаются на сайте в разделе \"Видео\".\n\nМногие знают, что такое Сири. Все мы, скорее всего, время от времени пользуемся онлайн-переводчиками, типа Google Translate, Bing Translator или Яндекс Переводчик.\n\nУ кого-то из нас дома уже может даже стоять Amazon Echo – новый домашний помощник, реагирующий на голос .\n\nАвтоматизация касается многих областей человеческой жизни, и новости не остаются в стороне (взять хотя бы недавнее появление ботов, рассылающих новости от имени медиа-организаций).\n\nОдна из моих профессиональных задач на Би-би-си – поиск, анализ и внедрение в журналистский обиход новых технологий, которые повышают эффективность работы редакции, позволяют журналистам меньше времени тратить на скучные задания, способствуют росту аудитории на цифровых платформах – на сайтах, в мессенджерах, в соцсетях.\n\nИдей вокруг масса, пробовать приходится много, но по-настоящему полезных мало.\n\nЭтот проект – по автоматизации перевода и озвучки видеосюжетов - мы готовили довольно давно: нужно было \"сшить\" вместе несколько систем, научить их общаться и понимать друг друга, найти высококачественные синтезированные голоса.\n\nНам также пришлось убедить редакции в том, что делается это не для того, чтобы рано или поздно избавиться от живых людей и отдать производство новостей роботам (хотя примеров автоматизаци новостей довольно много – Los Angeles Times уже давно разрешила роботам писать про регулярно происходящие в регионе землетрясения).\n\nВидео на Русской службе существует уже 10 лет – помню, что первый сюжет с экраном размером со спичечный коробок мы опубликовали в марте 2006 года.\n\nЗа 10 лет видео стало по-настоящему неотъемлемым форматом любого онлайн-издания, и, по одному из прогнозов, к 2019 году 80% мирового интернет-трафика будет приходиться именно на видео.\n\nНам очень интересно узнать, что автоматизация видеопроизводства может добавить к уже существующему разделу Русской службы.\n\nМы отдаем себе отчет в том, что кому-то новая технология может не понравиться: мы внимательно изучим ваши комментарии (вы можете оставить их здесь).\n\nКонечно, это эксперимент.

Я понимаю, что слушаю компьютерный голос, но понимать его легко, спасибо!\" - пишет другой.\n\n\"Было бы здорово, если бы вы заодно показывали английский текст в виде субтитров\", - просит третий.

REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny\n\nIslamic State’s stronghold in Libya is the city of Sirte but it also has a presence in Derna and Benghazi in the east and Sabratha in the west, General David M. Rodriguez, head of U.S. Africa Command, told a news briefing.\n\n“In Benghazi and Derna, (Libyan armed groups) have fought back against the Islamic State and made it much tougher for them to operate, as well as in Sabratha,” he said.\n\n“They are contesting the growth of ISIS in several areas across Libya,” Rodriguez said, citing U.S. intelligence assessments for the growth of Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nThe group’s growth in Libya has worried Western governments, which fear it will take advantage of persistent political chaos to emulate its success in seizing territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nSince 2014, loose coalitions of armed brigades have backed rival governments in Tripoli and the east. Western governments back the Government of National Accord, in part as the best chance for uniting armed factions against Islamic State.\n\n“The challenge of the Government of National Accord is to bring them together, one for the future of Libya, but also to get rid of ISIS,” Rodriguez said.\n\nHe downplayed the possibility Islamic State could strike out from its base and take large portions of territory as it did in Iraq and Syria.\n\n“They don’t have the homegrown people that know as much about Libya like they did in Iraq and Syria,” Rodriguez said. “The Libyan people are also different in the way they treat and respond to foreigners, so all that has an impact.”\n\nU.S. air strikes in Libya have targeted Islamic State, but those efforts are focused on targets posing an imminent threat to U.S. interests and personnel, Rodriguez said.",

Maybe someday\n\nBuy Photo U.S. national team member and Indiana native DaMarcus Beasley waves to the crowd before Indy Eleven's game against the Tampa Bay Rowdies at Carroll Stadium on July 12, 2014. (Photo: For the Star/Chris Bergin)\n\nHad a long conversation with Indy Eleven president Peter Wilt on a variety of topics for future stories (More on that later.) when the name of U.S. national team member and Indiana native DaMarcus Beasley came up.\n\nBeasley attended the Eleven's game against the Tampa Bay Rowdies on July 12. He had yet to sign with a club team after deciding not to return to Puebla of the Mexican League. Wilt has had a long-standing relationship with Beasley since signing him to his first pro contract in 200 when Wilt was president of MLS' Chicago Fire and some Eleven fans wondered -- perhaps only half-jokingly -- if he could convince Beasley to play for his home- state team.\n\nWell, Wilt tried. But while Beasley was impressed by the reception and sellout crowd at Carroll Stadium, he wasn't quite ready to play in the North American Soccer League and chose to sign with MLS' Houston Dynamo instead.\n\n\"He felt like he could make a little more money in MLS and he felt he could play at that level a little longer,\" Wilt said.\n\nBeasley is scheduled to make his debut with the Dynamo on Sunday and said during the visit to Indy that he hopes his time with the national team isn't over. He is the only U.S. player to play in four World Cups.\n\nBut Wilt likely will re-visit the topic when Beasley becomes available again. Returning to play in his home state also could open up some post-soccer business opportunities for him, Wilt said.\n\nHere is a story from the Houston Chronicle on Beasley, who will be playing his first MLS game in nearly 10 years this weekend.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1rWW1Ee",

  "latent_8577": "Opponents of Bernie Sanders have been having a field day. Over the past couple of weeks, the Vermont Senator has taken a number of shots. A writer at Slate rather absurdly knocks him for 1) hosting a popular podcast allegedly characterized by shoddy production values and softball questions. More seriously, he has been criticized both for 2) failing to endorse, at least initially, Democratic Congressional candidate Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s sixth district, and 3) endorsing Omaha Mayoral candidate Heath Mello notwithstanding Mello’s votes to restrict abortion rights in the Nebraska legislature. Sanders also continues to hear from carpers who resent his decision 4) to re-become an independent after registering as a Democrat before his Presidential run.\n\nSanders should have climbed on board the Ossoff train weeks before, not immediately after, the primary in which the Georgia Democrat came agonizingly close to prevailing in a long-held Republican district. On the other hand, Bernie’s support for Mello is reasonable in light of Mello’s “feisty economic populism” and pro-choice voting record over the past five years .\n\nUltimately though, the attacks on Bernie are beside the point regardless of merit. Sanders is our country’s most popular politician and most important progressive because of his authentic outrage at America’s “rigged” neo-liberal political economy and his preference for an idealized form of Euro-style socialism. A recent poll suggests over 100 million Americans view him favorably. No other politician comes close.\n\nBernie doesn’t just decry the ever-increasing share of our nation’s wealth and income gushing to the top. He articulates a clear and credible vision of a better America characterized by 1) an end to free trade deals, 2) a $15 hourly minimum wage, 3) single-payer healthcare, 4) tuition-free public colleges and universities, and 5) much higher taxes on the rich. In light of this achievement, his somewhat whimsical endorsement record is an afterthought.\n\nBernie’s core message is that the 99% must unite to fight economic injustice but he does not ignore other challenges including potential environmental collapse. Indeed, he links the two phenomena. From his website:\n\nThe scientists are virtually unanimous that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is already causing devastating problems in the United States and around the world. And, they tell us, if we do not act boldly the situation will only become much worse in years to come in terms of drought, floods, extreme storms and acidification of the oceans. . . . While fossil fuel companies are raking in record profits, climate change ravages our planet and our people – all because the wealthiest industry in the history of our planet has bribed politicians into ignoring science.\n\nRecognition has been growing that Bernie’s diagnosis for what ails us is accurate. Indeed scholars, along with religious leaders and anti-poverty activists are warning that our very civilization could unravel as a result of either global warming, extreme inequality, or a confluence of the two. In its May 2014 edition, a trio of NASA-funded scientists led by the University of Maryland’s Safa Motesharrei made this point. In an article in Ecological Economics they concluded that “two features . . . seem to appear across societies that have collapsed: the stretching of resources due to strain placed on the ecological carrying capacity, and the division of society into Elites (rich) and Commoners (poor).”\n\nIn June 2015, Oxfam International’s Executive Director Winnie Biyanyima praised Pope Benedict for his “moral leadership on these two defining issues, inequality and climate change.\" Just last week, the BBC’s Rachel Nuwer lamented in a published article that Syria’s recent history and the evident unwillingness of developed nations to meet the challenges of economic injustice and climate change suggest that the task of saving civilization may “exceed our political and psychological capabilities.” More optimistically, Nuwer concludes that “Western civilisation is not a lost cause, however. Using reason and science to guide decisions, paired with extraordinary leadership and exceptional goodwill, human society can progress to higher and higher levels of well-being and development[.]”\n\nGiven the evident urgency of humanity’s current predicament, Democrats have a moral obligation to grapple with Bernie’s policy prescriptions and, failing better solutions, embrace them. Nitpicking his podcasts, pointing out inconsistencies in his endorsement record, and chiding him for not being a “real” Democrat serve only as distractions from this essential task.",
  "latent_8671": "THE worst men on Tinder can be easily identified with the use of a simple two word phrase in their profile, sociologists have revealed.\n\nAn extensive analysis of the dating app found that the nastiest male users were helpfully marking themselves out to potential matches by claiming to be “nice guys”.\n\nResearcher Dr Julianne Cook explained: “It’s an immediate red flag. If you see the phrase ‘just a nice guy’, ‘one of the good guys’ or any variant thereof, he is a monster and you should swipe left immediately.\n\n“Our studies found that conversations with these men tend to deteriorate quickly, going from calling a woman ‘princess’ or ‘so beautiful’ to ‘a fucking bitch’ and bombarding her with unsolicited dick pics within 12 hours.”\n\nAdvice for male Tinderers includes avoiding women who only have pouty selfies as profile pictures, as this is a sign they have driven all their friends and family away with self-obsessed behaviour.\n\nPotential dates, both male and female, who say they “love to laugh” are statistically likely to be the most tedious people you will ever meet.\n\nMeanwhile those “looking for a partner in crime” are unlikely to have done anything more rebellious than getting a henna tattoo on an all-inclusive holiday.",
  "latent_8680": "The genes of 894 men and women over the age of one hundred in Spain and Japan have revealed that the secret to longevity, at least in southern Europe, lies in a variant on chromosome 9p21.3, which had already been associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nCentenarians live at least fifteen years longer than the average person in the West. This exceptional longevity is partially genetic.\n\nThere are a number of gene variants that may hold the key to a healthy old age life. For example, a polymorphism (that is, a particular sequence variation in the DNA among individuals from a particular population) called rs1333049 on chromosome 9p21.3 is related to chronic ailments associated with aging, mainly with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe C allele is the copy of this gene that carries the greatest risk. In order to find out whether this polymorphism is also associated with extreme longevity, Spanish researchers performed an analysis of the frequencies of this polymorphism among centenarians and healthy adults in two independent cohorts, by geographical regions and by ethnic groups.\n\nThe study included 152 Spaniards aged between 110 and 111 years and 742 Japanese people aged between 100 and 115 years. The results have been published in the journal Age.\n\n\"This variant may be associated with extreme longevity, particularly among the Spanish population,\" Alejandro Lucía, the main author and researcher at the European University and also a member of the Hospital 12 de Octubre Research Institute, told SINC. \"The study also revealed that the risk allele reduces the possibilities of reaching one hundred years of age.\"\n\nThe frequency of the risk C variant in Spanish people over the age of one hundred was 47.0%, lower than in healthy people that were taken as a control sample in the study (52.9%) and individuals with cardiovascular disease (55.1%).\n\nSignificant differences were also discovered between the centenarians and the two control groups when their genotype frequencies were compared, in other words, the proportion of individuals with a specific gene sequence.\n\nThe results were different in the Japanese group. Among the Japanese participants, the risk gene variant had a similar frequency in centenarians (46.4%) and in healthy controls (47.3%), but it was less frequent than in controls performed with cardiovascular disease (57.2%).\n\nAlthough the biological mechanisms through which this polymorphism could affect aging are not known, it is adjacent to two genes called CDKN2A and CDKN2B, which play an important role in cell cycle regulation.\n\n\"In fact, the CDKN2A takes part in the p53 signalling pathway, one of the most important ones in the cell senescence regulation,\" adds Lucía.\n\nHealthy aging model\n\n\"People aged one hundred years or over are not only the peak of the population pyramid,\" says Lucía. \"They also represent a healthy aging model given that they have delayed, and sometimes even avoided, chronic illnesses that come with age and loss of independence and they tend to be just as health as nonagenarians.\"\n\nThis is why the authors believe it is important to know the genetic or environmental factors that condition the possibilities of reaching this age.\n\nAlthough more research is required, the information obtained from this study coincides with others published recently on the Mediterranean population of the north of Italy, \"therefore the effect of this gene seems to exist in southern Europe at least,\" concluded the researcher.",
  "latent_8800": "From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.\n\nThis article is about the character. For the game titled \"Pokémon Silver Version\", see Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions.\n\nThe subject of this article has no official name.\n\nThe name currently in use is a fan designator; see below for more information.\n\nSilver (Japanese: シルバー Silver) is the rival character of Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, playing opposite Ethan, Kris, or Lyra. He is the son of Team Rocket Boss Giovanni.\n\nDuring the first battle against him in HeartGold and SoulSilver, he is given the unique Trainer class Passerby (Japanese: とおりすがり Passerby) with the placeholder name Boy (Japanese: しょうねん Boy).\n\nIn the games\n\nRole\n\nSilver first appears in the Generation II games, lurking outside of Professor Elm's lab, looking through the window. When talked to, he will deny everything and push the player away. During the player's journey to Mr. Pokémon's house, Silver makes his move, stealing one of Elm's two remaining starter Pokémon (coincidentally always the one that is strong against the player's choice). He will meet with the player on the outskirts of Cherrygrove City, battling to get through. A policeman will later ask for the name of the rival, and the rival will be called the name the player gives for the rest of the game.\n\nSilver shows a strong dislike of Team Rocket. He considers them to be weak, and vows to take them, as well as any other weak Trainer, down. He steals a Pokémon from a Trainer in Cianwood City and while Ethan/Kris/Lyra attempts to take down Team Rocket in Mahogany Town and Goldenrod City, he interferes to prove himself. It is in the Mahogany hideout that he meets with Lance, Champion of the Elite Four at Indigo Plateau. Silver challenges Lance and is easily defeated by the dragon Trainer, who then proceeds to berate Silver for his callous ways towards training Pokémon. Though Silver is outraged for losing to someone with such an attitude, the loss and Lance's words ultimately set him on the path to becoming a better person. In HeartGold and SoulSilver, when Team Rocket takes over the Goldenrod Radio Tower, Silver first blows the player's Team Rocket disguise, unaware of the player's plan to sneak in by pretending to be a member of Team Rocket. He later follows the player to the Goldenrod underground and they battle Team Rocket, hoping that Lance will reappear and he can request a rematch.\n\nBy the time the player reaches Victory Road, Silver battles against the player not out of malice, but to prove that he is a good Trainer. He is defeated and departs to continue training. The player battles Silver on Mt. Moon, and though he loses he claims he can feel his Pokémon getting stronger, and resolves to train at Dragon's Den.\n\nAfter the player has become Champion, Silver can indeed be found training in the Dragon's Den on Tuesday and Thursday, where he cannot be battled. On Monday and Wednesday, he will appear at Indigo Plateau and will challenge the player to a battle if they appear there. He does not appear at all on Friday or the weekends, indicating that he may in fact take the day off, resting his Pokémon. When battled this seventh and final time at Indigo Plateau, Silver seems to have finally learned to care for his Pokémon properly, as his Golbat has evolved to Crobat, which only occurs when Golbat is very friendly. This is further expressed in Generation IV when his starter Pokémon starts to follow him around, much like the player's Pokémon; Professor Elm even expressly states that Silver's Pokémon have come to trust him when Silver returns to the lab, presumably to return the starter he stole. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Lance and Clair will appear in the Dragon's Den and challenge the player and Silver to a Multi Battle following the battle at Mt. Moon giving him the chance to avenge his loss from earlier.\n\nIn terms of personality, Silver is initially the darkest of the rivals in the series. While most other rivals are generally good-natured, or at least zestful enough to crack a joke at the player, Silver is (at first) cruel, hateful, power-obsessed and even physically abusive, pushing the player character around several times. Even after he starts to become kinder, he remains a rather serious individual. He does, however, express genuine happiness when Elm allows him to keep the Pokémon he stole.\n\nGiovanni and Silver's relationship is first alluded to in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, when Team Rocket Scientist Gideon at the Rocket Warehouse on Five Island asks Red if he is \"Giovanni's kid\" but concludes he is not, saying that \"Giovanni's kid has red hair.\" More information is revealed in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver when a fateful encounter Celebi is brought to Ilex Forest shrine: Celebi takes the player back in time three years to witness Giovanni abandoning Silver to go into seclusion because of his defeat at the hands of Red. Silver's hate for Team Rocket apparently stems from the failure of his father.\n\nSilver also appears in Pokémon Stadium 2, where he's simply called \"Rival\". He can be battled in White City once the player has cleared every Stadium Mode and the Gym Leader Castle, acting as the final opponent of the game. His party consists of three Legendary Pokémon, which the player is allowed to face with a full party of six Pokémon. Defeating Silver ends the game, and, in Round 1, also unlocks Round 2.\n\nPokémon\n\nThe starter Pokémon that Silver has will depend on which Pokémon the player chose to bring on Professor Elm's errand at the beginning of the game. As with most rivals, it will be the Pokémon whose type weakens that of the player's starter.\n\nFor Silver's Pokémon in Gold, Silver, and Crystal Versions, see here.\n\nFirst battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nSecond battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nThird battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nFourth battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nFifth battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nSixth battle\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nSilver in the Dragon's Den\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nIf the player chose Chikorita:\n\nIf the player chose Cyndaquil:\n\nIf the player chose Totodile:\n\nRound 1\n\nRound 2\n\nQuotes\n\nNew Bark Town \"…… So this is the famous Elm Pokémon Lab …… What are you staring at?\n\nBefore battle\n\n\"…… …… …… You got a Pokémon at the Lab .

Humph, you must really like Team Rocket so much. … Tell me, who was the guy in the cape who used Dragon-type Pokémon? My Pokémon were no match at all. I don't care that I lost. I can beat him by getting stronger Pokémon. It's what he said that bothers me… He told me that I don't love and trust my Pokémon enough. I'm furious that I lost to a bleeding heart like him. …Humph!

I should take them to Dragon's Den! See ya, <player>!\"\n\nBefore the Multi Battle with Lance and Clair\n\n\"…What? Are you here to make fun of my training? Humph! I took my time coming all the way here, but the Master won't tell me anything, and he's making a big deal out of it... So I decided to train my Pokémon here instead.\" \"You!

His only appearance in the anime was a brief cameo, in the original Japanese opening of The Legend of Thunder! (A New Oath). In this opening, he was shown defeating Jimmy with his Nidoking, only to be defeated later on when Jimmy's Cyndaquil fully evolved into Typhlosion.\n\nWhile Silver did not appear in the main series, he was considered by much of the fandom to have a close counterpart in the character of Paul, who was Ash's main rival throughout the Diamond & Pearl series. Like Silver, Paul believed in raising the power of his Pokémon through harsh training as opposed to forming a trusting relationship, which put him at odds with Ash throughout the series. Also, Paul's official art shows him in the same pose as Silver does in one of his official artwork by Ken Sugimori.\n\nPokémon\n\nYoung Silver in Pokémon Generations\n\nIn Pokémon Generations\n\nSilver appeared in The Legacy. He was seen meeting up with Looker outside the Indigo Plateau, discussing his relationship and last meeting with Giovanni that ultimately led to their estrangement. During the conversation, Silver asserts that he decided to stay out of his father's affairs, and he tells Looker that it is his job to find Giovanni before going off to face the Elite Four.\n\nVoice actors\n\nLanguage Voice actor Japanese 逢坂良太 Ryōta Ōsaka English Lucien Dodge European Spanish Ángel de Gracia\n\nIn the manga\n\nIn the Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga\n\nSilver in Pokémon Adventures\n\nThe character Black who appears in Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga is based on Silver.\n\nIn the Pokémon Adventures manga\n\nHis counterpart in the Pokémon Adventures manga is also named Silver. They share several similarities, such as stealing a starter from Professor Elm, in the manga's case, Totodile, owning a Sneasel, and being Giovanni's son.\n\nIn the Pocket Monsters HGSS Jō's Big Adventure manga\n\nTsubaki (JBA) from Pocket Monsters HGSS Jō's Big Adventure is based on him.\n\nIn the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga\n\nSilver has a counterpart in the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga named Silver.\n\nTrivia\n\nA 1997 pamphlet describing Gold and Silver mentions that the rival character lives in the same town as the protagonist. This aspect of his character was apparently discarded by the time of the final release, as his hometown was not elaborated upon in the games and it is implied to not be New Bark Town since he seems unfamiliar with Professor Elm's lab at the beginning of the game.\n\nIn Generation IV, Silver is depicted with two different eye colors. His eyes are gray in his Generation IV artwork while they are red in the HeartGold and SoulSilver games, as seen in the opening animation.\n\nIn the original Gold, Silver, and Crystal games, when battled at Indigo Plateau, the Champion theme is played instead of his rival theme.\n\nThe English script of the Celebi event in HeartGold and SoulSilver never states that Silver is Giovanni's son, unlike the Japanese script.\n\nSilver has achieved a high score of 2000 at Pal Park, which serves as the default high score.\n\nIn the battle in the Goldenrod Tunnel in the remakes, his team when the player starts with Cyndaquil are all 2 levels higher than the same team he uses if the player were to start with another starter.\n\nIn the original games, at level 16, Silver's Croconaw is underleveled in the second battle, when Totodile usually does not evolve into Croconaw until level 18. This is fixed in the remakes. His Haunter was also underleveled at level 20 in the third battle, when Gastly usually does not evolve until level 25. This is fixed in the remakes where instead his Haunter remains a Gastly.\n\nSilver is the only rival whose team does not change in accordance to his starter, nor does he have any types that cover for his starter's initial type.\n\nArt of Silver on Game Freak's website depicts him with a Houndoom, despite not owning one within the games.\n\nIn the Generation II core series games, Silver is the only Trainer who doesn't have a Trainer class.\n\nNames\n\nSilver (Japanese: シルバー Silver) is almost universally used in fanon as the name for this character, since it is his default name if the player provides a blank name for him in Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Crystal. Despite this, it should be considered that Pokémon Crystal only shares the default name with Pokémon Gold likely due to the former being specifically developed from the latter, as evidenced by development leftovers. Furthermore, his default name differs on other games, which call him Gold (Japanese: ゴールド Gold)S, Soul (Japanese: ソウル Soul)HG, and Heart (Japanese: ハート Heart)SS.\n\nSome fans call him Kamon (Japanese: カモン Kamon) to discern him from his Pokémon Adventures counterpart and an unrelated anime character. This name is taken from the suggested names for Ethan in both the Japanese and English versions of Pokémon Silver; this is similar to some fans calling Blue \"Gary\", since the name is found as one of the options for the player in international Pokémon Blue and for the rival in international Pokémon Red.\n\nPasserby Boy\n\nLanguage Title French Passant Garçon German Passant Junge Italian Ragazzino Passante Korean 나그네 소년 Nageune Sonyeon Spanish Transeúnte Chico\n\nRival characters Blue • Silver • Brendan/May • Wally • Barry • Cheren • Bianca • Hugh • Calem/Serena • Shauna • Tierno • Trevor • Hau • Gladion • Trace",
  "latent_9065": "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaks during an event at the University of Chicago on April 22. Andrew A. Nelles/AP\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., may follow in his father’s footsteps not only by seeking the Republican presidential nomination, but also by receiving the Libertarian Party’s ballot line.\n\nMembers of the Libertarian Party are bracing for an internal struggle over whether to back the libertarian-leaning senator if he appears poised to win the Republican nomination in 2016.\n\nPaul is unlikely to directly seek the third party’s support, but could win it anyhow through the work of eager activists like those who worked the campaigns of his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a GOP presidential contender in 2008 and 2012 and the Libertarian nominee in 1988.\n\nA co-nomination from one of the nation’s most significant minor parties could help Paul - if he’s the Republican nominee - avoid losing hundreds of thousands of votes to an ideological ally. In some states, his name would appear twice on ballots.\n\nIf Paul is nominated by both the Republican and Libertarian parties, it could also unleash electoral scenarios unseen in decades, such as the negotiation of a fusion slate of electors. Libertarians could, theoretically, nominate their own vice presidential candidate.\n\nThough the Libertarian Party’s Orlando, Florida, nominating convention isn’t until May 2016, Libertarian National Committee Executive Director Wes Benedict foresees a fight.\n\n“If Rand Paul wins the Republican nomination, I'd expect a big fight within the [party] over whether or not we should run our own candidate,” Benedict says. “It wouldn't just be a discussion.”\n\nLibertarian Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark, officially neutral on the matter, says “there is a possibility that the delegates in Orlando would nominate Sen. Paul and if they were to do so, I'd work hard to support their choice.”\n\nThe Republican primary season will be well underway when the 1,000 or so Libertarian convention delegates gather. If Paul appears poised for victory in the GOP race, they would have several options.\n\nDelegates could nominate Paul and his presumptive GOP running mate (if that person has been selected), or nominate Paul and a Libertarian running mate (as happened in 1896 when the Democratic and Populist parties nominated William Jennings Bryan for president, but chose different vice presidential candidates).\n\nThey could also choose to endorse no candidate, a scenario in which many would-be Libertarian voters would presumably vote for Paul without the party’s official blessing; or they could snub Paul and pick their own presidential candidate.\n\nThough Paul is largely in line with the Libertarian rank-and-file on mass surveillance, militarized policing, government spending and taxes, criminal justice reform and foreign policy, his stance on social issues and immigration are unappetizing to some party members and his anticipated catering to the GOP mainstream may alienate others.​\n\nBenedict says he would prefer Libertarians to run their own candidate, someone who supports abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nRichard Winger, a ballot access expert who’s participated in Libertarian Party nominating conventions since the 1980s, says Paul supporters would need to strategize in advance of the Orlando convention, as delegates are selected by state parties.\n\nGaming Republican state conventions was a specialty of enthusiastic Ron Paul supporters, who in 2012 took over GOP organizations and flooded state conventions to score delegate wins for their libertarian hero. It’s unclear if these activists would put the same effort into infiltrating the Libertarian Party on behalf of Sen. Paul.\n\nWinger says Paul probably would need to signal to Libertarians that he supports key party priorities. He recalls former Republican Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, the party’s 2008 nominee, successfully doing so when he apologized authoring the Defense of Marriage Act and voting for the Patriot Act.\n\nCartoons on the Republican Party View All 224 Images\n\nThe Republican primary season may make that difficult, Already, Paul has taken positions that some Libertarians consider heresy, such as saying he would vote in favor of bombing the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.\n\nBarr, citing his experience winning the Libertarian nomination, advises Paul supporters to “work quietly within the Libertarian Party to identify real-world libertarians” who would rather boost the libertarian-leaning Republican than nominate an ideologically pure candidate.\n\nBarr says Paul clearly needs to focus on the Republican nomination and offers a word of caution to fans seeking to pull off a Libertarian win: “If you come out too early, too strong as Libertarians with a capital ‘L’ for Sen. Paul, you can actually wind up hurting his effort to win the Republican nomination.”\n\nWinger, the ballot access expert, says if Paul wins both party nominations, his name would appear twice on ballots in Connecticut, New York and South Carolina. In states including California, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania both party names would appear under his name. Florida and Texas ballots would not show the Libertarian party name.\n\nThe possibility of Paul winning the Libertarian nomination, of course, doesn’t merely depend on the enthusiasm of his supporters or if his positions are close enough to party dogma. It also depends on who else is interested in the nomination.\n\nThe party’s 2012 nominee, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, is busy running a marijuana company he hopes to build into an industry leader, but may enter the race.\n\nJohnson, a former Republican, says he’d like to seek the Libertarian nomination again - though he’s not firmly committed to doing so - and says Libertarians should not nominate Paul.\n\n“If that happened it would be really anti-libertarian,” he says, describing Paul’s positions on immigration, abortion, drug policy, same-sex marriage and military interventions abroad as insufficiently in line with the Libertarian Party.\n\n“I doubt that would occur, but if it did occur that would be Libertarians saying those issues are not important, when they really are,” Johnson says. “Outside of those five issues I think Rand Paul does a pretty darn good job.”\n\nJohnson expects the 2016 Libertarian candidate to perform about as well as he did in 2012, when he pulled nearly 1.3 million votes, regardless of whether Paul is the Republican nominee.\n\nThird-party candidates are sometimes blamed for major-party losses, such as in 2000, when Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was accused of siphoning enough votes from Democrat Al Gore to cause Gore's loss in Florida and with it the entire presidential election. In recent elections, Libertarian presidential candidates at a minimum pull several hundred thousand votes.\n\nJohnson says if he’s the Libertarian candidate he’d be unfazed about possibly spoiling the race for Paul. “Being a spoiler is not a bad thing, being a spoiler suggests you are saying something differently,” he says.\n\nSarwark, the party chairman, acknowledges the senator’s appeal but notes Paul has angered some members by campaigning against Libertarian candidates. Party bylaws may require Paul to indicate he would accept the nomination, he says.\n\n“He does take more libertarian positions than many Republicans, to his credit,\" Sarwark says, \"but he also shows more deference to the [Republican National Committee] than his father.\"",
  "latent_9144": "Dark and Light, once thought dead and buried is nearing ever closer to its eventual relaunch. It’s not the game it was 12 years ago, except in name only. Still, even with a few interviews, we don’t have much in the way of gameplay video or real details from the developer itself to go on. Ergo, today we’re offering up five things we want from Dark and Light. These are just five of our many hopes, so feel free to weigh in with your own.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\n5.) PVE Servers with PVP Optional\n\nThis one has yet to be clarified from what I can tell. Snail has announced that Dark and Light will have both full open world PVP servers with full loot, and more friendly PVE servers. That said, there are three player factions akin to Dark Age of Camelot, ESO, and more – and I’ll be damned if I wouldn’t love to be able to PVE without fear and still PVP when I want to.\n\nFrom the early Reddit QnA:\n\n“After creating a character, players will be able to choose from one of three factions, each with their own background and lore. Each faction controls a main \"city\" hub that serves as a neutral zone for players who belong to that faction. There's a lot we want to explore with inter-faction relations, a lot of what makes it into the full game will depend on how factions play out in testing.”\n\n4.) Don’t Be Too Grindy\n\nSandboxes of late, namely in the survival vein, have a tendency to overly rely on berry picking, tree punching, and spending most of your time harvesting tons of materials you have no real means to carry in order to get anything done. I love that Dark and Light is being positioned as a sandbox where you can explore, craft, and live life… just don’t make it so monotonous that it feels like real life.\n\n3.) First and Third Person\n\nOn several occasions, Snail has referred to Dark and Light’s action combat as “being like a First Person Shooter”. Since, as of this writing, we still don’t have much gameplay to go on, I’m hoping that doesn’t mean we don’t have a third person POV option. FPS is good and all, but I love being able to watch my character’s looks grow and his animations fire when fighting. Right now, Snail can’t confirm or deny whether a 3rd person view will be in the game, which seems sad to this Panda.\n\n2.) Player-Run Shops\n\nOne of the best parts of a game like Shards Online is that not only can you create your own goods or sell what you find, but when you log out you can leave a merchant behind to sell your stuff for you. With Dark and Light taking such a heavy focus on crafting, I really hope it has the option for players to run their own shops, even when offline.\n\n1.) Survival Shouldn’t Mean Boring\n\nIn so many survival games, you have to eat and drink so much that the core gameplay loops veers off and becomes all about finding and consuming rations. Think of No Man’s Sky and its ridiculous resource hunting. That’s all you really did in the game, especially early on. I can appreciate good survival mechanics, but make them behave rationally, much like Osiris: New Dawn and how players only truly need to eat and drink every few in-game days to stave off starvation and thirst. Not every 15 minutes of in-game play time.",
  "latent_9150": "(CNN) White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer in a wide-ranging, 35-minute interview Monday with CNN's Chris Cuomo, saying there was \"no information provided that was meaningful.\"\n\n\"Let's focus on what did not happen in that meeting,\" she said, speaking on \"New Day,\" adding there was \"no action taken. Nothing.\"\n\nConway said the President's son had taken the meeting based on connections made through the Miss Universe pageant and promises of a conversation about adoption policy. She said he did not even know the name of the lawyer going into the meeting.\n\n\"Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he didn't even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,\" she said. \"He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.\"\n\n\"They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption, according to his statements, that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague. They were meaningless.\"\n\nTrump Jr. changed his account of events as he was presented with new reporting by The New York Times. When the paper first reported on the meeting -- but not about the promise of information about Democrats -- he said it was a \"short, introductory meeting\" about adoption.\n\n\"I asked (Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner) and (then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort) to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,\" Trump Jr. initially said in a statement.\n\nBut on Sunday, when the Times -- citing three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it -- reported about the lawyer offering to provide information about the Democratic National Committee before he took the meeting, he acknowledged that Democrats and Hillary Clinton were discussed. He said the lawyer had \"no meaningful information\" to offer him, adding that he was not told her name prior to the meeting.\n\n\"After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,\" Trump Jr. said in the statement. \"Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\"\n\nHe added, \"She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.\"\n\nHe defended himself, sarcastically, on Twitter Monday: \"Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview 34:52\n\nTrump Jr. on Twitter said there were no inconsistencies in his statements.\n\n\"I simply provided more details,\" he tweeted Monday.\n\nCuomo, however, seized on the changes in Trump Jr.'s story.\n\n\"He changed his story twice. You talked about being in a court of law -- not good when you change your story,\" Cuomo said. \"There are big implications when you change your story like this. Second of all, even if it is true, whether or not it was good information, Kellyanne, doesn't mean it was a smart move to take a meeting with a Russian-connected person who was going to give you negative information about your opponent. That could create huge legal issues. You know that.\"\n\n\"I admire your moxie, sitting there with the CNN chyron next to you,\" she replied.\n\n\"I could not be more proud to have that CNN chyron next to me,\" Cuomo fired back.\n\nThroughout the often-tense interview, Conway leveled a sustained attack on the media and CNN in particular, suggesting it was obsessed with the probes into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n\"Aren't you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed, that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?\" Conway asked.\n\nCuomo, however, argued that the President's Twitter feed, which often features attacks on the media and commentary on the Russia investigations, was evidence that the issue mattered to him as well.\n\n\"The President spends as much time tweeting about this as anything else,\" said Cuomo. \"I'll show you his thread right now. It's not filled with ideas for new jobs. He's on this stuff as well.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, he's the President of the United States and you are looking at his ... social media instead of listening to what he does,\" replied Conway, who followed up with: \"Name three things he talked about at the Department of Transportation.\"\n\nDespite her sharp words, however, Conway said twice she had not come on air to attack CNN.\n\n\"We appreciate the platform, Chris.

  "latent_9186": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Britain has listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) as a terrorist organization, pleasing China, which had demanded Western support for its fight against a group it says seeks to split off its western region of Xinjiang.\n\nBritain’s Home Office, or interior ministry, on Friday designated ETIM, which it also called the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), as an “Islamic terrorist and separatist organization” trying to create an “independent caliphate” in Xinjiang.\n\nThe United States and the United Nations have listed ETIM as a terrorist group, though there is some discrepancy internationally over whether ETIM and TIP are the same entity as China says, and experts have questioned their cohesiveness.\n\nWestern countries have long been reluctant to share intelligence with China or otherwise cooperate when it comes to counter-terrorism in Xinjiang, saying China has provided little evidence to prove ETIM’s existence and citing worries about possible human rights abuses.\n\nThe addition of ETIM to the list of proscribed organizations comes as leaders from China and Britain have proclaimed the countries are enjoying a “golden age” in relations.\n\nThe Home Office said the group was based in tribal regions of Pakistan, had claimed responsibility for attacks in China, “maintained an active and visible presence in the Syrian war” and had detailed its “jihad against the Chinese authorities”.\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry welcomed the designation.\n\n“We are willing to work with Britain and other parties to increase practical counter-terrorism cooperation and resolutely crack down on international terrorist forces,” the ministry said in a faxed statement.\n\nChina’s state-owned Xinhua news agency also praised the British decision but said it came “a bit late”.\n\nHundreds have died in violence in recent years in Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people. Beijing blames the bloodshed on Islamist militants and separatists, though rights groups say the unrest is more a reaction to repressive Chinese policies.\n\n“Regrettably, some western countries not only fail to recognize these East Turkestan terrorist groups as illegal, but also secretly aid them, using them as a chess piece to contain China,” Xinhua said in a commentary.\n\nThe U.S. State Department, in its annual report on terrorism around the world, said there was a lack of transparency or information from China about incidents Beijing called terrorism, and said counter-terrorism cooperation was limited.\n\nIt has also criticized Chinese restrictions on religious expression in Xinjiang, like banning veils for women.\n\nLast week, Premier Li Keqiang called for greater global cooperation against terrorism.\n\nDilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, the main Uighur exile group, said in an email that Britain had given China the pretence it needed to “increase its crackdown on Uighurs”.\n\n“In China, any Uighurs that are unhappy with China’s systematic policies of suppression are all accused of terror, but China is incapable of providing any evidence able to stand up to transparent examination,” he said.",

  "latent_9705": "The fuselage of the BA Boeing shows smoke damage. Credit:AP The Boeing 777-200 series can accommodate 275 passengers when fully loaded. The plane had just 159 passengers and 13 crew members aboard. The passengers were evacuated using the plane's emergency slides and were returned to the terminal by bus. Two people suffered minor injuries.\n\nFirefighters enter a plane that caught fire at McCarren International Airport in Las Vegas. Credit:AP Virgin Australia uses the Boeing 777-300 for its long haul flights. It has said it will release a statement soon on its response to the Las Vegas plane fire.\n\nMcCarran International Airport has four runways; the fire has forced the closure of one of the four. \"Flight operations continue on the airport's other three runways,\" a statement from the airport said. Passengers run to safety\n\nVideo taken on board a grounded aircraft on an adjacent runway captures that flight's captain advising his passengers \"There is obviously an issue going on on the tarmac.\" The footage shows a long line of passengers running from the burning aircraft, after using the plane's evacuation slides. The pilot of the observing aircraft commends the cabin crew of the burning plane. \"The flight attendants are doing a really good job of getting them off,\" he says. Despite the relatively tiny size of Las Vegas, its popularity as a holiday destination means that McCarran International Airport is America's ninth busiest.\n\nMore than 30 airlines use the airport daily. Video footage posted to social media shows fire equipment sending plumes of water across the burning aircraft fuselage. According to McCarran Airport's official Twitter feed, which it is using to post media updates, the fire has been extinguished. An airport spokesman said the crew of the aircraft declared the emergency at 4.13pm local time. Flames were visible to the airport's control tower at 4.14pm and the Aircraft Rescue and Fire-Fighting (ARFF) unit was immediately deployed.\n\nThe ARFF deals with the \"hazard mitigation, evacuation and possible rescue of passengers and crew\" in ground emergencies at airports. The airport said the passengers were fully evacuated from the burning airliner by 4.18pm. Some photographs of evacuating passengers posted to social media show them pulling cabin baggage, in breach of standard aircraft evacuation procedure, which requires all cabin baggage be left behind. Plane came to crashing halt: journalist\n\nA journalist for British newspaper The Guardian, Jacob Steinberg, was on board the aircraft. Steinberg said via his social media account that the plane came to a \"crashing halt\" during take-off and there was an immediate smell of smoke in the cabin. Passengers were initially told to remain in their seats, he said, but then came a \"shout of evacuate\". \"[We] could smell and see smoke but was on [the] other side of plane,\" he said. Steinberg was presumably seated on the right side of the aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane's left engine caught fire.\n\nSteinberg also quoted another passenger saying that the fire had \"melted a couple of windows\". The plane's rear door was opened first, Steinberg said, and the slide inflated. But smoke began to pour into the cabin resulting in a \"mad dash\" to the front by passengers. \"A lot of panic,\" he said. The passengers were evacuated on foot but loaded on to buses.\n\nThey were returned to the gate, but held there because they had already cleared outgoing customs. In order to re-enter the terminal, under US law, they would have to processed again as arriving passengers. Steinberg said the British Airways crew have addressed the evacuated passengers at the gate. When the airliner's pilot got up to speak, Steinberg said, the passengers applauded him.\n\nThe pilot described the incident as a \"catastrophic failure of the engine\". \"Ground stop\" for US airports According to McCarran International Airport, the FAA issued a \"ground stop\" for a number of airports in the western United States. This means inbound aircraft are slowed or stopped. It also slows or stops take-offs at airports sending flights to an airport affected by a ground stop. The affected airports are Mineta San Jose International Airport and San Francisco International Airport in California; Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Arizona; Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah; Denver International Airport in Colorado; Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico; and Boise Airport in Idaho.\n\nThe FAA later expanded the ground stop to include inbound aircraft from Canada. Five Canadian airports are affected; they are Edmonton International Airport and Calgary International Airport in Alberta; and Victoria International Airport, Kelowna International Airport and Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia. The ground stop appears to affect aircraft from those airports bound for McCarran. The note from McCarran did not clarify the reason for the ground stop, but that procedure is normally used to slow the flow of aircraft to prevent congestion, either in the air, or at affected airports. The FAA's website says ground stops are implemented when \"air traffic control is unable to safely accommodate additional aircraft in the system\".\n\nThe most likely cause is that the disruption caused by the incident at McCarran would require some time for air-traffic controllers to manage, as delayed outbound aircraft and diverted incoming aircraft are rescheduled. The FAA has since lifted the ground stop on some airports, but has not clarified which ones. Second plane fire It is the second time in recent years that a British Airways has been hit with plane fire controversy. In 2013, a flight from London to Oslo was forced to make an emergency landing at Heathrow with one engine damaged and another on fire after fatigued engineers worked on the wrong aircraft, London's Telegraph reported.\n\nAn investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said doors on both engines had been left unlatched during maintenance and two technicians had failed to notice they were working on the wrong aircraft. The AIIB's report, released in July, said an analysis of the workers' working time records showed a two in five risk the workers were experiencing high levels of sleepiness on the shift in question. All passengers were safely evacuated, although the AIIB said cabin crew in that case had failed to act on the concern of alarmed passengers about the state of the plane. - with Catherine Armitage Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the Oslo incident took place in 2015.",

  "latent_10144": "President Barack Obama discusses the presidential campaign with “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday. | Getty Obama nudges for Hillary, hopes for unity The president stops short of a full-blown endorsement. But there's little question about where he stands.\n\nNEW YORK — Still not a Hillary Clinton endorsement — but edging closer and closer.\n\nAnd literally laughing about running against Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama didn’t leave much question, telling “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon that Clinton “is whip smart, she is tough, and she deeply cares about working people and putting kids through school and making sure we’re growing our economy.”\n\nThen, asked by Fallon whether he thinks Republicans are happy with their nominee, Obama said, “We are, but I don’t know how they’re feeling.”\n\nObama, who’s seen as nudging Bernie Sanders toward an end for his active run against Clinton, also praised the Vermont senator for bringing “enormous energy” and “new ideas” through his campaign, adding that he thinks the primary process “made Hillary a better candidate.”\n\nAnd ahead of his Oval Office meeting with Sanders scheduled for 11:15 a.m. on Thursday, Obama said he’s trying for, but not yet fully confident in Democratic unity.\n\n“My hope is that over the next couple of weeks is we’re able to pull things together,” Obama said.\n\nObama’s support for Clinton is hardly a secret. Repeatedly through the race, he spoke warmly about her and said she had the right résumé to do the job, though he always stopped short of an outright endorsement. Tuesday night, he called her to congratulate her on securing the nomination. Wednesday morning, he reflected on Clinton’s becoming the first female major party nominee with aides aboard Marine One on his way to Andrews Air Force Base.\n\n“We were talking on the helicopter about the powerful speech that Secretary Clinton delivered last night. It was a historic moment,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One traveling to New York. “The president was struck by the historic nature of last night’s speech.”\n\nObama didn’t stay up to watch Sanders’ speech, which started close to 1:30 a.m. Washington time.\n\nIn phone calls in recent days with both Clinton and Sanders, Obama has been making ever clearer that he’s getting tired of the dance. Less than 24 hours after the last big primaries (though a week before the Washington, D.C., primary) and Sanders’ last major gambit to shake up the race by pulling out a win in California, Obama came as close as he has to fully signing on.\n\nWhile Clinton was also here in New York, Obama didn’t appear in person with her, or make the surprise stop by her Brooklyn headquarters that some had speculated would be on his schedule. A joint event is expected soon, as Clinton begins her general election campaign in earnest. Next week, she’ll do events in Ohio and Pennsylvania, both states that Donald Trump is hoping to edge her out in as he tries to create a competitive electoral map.\n\nEarnest said Obama wouldn’t make a “formal” endorsement until at least after Obama’s meeting with Sanders. The Vermont senator is scheduled to do a rally in Washington later Thursday evening.\n\nWhite House aides had expected the Democratic race to be wrapped up months ago, and had rough plans for Obama to be hitting the campaign trail by April. As the fight between Sanders wore on and the president’s poll numbers continued to rise, inside and outside the Oval Office there was a growing hunger to get him out on the trail.\n\nEarnest said he wouldn’t rule out Obama hitting the trail ahead of the Democratic convention in late July, but declined any further detail.\n\nRepublicans seem just as eager to make Obama an issue to rev up their own base, where hatred of the president runs high. For months, they’ve been attacking the Obama-Clinton agenda, and Trump attacked the president again in his victory speech on Tuesday night. He’s also warned that he feels Obama is fair game to attack personally if the president campaigns against him.\n\nMeanwhile, aides have for months predicted that Obama will be campaigning extensively for Clinton and for House and Senate candidates. Wednesday, in addition to his appearance on “Tonight,” he was in town for fundraisers for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nFrom the Clinton campaign on down, the eagerness to have Obama on the trail is an almost complete turnaround from the midterms two years ago, when Democrats nearly disavowed any association with him and were specifically not putting in requests for him to appear with them on the trail. Plans are underway for how and where to deploy him, since the president is immensely popular with Democratic donors and with the Democratic base — including among African-Americans, Latinos, younger voters and city residents, as all White House employees love to point out.\n\n“It is an objective fact that in states all across the country that President Obama’s approval rating among Democrats is higher than anybody else’s. The same applies to independents by the way,” Earnest said. “That means the president is a particularly influential advocate for the Democratic nominee in the general election.”",

Steve Cunningham, administrator of Sensus Fidelium, is a revert to the Faith and started recording and posting the homilies on YouTube five years ago.\n\nHis brother, Mike, is currently a seminarian with the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter. Sensus Fidelium, which features sermons from priests in full communion with the Catholic Church, is now growing at a rate of 200 subscribers a day.

Plus, St. Maximilian Kolbe said to use the media, and most people do not get to hear good sermons.\"\n\nSteve Cunningham was inspired to start the YouTube channel after seeing the popularity of an initial upload about the Cristero conflict in Mexico. He told us about going to see the Knights of Columbus funded film For Greater Glory, sitting in a nearly empty theatre and desiring to get the word out.\n\n\"My brother and I and a friend of ours went,\" he said, \"including us, there were five people in the movie theatre, and we were the only ones under the age of 90. I knew Father did a sermon on the Cristeros, I thought if I put a video up, maybe that will promote the movie.\"\n\nCunningham didn't have very much computer or social media experience, but he was undeterred from his project. \"So I had to figure out how to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"It took me an hour or two, but a lot of people looked at it. I did another one the next day. So far, I've been doing one a day for five years now almost. Still learning.\"\n\nCunningham told us about his recent experience representing the Faith at a local fair with vendors representing mostly anti-Catholic ideologies and causes. Cunningham had good past experiences going to the public directly with the Faith. \"This was our second year doing this fair,\" he said.\n\nCunningham continued:\n\nI did this in South Carolina, for a few years. We almost had the entire fair walking around with Rosaries. I'd give them CDs, especially if they were fallen-away Catholics. My brother was with me in his cassock, he's a seminarian and had him lead a procession with the Vatican flag around the area where the fair was ... We had Messianics to the left, next to the freedom-from-religion folks, and ACLU to the right. We put up our \"Catholic truth here\" sign, I think we gave away about 200 Miraculous medals, St. Benedict medals, a hundred Rosaries maybe. Invited a lot of people to our parish. Then I decided to talk to the Muslims after we got through packing up.\n\nCunningham has seen the fruit of his efforts among people who respond with interest in the Catholic faith, saying, \"We had a guy who came out of prison, he came up and was asking my wife about the Faith, she gave him a Rosary, introduced him to me. I invited him down to the parish.\"\n\nSensus Fidelium isn't the only rapidly flourishing channel with traditional Catholic content on YouTube. The channel Callixtus, devoted exclusively to Gregorian chant, with only 111 videos uploaded so far has drawn more than 2,000 subscribers.\n\nHave a news tip? Submit news to our tip line.",

  "latent_10317": "It takes the combined wealth of about 160 million Americans to equal that of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett, according to analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nIn its Billionaire Bonanza report, the think tank called the growing wealth inequality in the U.S. a “moral crisis” and warned that the tax policy proposed by the Trump administration would only worsen the disparity, with 80% of tax benefits going to the wealthiest 1% of households.\n\nCiting the rise in wealth inequality, economist and co-author of the report Chuck Collins said, “Now is the time for actions that reduce inequality, not tax cuts for the very wealthy.”\n\nThe report found that the wealthiest 400 people in the U.S., based on a Forbes magazine list, have more combined wealth than the bottom 64% of Americans.\n\n“We have not witnessed such extreme levels of concentrated wealth and power since the first gilded age a century ago,” the report says.\n\nThe Forbes list cites Gates, the Microsoft founder, as the richest person in America with $89 billion, Amazon’s Bezos as second richest with $81.5 billion, and investor Warren Buffett at third-richest with $78 billion. Since the list was published, Bezos’s wealth has increased — thanks in large part to the rising value of Amazon’s stock — putting him at nearly $100 billion and in a position to appear at the top of the Forbes list next year.\n\nBezos, in particular, demonstrates a key point of the report: The super rich are accumulating wealth faster, making it harder and harder to break into the club.\n\nWages for workers in the U.S. have remained relatively stagnant in recent years, while chief executive officers’ compensation has grown more than 930% since 1978. CEOs now make 271 times what the typical worker earns.\n\nThis year the Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest people in the U.S. saw an 18% increase in the amount of wealth needed to make the cut. The price of admission is now $2 billion — ten times the amount of money it took to make the first Forbes 400 list in 1982.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five U.S. households have zero or negative wealth. This is especially true of minority households — nearly a third of black households and more than a quarter of all Latinx households have zero or negative wealth, compared to 14% of white families.\n\n“Such staggering levels of wealth inequality threaten our democracy, compound racial and class divisions, undermine social cohesion, and destabilize our economy,” the report says.\n\nThe top 25 richest billionaires are all white.

Institute for Psychiatric Research and made available by the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project INDI (Enhanced NKI Rockland Sample24, http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/). Institutional review board approval for this project was obtained at the Nathan Kline Institute (#239708). All methods were carried out in accordance with these guidelines and all participants gave written informed consent. We used a subsample of 309 participants, for which complete neuroimaging data were available (age: 18–60 years, M = 38.93, SD = 13.94; gender: 199 female, 110 male; handedness: 262 right, 22 left, 25 ambidextrous). For this sample, the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), as assessed with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)25, ranged from 67 to 135 (M = 99.12, SD = 13.23).\n\nfMRI Data Acquisition\n\nMRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Trio Tim, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Functional resting-state data were obtained using a T2*-weighted BOLD-sensitive gradient-echo EPI sequence with 38 transversal axial slices of 3 mm thickness (120 volumes; field of view [FOV] 216 × 216 mm; repetition time [TR] 2500 ms; echo time [TE] 30 ms; flip angle 80°; voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm; acquisition time 5.05 min). For coregistration, three-dimensional high-resolution anatomical scans were obtained with a sagittal T1-weighted, Magnetization Prepared-Rapid Gradient Echo sequence scan (176 sagittal slices; FOV 250 × 250 mm; TR 1900 ms; TE 2.5 ms; flip angle 9°; voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm; acquisition time 4.18 min).\n\nPreprocessing\n\nData was preprocessed using FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) and AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) with the scripts released by the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000), comprising: 1. Discarding the first four EPI volumes to allow for signal equilibration, 2. Slice-time correction, 3. Three-dimensional motion correction, 4. Time-series despiking, 5. Spatial smoothing (6 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel), 6. Four-dimensional mean-based intensity normalisation, 7. Bandpass temporal filtering (0.005–0.1 Hz), 8. Removing linear and quadratic trends, 9. Normalisation of the individual EPI volumes to MNI152 space (3 × 3 × 3 mm) via nonlinear transformation and by the use of each subject’s anatomical scan, 10. Elimination of nine nuisance signals (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global mean, six motion parameters) by regression.\n\nGraph Analyses\n\nGraph analyses were performed with the open source python package network-tools 26, specifically developed for the analysis of functional and structural brain network graphs.\n\nGraph construction\n\nAs nodes, we used those 5,411 voxels that covered all grey matter in the EPI images down-sampled to 6 × 6 × 6 mm. For each subject separately, edges were assumed between nodes showing high positive correlations of BOLD signal time series. Edges of physically short distance (< 20 mm) were excluded, due to their increased susceptibility to motion artefacts and potential correlations arising from shared nonbiological signal27. Most graph metrics are strongly influenced by the density of the graph28. This has specifically been shown for modularity29. To avoid biases due to individual differences in graph density, the main analyses were performed on thresholded and binarised graphs (as recommended for the study of individual differences in graph topology28,30). In contrast, weighted graphs usually vary in density (i.e., the mean weight of edges), even if the number of edges is held constant across individuals. For the purpose of comparison, we also conducted all analyses on weighted graphs (see Supplementary Tables S4, S5). Discussion of results, however, will rely on the results for the binarised graphs. We applied five different thresholds to the correlation matrix, retaining the strongest 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% edges, thereby also excluding all negative edges31. This resulted in five graphs of different density per person. Community detection and the calculation of graph metrics were performed separately for the five graphs, and resulting graph metrics were averaged for each participant. This averaging procedure was applied to enhance the reliability of findings, as the resulting measures of graph properties are robust across a wider range of thresholds.\n\nMeasures of modular network organisation\n\nTo study the modular organisation of the functional brain network graphs, we applied the Louvain algorithm32. It finds the optimal modular partition in an iterative procedure maximizing the global modularity Q 33:\n\n$$Q={\\sum }_{s=1}^{m}[\\frac{{l}_{ins}}{L}-\\,{(\\frac{{k}_{s}}{2L})}^{2}]\\,,$$ (1)\n\nwhere m is the number of modules, l ins is the number of edges inside module s, L is the total number of edges in the network, and k s is the total degree of the nodes in module s. Thus, the actual fraction of within-module edges is represented by the first term, whereas the expected fraction of within-module edges is represented by the second term. If the first term (actual within-module edges) is much larger than the second term (expected within-module edges), there are many more edges inside module s than expected by chance. In that case, s can be defined as a module and the global modularity Q, which results from summing up these differences (actual – expected within-module edges) over all modules m in the network, is increased. Usually, modularity values of Q > 0.3 indicate a modular network structure34.\n\nThe Louvain algorithm starts by assigning a different module to each node. Then, the first step is a greedy optimisation, where nodes adopt the modules of one of their neighbour nodes, if this reassignment increases the global modularity Q (see above). In the second step, a meta-network is built, whose nodes are the modules found in the first step. Both steps are repeated until no improvement in global modularity Q is possible and the optimal partition is found35,36,37. In addition to global modularity Q, for each participant, we calculated three further whole-brain measures of modular network organisation for the final module partition: number of modules, average module size, and the variability in module size.\n\nThe embedding of each node within the modular partition can be described by two graph-theoretical metrics:\n\n(i) The participation coefficient p i represents between-module connectivity and is defined as:\n\n$${p}_{i}=1-\\,{\\sum }_{m{\\epsilon }M}{(\\frac{{k}_{i}(m)}{{k}_{i}})}^{2}\\,,$$ (2)\n\nwhere k i is the degree of node i (i.e., the number of edges directly attached to node i) and k i (m) is the subset of edges that connect node i to other nodes within the same module13,38. The participation coefficient p i of a node is 0 when all of its edges are within its own module, and close to 1 when its edges are uniformly distributed among its own and other modules38.\n\n(ii) The within-module degree z i represents within-module connectivity and is defined as:\n\n$${z}_{i}=\\,\\frac{{k}_{i}\\,({m}_{i})-\\,\\overline{k\\,}\\,({m}_{i})}{{\\sigma }^{k({m}_{i})}},$$ (3)\n\nwhere m i is the module of node i, k i (m i ) is the within-module degree of node i, \\(\\bar{k}\\) (m i ) and σ k(mi) are the mean and standard deviation of the within-module degree distribution of module m i 38. Positive values indicate that a node is highly connected to nodes within its own module, whereas negative values indicate low levels of connectivity within the same module15.\n\nThese two graph metrics, participation coefficient p i and within-module degree z i , allow the characterisation of a node’s embedding within the modular brain network free of any biases due to different module sizes18 (as would be the case when simply comparing numbers of between- and within-module connections). The distributions of participation coefficient p i and within-module degree z i were visualised by averaging the individual mean p i - and z i -values of each node across participants and projecting them to the surface of the brain (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 Values of participation coefficient p i (top row) and within-module degree z i (bottom row) averaged across all participants. Higher values are shown in warm colours (green to red), lower values are shown in cool colours (blue to pink). Graph metrics (p i and z i ) were calculated for binarised and proportionally thresholded graphs using five different cut-offs (i.e., graphs were defined by the 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30% strongest edges). For each participant, individual mean maps for the graph metrics were calculated by averaging across the five thresholds. Displayed here are the group average maps for p i and z i that resulted from averaging all individual mean maps across participants (see Methods section for details on the procedure). For the lateral view, values were projected to the surface of the brain. The medial view displays graph values in the x-plane. L, left; R, right. Full size image\n\nNode-type analysis\n\nFunctional cartography38 uses the above-described metrics (participation coefficient p i , within-module degree z i ) to classify network nodes into seven different types regarding their roles in within- and between-module communication (see Fig. 2A). As proposed in previous work38,39, we classified nodes with within-module degree z i ≥ 1 as hubs (18% of all nodes) and nodes with z i < 1 as non-hubs. Depending on the participation coefficient p i , non-hubs were further divided into ultra-peripheral (p i ≤ 0.05), peripheral (0.05p i ≤ 0.62), non-hub connector (0.62 < p i ≤ 0.80), and non-hub kinless nodes (p i > 0.80), whereas hubs were classified into provincial (p i ≤ 0.30), connector (0.30 < p i ≤ 0.75), or kinless hubs (p i > 0.75).\n\nFigure 2 Node-type analysis.

(C) Illustration and anatomical distribution of node types within the human brain for one exemplary participant. Non-hub nodes (z i ≤ 1) are shown in cool colours (green to blue), hubs (z i > 1) are shown in warm colours (yellow to red). Graph metrics (p i and z i ) and the respective node-type proportions were calculated for binarised and proportionally thresholded graphs using five different cut-offs (i.e., graphs were defined by the 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30% strongest edges). For each participant, individual node-type proportions were calculated by averaging across the five thresholds. Displayed in B are the group average proportions of node types resulted from averaging all individual node-type proportions across participants (see Methods section for details on the procedure). The x- and z-coordinates represent coordinates of the Montreal Neurological Institute template brain (MNI152). Full size image\n\nIntelligence-related differences in modular network organisation\n\nAll individual-differences analyses were done after exclusion of outliers, i.e., subjects with values > 3 SD above/below the mean of the respective variable of interest. For all whole-brain measures and proportions of node types we used SPSS22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) to calculate partial correlations with WASI FSIQ, including potential confounding effects of age, sex, and handedness as covariates. Effects with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant (Bonferroni-adjusted p-values are .013 for global modularity measures and .007 for node-type proportions). To quantify evidence for the null hypothesis (i.e., absence of an association) we calculated Bayes Factors40,41 (BF 01 ), using Bayesian linear regression and the default prior42 as implemented in JASP (https://jasp-stats.org). In accordance with Jeffreys40, we interpret BF 01 > 3 as substantial evidence for the null hypothesis.\n\nTo investigate the association between intelligence and whole-brain aspects of modular network organisation, we calculated partial correlations between WASI FSIQ and global modularity Q, number of modules, average module size, and the variability in module size. Furthermore, we tested for associations between intelligence and the whole-brain proportions of each node type as determined in the node-type analysis. To study the association between intelligence and node-specific aspects of modular organisation (i.e., between- and within-module connectivity), we set up two separate regression models in SPM8 (Statistic Parametric Mapping, Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK), one for predicting the individual maps of participation coefficient p i , and one for predicting the individual maps of within-module degree z i (both maps upsampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm) by WASI FSIQ. To control for the potential confounding effects of age, sex, and handedness, these variables were included as covariates of no interest in all regression models. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Monte Carlo-based cluster-level thresholding procedure43. An overall threshold of p < 0.05 (FWE-corrected) was applied by combining a voxel-level threshold of p < 0.005 with a cluster-level threshold of k > 26 voxels (3dClustSim; AFNI version August 2016; 10,000 permutations; voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm)44. As ultimately the modular organisation of the whole brain network is always defined by both, between-module and within-module connectivity, we also tested for an overlap of intelligence-related effects in both measures, i.e., participation coefficient p i and within-module degree z i .\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe data used in the present work can be accessed under the following link: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/.",

That's because the rewards program has lowered the value of miles in the category by about 20 per cent.\n\nThe program made the move without informing its collectors.\n\nCollector Allison Peters only found out because she tried to book a vacation package to Mexico. Between the time she researched the trip and finally was able to contact Air Miles by phone to book it, she discovered her trip would now cost much more.\n\n\"I was surprised and then I was angry,\" says Peters.\n\nShe estimated the more than $11,000 worth of miles she had to book a trip suddenly plummeted to a value of about $9,000.\n\n\"I feel like they've stolen over $2,000 of available travel to me,\" says Peters, who lives in Victoria. \"I'm really unimpressed.\"\n\nAir Miles told CBC News Friday that it adjusted the pricing for vacation packages because this is a \"subsidized\" rewards category requiring a higher level of customer support.\n\nCustomers can't book vacation packages online. They must contact the program by phone. That has always been the case.\n\nMaking up a $242 million US shortfall?\n\nPeters believes Air Miles devalued some miles to make up for lost profits when its owner, Toronto-based LoyaltyOne, cancelled its controversial expiry policy last month.\n\n\"This is just another way for them to make some money that they were looking to make from the expiry,\" she says.\n\nBefore it cancelled its expiry policy, all unused miles older than five years were set to expire on Jan. 1.

It also said that collectors can use a calculator on its website that will tell them the value of vacation package miles.\n\nAfter Peters expressed her concerns to the program, Air Miles allowed her to book her Mexico trip using miles based on their original value.\n\nBut after all she's endured, she's still considering leaving the program.\n\n\"I'm not sure it's worth it,\" says Peters.",
  "latent_10463": "The James Bond franchise — with all of its womanizing and improbable escapes — has never held much appeal for me. So when my dad asked me if had seen the latest movie last week, it should surprise no one that I responded with the text equivalent of a blank stare.\n\nIt turns out he had a specific reason for asking:\n\nHaving spent the last several years studying impact craters and their history on the Moon and Earth, I was intrigued…\n\nNow I was really intrigued. Was it possible that some of the minute details to which I’d devoted my grad years had rubbed off on one of my closest relatives, to the point that he would notice the difference between a volcano and an impact crater in a James Bond film? After a bit of quick googling, I had my answer: YES!\n\nSPECTRE ‘s “meteorite crater” (lair of the evil villain Blofeld, né Oberhauser) was actually filmed in an extinct volcano outside the Moroccan city of Erfoud named Gara Medouar . Not having seen the movie itself, I did find a behind-the-scenes look at a massive (and apparently record-breaking) explosion filmed for the movie that gives us a good look at the outside of the ancient caldera. Even with just that brief glimpse, we can already say a lot about this crater. An impactor striking the surface at planetary speeds (several to tens of kilometers per second) carries a huge amount of kinetic energy, all of which suddenly has to go somewhere. The resulting explosion almost always creates a circular depression (regardless of the original impact angle) with a raised rim and ejecta blanket that thins out the further away you get. The dimensions of the crater — its diameter, the depth to the floor, the height of the rim — are not random, but closely related to each other and the total energy of the impact. If you spend enough time looking at examples of lunar and terrestrial impact craters, you get a sense for the ones that look “wrong,” and this one just doesn’t look right.\n\nFirst, as my dad noted, the outer walls are very steep and rugged. For a crater of that diameter, they stand far taller than you’d expect an impact throw them. I can’t tell how deep the crater is from the explosion clip, which is why I asked my dad if he got a sense in the movie for the ratio between depth and diameter. He estimated the depth-to-diameter ratio as about 1:2, which is much more exaggerated than any real impact craters on the Earth or Moon, which have depth-to-diameter ratios closer to 1:5. Then there’s the sloping layers of volcanic-looking rock making up the rim and the large gap leading into the cavity. By themselves, these are not necessarily indications of a non-impact origin, but you’d have to have a pretty specific and complicated sequence of post-impact tectonic or erosional events to explain the crater’s current appearance. Finally, a satellite view of Gara Medouar — revealing a decidedly asymmetric cavity — seals the deal: it’s a volcano, folks.[UPDATE: It’s actually NOT a volcano! Or an impact crater! It seems to be an erosional crater instead – had me fooled, but it’s always nice to learn something new!]\n\nThinking about this “meteorite crater,” I can’t help but be reminded of the controversy over the craters on the Moon, especially the arguments made by geologist Grove Karl Gilbert in 1896, when most scientists weighing in (astronomers primarily) argued for a volcanic origin. Making a detailed comparison between the volcanoes of the Earth and the craters of the Moon, Gilbert made a case for the impact hypothesis instead, concluding:\n\nNinety-nine times in one hundred the bottom of the lunar crater lies lower than the outer plain; ninety-nine times in a hundred the bottom of the Vesuvian crater lies higher than the outer plain. Ordinarily the inner height of the lunar crater rim is more than double its outer height; ordinarily the outer height of the Vesuvian crater rim is more than double its inner height. The lunar crater is sunk in the lunar plain; the Vesuvian is perched on a mountain top…Thus, through the expression of every feature the lunar crater emphatically denies kinship with the ordinary volcanoes of the earth.\n\nThat Gilbert felt like an outsider — a geologist trespassing on astronomers’ territory — is clear from his introduction to The Moon’s Face, and he got a frosty reception from the astronomy community. His fellow geologists weren’t exactly thrilled either, since the Moon (being so remote) was considered too speculative a topic for a solid geologist to spend time on. Yet he persisted, convinced that he was precisely the sort of scientist who ought to be studying the features on the Moon, given his experience with the features of the Earth. “[T]he problem is largely a problem of interpretation of form, and is therefore not inappropriate to one who has given much thought to the origin of the forms of terrestrial topography.”\n\nGilbert may not have changed many minds in his own time, but impact studies have come a long way, thanks in part to his disciplinary transgression. In fact, if anything the planetary pendulum has swung toward impact as the default interpretation for most features in the solar system, and evidence of volcanic activity is heavily scrutinized. Admittedly, I am biased, but I think it’s a bit sad that 120 years after Gilbert’s work, the difference between an impact crater and a volcano is given such short shrift on so public a stage. There’s even a real impact crater just over the border in Algeria that would have made a stunning backdrop for Bond’s adventures. Somewhat ironically, the 1967 Bond film You Only Live Twice actually involved an extinct volcano (another Blofeld lair), but it was filmed on a massive purpose-built set at Pinewood Studios. Oh well. Gara Medouar would have been perfect for that, except I suppose that there’s no roof to hide the heliport/missile launcher/command center.\n\nOberhauser: Do you know what it is? Madeleine Swann: It’s a meteorite. Oberhauser: Yes, exactly. The Kartenhoff, the oldest in human possession. The very meteorite which made this crater. Think about it: so many years up there – alone, silent – building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth… a huge unstoppable force. James Bond: Except it did stop, didn’t it? Right here.\n\nAnyway, I can understand bowing to the logistics of filming locations and permissions and passing off a volcanic feature as an impact crater, but what about the “meteorite” itself? Here’s a quote from the scene between Bond and arch-villain Oberhauser (Blofeld):\n\nOk, so we’re meant to believe that the “meteorite which made this crater” (more on that later) is also the oldest meteorite in human possession…really? Not having actually seen the movie, I asked my dad what the meteorite in the scene looked like.\n\nThose melted depressions are called regmaglypts, and they’re formed as the meteorite is passing through the atmosphere. All of that air rushing by at high speed creates a huge amount of friction, and some material is ablated (vaporized) away, leaving these little thumbprint-like hollows. The problem? My dad is describing an iron meteorite, like this one:\n\nBut what if Oberhauser meant “this meteorite is from the oldest-known impact“? That assertion doesn’t make sense either. The oldest identified impact structures on Earth don’t really look like craters anymore, thanks to our planet’s tendency to rough up its landmasses via plate tectonics. One candidate for the oldest terrestrial impact structure is Vredefort crater in South Africa. Only the central dome survives, the rest of the crater having been eroded and filled in over the two billion years since its formation. Compared to the relatively pristine Barringer Meteorite Crater (Meteor Crater) in Arizona — a sprightly 50,000 years of age — Vredefort is hard to spot. It takes geological evidence in the form of impact-generated mineral phases, glass spherules, and shattercones to identify the oldest craters.\n\nIron meteorites are thought to be the cores of once-mighty proto-planets that have broken apart in some violent collision and eventually made their way across the solar system to land on Earth. By definition, they have melted and recrystallized — they’re not the oldest meteorites! That title goes to the least altered, most primitive samples we can find, the carbonaceous chondrites . Visually, they are less stunning, perhaps not even immediately recognizable as meteorites, but inside they contain the birth records of the solar system. Analyzing these meteorites is the best way we have of understanding the original composition of the pre-solar nebula, out of which the Sun and the planets and ultimately you and I formed. We are made of star stuff, yes, but what star stuff? Carbonaceous chondrites tell us that. Some of them, like the Tagish Lake meteorite , even contain unchanged stellar dust particles, grains that predate the Sun. Now that’s OLD.\n\nIt’s not the oldest meteorite, and it’s not the oldest crater. Either Oberhauser has been badly misled when it comes to his collection, or the writers really didn’t care very much about getting the science right in this case. Does it really matter? Perhaps not, but it’s certainly a missed opportunity. With just a little bit more research, they could have turned real science facts into support for their story. It wouldn’t even have been that hard. Oberhauser seems to be talking about himself in this scene, using the meteorite as a convenient vehicle to talk about his own journey and motivations. Call me crazy, but incorporating some dialogue about refining a central iron core that’s ultimately flung onto a crash course with humankind by a violent event deep in the past doesn’t sound completely out of line with the Bond villain archetype. It’s a far more fitting metaphor than “the very meteorite which made this crater,” seeing as the parts of the (much bigger) impactor that actually made the crater wouldn’t be around any more to provide a backdrop for this conversation. The meteorite is the part that survived — the resourceful, resilient fragment of a much larger entity. Given a chance, the science here really could have augmented the story, but SPECTRE passed on that chance, and I can’t help but feel a little disappointed that it did.",
  "latent_10484": "Like many schools across the country, Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden, Mass., has a dress and grooming code. But this one bans the wearing of braids and extensions — a measure that many students and parents are calling out as discriminatory and racist, as black students wearing their hair in braids have been issued detention and suspensions for violations that seem to target them specifically, according to Boston 25 News.\n\nIn a statement, the school has said of its policy, “One important reason for our students’ success is that we purposefully promote equity by focusing on what unites our students and reducing visible gaps between those of different means. Our policies, including those governing student appearance and attire, foster a culture that emphasizes education rather than style, fashion, or materialism. Our policy on hair extensions, which tend to be very expensive, is consistent with, and a part of, the educational environment that we believe is so important to our students’ success.”\n\nBut mothers of black and biracial children attending the school say what the policy actually does is punish their children for their race and how it’s reflected in their hairstyling choices. The school’s policy explicitly bans braids that have extensions or any additional hair woven into them.\n\nView photos Photo: Boston 25 News More\n\nIn an interview with the Boston Globe, Colleen Cook, who is white, said that her twin 15-year-old daughters, Deanna and Mya, who are black, have served multiple detentions and face suspension — all because of their hair.\n\nCook tells Yahoo Beauty that her daughters, who have attended Mystic Valley since kindergarten, had grown up at the school seeing fellow black girls wearing braids, dreadlocks, and other traditionally African-American hairstyle — so when they asked to have their hair braided before spring break, Cook says she told her daughters, “Of course.” However, two days after being back in school after returning from spring break — and having their hair braided — Cook says one of her daughters was sent by her history teacher to the front office for her hair and sent home with a uniform infraction.\n\nShe adds that when she told the school that there were lots of other girls who wore their hair in braids other than her daughters, so that couldn’t be the case, the school then asked her to tell themother students’ names. When Cook refused, the punishments for her daughters seemed to escalate, as they were barred from their sports teams, school sporting events, and even the prom — all because they refused to take their braids out.\n\n“My girls says, ‘I like who I am in my hair. I feel beautiful in my hair. I want to leave my hair as it is,'” Cook says of her daughters, on why they have continued to endure punishments by the school instead of changing their appearance. “It’s so unfortunate that the school won’t listen to how this affects black children. It’s unfair and it’s disproportionately targeting them. It’s really harmful to my girls to say, ‘Your culture isn’t allowed. Your culture will not be permitted in school.'”\n\nCook is now working with an attorney through ADL New England and filing a formal complaint with the Department of Education.\n\nRobert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in Boston, tells Yahoo Beauty that he was contacted by Cook about the school’s policy and its impact on her daughters. But after setting up a call with the school, officials failed to call in on time, he says.",

  "latent_10589": "During most of EVE’s history, hull tanking has been a common joke—“Real men hull tank”. This has often been called “hero tanking” or “structure tanking”. It was a joke because it was generally a very bad idea and didn’t work. Ever since Kronos however, that has changed. Nowadays hull tanking is a smart strategy if you’re flying solo and in small gangs without logi. Guess where that happens a lot? That’s right: lowsec.\n\nTrendsetters\n\nHull tanking may have been a joke, but when solo 191,000 EHP Brutix Navy Issues started showing up ripping entire fleets to shreds, people stopped laughing. It was no coincidence that hull tanking went from farce to serious business in lowsec, especially in areas where Gallente ships are common.\n\nWithin the Gallente Militia for instance, creative individuals who are used to thinking outside the box began experimenting with hull tanks and ended up with ships with not only superior EHP, but also improved maneuverability. Solo pilots, such as the well known streamer Fintarue, put together a hull tanked Vigilant during the summer of 2014 and noticed that it not only had all the hitpoints of a heavily armour-tanked Vigilant, but also moved faster and was able to get on top of targets more efficiently.\n\nStill the old stigma remains somewhat, and it’s only amongst the more forward thinking that hull tanking has gained a real foothold.\n\nHull smash!\n\nThe way it works, is that you increase the buffer of the ship’s structure hitpoints using Reinforced Bulkhead modules and Transverse Bulkhead rigs, and then apply a Damage Control with its flat 60% resist profile on that buffer.\n\nHull tanking is only useful when flying without logi, and that’s commonly reserved for fleets numbering two squads or less. The reason for this is of course that there are no hull logistics ships (yet, make it happen CCP).\n\nIntending to take damage in structure also means that it becomes a form of inherent bait tanking. After all, most people think the fight is all but won when armour drops to zero. With some skill, this can be used to great advantage as people move in to maintain point or come close to whore on the kill. We’ll explore this further with the fits below.\n\nSomething to consider when fitting for hull tank however, is that the window of GTFO becomes relatively narrow because the main EHP is at the very end of total EHP. Whilst shield and armour ships have some time to react when their main tank is depleted, hull tanks are dead at that point.\n\nLet’s get what you really came here for: some nice fits and how to fly them!\n\nComet Plus\n\nIn the domain of frigates you’ll be hard pressed to find a more competent ship than the Comet. With bonuses to both damage and tracking, a balanced slot layout and good speed, it is well suited for both in-your-face brawling and kiting with railguns. The whole package is nicely rounded off with a trio of light drones which allow the ship more flexibility in engagements.\n\nThe Comet is already known in Factional Warfare to be an excellent plex fighter, especially when defending as a blaster boat. Now let’s improve that with some hull:\n\nYou will notice we’re only using the rigs for hull tank in this fit. You can of course change some things out and get one or even two Reinforced Bulkhead II’s in there, but I have found that this is the most practical balance between staying power and DPS.\n\nThe Ancillary Armour Repairer is a very nice compliment to the hull tank and also functions as a ruse. Your opponent will often think they have you on the ropes when your active reps can’t keep up with the incoming DPS, perhaps getting reckless because they think this is your primary tank and they have the fight in the bag—an excellent opportunity to overheat your guns and change the complexion of the fight.\n\nThe nosferatu can be taken off in order to fit a microwarpdrive (MWD), something that is perhaps more useful when flying in a fleet in order to apply DPS quickly or for slingshotting kiters. However, it leaves the ship susceptible to neuting and scram kiting.\n\nBrutix for days\n\nThe standard Brutix has always been well suited for solo and small gang with its repairer bonus, as active tanking allows you to absorb a moderate amount of DPS over a long period of time while decimating the enemy. The Brutix Navy Issue (BNI) is another beast however. While it is well suited for fleets with logi because of its many low slots, as well as a very handy tracking bonus, it’s true strength is solo with a hull tank. A well fit and flown BNI can wipe out an entire fleet of frigates, destroyers, or even a handful of cruisers.\n\nWith an EHP that puts even some 1600mm-plated battleships to shame, as well as a very respectable 728 DPS (using small drones, mind you), this is a beast.\n\nAs with all Gallente ships the BNI has ample amounts of structure hitpoints and CPU. This, combined with a whopping seven low slots, makes for a hull tank with immense staying power. The tracking bonus and full tackle simply deletes frigates that come within range like they were toys.This fit uses one low slot for a damage mod, but that can be replaced with yet another Reinforced Bulkhead II, producing a ridiculous 191,000 EHP.\n\nThe microjumpdrive (MJD) is there to make sure that the ship fights within its optimal envelope: scram/web range. The idea is to demolish anything within this range, thus removing any applied scrams, and simply moonwalk out with the MJD when only kiters remain. I have seen this monster eat frigate and destroyer fleets alive, and then MJD out like it was nothing.\n\nIt is a bit pricy however, costing more than any standard T1 battleship. It also moves around slowly and is susceptible to being intercepted. Consider having an alt scout with you and keep tabs on as many intel channels as possible when you’re flying this ship.

  "latent_10649": "Bowen Greenwood (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nHELENA — A nonprofit organization with a stated mission is to protect and strengthen Montana families is asking candidates statewide to pledge support to the defense of Montana’s schools from the federal transgender schools directive, sparking criticism that the group is promoting divisiveness.\n\nBowen Greenwood, spokesman for the Laurel-based Montana Family Foundation, said nearly 240 copies of the pledge have been sent to legislative and statewide lawmakers with nearly one-dozen candidates already pledging support.\n\nThose asked include candidates for House and state Senate seats, as well as the governor, attorney general and court seats.\n\nThe pledge comes a few weeks after President Barack Obama issued a transgender schools directive for students to use bathrooms and locker rooms conforming with their gender identity.\n\nThe directive has prompted opposition.\n\n“It’s part of the larger issue of religious freedom in this country,” Greenwood said. “People need to make their own decisions about this kind of thing rather than have the federal government say this is how we are going to do it from now on.\n\n“It’s a local control issue,” he said. “Montana school districts are competent to make decisions on their own.”\n\nThe foundation has posted a list of candidates signing the pledge on its website. As of Thursday, 10 Republicans and two Democrats had signed up.\n\nRecently, the federal departments of education and justice warned school they could lose federal funding if they don’t permit people who were born male to use female facilities, including high school girls’ locker rooms, the foundation claims, adding that teenaged boys who identify as female must be permitted to use the same facilities as teen girls, according to the government’s directive.\n\n“For Washington, D.C., to threaten Montana’s schools with loss of funding if they don’t comply is a classic example of heavy-handed federal overreach,” said Jeff Laszloffy, president and chief executive officer of the Montana Family Foundation. “The federal government needs to leave this issue to local school districts, that’s why we’re asking candidates at every level to pledge to do everything in their power to stop the implementation of this directive.”\n\nEarlier this month Attorney General Tim Fox said Montana joined nine other states and sued the federal government over the directive, and said the federal government was trying to supersede local control.\n\nCarol Rivas, co-director of the Montana Human Rights Network, called the lawsuit “offensive and frivolous.”\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Denise Juneau called Fox’s decision a waste of taxpayers’ money.\n\nGov. Steve Bullock, speaking to reporters in Billings Wednesday, says it‘s Fox’s decision, but he believes local school districts can figure it out better than a federal court, the Billings Gazette reported.\n\nFox said Thursday that such local control is the point of the lawsuit.\n\n“I am pleased to see that Gov. Bullock and Superintendent Juneau are on the record agreeing with me that parents and our local school districts should be making decisions about accommodating students’ needs, because that’s precisely what the lawsuit is advocating,” he said. “This lawsuit is about preserving local control of our schools.”\n\nSen. Mary Sheehy Moe, D-Great Falls (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nThe Montana Family Foundation pledge request has come under criticism by state Sen. Mary Moe Sheehy, D-Great Falls, who does not have to run during this election cycle.\n\n“I find this pledge drive a classic case of ‘pot calls kettle black,’” she said. “If the Montana Family Foundation objects to ‘government overreach’ so much, it should not be urging current candidates, not one of whom is running for a local school board position, to meddle in the operations of local schools, which are constitutionally assigned to local school boards.\n\n“The MFF is trying to convert a nonissue into a wedge issue by fanning unwarranted fears into what it hopes will become a distracting flame,” she said.\n\n“Montana’s public schools do a great job of accommodating differences and privacy rights across the spectrum and throughout the school environment,” Moe said. “They do so because they are supervised by local trustees dedicating to ensuring that schools are safe, welcoming places for all children and helping all children reach their full potential.”\n\nEvelyn Carlisle, a Democratic candidate from Culbertson, is one of the candidates who signed the Family Foundation pledge.\n\n“Is such a stupid ruling,” she said of the directive, adding it takes away from local control.\n\nShe added it could be dangerous, adding she feared someone could say they were female and enter a girls’ bathroom.\n\nLaszloffy said candidates taking a stand on the pledge helps the electorate.\n\n“Signing our pledge will help candidates make it clear where they stand, and voters always benefit when candidates are clear on their positions,” he said.\n\nRivas said far right groups and their leaders are using fear to steer basic civil rights issues into the political debate.\n\n“This pledge ploy is no surprise coming from a group that has long villainized LGBT people and is leading the anti-public education efforts in the state,” she said, adding many of the youth success stories of the last 50 years are young women of “the Title IX revolution” who broke barriers to excel at athletics and succeed well into college.\n\n“Transgender students, like all students, deserve to be included and protected in our public schools as a place for all youth to thrive,” she said.\n\nEarlier this month the foundation released a survey that found that 62 percent of 450 Montanans responding to its poll opposed the directive while 29 supported it.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nThe pledge\n\nHere is the pledge the candidates were asked by the Montana Family Foundation to support: “I pledge to do everything within my power as an elected official to stop the federal Transgender Schools Directive and block its implementation in Montana.”\n\nTaking the pledge\n\nThe Montana Family Foundation is keeping a list of candidates who have taken the pledge at:\n\nhttp://montanafamily.org/candidates-signed-pledge/\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/29XVZ8l",

So how did your team do?\n\nHow These Work\n\nAs we have in the past, these charts are based on Football Outsiders' DYAR stat, which compiles everything a player does on the field—yards, catches, third down conversions, touchdowns—and adjusts them against the quality of the defense each week to give you a sense of how much each player has produced, not how well they've played per touch, or per game. So a player who's been shockingly productive in a small amount of carries (Toby Gerhart, say) will look good, but not off the charts good. Offensive line is broken into run blocking and pass protection stats, also provided by FO.\n\nThe charts have three colors: BLUE, GREY, and RED. Blue means a team is above league average at that position, and the larger the bubble, the better they are. Grey means a team is below league average at that position, and the smaller the bubble, the worse they are. Red is god awful, and means the position isn't just below average, it's actually below replacement level (similar to the replacement level from WAR in baseball). It means the team could, hypothetically, hire a bunch of free agents off the street and get better production than its paid starters. A larger red bubble is worse than a smaller red bubble, but any red at all is disastrous.\n\nAs an illustration, here's each position progressing from the best squad in the NFL (i.e. \"Broncos\" at QB) to the worst squad in the NFL (\"Ravens\" at RB):\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've split the charts into playoff teams and non-playoff teams, so you can see that Cincinnati, 17th overall, has the worst offense of anyone in the postseason, while the Bears, sixth, have the best offense of the non-playoff teams. We tried to make the charts as easy to understand for non-nerds as possible, but let us know if you've got any questions.\n\nA few year-end takeaways:\n\nWe say this every single time, but oh my god Blaine Gabbert . Despite playing just three games this season, he led the league in negative DYAR with -434. Brandon Weeden played in eight games and was second with -429. These are remarkable numbers, given that DYAR is a counting stat. Willis McGahee is also third-worst in the league having appeared in just 12 games after the Browns traded away Trent Richardson (Richardson's composite DYAR was ninth-worst among running backs).\n\n.

These are remarkable numbers, given that DYAR is a counting stat. is also third-worst in the league having appeared in just 12 games after the Browns traded away (Richardson's composite DYAR was ninth-worst among running backs). The two running backs below McGahee are both from the same backfield. Ray Rice and Bernard Pierce have been dreadful all season, and while this does reflect serious dropoffs in their play and the high rate of carries they continue to get, it also reflects a team-wide malady that DYAR can't quite capture. The Ravens offense is broken, as you can see from Baltimore having the worst rushing stats of any offensive line. DYAR attempts to separate those, but it's very hard to do so (Correction: DYAR doesn't attempt to separate these stats. The Ravens terrible O-line stats and the Ravens terrible running back DYAR are definitely interconnected). So while they've produced the worst results in the league, we're not sure anyone could have done much better.\n\nand have been dreadful all season, and while this does reflect serious dropoffs in their play and the high rate of carries they continue to get, it also reflects a team-wide malady that DYAR can't quite capture.

So while they've produced the worst results in the league, we're not sure anyone could have done much better. One position that doesn't see many negative figures for DYAR is wide receiver. This, we think, illustrates a fundamental truth about the position, namely that it's a lot easier to find replacement level wide receivers off the scrapheap than it is to find, say, a quarterback. This is compounded by the fact that wide receivers are more likely to see their involvement in the offense cut if they perform poorly, so it's hard to accumulate large negative DYAR values.\n\nThat makes it all the more astonishing that the Browns have the two worst WRs in the league, Greg Little and Davone Bess (-171 and -134 respectively) while also having the third best in Josh Gordon (+389, in 14 games).\n\nand (-171 and -134 respectively) while also having the third best in (+389, in 14 games).

  "latent_10708": "Welcome everyone to the Deck Spotlight series, where we are going to be traveling down the meta highway once again. Today we have Token Mage, an aggressive Willpower based deck. The thing I like a lot about Token Mage is that it reminds me of a Magic: The Gathering deck, especially White/Red Aggro. You have your token producers, creatures with power higher than their Magicka costs, burn spells and anthems. A lot of these cards and the strategy as a whole is fairly straight forward, but it still requires a good mind for sequencing and spacing threats to optimize damage, so there is a decent amount of skill involved. Of course there are always the Marked Man into Ring + Pit Lion into super aggro draws, but for the most part Mage requires more decision making than other Token lists.\n\nWhy Mage?\n\nThe most common Tokens deck is Crusader, and over the past while Token Monk has been popping up (Poor Token Spellsword, you will be missed), so the question is; why Mage? The primary answer for me is burn spells. Mage gives the ability to have reach, particularly Lightning Bolt and Camlorn Hero, that can push through damage in clutch moments. Crusader has Charge creatures or Shield Breaker to give beats, while Monk has movement abilities, but simple burn spells are just so much cleaner. Burn spells don’t get stopped by Guard creatures or sudden Prophecies, they say “I go face” and move on.\n\nIntelligence also gives Tokens access to a decent amount of card advantage. Ayrenn is a great example of this, being a good threat and drawing an action. The best part is, these actions are mostly either token creators or more burn spells. Playing Ayrenn and drawing a Scouting Patrol and then getting to cast that for free is really good play, and that’s not even her best possible outcome. In a late game scenario, you can cast Lightning Bolt, play Ayrenn, redraw that Lightning Bolt and send it upstairs again for a massive burst of damage. To a smaller extent, Wardcrafter offers a sort of card advantage in that it takes two hits to kill, or Wards a friend so it can win out in combat. Now, to be fair, Mage doesn’t have access to as much card advantage as Crusader does, but it’s hard to compete with Crusader’s Assault and Ulric’s Housecarl. So as a result, Token Mage picked up Barbas. As a base, Barbas is a 5 Magicka 3/3 Charge, which is fairly poor in an aggressive deck, but with his ability to draw Daedra he offers a lot in the card drawing department. Plus, when you get to chain Barbas into another Barbas, it feels really damn good.\n\nOther Potential Inclusions\n\nSo right off the bat, a lot of people’s Tokens decks look different. Some people like Grisly Gourmet, some people hate it, for example. So for me, there are a couple cards I have skipped out on for mostly personal reasons. The one I want to touch on first is Daggerfall Mage. The reason is simple; it’s just too slow. The card drawing potential of this card is massive and can snowball games just on its own, but in a Tokens deck you want to try and snowball games anyways, so taking 4 Magicka to suit up a creature and draw a card is just too slow and grindy too me. What Daggerfall Mage does is it gives Mage a fairly decent mid-game to overwhelm opponents and offer as many threats as possible, which I do like.\n\nHaafingar Marauder is another card I’ve passed on. Haafingar Marauder does one thing in aggressive decks; end games. This card is a beast in closing out games. In addition, and something I’ll touch on later, it makes your Ramp Scout match-up virtually unlosable. Marauder also had a pseudo-Summon effect in that it can give value as soon as it hits the board, given that you break a Rune immediately. My issue with Haafingar Marauder is threefold: It doesn’t help this deck not lose to Ice Storm (That is, unless you manage to get an item that boosts toughness), it is a little costly at 5 Magicka in an aggro deck, and it has the word “random” in its text box. These issues are really small, and aren’t deal breakers at all, just reasons I don’t include it personally.\n\nLegate Rikke is the final one-of I haven’t included. And again, I have no real issue with this card. Most of the creatures that cost 2 Magicka and under are all Imperial, so you can play Legate Rikke into one of these cheap creatures for immediate value. I’m sure Rikke could slot in over Barbas or cutting one of the less-important cards like a Grisly Gourmet.\n\nThe other very simple inclusions for this deck would be the third copies of Cloudrest Illusionist and Imperial Reinforcements. I trimmed on them both to add in two copies of Grisly Gourmet. My reasoning is fairly simple, I would just rather have three-drops than four-drops in my aggro deck. If Legate Rikke would be added, I would want the last Imperial Reinforcements for sure.\n\nMatchups\n\nThe main reason to play Token Mage, and Tokens decks in general is their Ramp matchups. These Tokens decks beat up on Ramp, with a constant stream of pressure and the ability to hit the board really fast. Ramp also was a horrible time dealing with wide boards, and nobody goes wider than a deck with token producers. Ramp Scout in particular plays essentially zero Prophecies, so you get to go to town on them and not worry about a rogue Prophecy ruining your day.\n\nWhile Ramp is technically a control deck, other control decks can be much, much more of an issue. Ice Storm is the bane of Tokens, and to a smaller extent board clears like Dawn’s Wrath or Immolating Blast. Control Mage is very good against aggressive decks, so watch out for them. Any Control Sorcerer or Control Battlemage brews could also be this deck’s downfall.\n\nToken Mage’s midrange match-ups are also pretty good. This deck preys on midrange decks like Assassin or Sorcerer, as you can get underneath them and they have no way to sweep your board. The two things midrange strategies have to defeat tokens are Skaven Pyromancer and Goblin Skulk, as they are cheap enough to hit you before you’ve fully developed and they can pick off more than one of your creatures. So by default, Midrange Archer is the worst of all the midrange match-ups, even though it is still favored for you.\n\nIn terms of aggro mirrors, Token Mage has a couple of advantages, but a couple of downsides. One advantage is Wardcrafter. It lets you fight for the board early and protect the creatures you really care about like Hive Defenders or Bruma Profiteer. As noted earlier, the burn is very helpful in closing games quickly and can win you damage races very easily. Its downsides are that your creatures just aren’t as big as other aggro deck’s creatures. Orcs get to play with big beaters, Goblins start out small and get bigger, and Token Crusader gets to play with Rift Thane. So if you want an advantage in these matchups, you need to hit the ground running and try to snowball quickly.\n\nAftermath\n\nSo there we have it. Token Mage in the pocket, out of sight. Throughout the past month or so I’ve always had Token Crusader in my arsenal, but I swapped to Token Mage about a week ago and I couldn’t be happier. This deck is far more up my alley than Crusader with the Lightning Bolts and Ayrenn, so my bias can’t recommend it enough. And as an even better selling point, this deck obliterates Ramp decks. I had a game versus Ramp Scout where I went nothing turn one, turn two Priest of the Eight (Which didn’t draw a card) that got blocked by a Dark Guardian, turn three Camlorn Hero and I still won easily. That is maybe the rockiest start I’ve ever seen this deck have; no turn one, bad turn two that gets blocked, good/average turn three, and it wasn’t even close. So if you’re sick of seeing Ramp decks on the ladder, this is your solution. Plus you know, this deck does other things than just pick on Ramp.\n\nWell that does it for this week’s Deck Spotlight, thank you all for reading. Next week I’ll be doing a Halloween special, so we’ll be going way, way off the deep end. So with that, I’ll catch you next time.\n\nComments",

Virtually the entire political leadership of the United Kingdom, starting with Prime Minister Theresa May, denounced Trump for giving a boost to this racist extremist.

  "latent_10899": "June 2011 marks the 40th anniversary of President Richard Nixon's declaration of a \"war on drugs\" — a war that has cost roughly a trillion dollars, has produced little to no effect on the supply of or demand for drugs in the United States, and has contributed to making America the world's largest incarcerator. Throughout the month, check back daily for posts about the drug war, its victims and what needs to be done to restore fairness and create effective policy.\n\nThe \"war on drugs\" has had a devastating impact on women and families, who have been greatly affected by policies like mandatory minimum sentences, prosecution of low-level drug offenses, increased conviction and imprisonment of those with relationships to drug dealers, and criminalization of women with drug addiction and mental health problems and histories of sexual abuse.\n\nAs the ACLU report \"Caught in the Net\" details, the number of women with convictions, especially low-level drug-related convictions, has skyrocketed. Over the past two decades, the number of women in prison increased at a rate nearly double that of men. Women of color are disproportionately affected: African-American women are more than three times as likely as white women to be incarcerated, and Hispanic women are 69 percent more likely. Two thirds of women state prisoners are the mothers of minor children.\n\nWhen individuals leave prison, they face a host of barriers to obtaining housing, employment, education and subsistence benefits for themselves and their children — including bars on receiving governmental assistance based on prior drug convictions. Women of color, who are disproportionately poor and often bear the primary responsibility for raising their children, are disproportionately dependent on the government to satisfy their basic human needs through programs like public housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid, and therefore are particularly impacted by governmental bans on receiving such assistance based on prior drug convictions.\n\nWomen also are affected by policies targeting members of their families who are involved in the criminal justice system. For example, women who live in public housing may be evicted if a member of their household engages in criminal activity, and people with criminal histories are frequently denied admission to public housing in the first place. In 2002 alone, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that 46,657 applicants for conventional, project-based public housing were denied admission because of \"one strike\" criteria (the policy of excluding people with criminal records from public housing). Advocates believe the number of people actually denied housing is, in fact, far higher, because would-be applicants are often turned away by housing officials before they even fill out an application.\n\nMany public housing authorities additionally maintain lists of \"banned\" individuals who are not allowed on the premises — some of these banned individuals have criminal drug convictions or went through the juvenile justice system; others were arrested but never prosecuted or convicted of any offense. Once someone is on the list, he or she is not allowed on the property of the public housing authority, even if invited by a resident of the housing complex. As a result, residents of some public housing properties are not allowed to invite members of their families to come to their homes to help care for children or elderly relatives, or to visit with family at holidays or important gatherings. These banning policies tear families apart.\n\nRecently, the ACLU successfully challenged one such banning policy in Annapolis, Maryland, where Dalanda Moses had lived in public housing with her family for most of her life. In 2009, she and her boyfriend, James Alexander, had a baby girl named Mariah. Because James was on the housing authority's banned list after being arrested for a drug offense, he was not permitted to visit Dalanda while she was pregnant. During her pregnancy, Dalanda suffered from health problems; nevertheless, the Housing Authority for the City of Annapolis (HACA) told Dalanda's mother that she and Dalanda would be evicted if James came to their home. As a result, James had to pick Dalanda up away from her home in order to take her to doctors' appointments. After Mariah was born, Dalanda was forbidden from inviting James into her home to help feed and care for their daughter. Dalanda was ultimately forced to move off HACA property - away from her own mother and sister — so that James could help raise their baby and be a part of her family.\n\nAs Dalanda's story illustrates, public housing authorities' banning policies — which affect a large number of people who have been charged with low-level drug offenses, and particularly poor women of color — force people to choose between affordable housing and spending time with their families.\n\nThankfully, the problems in Annapolis have been rectified, and families living in public housing there will no longer be torn apart by unfair banning policies. Unfortunately, public housing authorities across the United States continue to utilize bans of this type, either as official policies or as a matter of practice — including in New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, Illinois, Alabama, Minnesota, West Virginia, Maine, Oregon, and many other states.\n\nIt is time for this war on families to end. The 40-year-old \"war on drugs\" has been a war of little success but huge casualties. The collateral damage of this war far exceeds any benefits. We must reform this country's drug policies to stop fighting our own citizens and instead enact policies that help those individuals who need mental and physical health care to cure addictions (approximately 80 percent of women in state prisons have substance abuse problems), and that provide jobs and economic opportunity for all members of our society so that dealing drugs is no longer the best-paying job available. It is time for our government to work to improve the lives of all members of our community rather than continuing to fight this war against poor women of color and their children.\n\nLearn more about drug law reform : Sign up for breaking news alerts, follow us on Twitter, and like us on Facebook.",

  "latent_11702": "Danny Jacob is a busy man. Coming off of the massive success of Phineas and Ferb, he’s has teamed back up with that show’s creators for Milo Murphy’s Law, a Disney XD series starring “Weird” Al Yankovic as a middle school kid who keeps an upbeat attitude in the face of the world’s worst luck. The LA guitarist and composer is also currently producing songs for TV series including Sofia the First, Elena of Avalor, and more. We talked to Danny about the new show, and about the unique challenges of writing music for comedy.\n\nDanny Jacob: Hi, Garrett!\n\nNerdspan: Hi, Danny, how are you?\n\nDJ: I’m good! How are you, sir?\n\nNS: I’m doing well. I’ve had a weird string of luck lately, so I’m really grooving on Milo Murphy’s Law.\n\nDJ: A string of luck, you say?\n\nNS: Well…kind of…bad luck\n\nDJ: Ha! A la Milo. Well, he knows how to turn it into good luck, so we should keep watching the show.\n\nNS: You know, I’m fascinated by this whole thing. The construct lets you have an action show without an antagonist, and I think that’s brilliant.\n\nDJ: Right. Hey, right, if you’re a Phineas and Ferb fan, there was always an antagonist. That’s a really good point.\n\nNS: I’m absolutely loving it. So I know you’ve talked some before about where you’ve come from and how you got into the business. What I’m curious about is some of the mechanics of scoring for comedy, if that’s alright.\n\nDJ: No, it’s fine! So, scoring for comedy, how I do it?\n\nNS: Well I know there are some unique challenges when you’re looking at, “okay, do I downplay a joke and score this straight? Or do I lean into the joke?” The chase scene with the wolf and the bees being played straight, versus something like the egg drop scene.\n\nDJ: I mean, you brought up a cue that’s such a perfect illustration. So, on that cue, you’re talking about, “That park was named for Peter Coyote! There are no coyotes here! He set this up as a wolf preserve!” And Zach goes, “You get how that’s not better, right?” And the next cut, they’re being chased by wolves?\n\nNS: That’s exactly the one.\n\nDJ: So the story on that cue is, I played through a whole scene that they had cut out. All through the scene I just said, I was playing scary stuff, and we decided to cut it because it was funnier just to hear the dialogue. And then to see the look in Zach’s eyes when he says, “You get that that’s not better,” it did make it funnier. So it’s not an exact science. But I find that with my bosses, who are the same creators that created Phineas and Ferb, Dan Povenmire and Jeff “Swampy” Marsh, they like to just lay out of the jokes. So every time I play into ’em, which I do less and less…playing into it is great, but they don’t need any kind of funny percussion sound or something. They’re really great showrunners, so I’m finding with them that less is more when it comes to the jokes.\n\nNS: I totally get that. So you’ve been working with them for about ten years, right?\n\nDJ: Yeah, I mean for me, Phineas was a ten-year project. Maybe for the public it was eight years on television, but for me it was ten years, yeah.\n\nNS: So do you mind describing your workflow with them a little bit?\n\nDJ: Yeah, I like to think that it’s evolved, just like we’ve all evolved. Milo’s not quite Phineas but there’s a connectivity, and it feels great that we’re keeping the band together, you know what I mean? Some of same storyboard people, obviously the same creators, same music, same composer. The composer will get an episode last. Music is the last thing. So by the time I get it, it’s already been created and worked out. The thing that’s different is Phineas – and to a lesser degree Milo, but especially Phineas – was a song-driven series. And how I got Phineas was I’ve been a musician my whole life and what I got really good at was production. I love producing records, and producing songs, and that was sort of my door to becoming a composer. I’m answering your question in sort of a roundabout way, but the process starts with a song, and that’ll come way before the score. They’ll send me a song demo, it’ll just be a silly song on a guitar. And I won’t even know what it’s about, or what episode, or what the plot is, but I’ll listen to the lyrics, and they’ll tell me what kind of style they want, and then I’ll do a fully-produced song, a record. And then months later, I’ll do what’s called a “spot.” I’ll sit in a room, and we’ll watch the episode. And I’ll hear the song I did months ago and go, “Oh, I get it!” Like the video, it was just on TV, “Rooting for the Enemy,” it’s a song about how Milo’s football team always loses from his high school, so he rooted for the other team, and that’s how his team won, the Geckos.\n\nBut I didn’t know that. All I knew is they wanted a funk groove, and some grunge guitar, “Weird” Al Yankovic, who’s the star of the show, to sing it. And then, they’ll temp it. They’ll have an idea of what they want to do and they’ll pull music from Independence Day, Jaws, 10 Cloverfield Lane, there’s a lot of action/adventure crazy stuff when things go wrong for Milo. And then I’ll have an idea what they want on some of the scenes, and then I take it home and do the magic in my home studio.\n\nNS: Awesome, well you touched on like four different things I wanted to ask you about. So you mentioned the temp track, and I know that’s kind of a hot topic right now. I was wondering about the degree to which temp music is helpful for you and how you use it…I know some composers feel obligated to hew close to it, but the preference for a lot of composers is to just use it as a jumping off point, so I was kind of wondering where you fall on that.\n\nDJ: You know, I think a lot of that comes down to how confident you are in your bosses. In my case, everyone has amazing gifts to bring to our business, and they all come in different shapes and forms. In the case of Dan and Swampy, they’re musicians. They really are confident. And they’re also not insecure to admit that they may be wrong or unsure. So I love that. Because I respect them so much, they’ll temp something and it’s just helpful. I think the hardest part of starting a cue is, “Okay, what is it supposed to be? Who is this character?” I mean, once I figure that out there’s still a ton of hard work to do, but at least I know where this is supposed to go now. Well, if they temp something, and it works most of the time, I know where it’s supposed to go.\n\nNS: I don’t want to jump around too much, but I wanted to ask – when you look at an individual episode, the music has to do so much so quickly. Like the :Undergrounders” episode. There’s the trainwreck, and then the French music, and then the music when they go underground. Or the joke with the physics teacher and the desk in the egg episode, where you just utterly commit to that romantic funk groove and then abandon it…how do you compartmentalize all that? Do you sit and score the entire episode and then they chop that up, or do you have to take it, like, ten seconds at a time because so much stuff is happening?\n\nDJ: That’s a really good question. That goes back to the spot, and what’s great about my team is that we sit there together. By the time we’re looking at it they’ve seen it 100,000 times already, so it’s not fair to me, because I’m finally seeing it for the first time. (joking) But their job is to tell me what they want. So they’ll sit there, and sometimes like on the scene you were talking about with the teacher, I think that I just said, “FILM NOIR! Come on, let’s just go there, let’s just get really romantic and sexy.” It just happened together. I can’t remember who came up with that. But once somebody said “film noir,” I jumped on it. I think it works well. And it’s romantic; it’s not cheesy. I had a real woodwind guy, and I think that was the way to go rather than do something contemporary.\n\nNS: I agree; I think it works. So how do you switch modes so quickly, or is that just something that comes with years of practice? I mean in the span of 60 seconds of that show you might hear 3 or 4 completely different cues.\n\nDJ: That’s a good question. I believe that compared to Phineas, Milo is less stoppy-starty. But I’ll answer in two ways. The first answer is, by the time you’re done with a successful series like Phineas, you are forced through fear of mediocrity or being fired (and my biggest fears are mediocrity and being fired) to learn everything. There’s nothing like a deadline. There’s nothing like a real-world deadline to make you stay up late, and do whatever you gotta do to learn the style. So at this point, I have had to do every style, you know? My biggest strength is, I come from being a guitar player. I’m an LA guitar player that’s played every bar, every bar mitzvah, every nightclub. I did tons of sessions, I toured with big stars, I know what it’s like to play with a band, so I bring that to the table. And then it’s just been getting my chops up, falling in love with the orchestra. Starting out by the seat of my pants, and then studying it more seriously as time went on.\n\nNS: I know there’s some orchestral stuff in there and some sample stuff in there, how do you decide when to do what? I assume time and budget affect that.\n\nDJ: Yeah, you mean whether it’s live or sampled? For my world, when it comes to the big orchestral stuff, it’s always going to be samples. That’s just sadly the way of the world. But what happened to Phineas and hopefully will happen to Milo is when a show is successful then you get to do hour-long versions, or a movie. And then they give you a bigger budget, and you get to go actually work with a part of an orchestra, or a whole orchestra. That was the thrill of my life on the Phineas movie, and I hope to get to do it again with Milo. But if you listen to the main orchestral stuff, it’s always samples. But what I have done on Milo that was my idea, and it worked, and they’re giving green light, is big band stuff, instead of your basic action-adventure. When something perilous happens, there’s a few times now where I’ll do screamin’ Buddy Rich-style kind of big band. And that’s when I draw from my years of playing with all the great LA players, and I get live guys.\n\nNS: That’s great. And it makes a difference. The flood, in the first episode? There was big band some stuff in that, right? That was a lot of fun.\n\nDJ: Okay, so that one you’re talking about went from a techno kind of thing to big band. It started out all techno. And then we were watching together and at the point where the big band ending up being, they said, “Okay, I don’t want to hear that anymore,” or something like that. “What are we going to do?” And we were talking about what to do and somebody blurted out, “Big band!” I mean, it was that fast. I might’ve said it. I don’t know. But as soon as the idea popped up, I said, “Oh, yeah. I’m going to do that. And I’m going to call the guys, and I’m going to do something frantic with 13+4 chords all over the place, and just…fast. Weather Report chords, you know?\n\nNS: Yeah! Well, and I think it works. When I first heard it, it didn’t sound like a substitution. It sounded more like a callback to that heritage of animation. Like in Looney Tunes, you might hear something over a similar scene, and it just felt like it was always supposed to be there.\n\nDJ: I’m really glad to hear that. I mean I tried to make it seamless, and it was fun going from one to the other. I like the craziness about it. And I’ve done it again now a couple of times. On the egg episode, there was more of a Les Brown kind of thing, do you remember? I don’t know if you saw it.\n\nNS: So long-term organization, musically. Obviously Milo has a theme, and I was listening to see if anyone else did. You could almost just have themes for differing levels of peril that they’re in. But do you thread material through, or do you look forward to going back and bringing this material back, or is it just a constant stream of new stuff?\n\nDJ: The scariest and most exciting thing about a first season – and it should be for a whole show, however long it lasts – I’m still getting to know these characters. As you know, music is the last thing. By the time you get it, they’ve completely conceptualized and finished something. They’re five episodes ahead of me. When I do the action-adventure thing, it’s always new. And it’s not going to get locked into an exact formula yet. After a season is over, you could say that it becomes a little more of a formula. And you can hearken back to things that work. And then sometimes on a deadline you do that, and other times, if you want to stay on top of the curve, you want to push yourself and try something new. And it’s a scary thing to do. Because you only have so much time, and if they don’t like it, then you’ve just given yourself a couple of nights of no sleep. But you want to try to keep growing, I think. It certainly made me better.\n\nNS: Thank you so much. I have had an absolute blast talking to you.\n\nDJ: Same to you!",
  "latent_11708": "OpEdNews.com\n\nby Cheryl Biren-Wright\n\nGOP Reps. Smith, Sensenbrenner, Coble, Gallegly, Goodlatte, Chabot, and Cannon after much deliberation put the Constitution and rule of law before politics. Rep. Lamar Smith stated, “As much as one might wish to avoid this process, we must resist the temptation to close our eyes and pass by. The president’s actions must be evaluated for one simple reason: the truth counts.”\n\nPlease read full article for a complete understanding. Short on time? Skim ’til you get to the end.\n\nHon. Lamar Smith (TX) Phone 202-225-4236 . Fax: 202-225-8628\n\nWe should not underestimate the gravity of the case against the president. When he put his hand on the Bible and recited his oath of office, he swore to faithfully uphold the laws of the United States – not some laws, all laws.\n\nAs to the uniqueness of the office the president holds, he is a person in a position of immense authority and influence. He influences the lives of millions of Americans. When he took the oath of office, he swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\nWhen someone is elected president, they receive the greatest gift possible from the American people, their trust. To violate that trust is to raise questions about fitness for office. My constituents often remind me that if anyone else in a position of authority – for example, a business executive, a military officer or a professional educator – had acted as the evidence indicates the president did, their career would be over. The rules under which President Nixon would have been tried for impeachment had he not resigned contain this statement: “The office of the president is such that it calls for a higher level of conduct than the average citizen in the United States.”\n\nThis will not be an easy task. In fact, it is a difficult ordeal for all Americans, but we will get through it. We are a great nation and a strong people. Our country will endure because our Constitution works and has worked for over 200 years. As much as one might wish to avoid this process, we must resist the temptation to close our eyes and pass by. The president’s actions must be evaluated for one simple reason: the truth counts.\n\nAs the process goes forward, some good lessons can be reaffirmed. No one is above the law, actions have consequences, always tell the truth. We the people should insist on these high ideals. That the president has fallen short of the standard doesn’t mean we should lower it. If we keep excusing away the president’s actions we as a nation will never climb upwards because there will be no firm rungs.\n\nHon. James Sensenbrenner (WI) Phone (202) 225-5101 . Fax (202) 255-3190\n\n“¦being a poor example isn’t grounds for impeachment; undermining the rule of law is.\n\nWhen Americans come to Washington, they see the words “equal justice under law” carved in the facade of the Supreme Court building. Those words mean that the weak and the poor have an equal right to justice, as do the rich and the powerful.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution devised an elaborate system of checks and balances to ensure our liberty by making sure that no person, institution or branch of government became so powerful that a tyranny could be established in the United States of America. Impeachment is one of the checks the framers gave the Congress to prevent the executive or judicial branches from becoming corrupt or tyrannical.\n\nI do so with no joy but without apologies, just as those on this committee who voted to impeach President Nixon, 24 years ago, did. Watergate and the Nixon impeachment reversed the results of an overwhelming election and were extremely divisive to our country, but America emerged from that national nightmare a much stronger country and will do so again after this sad part of our history is over. What is on trial here is the truth and the rule of law.\n\nHon. Howard Coble (NC) Phone (202) 225-3065 . Fax: (202) 225-8611\n\nMuch has been made about the absence of bipartisanship on this issue, and I want to reiterate my position on that. Do not point accusatory fingers at Republicans or Democrats because there is disagreement. Assuming we vote our consciences and exercise sound judgment, little else can be asked.\n\n…I take umbrage to charges that some are out to get the president…I take umbrage as well to those who claim that some approach this arduous task in a gleeful manner. I take no joy in discharging this duty before us, but it remains our duty nonetheless.\n\n…I can’t see that this is going to shut down the government or tie it up, assuming it does advance to the Senate.\n\nHon. Elton Gallegly (CA) Phone (202) 225-5811 . Fax (202) 225-1100\n\nThis has been a very trying time. In a democracy, there are few more serious acts than to consider the possible impeachment of a president. I can tell you in true conscience it has caused me many sleepless nights.\n\nI wanted to hear the evidence that would prove the charges were false. I believed that was the only fair way to proceed, and it was also my solemn constitutional duty and immense responsibility. I waited, I read, and I listened.\n\nMr. Chairman, I’m not a lawyer — one of the few on this committee — however, everyone that knows me knows I believe in the rule of law — believe the rule of law is fundamental to our society. A society without laws is anarchy. Societies that ignore the laws are condemned to violence and chaos.\n\n(Original Article)\n\nThat bothers me. My district is considered among the safest communities in the nation. We have fine police officers, which certainly helps, but every officer from the chief to the beat officer will tell you a low crime rate begins with citizens who obey the law. Every citizen must obey the law, every law.\n\nHe violated the Constitution. To condone this would be to condemn our society to anarchy. Mr. Chairman, I cannot and will not condone such action.\n\nHon. Bob Goodlatte (VA) Phone (202) 225-5431 . Fax (202) 225-9681\n\nMr. Chairman, this is a somber occasion. I am here because it is my constitutional duty, as it is the constitutional duty of every member of this committee, to follow the truth wherever it may lead. Our Founding Fathers established this nation on a fundamental yet at the time untested idea that a nation should be governed not by the whims of any man but by the rule of law. Implicit in that idea is the principle that no one is above the law, including the chief executive\n\nSince it is the rule of law that guides us, we must ask ourselves what happens to our nation if the rule of law is ignored, cheapened or violated, especially at the highest level of government. Consider the words of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was particularly insightful on this point. “In a government of laws, the existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. If government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law. It invites every man to become a law unto himself.”\n\nMr. Chairman, we must ask ourselves what our failure to uphold the rule of law will say to the nation, and most especially to our children, who must trust us to leave them a civilized nation where justice is respected.\n\nIf we truly respect the presidency, we cannot allow the president to be above the law. Millions of law-abiding Americans from all walks of life, including my constituents, put in an honest day’s work, follow the rules and struggle to teach their children respect for the law and the importance of integrity. When a factory worker or a medical doctor or a retiree breaks the law, they do so with the knowledge that they are not above the law.\n\nThis same principle must also apply to the most powerful and privileged in our nation, including the president of the United States. To lose this principle devastates a legacy entrusted to us by our founding fathers and protected for us by generations of American families.\n\nI have a constitutional duty to follow the truth wherever it leads. The truth in this case leads me to believe that the president knowingly engaged in a calculated pattern of lies, deceit and delay in order to mislead the American people”¦\n\nThe precious legacy entrusted to us by our founders and our constituents is a nation dedicated to the ideal of freedom and equality for all her people. This committee must decide whether we will maintain our commitment to the rule of law and pass this precious legacy to our children and grandchildren, or whether we will bow to the political pressure for the sake of convenience or expediency.\n\nHon. Steve Chabot (OH) Phone (202) 225-2216 . (202) 225-3012\n\nThank you. Mr. Chairman, every member of our committee recognizes that this is likely the most important vote we will ever cast, and all of us would prefer that the president’s actions had not led us down this fateful path. However, we have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and we must fully accept that responsibility.\n\nBack in 1974, Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, who served on the judiciary committee during Watergate, said that she would vote to impeach President Nixon, in part, because — and I quote — “the presidential cover-up is continuing even through today.”\n\nThe historic record, the law, and the Constitution tell us that the charges against the president do indeed rise to the level of impeachable offenses. They constitute serious violations of criminal law and fall squarely within our Founding Fathers’ definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nMr. Chairman, impeaching the president is an extremely serious matter. Throughout these proceedings, I’ve tried to keep an open mind, giving the president every opportunity to refute the facts that have been laid before our committee, but now all of the evidence is in and a decision is at hand.\n\nIt has become apparent to me that impeachment is the only remedy that adequately addresses this president’s illegal and unethical acts. Allowing the president’s actions to go unpunished would gravely damage the Office of the President, our judicial system and our country.\n\nI have not reached this decision lightly. I have done my share of soul searching, I have listened carefully to the views of my constituents, and I’ve reviewed the evidence in excruciating detail. And much of it wasn’t particularly pleasant, I can assure you. And I’ve been guided by our Constitution.\n\nWhen we cast our votes, we are not voting as Republicans or Democrats, we are voting as Americans. Our allegiance does not lie with any one president but with our country. Our charge is not handed down from any one political party but from the Constitution. Every member of this body is duty-bound to put politics aside, follow our conscience, and uphold our oath of office.\n\nHon. Chris Cannon (UT) Phone (202) 225-7751 . Fax (202) 225-5629\n\nWe are at a defining moment in our history. What we do here will set the standard for what is acceptable for this and future presidents.\n\nI believe profoundly that the behavior of this president is unacceptable because I agree with John Jay, one of our Founding Fathers, who said, “When oaths cease to be sacred, our dearest and most valuable rights become insecure.”\n\n[Quoting President John F. Kennedy], “I think you gentlemen should recognize the responsibility of the president of the United States. His responsibility is different from what your responsibility may be. In this country, I carry out and execute the laws of the United States. I also have the obligation of implementing the orders of the courts of the United States. And I can assure you that who’s ever president of the United States, he will do the same, because if he did not, he would begin to unwind this most extraordinary constitutional system of ours. So I believe strongly in fulfilling my oath in that regard.” And that regard means if he didn’t fulfill his oath, the system would begin to unwind. It’s inexorable.\n\nI submit that in the spirit of our Founding Fathers and John F. Kennedy, that our first duty is to provide for the security of the fundamental rights of Americans.\n\nTo properly perform that duty, we must vote to impeach the president. Thank you.\n\nThe statements above are excerpts from transcripts of the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearings. December 10-11, 1998.

  "latent_12025": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego said it would lay off 8 percent of its staff and revamp its business after reporting its first fall in sales in more than a decade on Tuesday.\n\nThe Danish toymaker announced a 5-percent decline in mid-year revenue a month after abruptly removing its chief executive, suggesting it is facing its biggest test since flirting with bankruptcy in the early 2000s.\n\nLego said it could not promise a return to growth in the next two years, a jolting acknowledgement for a group widely admired for embracing the digital era and tying up lucrative franchises from Harry Potter to Minecraft.\n\n“We have now pressed the reset-button for the entire group,” executive chairman Jorgen Vig Knudstorp said, acknowledging the business had grown too complicated.\n\nHe would seek a return to a leaner and more efficient organization to respond to “losing momentum ... which we think could ultimately lead to stagnation or even decline.”\n\nLego said revenues had disappointed in its core markets of the United States and Europe, after a decade of double-digit growth and launches spanning Lego sets, video games, movie franchises, robotics and smartphone applications.\n\nSales related to its Star Wars line declined slightly in the first half of the year, the company said.\n\nSHARP REVERSAL\n\nIt marked a sharp reversal for a company that managed to expand and respond to rising demand in Asia when Knudstorp was CEO, even as the global toy market shrank after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The window of a Lego shop in Copenhagen, Denmark April 19, 2017.

Although the two are from countries that have long been at each other’s throats, with the Hindu/Muslim conflict playing the central role, the Nobel Prize Committee lauded them for what easily unites the duo:\n\nThe reaction in Malala’s former home country was mixed. There’s this:\n\n[N]ews of the Nobel Prize on Friday inspired jubilation and well-wishers in the Swat Valley, who spilled onto the streets and distributed sweets in a traditional celebration. “We have no words to express our feelings,” said Ahmad Shah, a family friend, speaking by phone from Mingora, the main town in the region. “Her efforts have been recognized by the world with this great prize. This is a victory for the people of Swat and of Pakistan.”… criticized the schoolgirl, fearing publicity around her case would invite further Taliban attacks. But now, Mr. Shah said he told Mr. Yousafzai [Malala’s father] by phone, “even those who were opposing Malala are happy.”\n\nAnd this:\n\nSome residents, however, clung to the conspiracy theories that have dogged Ms. Yousafzai’s reputation in Pakistan. “Her shooting was a ready-made drama that was created by foreign powers,” said Ghulam Farooq, the editor of a small local newspaper.\n\nThe young laureate herself was unfazed, stating at a press conference today that\n\n“I’m proud that I’m the first Pakistani and the first young woman, or the first young person, who is getting this award.”\n\nWell deserved, I’d say.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nP.S.: This 11-minute Times documentary, The Making of Malala, is fascinating, and a little depressing at the same time. Though the girl was just 12 years old at the time, you see Malala’s father pushing her — too hard? — to become a politician, the way that other ambitious parents might try to push their kids to become tennis stars or beauty-pageant winners (a point also made by Adam B. Ellick, the maker of the film). Moreover, there’s Ellick’s assessment that\n\nEven if the Taliban vanished tomorrow, most girls still wouldn’t be in school. Only 9 countries in the world spend less money on education than Pakistan.\n\nHere’s hoping that Malala, and others, can change that.",

Red Cross workers rescued him with a brother and two sisters — four other children survived elsewhere — and cared for them until 1998, when the growing tide of parentless children forced workers to return them to their village.\n\nThey arrived as a drought, and then famine, began to grip their home province. “I was malnourished,” Mr. Uwayesu said. “My brother would tell me, ‘I’m going out to look for food,’ and then he would come back without it. There were times we did not cook the whole day.”\n\nIn 2000, young Justus and his brother walked to Kigali, Rwanda’s capital and a city of about one million, in search of food and help. Instead, they wound up at Ruviri, a sprawling garbage dump on the city’s outskirts that was home to hundreds of orphans and herds of pigs.\n\nJustus found a home with two other children in an abandoned car, its smashed-out windows and floor covered with cardboard. For the next year and a half, he said, all but the search for food and shelter fell by the wayside. “There was no shower, no bathing at all,” he said. “The only thing was to keep something warm for the night, something really warm.”\n\nHe learned to spot trucks from hotels and bakeries that carried the tastiest castoffs, and to leap atop them to grab his share before they discharged their loads to less nimble orphans.\n\nFor days when there was nothing to eat — no trucks came on Sundays, and bigger children claimed most edible garbage — he hoarded food in discarded cooking-oil tins, sunk into trash-fire embers to keep their contents warm.\n\nMr. Uwayesu said he was hobbled in a fall from one moving trash truck, and once nearly buried alive by a bulldozer pushing mounds of garbage into a pit.",
  "latent_12465": "Members of Anonymous take part in the Million Mask March in front of the White House on Nov. 5, 2013, in Washington, D.C. Freelance journalist Barrett Brown is headed to prison in part for his ties to Anonyomus. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA federal judge's five-year prison sentence for a freelance journalist who linked to documents obtained by hackers is raising questions about the roles of and protections for journalists in a digital age.\n\nBarrett Brown was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Dallas to 63 months in prison and ordered to pay about $900,000 in restitution Thursday on charges stemming from the incident, in which he posted a hyperlink in his reporting to information obtained by the Anonymous collective in a 2011 hack of intelligence contractor Stratfor.\n\nBrown pleaded guilty in April to a federal charge of assisting the hackers after the fact, along with two other charges that resulted from his subsequently obstructing the execution of a search warrant and threatening an FBI agent on YouTube. Arrested in September 2012, Brown has been jailed already for two years and will have that time deducted from his term.\n\nBut critics of the sentence, including Brown himself, say he has done nothing that many mainstream journalists haven't also done in their work and that he is being persecuted because he does not have the protection of a large media organization. Reporters for outlets like the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Guardian, for example, have not faced the same prosecution efforts from the government for their part in publishing documents stolen from the National Security Agency by former contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n“The government asserts that I am not a journalist and thus unable to claim the First Amendment protections guaranteed to those engaged in information-gathering activities,” Brown wrote in a prepared statement he planned to deliver before the judge at his sentencing. “If I am not a journalist, then there are many, many people out there who are also not journalists, without being aware of it, and who are thus as much at risk as I am.”\n\nThe government's charges suggested that Brown, often described as an advocate for Anonymous, went further than simply collect information, accusing him in court papers of working to \"conceal the involvement and the identity\" of the hacker, to \"create confusion\" about what had been done and of communicating with the company that had been targeted in a manner that \"diverted attention away from the hacker.\" Anonymous, a collective of loosely connected groups, engages in activities ranging from online protest against big business to stealing and disclosing data. Some members of the collective have been jailed for cybersecurity violations.\n\nBrown’s five-year sentence also places a spotlight on new criminal statutes being drafted for cybersecurity. President Barack Obama has promised to support cybersecurity reform that would both expand authority to prosecute online crimes and adjust penalties for computer crimes to ensure “insignificant conduct does not fall within the scope of the statute.”\n\nPenalties for hacker crime outlined by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act have been criticized by members of Congress, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has called for reform of the law. The charges against Brown, for instance, could have resulted in more than 100 years in prison.\n\nThe ruling also comes after Obama’s recently called for police to stop “arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs” — comments made in the wake of complaints that authorities harassed journalists reporting on protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nDuring the past two years press freedom groups, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, have called Brown's case a dangerous precedent for online reporting.\n\n“By seeking to put Brown in prison for linking to publicly-available, factual information, the U.S. government sends an ominous message to journalists who wish to act responsibly by substantiating their reporting,” Geoffrey King, Internet advocacy coordinator for the committee, said in a September 2013 blog post.",

  "latent_12556": "American presidential elections are increasingly indistinguishable from the reality TV competitions drowning the nation's airwaves. Both are vapid, personality-driven and painfully protracted affairs, with the winners crowned by virtue of their ability to appear slightly more tolerable than the cast of annoying rejects whom the public eliminates one by one. When, earlier this year, America's tawdriest (and one of its most-watched) reality TV show hosts, Donald Trump, inserted himself into the campaign circus as a threatened contestant, he fitted right in, immediately catapulting to the top of audience polls before announcing he would not join the show.\n\nThe Republican presidential primaries – shortly to determine who will be the finalist to face off, and likely lose, against Barack Obama next November – has been a particularly base spectacle. That the contest has devolved into an embarrassing clown show has many causes, beginning with the fact that GOP voters loathe Mitt Romney, their belief-free, anointed-by-Wall-Street frontrunner who clearly has the best chance of defeating the president.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to find someone less slithery and soulless (not to mention less Mormon), party members have lurched manically from one ludicrous candidate to the next, only to watch in horror as each wilted the moment they were subjected to scrutiny. Incessant pleas to the party's ostensibly more respectable conservatives to enter the race have been repeatedly rebuffed. Now, only Romney remains viable. Republican voters are thus slowly resigning themselves to marching behind a vacant, supremely malleable technocrat whom they plainly detest.\n\nIn fairness to the much-maligned GOP field, they face a formidable hurdle: how to credibly attack Obama when he has adopted so many of their party's defining beliefs. Depicting the other party's president as a radical menace is one of the chief requirements for a candidate seeking to convince his party to crown him as the chosen challenger. Because Obama has governed as a centrist Republican, these GOP candidates are able to attack him as a leftist radical only by moving so far to the right in their rhetoric and policy prescriptions that they fall over the cliff of mainstream acceptability, or even basic sanity.\n\nIn July, the nation's most influential progressive domestic policy pundit, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, declared that Obama is a \"moderate conservative in practical terms\". Last October, he wrote that \"progressives who had their hearts set on Obama were engaged in a huge act of self-delusion\", because the president – \"once you get past the soaring rhetoric\" – has \"largely accepted the conservative storyline\".\n\nKrugman also pointed out that even the policy Democratic loyalists point to as proof of the president's progressive bona fides – his healthcare plan, which mandates the purchase of policies from the private health insurance industry – was designed by the Heritage Foundation, one of the nation's most rightwing thinktanks, and was advocated by conservative ideologues for many years (it also happens to be the same plan Romney implemented when he was governor of Massachusetts and which Newt Gingrich once promoted, underscoring the difficulty for the GOP in drawing real contrasts with Obama).\n\nHow do you scorn a president as a far-left socialist when he has stuffed his administration with Wall Street executives, had his last campaign funded by them, governed as a \"centrist Republican\", and presided over booming corporate profits even while the rest of the nation suffered economically?\n\nBut as slim as the pickings are for GOP candidates on the domestic policy front, at least there are some actual differences in that realm. The president's 2009 stimulus spending and Wall Street \"reform\" package – tepid and inadequate though they were – are genuinely at odds with rightwing dogma, as are Obama's progressive (albeit inconsistent) positions on social issues, such as equality for gay people and protecting a woman's right to choose. And the supreme court, perpetually plagued by a 5-4 partisan split, would be significantly affected by the outcome of the 2012 election.\n\nIt is in the realm of foreign policy, terrorism and civil liberties where Republicans encounter an insurmountable roadblock. A staple of GOP politics has long been to accuse Democratic presidents of coddling America's enemies (both real and imagined), being afraid to use violence, and subordinating US security to international bodies and leftwing conceptions of civil liberties.\n\nBut how can a GOP candidate invoke this time-tested caricature when Obama has embraced the vast bulk of George Bush's terrorism policies; waged a war against government whistleblowers as part of a campaign of obsessive secrecy; led efforts to overturn a global ban on cluster bombs; extinguished the lives not only of accused terrorists but of huge numbers of innocent civilians with cluster bombs and drones in Muslim countries; engineered a covert war against Iran; tried to extend the Iraq war; ignored Congress and the constitution to prosecute an unauthorised war in Libya; adopted the defining Bush/Cheney policy of indefinite detention without trial for accused terrorists; and even claimed and exercised the power to assassinate US citizens far from any battlefield and without due process?\n\nReflecting this difficulty for the GOP field is the fact that former Bush officials, including Dick Cheney, have taken to lavishing Obama with public praise for continuing his predecessor's once-controversial terrorism polices. In the last GOP foreign policy debate, the leading candidates found themselves issuing recommendations on the most contentious foreign policy question (Iran) that perfectly tracked what Obama is already doing, while issuing ringing endorsements of the president when asked about one of his most controversial civil liberties assaults (the due-process-free assassination of the American-Yemeni cleric Anwar Awlaki). Indeed, when it comes to the foreign policy and civil liberties values Democrats spent the Bush years claiming to defend, the only candidate in either party now touting them is the libertarian Ron Paul, who vehemently condemns Obama's policies of drone killings without oversight, covert wars, whistleblower persecutions, and civil liberties assaults in the name of terrorism.\n\nIn sum, how do you demonise Obama as a terrorist-loving secret Muslim intent on empowering US enemies when he has adopted, and in some cases extended, what was rightwing orthodoxy for the last decade? The core problem for GOP challengers is that they cannot be respectable Republicans because, as Krugman pointed out, Obama has that position occupied. They are forced to move so far to the right that they render themselves inherently absurd.",

  "latent_12912": "Democratic and Republican Senators are preparing to turn the confirmation process for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State into a platform for debating the still-uncertain direction of U.S. relations with Russia.\n\n“Based upon his extensive business dealings with the Putin government & previous opposition of efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many question which must be answered,” tweeted Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham Tuesday morning. “I expect the US-Russian relationship will be front and center in his confirmation process.”\n\nGraham was one of several senators to announce their concern after Trump settled on nominating Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson to his to top foreign policy job this week. Tillerson has spent his entire career at the company, working extensively on deals overseas, including multi-billion dollar deals in Russia. In 2013, Putin presented him with the Russian Order of Friendship in recognition of his work.\n\n“I am concerned about his relationship with Vladimir Putin,” said Republican Sen. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nThanks to Republicans’ slim, 52-seat majority in the Senate, it would take just three dissenting Republican senators joining up with Democrats to make Tillerson the first cabinet nominee to fail a confirmation vote since 1989. Tillerson could also be blocked in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, if at least one Republican Senator votes against Tillerson and Democrats stand united in opposition.\n\nExxon Mobil has extensive business interests in Russia, including large projects that have been held up by U.S. sanctions. As CEO, Tillerson opposed sanctions imposed on Russia by President Barack Obama after Putin’s annexation of Crimea. The Russian president has also frustrated U.S. diplomatic efforts to wind down the civil war in Syria by providing support to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAnother issue that is likely to surface at the hearings is Trump’s refusal to accept the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia was behind election-related of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced his support for a non-partisan Senate investigation of the intelligence community’s findings.\n\nThe first test for Tillerson and Trump will be the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Obviously, there’s been some flirting, if you will with Russia that’s a little different than what we’re used to. I think folks are a little shaken by that,” said the committee’s chair, Republican Sen. Bob Corker in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I do think sanctions should continue to be in place.” But Corker has expressed openness to confirming Tillerson. “Just from the standpoint of experience, he’s got it,” Corker said.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, also a Republican member of the committee, has taken a more critical stance. “While Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination,” he said in a statement. “The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America’s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America’s foreign policy goals to the president.”\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations committee will be divided next Congress between nine Republicans and eight Democrats. Democrats like Sen. Ben Cardin and Sen. Chris Coons, have been strongly critical. Sen. Cardin said he was “deeply troubled” by Tillerson’s opposition to sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. If Tillerson’s nomination clears the committee, he will be subject to a floor vote, with Trump likely needing at least 50 Senators to support Tillerson, given that Vice President-elect Mike Pence can provide a tie-breaking vote.\n\nMcConnell has indicated he will support Tillerson. “We need a full review of our national security policy, and I know Rex [Tillerson] will face each problem head on with American interests and security as his top priority,” he said. “I look forward to supporting his nomination.”\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who is set to be Trump’s White House Chief of Staff, also suggested in an interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe that the United States should reexamine its relationship with Russia, saying, “We just don’t believe that talking to people and having relationships is a bad thing.”\n\nOthers senators said they were open to Tillerson. “I’m not committed to voting against him,” said Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. “I’m going to do my homework.”\n\nOther Trump nominees will undoubtedly be forced to contend with the president-elect’s denial about Russia’s role in the hacks of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s intended nominee to become the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has been a vocal Russia critic, but will surely face questions of whether he agrees with the president-elect’s comments about Russia. And Trump is considering Carly Fiorina to the post of Director of National Intelligence. After meeting with Trump Monday, she didn’t immediately accept Russia’s role in hacking during the election, telling reporters after the meeting, “We talked about hacking, whether it’s Chinese hacking or reported Russian hacking.”\n\nBut Trump’s stance toward Putin and fears in Congress about a realignment in U.S.-Russia relations may dominate confirmation proceedings early next year.\n\n“It is exactly because of President-Elect Trumps statements praising Putin, his flippant dismissal of the near-unanimous conclusion of the American intelligence community of Russia’s outrageous and unprecedented assault on our election by hacking, and the lack of clarity about his own potential conflicts of interests with Russian investors, that I see Tillerson’s friendship with Putin as a very concerning factor,” said Coons, the Democratic member of the foreign relations committee.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",
  "latent_13031": "President-Elect Donald Trump stunned the world last night with a commanding upset victory over the heavy favorite, Democrat Hillary Clinton. In addition to Trump’s victory in the contest to be the 45th President of the United States, the National Rifle Association’s five million members helped retain control of the Senate by backing victorious GOP contenders in Florida, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, and Wisconsin (at this time, New Hampshire’s Senate contest between Kelly Ayotte (R) and Maggie Hassan (D) remains too close to call). The House also remains comfortably under the control of the GOP.\n\nThe NRA pumped more money into Trump’s election than any super-PAC, and Trump has a reputation for standing by his allies.\n\nHere are five fast gun law reforms President Trump and his Republican House and Senate can make.\n\nEnding Gun-Free Zones On Military Bases\n\nPresident Trump will have the authority to executive authority to pass an executive order allowing the United States military to carry firearms on duty. Our domestic military bases and facilities have been the site of numerous terror attacks and mass shootings. Trump can reverse that with the stroke of a pen. He would also apparently have the authority to end firearm bans on other federal property, but there are so many laws and regulations that I don’t want to make that claim prematurely.\n\nNational Concealed Carry Reciprocity\n\nThere is significant momentum towards establishing national concealed carry reciprocity in all 50 states. President Trump, working with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, should be able to get this passed into law within the first 90 days. There are four different bills to choose from in the House and Senate.\n\nLegalizing Silencers\n\nMaking a hearing safety device criminal was one of the dumbest things ever done under the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt… and that’s saying a lot. The Hearing Protection Act is already written and has co-sponsors. It should be passed within the first 60 days of President Trump’s administration, which is a blessing to high-volume shooters such as myself who would like to better protect our hearing.\n\nNICS Background Check Reform\n\nGun control supporters want a “universal” background checks on all gun purchases in order to create a de facto gun registry… and that’s just not going to happen. What is going to happen is that President Trump, the House, and Senate are going to work on legislation to close the gaping holes in the existing background check system so that it is more effective, ensuring better and more accurate updating of prohibited persons. This will likely run in conjunction with mental health reform to both help people in crisis obtain the help they need, and ensure that fears of losing their Second Amendment rights won’t keep people from seeking help for a temporary but important mental health crisis.\n\nAllow Importation of Collectable Historical Firearms\n\nPresident Obama has stymied the importation of historically significant firearms provided to allies after the Second World War and the Korean War through executive orders. The Collectible Firearms Protection Act will allow the reimportation of hundreds of thousand of M1 Garands, M1 Carbines, and M1911 pistols.\n\nThese are five laws that a Republican Congress and President Trump can pass within the first 90-180 days, but they are not the only laws being considered.",

Here are the issues I have encountered with IntenseDebate that need to be fixed before I could recommend the service without hesitation:\n\nIntenseDebate is supposed to be able to import comments stored in the default Blogger commenting system. I have tried this multiple times on both Atheist Revolution and Mississippi Atheists and have been unable to get it to work. After a considerable delay, I receive an error about how the server is taking too long to respond. This is a big problem that must be resolved before those using Blogger comments jump to IntenseDebate.\n\nOne of the few things I liked better about Haloscan was that it made it very easy to view comments across all posts in the order in which they appeared. When I wanted to examine new comments across all posts, I could do so easily from one page. IntenseDebate seems limited to displaying only the 5 most recent comments. To see more, you have to go thread-by-thread. They need to have a page from which one can view all comments across all threads.\n\nAfter hearing about how it was coming for months, IntenseDebate has still not added trackback. This is a real puzzle, and I expect many Haloscan users will be reluctant to give this up. I know I was.\n\nA strength of IntenseDebate is that it allows for banning trolls based on IP or e-mail addresses. Unfortunately, they have also made this system fairly counterintuitive to use. It was only by accident that I stumbled on the solution. If you have a troll giving you trouble, use the \"report\" button next to the comment on your blog. This will send you an e-mail that contains the offender's IP address.\n\nAlthough they do need to fix these issues, there are many positives about IntenseDebate as well. Here are some of my favorites:\n\nThe primary benefit of IntenseDebate over either Blogger comments or Haloscan is threaded comments. This was my initial attraction and what I consider to best reason to use IntenseDebate. It is so much easier for me to interact with commenters using this system, and it should facilitate discussions among commenters.\n\nI like the inclusion of the \"report\" button because it lets any reader notify me when they come across a troll. While I have been far more involved in interacting with my readers since moving to IntenseDebate, readers are likely to encounter a troll before I do. With this handy button, they can alert me of abusive comments, etc.\n\nAlthough I am still confused about how the comment voting and reputation systems work, I do like the idea of readers being able to vote up comments they find useful. I've been using this as well, regularly voting up comments that add to the discussion.\n\nI do recommend IntenseDebate, especially to those who are still using Blogger's default commenting system. Still, I think it is important to realize that there are some issues that still need to be worked out. The service is good but not yet perfect.\n\nSubscribe to Atheist Revolution\n\nI'll get the problems out of the way first.

  "latent_13079": "Rics survey heaps further misery on Britain’s growing army of renters, who will likely have fewer properties to choose from\n\nUK rents are expected to rise faster than house prices over the next five years, bringing further misery to Britain’s growing army of renters, according to a survey.\n\nThe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has predicted that rents will increase by just over 25% in the coming years, while property values are set to grow by less than 20%.\n\nIn the three months to January, tenant demand for rental properties continued to go up. With landlords expected to scale back their portfolios in the next 12 months, tenants will have fewer properties to choose from, which is likely to push rents higher, the survey suggests.\n\nRics said there was a lack of new listings coming on to the lettings market for the fourth quarter in a row and its members expect this to worsen.\n\nThe past few months have seen a number of buy-to-let investors sell up, including Britain’s biggest landlord, Fergus Wilson and his wife, Judith, who declared that the days of small buy-to-let landlords were numbered after the stamp duty increase last year and other tax changes, along with tougher mortgage rules.\n\nThe Rics survey was conducted before the release of the government’s housing white paper on Tuesday, which promised encouragement for private developers to build large-volume rental flats for tenants, and more long-term “family friendly” tenancies. Campaign group Generation Rent criticised the fact that these were limited to new purpose-built private rented homes and said renters on stagnant wages needed homes costing no more than one-third of their income.\n\nBut Jeremy Blackburn, the head of UK policy at Rics, said ministers had listened to the organisation and stressed that the fledgling build-to-rent sector needed a “turbo-boost”.\n\n“At the same time, we need to stop punitive measures against our bedrock small landlords. The detail on the ban on letting agent fees is yet to come, and along with any overt forcing of longer tenancies, [it] could dampen investment in buy to let overall. The government must be careful about signalling both stop and go at the same time,” he said.\n\nAccording to the Rics survey, a net balance of 25% of surveyors reported rising house prices in January. Property values are expected to continue their upward trend across the UK over the next 12 months, except in London, where they are expected to fall further. North-west and south-west England and northern Ireland are seeing strong growth.\n\nSupply and demand are stagnant. Rics said the number of properties for sale across the country remained close to historic lows, while a net balance of 5% of surveyors reported an increase in demand from homebuyers, the lowest reading since last August.\n\nBrian Murphy, the head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said rent increases in many areas over coming months were “potentially a good outcome for landlords who are staying in the buy-to-let game, but not so great for tenants in the private rented sector”.",

  "latent_13767": "Ho ho ho, happy F# Advent my friends! This is my blog post for the F# Advent Calendar in English 2016. First a quick thanks to Yan Cui who has pointed out this calendar to me last year and a big thanks to Sergey Tihon who is organising this blogging event and was kind enough to reserve me a spot this year.\n\nIn this blog post I wanted to write about two technologies which I am particularly excited about: Suave and ASP.NET Core. Both are frameworks for building web applications, both are written in .NET and both are open source and yet they are very different. Suave is a lightweight web server written entirely in F# and belongs to the family of micro frameworks similar to NancyFx. ASP.NET Core is Microsoft's new cloud optimised web framework which has been built from the ground up on top of .NET Core and all of its goodness. Both are fairly new cutting edge technologies and both are extremely fun to work with.\n\nWhat I like the most about Suave is that it's written in F# for F#. It is really well designed and embraces functional concepts like railway oriented programming in its core architecture. Lately I've been a big fan of functional programming and being able to build web applications in a functional way is not only very productive but also a heap of fun. ASP.NET Core is object oriented and closer related to C#, but nonetheless an extraodinary new web framework. After more than 14 years of developing (the old) ASP.NET stack Microsoft has completely revamped the platform and built something new which is extremely fast and flexible. I love Kestrel, I love how ASP.NET Core is completely modular and extendable (via middleware) and I love how it is cross platform compatible and supported by Microsoft (Mono you have served us well but I am glad to move on now). There's more than one good reason to go with either framework and that's why I really wanted to combine them together.\n\nIdeally I would like to continue building web applications with Suave in F# and then plug them into the ASP.NET Core pipeline to run them on top of Kestrel and benefit from both worlds.\n\nSuave inside ASP.NET Core in theory\n\nIn order to better understand Suave let's have a quick look at a simple web application:\n\nopen System open Suave open Suave.Successful open Suave.Operators open Suave.RequestErrors open Suave.Filters let simpleApp = choose [ GET >=> choose [ path \"/\" >=> OK \"Hello world from Suave.\" path \"/ping\" >=> OK \"pong\" ] NOT_FOUND \"404 - Not found.\" ] [<EntryPoint>] let main argv = startWebServer defaultConfig simpleApp 0\n\nEven in this simple example you can clearly see the core concept behind Suave. An application is always an assemble of one or many web parts. A WebPart is a function which takes a HttpContext and returns an option of HttpContext wrapped in an async workflow. Through combinators such as choose or >=> (and many others) one can compose a complex web application with routing, model binding, view engines and anything else that someone might want to do. At the end there is one top level function of type WebPart which takes in a HttpContext and returns a HttpContext . In this example this function is called simpleApp .\n\nIn theory the one thing required to plug a Suave web app into ASP.NET Core would be to take an incoming HTTP request from ASP.NET Core and convert it into an HttpContext in Suave, execute the top level web part, and then translate the resulting HttpContext back into an ASP.NET Core response:\n\nThe other thing which you get with Suave is a self hosted web server which is built into the framework and the traditional way of starting a Suave web application. The startWebServer function takes a SuaveConfig object and the top level WebPart as input parameters. The config object allows web server specific configuration such as HTTP bindings, request quotas, timeout limits and many more things to be set.\n\nWhen putting a Suave app into ASP.NET Core then it would be running on a different web server under the hood (Kestrel by default) and it wouldn't necessarily make sense to use an existing SuaveConfig in this scenario. Considering that ASP.NET Core offers other natural ways of configuring server settings, I think it is fair to skip the SuaveConfig when merging Suave into ASP.NET Core and mainly focusing on a smooth WebPart integration.\n\nSuave inside ASP.NET Core in practice\n\nTaking theory into practise I thought I can make it happen, and when a programmer says that then it usually means to google for an existing solution first. I was lucky to discover Suave.Kestrel which is a super early alpha version of the above concept written by Krzysztof Cieślak. Krzysztof is the developer behind the Ionide project which makes F# development in Visual Studio Code even possible, and therefore a massive thanks to him and his great contributions as well!\n\nEven though this project was a good start to begin with there was still loads of work left to do. First I started off by using the existing code and trying to extend it, but then I quickly realised that I was fighting more with the tools than writing any code, which lead me to the decision of creating an entirely new project written in C#. Why C#? Because the Visual Studio tooling for F# projects in .NET Core is non existent (at least at the moment). As much as I love F# if I cannot properly debug or reason with my code then I rather switch to C# and get the job done.\n\nHowever as a seasoned C# developer that was not a big problem and in the end it wouldn't even matter if the library was written in C#, F# or VB.NET as long as it would allow an easy integration from an F# point of view. Moments like this make me really appreciate the flexibility of the .NET framework.\n\nIntroducing Suave.AspNetCore\n\nAfter my initial start on the project it took me another 3 months (mainly because I had absolutely no time) to finally release the first version of Suave.AspNetCore and make it available. Since yesterday anyone can install Suave.AspNetCore as a NuGet package for a .NET Core application.\n\nI decided to name the package Suave.AspNetCore because I thought it is a more representative name of what the NuGet package has to offer. While this library makes it perfectly possible to run Suave on top of Kestrel it is certainly not limited to it. Suave.AspNetCore gives a way of plugging a Suave WebPart into the ASP.NET Core pipeline and run it on any environment of someone's desire. In theory Suave can be run alongside NancyFx and ASP.NET Core MVC in the same ASP.NET Core application and let the middleware decide which framework is suited best to satisfy an incoming request.\n\nCurrent release information\n\nThe current version should be able to deal with any incoming web request which can be handled by a Suave WebPart . One thing that is missing (but already in the works) is the support for Suave's web socket implementation.\n\nI shall also note that Suave and F# itself don't have an official stable release for .NET Core yet and therefore the project as a whole should be taken with some caution.\n\nSuave.AspNetCore in action\n\nOk enough of the talk and let's look at a demo.\n\nFirst I'll start by using one of my existing F# ASP.NET Core project templates and upgrade it to .NET Core 1.1.\n\nThen I add Suave , Suave.AspNetCore and Newtonsoft.Json to the dependencies:\n\n\"dependencies\": { \"Microsoft.FSharp.Core.netcore\": \"1.0.0-alpha-*\", \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics\": \"1.1.0\", \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.1.0\", \"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console\": \"1.1.0\", \"Suave\": \"2.0.0-*\", \"Suave.AspNetCore\": \"0.1.0\", \"Newtonsoft.Json\": \"9.0.1\" }\n\nNext I move on to the Startup.fs file and create a Suave web application:\n\nmodule App = let catchAll = fun (ctx : HttpContext) -> let json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject( ctx.request, Formatting.Indented) OK json >=> Writers.setMimeType \"application/json\" <| ctx\n\nThis app is very basic. You can see that it is a single web part which uses Json.NET to serialize the entire HttpContext and then later returns a successful response of the Json text with a mime type of application/json .\n\nIt is not hugely interesting but it is a nice function which will handle every incoming web request and output the resulting HttpContext in a more or less readable way. It's at least a good way of quickly verifying if the incoming web request has been correctly converted into a Suave HttpContext object.\n\nFinally I go to the Startup class and hook up the Suave catchAll web app into the ASP.NET Core pipeline via a middleware:\n\ntype Startup() = member __.Configure (app : IApplicationBuilder) (env : IHostingEnvironment) (loggerFactory : ILoggerFactory) = app.UseSuave(App.catchAll) |> ignore\n\nSave all, dotnet restore , dotnet build and dotnet run :\n\nIf everything is correct then going to http://localhost:5000/ should return a successful response like this:\n\nYou can check out the sample app in GitHub and try it yourself!\n\nDifferences between vanilla Suave and Suave.AspNetCore\n\nAfter running a few tests of my own I noticed a few minor differences.\n\nFirst I noticed that the original Suave web server converts all HTTP headers into lower case values. For example Content-Type: text/html would be stored as content-type: text/html in Suave's HTTP header collection. In contrast ASP.NET Core preserves the original casing. When using the Suave.AspNetCore middleware then it will match the original Suave behaviour, but can be easily overriden by setting the preserveHttpHeaderCasing parameter to true in the UseSuave method:\n\napp.UseSuave(App.catchAll, true) |> ignore\n\nAnother difference which I found was that Suave always sets the host variable to 127.0.0.1 for local requests, even when I explicitely call the API with http://localhost:5000/ . I wasn't able to find out why or where this is happening and if there is a good reason for it. In this case I didn't align with the original Suave behaviour and kept the values provided by ASP.NET Core.\n\nOther than this I haven't found any big differences and hope that it is (mostly) bug free. The project is open source and I am open for ideas, help or suggestions of any kind.\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!",
  "latent_13803": "I return often to Cambridge and was there recently. Julian Glover, my partner, was talking to the History Society at Trinity about his new biography of Thomas Telford, the 18th-century roads, bridges and canals engineer. We spent the night at Trinity, and I had time to update my acquaintance with this fast-changing city.\n\n‘Fast’ hardly does justice to the speed of change. ‘Silicon Fen’ may be a smart-Alecky sobriquet, but something huge is happening here, something very much of our time. Though the university nucleus remains reassuringly familiar, the river Cam sits at the centre of the biggest and most sustained expansion and boom I’ve ever seen in England. A new railway station, Cambridge North, has appeared in Chesterton, and Cambridge station itself has been passing through convulsive (and impressive) re-development as it struggles to keep up with the cars, taxis, buses, cycles and sheer growing volume of passengers, while huge new buildings mushroom all around. Transport pressures on the city and its surrounds are almost overwhelming; there is a building boom, a house-price boom, huge challenges with parking and access, and dreadful overcrowding on the trains.\n\nIt was on one of these overcrowded trains (standing room only all the way to King’s Cross) that Julian and I started talking about plans not only for the Cambridge area, but the whole east-west corridor through Milton Keynes to Oxford, of which Cambridge’s boom is a part. Julian was for three years the principal policy adviser to the transport secretary, and both the reach and the depth of his knowledge of the field are scary. He started mapping out the possibilities to me in his typically bish-bash-bosh way, no ifs or buts, no grey areas, but a powerful starting point for discussion. He began with the university town.\n\n‘The problems getting to the station are ridiculous. So we bury a tramway from the station, running beneath Hills Road and all the way onward through the town and out the other side, skirting but not touching the colleges along the river. Not a complicated project. Deep tunnel. Two years of traffic hell, and it’s done.\n\n‘Then a third rail station, Cambridge South, obviously. Incidentally, the M11 must be extended north to Newcastle using the Humber Bridge as it was designed to be used, and taking pressure off the M1.\n\n‘Meanwhile, we build a new, dedicated express line, possibly via Stansted, direct to Canary Wharf. The Liverpool Street and King’s Cross lines can’t take much more.’\n\nWe looked out of the train windows over the mostly dreary, flat country surrounding Cambridge. ‘And this,’ said Julian, ‘should be partly reforested. Telford did a good job draining the fens but the biodiversity of this landscape is abysmal. While we grow a Greater Cambridge of two million or more, why grow turnips all around? We should be ringing the city in woodland and park.\n\n‘Then there’s the new rail link to Oxford. It will interchange with the East Coast, Midland and West Coast main lines, obviously, but it’s vital there’s an interchange with the new HS2. And between Cambridge and Oxford: one entirely new city — or two? It’s for discussion. There’s an Infrastructure Commission report just published. It deserves to be big news.’\n\nThe discussion continued as we waited in Royston for more poor would-be passengers struggling to board. Doubtless many readers will take issue in respect of Julian’s impromptu Green Paper, but nobody who has visited Cambridge recently will deny that big thinking is needed. I find this kind of thing tremendously exciting. It was what I went into politics for.\n\nAnd here we are at Christmas 2017, arguing about Brexit. The foul air is thick with abstract nouns and phrases — ‘sovereignty’, ‘control’, ‘the will of the people’, ‘casting off our shackles’, ‘Article 50’, ‘transition period’, ‘implementation period’, ‘the European yoke’ — and we’re all at each other’s throats. One protagonist questions another’s patriotism; another spews the wartime rhetoric of Winston Churchill; the glories of the past are called in evidence; the promise of the future is cited in huge and vague generality. And there’s not a single brick, not a single blueprint, not a bridge or culvert or tunnel or garden city to be seen in this wretched war of words, which is at the same time viciously overheated yet utterly nebulous.\n\nThe whole thing has been beautifully designed for the kind of politician or columnist who couldn’t change a lightbulb, let alone get to grips with a transport plan; they’re in their element, these posturers, when the talk is of destiny rather than drains. If you consider the real domestic problem-solving that our challenging epoch calls for, this damned European thing is notable not just for the level of noise, but for its flimsiness. Look at the Infrastructure Commission’s interim report: ‘Maximising the potential of the Cambridge-Milton Keynes-Oxford corridor as a single, knowledge-intensive cluster.’ Its dramatis personae are solid: houses, steel, concrete and greenery. Look at the Brexit debate and you encounter only wraiths.\n\nAnd while we’re all shouting at each other about Brexit, time and attention are diverted from the questions we should be answering for the next generation. Whether in the end we leave or stay in the European Union, the sheer opportunity cost of this stupid distraction will be counted not least among the harms inflicted on the better part of a decade of our political history.\n\nI’m as guilty as the rest.

She lost big among young women and men alike, in cities and their suburbs.\n\nObama – the first African-American seriously considered for the presidency – was hailed by Democratic party elders as viable in a general election. Several forces thus conspired against a Clinton nomination: a broad, diverse and enthusiastic Democratic coalition backing her rival; unassigned “super delegates” to the Democratic National Convention flocking to his cause, considering him a winning candidate against the Republicans; significant endorsements from the Democratic Party establishment; and the continued presence of several other candidates in the primary race – former North Carolina senator John Edwards chief among them – who were earning roughly 15 percent of the total vote in early voting states.At the end of the day, after competing in all 50 states, Clinton nevertheless won 48% of all pledged delegates to the Democratic convention that year. Obama won 47%. She won the popular vote, but Obama took the nomination with a majority of super delegate support from the party establishment.Despite facing a formidable Obama coalition backed by significant donors and establishment support, Clinton’s support was also broad and competitive – and is even more so today as she enters a contest far less contentious with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.All the factors that broke against Clinton in 2008 are breaking for her in 2016. Clinton’s support in Iowa’s cities and suburbs on Monday night proved robust; voters from minority groups that in 2008 supported Obama are now firmly in her camp; and she maintains virtually absolute support of the party establishment, with Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, earning no endorsements from his colleagues.Should Clinton perform merely as well as she did in 2008, she is on track to win both the popular vote and the pledged delegate count – plus the requisite number of super delegates to clinch the nomination.And her leads, according to polls, in key delegate-rich states such as Florida, Texas, California, New York and Illinois suggest that won’t be necessary.Sanders’ surge in Iowa reflects a flirtation with socialism within the Democratic Party – a flirtation with a specific brand of liberalism that has ebbed and flowed for decades.That is a significant story, but different from one that suggests Sanders has a considerable shot at winning the Democratic nomination.What concerns leadership in the Democratic Party is not those who voted for Sanders in Iowa, or those who will vote enthusiastically for him in New Hampshire next week.Their concern is with voters who voted against Clinton.Iowa provided the party with its first batch of hard data, and the numbers confirm that Clinton has a credibility problem.According to exit polls, fully one quarter of Democratic caucus-goers voted based on which candidate they deemed most honest and trustworthy – Clinton earned 10% of those voters to Sanders’s 83%.Those numbers in Iowa are reflected in national polls, and they will affect her performance in New Hampshire, and the states to come immediately following: South Carolina and Nevada. But, perhaps more significantly, the question is a top consideration for independent voters in all general elections.Whether or not Bernie Sanders is a realistic alternative, Democrats may begin to concern themselves with Clinton’s own electability in November, with numbers suggesting that the base of their own party views the front-runner with skeptical eyes.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_13969": "Cover of a 2018 Michelin Guide\n\nMichelin Guides (French: Guide Michelin [ɡid miʃ.lɛ̃]) are a series of guide books published by the French tire company Michelin for more than a century. The term normally refers to the annually published Michelin Red Guide, the oldest European hotel and restaurant reference guide, which awards up to three Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.[1] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. Michelin also publishes a series of general guides to cities, regions, and countries, the Green Guides.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nIn 1900, there were fewer than 3,000 cars on the roads of France. To increase the demand for cars and, accordingly, car tires, car tire manufacturers and brothers Édouard and André Michelin published a guide for French motorists in 1900, the Michelin Guide.[2] Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free edition of the guide were distributed; it provided useful information to motorists, such as maps, tire repair and replacement instructions, car mechanics listings, hotels, and petrol stations throughout France.\n\nFour years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.[3]\n\nMichelin subsequently introduced guides for Algeria and Tunisia (1907); the Alps and the Rhine (northern Italy, Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Netherlands) (1908); Germany, Spain, and Portugal (1910); Ireland and the British Isles (1911); and \"The Countries of the Sun\" (Les Pays du Soleil) (Northern Africa, Southern Italy and Corsica) (1911). In 1909, an English-language version of the guide to France was published.[4]\n\nDuring World War I, publication of the guide was suspended. After the war, revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920. It is said that André Michelin, whilst visiting a tire merchant, noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench. Based on the principle that \"man only truly respects what he pays for\", Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide, which was about 750 francs or $2.15 in 1922.[5] They also made several changes, notably listing restaurants by specific categories, adding hotel listings (initially only for Paris), and removing advertisements in the guide.[3] Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide, the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants, who were always anonymous.[6]\n\nFollowing the usage of the Murray's and Baedeker guides, the guide began to award stars for fine dining establishments in 1926. Initially, there was only a single star awarded. Then, in 1931, the hierarchy of zero, one, two, and three stars was introduced. Finally, in 1936, the criteria for the starred rankings were published:[3]\n\n: \"A very good restaurant in its category\" ( Une très bonne table dans sa catégorie )\n\n: \"A very good restaurant in its category\" ( ) : \"Excellent cooking, worth a detour\" ( Table excellente, mérite un détour )\n\n: \"Excellent cooking, worth a detour\" ( ) : \"Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\" (Une des meilleures tables, vaut le voyage).[6]\n\nIn 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red, and has remained so in all subsequent editions.[6] During World War II, publication was again suspended, but in 1944, at the request of the Allied Forces, the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use; its maps were judged the best and most up-to-date available. Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945, a week after VE Day.[3]\n\nIn the early post-war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard.[7] The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.[8]\n\nIn 2005, Michelin published its first American guide, covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of New York City and 50 hotels in Manhattan. In 2007, a Tokyo Michelin Guide was launched. In the same year, the guide introduced a magazine, Étoile. In 2008, a Hong Kong and Macau volume was added.[3] As of 2013, the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries.[3]\n\nIn 2008, the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor-in-chief of the French edition of the guide. She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. She became the first woman and first non-French national to occupy the French position. The German newspaper Die Welt commented on the appointment, \"In view of the fact German cuisine is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France, this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian.\"[9]\n\nMethods and layout [ edit ]\n\nDishes made by Michelin star restaurants\n\nRed Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines. Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialties. Short summaries (2–3 lines) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published (though the Spain and Portugal volume is in Spanish only) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.[10]\n\nStars [ edit ]\n\nMichelin reviewers (commonly called \"inspectors\") are anonymous; they do not identify themselves, and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin, never by a restaurant being reviewed:\n\nMichelin has gone to extraordinary lengths to maintain the anonymity of its inspectors. Many of the company's top executives have never met an inspector; inspectors themselves are advised not to disclose their line of work, even to their parents (who might be tempted to boast about it); and, in all the years that it has been putting out the guide, Michelin has refused to allow its inspectors to speak to journalists. The inspectors write reports that are distilled, in annual \"stars meetings\" at the guide's various national offices, into the ranking of three stars, two stars, or one star—or no stars. (Establishments that Michelin deems unworthy of a visit are not included in the guide.)[11]\n\nThe French chef Paul Bocuse, one of the pioneers of nouvelle cuisine in the 1960s, said, \"Michelin is the only guide that counts.\"[12] In France, when the guide is published each year, it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual Academy Awards for films.[11] Media and others debate likely winners, speculation is rife, and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose, and who might gain a Michelin star.[13]\n\nThe Michelin Guide also awards Rising Stars, an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star, or an additional star.\n\nBib Gourmand [ edit ]\n\nA menu course from a Michelin rated restaurant in Helsinki, Finland\n\nA course in a Michelin starred restaurant in Geneva, Switzerland\n\nA course in a Michelin starred restaurant in Tokyo, Japan\n\nSince 1955, the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering \"exceptionally good food at moderate prices\", a feature now called \"Bib Gourmand\". They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards. Bib (Bibendum) is the company's nickname for the Michelin Man, its corporate logo for over a century.\n\nGuides [ edit ]\n\nCountry[14] Release date Bib Gourmand Establishments France 2017 Edition[15] 27 86 503 645\n\n(€32, €36 in Paris area)[16] over 3,222 hotels and guest houses,\n\n4,362 restaurants Belgium and Luxembourg 2012 Edition[17][18] 3 16 99 140 (€35 or less) over 700 hotels and guest houses,\n\n1,100 restaurants Germany 2016 Edition[19] 10 39 241 471\n\n(€35 or less) over 4,200 hotels and guest houses,\n\n2,100 restaurants, 4,287 hotels Great Britain and Ireland 2019 Edition[20] 5 20 155 143\n\n(£28 or €40) over 1,100 hotels, guest houses,\n\n2,100 restaurants, pubs Italy 2012 Edition[21] 7 38 250 260 (€35) over 3,700 hotels and guest houses,\n\n2,700 restaurants Netherlands 2012 Edition[22][23] 2 16 84 102\n\n(€35)[24] over 600 hotels and guest houses,\n\n700 restaurants Nordic Countries 2019 Edition[25] 3 10 51 168\n\n(€35) 266 restaurants Spain and Portugal 2018 Edition[26][27] 11 25 177 253\n\n(€35 or less) over 1,775 hotels and guest houses,\n\n1,549 restaurants, 130 tapas bars Switzerland 2019 Edition[28] 3 20 105 157\n\n(CHF70 or less)[29] 458 hotels and guest houses,\n\n777 restaurants\n\nCity[14] Release date Bib Gourmand Establishments Paris 2012 Edition[30] 10 17 50 70 (€35) 60 hotels, 453 restaurants[31] Chicago 2018 Edition[32] 2 4 19 54 ($40)[33] 400 restaurants[34] Hong Kong and Macau 2012 Edition[35] 5 13 51 64 (HK$300 or MOP$300) 272 restaurants, 60 hotels[36] Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Nara 2012 Edition[37] 15 61 224 40\n\n(coins, ¥5000)[38] 296 restaurants, 48 hotels, 41 ryokans Las Vegas (suspended) 21 October 2008[39] 1 3 13 127 restaurants, 30 hotels (2007) London 2012 Edition[40] 2 7 46 45 (£28) 450 restaurants, 50 hotels Los Angeles (suspended) 21 October 2008[41] 0 4 16 263 restaurants, 27 hotels (2007) Main Cities of Europe 17 March 2010[42] 15 55 271 231 1,715 restaurants, 1,542 hotels New York City 2017 Edition[43] 6 10 61 132 ($40) 857[43] Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo 2018 edition[44] 0 3 15 33 (R$ 90) [45] San Francisco and Bay Area 2017 Edition[46] 6 7 41 75 ($40)[46] 513 restaurants[46] Seoul 2018 Edition[47] 2 4 18 48 (₩35,000 or less)[48] 174 restaurants, 36 hotels Shanghai 2017 Edition[49] 1 7 18 25 (￥200 or less)[49] TBC Singapore 2017 Edition[50][51] 1 7 30 38 (S$45) TBC Tokyo, Yokohama\n\nand Shonan 2012 Edition[52] 17 57 219 95\n\n(coins, ¥5000)[53] 292 restaurants, 54 hotels and 10 ryokans Washington, DC 2018 Edition[54] 0 3 11 19\n\n($40)[55] 102 restaurants, 440 hotels and inns Bangkok, Phuket, Phang-nga 2019 Edition[56] 0 4 23 72\n\n(฿1,000) Taipei 2018 Edition[57] 1 2 17 36 (NT$1,500 or less) 126 restaurants, 25 hotels (2018) Canton（Guangzhou） 2018 Edition[58] 0 0 8 20 (¥200 or less)\n\nNon-restaurant food [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014, Michelin introduced a separate listing for gastropubs in Ireland.[59] In 2016, the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments.[60][61] Additionally in 2016, the Singapore guide introduced the first Michelin stars for street food locations, for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.[62]\n\nOther ratings [ edit ]\n\nAll listed restaurants, regardless of their star- or Bib Gourmand-status, also receive a \"fork and spoon\" designation, as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant.[63] Rankings range from one to five: One fork and spoon represents a \"comfortable restaurant\" and five signifies a \"luxurious restaurant\".

Grapes, a sake set, or a cocktail glass indicate restaurants that offer, at minimum, a \"somewhat interesting\" selection of wines, sake, or cocktails, respectively.[63]\n\nGreen Guides [ edit ]\n\nThe Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants. There is a Green Guide for France as a whole, and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France. Other Green Guides cover many countries, regions, and cities outside France. Many Green Guides are published in several languages. They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest. Like the Red Guides, they use a three-star system for recommending sites ranging from \"worth a trip\" to \"worth a detour\", and \"interesting\".[citation needed]\n\nControversies [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of lax inspection standards and bias [ edit ]\n\nPascal Rémy, a veteran France-based Michelin inspector, and also a former Gault Millau employee, wrote a tell-all book published in 2004 entitled L'Inspecteur se met à table (literally, \"The Inspector Sits Down at the Table\"; idiomatically, \"The Inspector Spills the Beans\", or \"The Inspector Lays It All on the Table\"). Rémy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book.[64] He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.[65]\n\nRémy described the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy said only about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003.[64]\n\nRémy also accused the guide of favoritism. He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs, such as Paul Bocuse and Alain Ducasse, as \"untouchable\" and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser-known chefs.[64] Michelin denied Rémy's charges, but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France. In response to Rémy's statement that certain three-star chefs were sacrosanct, Michelin said, \"There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it weren't true, if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us.\"[66]\n\nAllegations of prejudice for French cuisine [ edit ]\n\nSome non-French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favor of French cuisine or French dining standards. In the UK The Guardian commented in 1997 that \"some people maintain the guide's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism\".[67] When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of The New York Times noted that Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, a restaurant rated highly by The New York Times, Zagat Survey, and other prominent guides, received a no star-rating from Michelin. (He did acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars). Kurutz also claimed the guide appeared to favor restaurants that \"emphasized formality and presentation\" rather than a \"casual approach to fine dining\". He also claimed that over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars \"could be considered French\".[68] The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants, compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007; after The Four Seasons Restaurant received no stars in that edition, co-owner Julian Niccolini said Michelin \"should stay in France, and they should keep their guide there\".[69] The 2007 guide does, however, include menus, recipes, and photographs, and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants.[69]\n\nAllegations of leniency with stars for Japanese cuisine [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010 Michelin guides ranked Japan as the country with the most starred restaurants. This sparked questioning over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants, or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tire-selling company to market itself in Japan.[70] The Wall Street Journal reported in 2010 that some Japanese chefs were surprised at receiving a star, and were reluctant to accept one, because the publicity caused an unmanageable jump in booking, affecting their ability to serve their traditional customers without lowering their quality.[71]\n\nUnwanted stars [ edit ]\n\nSome restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star, because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and decor.[72] Some cases:\n\nCasa Julio ( Fontanars dels Alforins , Spain): After receiving a star for a perfumed cuisine in 2009, the restaurant chef Julio Biosca felt the award was granted to dishes that he did not like and restricted his creativity, and tried to remove his star and in December 2013, discontinued his tasting menu. The removal took place in the 2015 guide.

Petersham Nurseries Café (London): After receiving a star in 2011, founder and chef Skye Gyngell received complaints from customers expecting formal dining, leading to her attempt to remove the star, and subsequent retirement from the restaurant. She has now said she regrets her remarks and would welcome a star.

  "latent_14008": "Why Egypt's Military Cares About Home Appliances\n\nLefteris Pitarakis/AP\n\nThe Egyptian military has been notably non-confrontational during the recent wave of protests, defending the right of people to protest and protecting the protesters from attacks by pro-regime forces.\n\nOne reason for the military's peaceful response: the unique role it plays in the Egyptian economy. The military owns \"virtually every industry in the country,\" according to Robert Springborg.\n\nSpringborg, a professor at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, has written several books about Egypt, he's lived in Egypt, he's consulted with the Egyptian military, and he's an expert on the various businesses it runs. Here's a list he rattled off from the top of his head:\n\n...car assembly, we're talking of clothing, we're talking of construction of roads, highways, bridges. We're talking of pots and pans, we're talking of kitchen appliances. You know, if you buy an appliance there's a good chance that it's manufactured by the military. If you ... don't have natural gas piped into your house and you have to have a gas bottle, the gas bottle will have been manufactured by the military. Some of the foodstuffs that you will be eating will have been grown and/or processed by the military.\n\nThe reasons for this arrangement go back to the '60s and '70s, when the Egyptian military was very large as a result of the wars with Israel. After the peace treaty with Israel was signed, the need for such a large fighting force disappeared. But leaders worried about all those young men released from military service suddenly flooding the job market.\n\nSo the military transformed itself from a fighting force to hiring force. And some of the businesses it got into were pretty far away from its traditional mission. For example, the military had all these forces stationed on the coast — a really pretty coast that lots of people would probably pay to visit. So, Springborg says, the question arose:\n\nWhat are we gonna do with this military zone that is huge and in the most desirable part of the country and has extremely beautiful beaches, and some of the greatest … coral reefs in the world and was absolutely crying out for touristic development?\n\nThe answer: The military gave private developers access to the land, and the developers made military officers shareholders in big tourist developments.\n\nNo one knows for sure how many resort hotels or other businesses in Egypt are run by the military, which controls somewhere between 5 percent and 40 percent of the nation's economy, according to various estimates. Whatever the number, Springborg says, officers in the Egyptian military are making \"billions and billions and billions\" of dollars.\n\nThese billions would be threatened if the protests devolved into full-on civil conflict. People in the middle of violent political chaos don't buy dishwashers.\n\n\"The military wants stability above all,\" Springborg says. \"It's not focused on war fighting; it's focused on consumption.\"\n\nOne of the few glimpses we have into the role of the Egyptian military in the economy comes via a 2008 diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks.\n\nThe cable discusses the various businesses the military is involved in, and considers how the military might react if Egypt's current president, Hosni Mubarak, were to lose power.\n\nThe military would almost certainly go along with a successor, the cable's author writes, if that successor didn't interfere in the military's business arrangements.

The firm measured nations by gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\nThe report, released this month and entitled \"The Long View: How will the global economic order change by 2050?,\" showed China remaining the world's largest economy, a title bestowed upon it by the International Monetary Fund in 2014. The U.S. eventually fell to third, behind India. Next, Indonesia would become the second-biggest economy in Asia, overtaking Japan, which fell from fourth in 2016 to eighth in the last 2050 ranking. Brazil would climb to fifth, making it the second-largest economy in the Western hemisphere. Russia remained in sixth place, but other European competitors, Germany and the U.K., fell to ninth and tenth places, respectively. Mexico, which was not previously on the top ten list, came in at seventh.\n\nThe document revealed a stunning show by countries sometimes labeled \"third world\" that have vowed to boost their economies and take a greater role in the dynamics of the international financial order.\n\nSeveral of these countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — have been classified as BRIC countries and are believed by many experts to rise in the next economically in the next few decades. In 2010, South Africa, which also made gains in this month's report, was added to the grouping, changing the acronym to BRICS. Other countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Nigeria were credited with some of the fastest overall growth.\n\nThe firm's researchers noted the anticipated success of the developing economies, but also warned of great volatility that must be taken into account for such long-term projections.\n\n\"Our analysis shows the great potential that emerging economies have to grow and prosper over the coming decades. But to realise this potential in full, they must undertake sustained and effective investment in education, infrastructure and technology,\" the document read.\n\nPwC is an international professional services firm headquartered in London and has been considered one of the four big auditing firms in the world along with Deloitte, EY and KPMG.

  "latent_14267": "A question for Tzipi Livni\n\nEarlier this week, I had the privilege of attending a breakfast meeting with Tzipi Livni, former Israeli foreign minister and current head of the opposition Kadima Party, along with a group of Boston-area faculty, journalists, and other interested parties. The session was off-the-record, so I can’t tell you what any of the participants said. I can report that Livni was well-informed, articulate, direct, and engaging, and it was easy to see why she’s done well in political life.\n\nI had a faculty meeting to attend and was unable to stay for the full session, so I didn’t get a chance to ask her a question. I had scribbled one down in my notebook, however, and here’s what I would have asked:\n\n\"I would like to know where you think the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is headed. I don’t mean where you want the conflict to go or what resolution you think is most desirable, but rather what outcome you think is most likely given where we are today and what the prevailing trends are.\n\nAt present, most people say they want a \"two-state solution.\" Barack Obama wants that, and so did George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Tony Blair, Mahmoud Abbas, Ehud Olmert, and you do too. So do I. Even Prime Minister Netanyahu has endorsed that idea at least once.\n\nYet if current trends continue, a two-state solution will eventually be impossible and we will all have to acknowledge that reality. Indeed, a growing number of people are convinced that this is already the case, either because Israel’s political system is too dysfunctional to change course, because the Palestinians are too divided to make a deal, or because there are too many settlers to remove.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Olmert has warned that if the two-state solution fails, then Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state is imperiled. I think he’s right, and what I can’t understand is why more Israelis — and their supporters in other countries — aren’t deeply worried about this situation, and aren’t doing everything in their power to get a two-state deal done before it is too late.\n\nSo my question is: where is this conflict headed, and what should be done today to avoid the one-state future that many now see as inevitable?\"\n\nLike I said, I didn’t get to ask this question so I don’t know how she would have responded. But it still strikes me as the central issue, and one that overshadows the current haggling over a two-month extension of the (partial) settlement freeze, or whatever Iran may or may not be up to at the moment.",

Those with two or more spare bedrooms have had reductions of 25%.\n\n'Better use'\n\nMinisters say the policy frees up larger homes and saves the taxpayer £1m a day.\n\nIn its report, the committee urged the government to exempt anyone whose home had been adapted to help them with their disability.\n\nChairwoman, Labour MP Dame Anne Begg, said: \"The government has reformed the housing cost support system with the aim of reducing benefit expenditure and incentivising people to enter work.\n\n\"But vulnerable groups who were not the intended targets of the reforms and are not able to respond by moving house or finding a job are suffering as a result.\n\n\"The government's reforms are causing severe financial hardship and distress to vulnerable groups, including disabled people.\"\n\nShe added: \"Using housing stock more efficiently and reducing overcrowding are understandable goals.\"\n\nDame Anne added that between 60% and 70% of homes affected by the change contained \"somebody with a disability, and many of these people will not be able to move home easily due to their disability\".\n\nShe said: \"So, they have to remain in their homes with no option but to have their housing benefit reduced.\"\n\n'Shameless'\n\nLiberal Democrat president Tim Farron, who sits on the party's manifesto committee, has said he wants his party to drop its support for changes.\n\nHe criticised the move's impact on disabled and other vulnerable families.\n\nBut a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: \"Our reforms are necessary to restore fairness to the system and make a better use of social housing.

Sportsnet’s Shi Davidi writes that outfielder Kevin Pillar will be recalled from Triple-A to take his roster spot.\n\nToronto claimed the 30-year-old Reimold off waivers from the division-rival Orioles earlier this summer, hoping that the injury-prone slugger could provide an upgrade to their offense. Reimold struggled in 22 games with the Jays, however, posting a .212/.283/.404 batting line in 60 plate appearances.\n\nThe Orioles long thought Reimold to be capable of providing some production either in left field or from the DH spot, but his growing list of injuries eventually led to a DFA earlier this season. Reimold has undergone two neck surgeries and an ankle operation in his career, and he’s also spent time on the disabled list for calf and hamstring injuries in the past two seasons.\n\nStill, the former second-round pick owns a lifetime batting line of .250/.324/.437 and an isolated power mark (slugging minus batting average) of .187, suggesting that he can indeed provide some offensive benefit when healthy. As Davidi notes, Reimold would have been a non-tender candidate following the season, though I’d imagine that the raise on his $1.03MM salary wouldn’t have been too substantial. Davidi also points out that by clearing a 40-man roster space without immediately filling it (Pillar is on the 40-man roster), the team creates room to add either Brandon Morrow or Daniel Norris in September.

Or, hint anonymous “intelligence sources,” perhaps impoverished, pariah state Myanmar is just a way station for a more nefarious technology transfer.\n\nSadly, the world probably will never know which is the case.\n\nNew United Nations Security Council sanctions passed after North Korea tested its latest nuclear warhead authorized the world’s navies to monitor such traffic. China, which has traditionally protected Pyongyang from the harshest Security Council rebukes, even voted for the sanctions this time, a significant symbolic shift and a victory for U.S. diplomacy.\n\nBut Beijing still blocked efforts to authorize boarding parties to inspect suspect North Korean vessels. For that to happen, North Korea would have to give its permission, which is about as likely as Kim Jong Il turning up at the next board meeting of Human Rights Watch.\n\nSuch is the infuriating status quo at the U.N. Even a nuclear explosion by a nation that sells its nuclear knowledge to the highest bidder, shoots poorly engineered missiles over their neighbors’ heads and treats its own population like prison inmates could not bring coherent action from the Security Council.\n\nAnd so Barack Obama finds himself in a familiar position for an American president. Having seen a diplomatic initiative spurned with a nuclear test, he talked tough and did due diligence by working through the existing U.N. channels. And for his pains, he finds himself with less leeway to deal with a ship that might (though it is unlikely) be carrying a nuclear weapon than he had with a bunch of teenaged Somali pirates.\n\nIt did not take long for Obama’s domestic enemies to gloat. Smarting from the years in which their own approaches (including diplomatic quarantine, covert action, and preemptive warfare) failed, they were loath to see Obama’s squishy diplomatic initiatives bear fruit. How happy they must now be.\n\nStill, with the exception of the one-third of Americans who constitute the permanently embittered minority, reasonable people should have some pity for Obama at this stage.\n\nInheritor of a zombie banking sector, a seized-up auto industry, two raging wars, and poisonous hands in Iran and North Korea, he’s had little time to put a stamp of his own on world events.\n\nAnd the best case scenario for many of these problems is slow, gradual improvement. For some, including Iran, North Korea, and aspects of the global economy, improvement depends less than ever on America’s actions.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush could shoot for a “new world order.” Bill Clinton’s secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, called America “the indispensible nation.” George W. Bush created the “indefensible nation.” Now Obama must salvage what he can of the goodwill the U.S. took with it out of the 20th century.\n\nObama's speech in Cairo invited the Muslim world to end the “cycle of suspicion and discord” that has characterized relations with America since the end of World War II. He recorded a video message for Iran promising a “new beginning” and sent feelers to Russia. Both were spurned.\n\nTruman-like, he sacked a highly decorated commander of the Afghan war and replaced him with Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a counterinsurgency specialist whose own writings on the topic echo the “smart power” approach espoused by the new White House.\n\nObama promised to keep his promise to get U.S. forces out of Iraq — well, all but 50,000 of them — and he shows signs of reversing America’s disgraceful reputation as a leading global polluter.\n\nAll of these made good sense as first steps. Now, each demands a second step which is far, far more difficult to achieve.\n\nWith regard to North Korea, that decision may be only hours away. As the Kang Nam chugs toward its destination — probably the Myanmar port city of Thilawa — Obama faces a delicate decision. Should he order the Seventh Fleet to go beyond the U.N. Security Council’s writ and board the Kang Nam? Facing a much more serious (and well-documented) risk, John F. Kennedy did precisely that during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.\n\nYet to follow that course today runs the risk that the increasingly irrational North will respond with a wild retribution of some kind against South Korea and the American troops based there. The North need not go nuclear to cause thousands of deaths. Within the range of its tens of thousands of artillery tubes on the 37th parallel is the entire city of Seoul and some of the U.S. garrison, too.\n\n“What we're not going to do is to reward belligerence and provocation in the way that's been done in the past,” Obama said, a reference to the sand Kim Jong Il kicked in the eyes of both Clinton and Bush after previous American initiatives were spurned.\n\nWhat then, Mr. President, will North Korea’s reward be this time?

  "latent_14915": "Comment: History shows governments that don’t anticipate and make provisions for the decline of coal burden communities for generations\n\nBy Oliver Sartor and Andrzej Błachowicz\n\nDonald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement was sometimes presented as the president putting coal workers first.\n\nBut the history of coal mining transitions, both in Europe and the US, tells us that failing to anticipate before change comes often finishes badly for workers.\n\nIn a new report, authors from the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations and Climate Strategies examined past coal mining declines in five European countries (Spain, the Netherlands, UK, Poland and the Czech Republic) and also in the US.\n\nOne of the overarching conclusions is that early anticipation is essential to making a ‘just transition’. Given the scale of the challenge, it is necessary to use all of the available time. Workers must prepare for and move to new jobs, regional economic policy has to be redrawn and companies need to develop new business models.\n\nThis can be a long process. However, with anticipation, experience suggests it is possible. For instance, from 1965 to 1990 the Limburg region of the Netherlands – a former coal mining heartland that employed more than 75,000 miners – was able to transition from coal mining to a relatively successful regional economic hub with new industrial activities, with most workers finding reemployment or retiring normally.\n\nHowever, from a climate policy perspective, we do not have a lot of time. There are very plausible and even quite likely scenarios in which the global demand for coal, including domestic demand in many large coal consuming countries, begins to decline from the coming decade onwards. The just transition is thus matter of urgency for governments and affected stakeholders.\n\nAnticipation and planning is also crucial because, desired or not, once a transition is underway, events can move very quickly, often with severe and long-lasting impacts for workers and regions. Almost everywhere, with the notable exception of Limburg, the failure to prepare and invest in economic alternatives for former mining regions has meant that regional unemployment in mining regions is often significantly higher than the national average.\n\nIn southern Poland in the 1990s, a lack of adequate worker reemployment strategies meant that, meant that roughly 40% of former miners were still unemployed 5 years after redundancy. There, as in Spain in the 1990s, workers often faced little option but to retire at age 40 from mining and live off state pensions due to the lack of possibilities to find desirable alternative work.\n\nIn the UK, thirty years after the Thatcher government suddenly withdrew support for the industry, many mining regions still only count 50 jobs per hundred working age adults. This has created problems not just for former miners (now retired), but their children too. Low employment can be accompanied by poor educational attainment, lower average wages, higher rates of physical illness, higher suicide rates, higher rates of workers on disability and incapacity benefits.\n\nIn the US, failure to anticipate company bankruptcies has meant the pension and health care funds of former miners have been wiped out. The social and economic costs of failing to adequately prepare and implement the transition while time and resources are available can therefore be very high.\n\nConsensus is crucial. While the state and workers may not agree on everything, the first step should be a basic agreement on the need for, and broad terms of, the transition desired. Historically, where there was relative consensus on the need to phase out activities (like in the Limburg region of the Netherlands), the transition strategy tended to show greater political resilience and implement more coherent and comprehensive adjustment strategies over time.\n\nHowever, forging this consensus needs to be context specific. For example, hard coal mines for exports to global markets may find different arguments for transition convincing to lignite mines that feed local electricity production.\n\nOf course, short-term interests don’t always align between stakeholders and bargaining power is not always evenly distributed. Companies can sometimes have an incentive to sell or abandon a site as quickly as possible, without playing their part in helping workers and local regions shift away from coal. Environmental clean-up from mining is another thing companies typically get out of paying. Governments need to anticipate this and ensure no stakeholder wriggles out of their responsibilities.\n\nSometimes badly-managed historical transitions led to generous short term economic compensation to gain the acquiescence of workers, but neglected other long term human needs. These often resulted in poor long term outcomes for workers’ long term employability and health and for those of their children. The future employment and employability of young and middle-aged former miners and their children needs to be ensured. That means investing in intergenerational educational attainment, supporting miners with disabilities to find appropriate work and taking professional pride into consideration when designing employee transition programs.\n\nFor governments, a just transition requires long-term financial and institutional commitments. But the costs of failing to invest in the transition early enough are clearly much higher. Typically, prior to transitioning out of mining, the cost of supporting an uncompetitive industry is extremely high. For example, in Spain, approximately €22bn is estimated to have been spent in government subsidies on supporting the profitability of mining activities between 1992 and 2014. That’s before any investment in a transition away from coal.\n\nFailure to invest sufficient resources and political will into a transition can lead to the development of extremely costly economic, social and environmental problems.

This ship was a nuclear-powered submarine.\n\nThe contract to build her was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine on 29 September 1955 and her keel was laid down on 20 June 1956. She was launched on 16 August 1958 sponsored by Mrs. Robert L. Dennison, and commissioned on 5 December 1959, with Lieutenant Commander George P. Steele in command.\n\nOperational history [ edit ]\n\nFollowing a Caribbean shakedown cruise, Seadragon returned to Portsmouth, whence, on 1 August 1960, she sailed for the Pacific. Ordered to proceed via the Northwest Passage, she moved north to Parry Channel, at mid-month reached Lancaster Sound, the eastern end of the channel, and continued westward with Edward Parry's 1819 journal as a guide.\n\nCollecting oceanographic and hydrographic data en route, Seadragon transited the Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and McClure Strait. On 21 August, she completed the first submarine transit of the Northwest Passage, entered the Beaufort Sea, and headed for the North Pole, which she reached on 25 August. The ship surfaced through the thin ice becoming the third submarine to surface at the pole. Members of the crew laid out a softball diamond with the pitcher's box at the pole where the captain claimed he hit a fly ball at 4:00 pm on Wednesday and it wasn't caught until 4:00 am on Thursday. From the pole, Seadragon (having no other choice) turned south, and after conducting experiments in cooperation with scientists on ice island T-3, headed for the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. On 5 September, she reached Nome, Alaska, and, nine days later, she arrived at her home port, Pearl Harbor. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her transit of the Northwest Passage via Parry Channel.\n\nFor the next nine months, Seadragon was employed in local operations. In June 1961, she headed west for her first tour in the western Pacific (WestPac), during which she participated in Seventh Fleet exercises – primarily antisubmarine warfare training exercises – and completed a submerged endurance cruise of 58 days. In October, she returned to Pearl Harbor and local operations.\n\nOn 12 July 1962, Seadragon departed Pearl Harbor for her second Arctic cruise. Transiting the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea, she contacted T-3, then moved further north to rendezvous with sister ship, USS Skate, en route from New London, Connecticut. On 31 July, the two submarines rendezvoused under the ice and continued on to the North Pole, arriving on 2 August for sonar and weapons evaluations. The submarines were joined by the icebreaker USS Burton Island. In late August, the submarines returned to their home ports. En route, Seadragon, which was scheduled to port at Seattle, Washington, rescued 12 survivors from a downed seaplane and delivered them to Port Angeles, Washington. On 14 September, Seadragon arrived back at Pearl Harbor.\n\nDuring the first half of 1963, Seadragon participated in local operations and conducted her second WestPac cruise. On 8 July, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her first refueling and overhaul. In late May 1964, she resumed operations in the Hawaiian area. Torpedo evaluations off the Washington coast followed; and, on 10 August 1964, Seadragon sailed west in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. During September and October, she operated out of Subic Bay; then, after a call at Hong Kong continued on to Okinawa and Japan to conduct public relations cruises and to participate in further Seventh Fleet exercises.\n\nOn 27 October 1964, Seadragon became the first nuclear powered vessel to visit Hong Kong.[citation needed] This was followed shortly by an historic entry into Japanese waters and a port visit to Sasebo, Japan, on 12 November 1964. The visit was protested by China and the Soviet Union; the Soviets in particular warned that the visit would eventually lead to the introduction of nuclear weapons to Japan and alter the security status quo in East Asia.[1] On 4 March 1965, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Again, in the fall of 1966 and early 1967, Seadragon became the first SSN to visit Yokosuka, Japan. She was the first nuclear powered vessel the Japanese government permitted to enter her home waters. This achievement has since often been compared with Commodore PERRY's first expedition to Japan in 1853 as an achievement in international diplomacy. Seadragon was the first SSN to visit Hobart, Australia in January 1983. In twenty-four years of active service, Seadragon steamed over 200,000 miles, dove and surfaced 1800 times, made thirteen deployments to the Western Pacific, and conducted four under ice operations. Seadragon was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. The ship was overhauled three times, refueling at each overhaul. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was her home for all the overhauls and performed the inactivation commencing 1 October 1983. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, which she visited on occasional trips to the North Polar region, performed the recycling. [2]\n\nDecommissioning [ edit ]\n\nDecommissioned on 12 June 1984 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986, ex-Seadragon entered the Navy's Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 1 October 1994. On 18 September 1995, Seadragon ceased to exist. It should be noted that Seadragon was decommissioned after only 24 and a half years of commissioned service - five and a half years less than the normal 30 year service life for U.S. Navy submarines.\n\nBook [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, the former captain of the Seadragon, Dan Summitt, wrote a book about the exploits of boat and its crew.[3] Summitt describes how his boat was the first nuclear sub to patrol the eastern Soviet coast for SIGINT and the third to reach the North Pole.\n\nSeadragon: Northwest Under the Ice [The story of the nuclear Submarine Seadragon’s epic discovery of an underwater Northwest Passage], by Cmdr.

  "latent_15010": "The Depiction of Jews in the Carnival Plays and Comedies of Hans Folz and Hans Sachs in Early Modern Nuremberg\n\nJohn D. Martin (University of Texas at Austin)\n\nBaylor Journal of Theatre and Performance: Vol.3:2 (2006)\n\nAbstract\n\nBakhtin’s theory of the social function of the carnival play (Fastnachtspiel) characterized the primary function of carnival plays as one of relieving class tensions and intra–group hostilities by providing members of diverse groups with an outlet for aggression, turning impulses that would otherwise express themselves in violence or disruptive behaviors into carefully modulated public displays of excess consumption (e.g. drunkenness, gluttony, staged sexual humor) and oftentimes sexual or scatological mockery of ruling elites through easily recognizable type scenes and characters (e.g. the foolish old guildmaster cuckolded by the whoring priest, the merchant deceived into buying a bag of his own feces). While this account of the Fastnachtspiel’s role in late medieval German society is certainly persuasive prima facie, it has not been accepted as an exhaustive explanation of their public functions and political uses, which included both critiques and affirmations of public authority figures.\n\nThe most significant flaw in the Bakhtinian model is that it describes a form of theatre that reinforces existing social structures without either threatening the continued existence of hierarchies of authority or changing the political attitudes and behavior of the audience. What follows here will describe how Hans Folz and Hans Sachs of Nuremberg transformed the late medieval carnival play from an outlet for otherwise repressed impulses—the Bakhtinian ‘social safety valve’ model of carnival—into a means of effecting social, political change. Since this development has already been discussed in some measure by scholars of the Fastnachtspiel, I will discuss here more particularly how Folz and Sachs’s respective depictions of Jews in carnival plays and comedies effected (or failed to effect) the conditions of Jews living in or around Nuremberg in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. This study will thus demonstrate that the Bakhtinian model and its critics both contribute to our understanding of the Fastnachtspiel and the development of early modern German attitudes toward Jews.\n\nClick here to read this article from Baylor Journal of Theatre and Performance\n\nAmazon.com Widgets Amazon.com Widgets\n\nSmartphone and Tablet users click here to sign up for\n\nour weekly email",
  "latent_15080": "Some people are fans of the New York Jets. But many, many more people are NOT fans of the New York Jets. This 2014 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group.\n\nYour team: New York Jets.\n\nYour 2013 record: 8-8, with a point differential of -97, just one point better than the 4-12 Browns. In other words, when luck is on their side, 8-8 is the best the Jets can do. The most heartwarming part of last season was when the team publicly decided to not fire the coach, even though that coach got an extension that isn't guaranteed past this season, which means he's still a lame duck, which means the Jets are in the exact same spot they were a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour coach: Rex Ryan, who is terminally incapable of hiring a decent offensive coordinator (Marty Mornhinweg is the OC for the second straight season, a rare and completely unwelcome example of continuity at that post) or fielding a competent quarterback. It's baffling. How can he be so bad at finding offensive help? He's not like his old man, who intentionally belittled and injured his own offensive players because he was an idiot. Rex actually WANTS the offense to be good, and yet he fucks it up time and time again. I can't tell if it's his fault, or just the stink of the Jets crawling inside his brain and slowly eating away at it. Rex Ryan is a legitimately awesome dude who would be fun to pull for if he coached any other team, but the Jets do everything they can to suck the life right out of him. Case in point…\n\nYour quarterback: Geno Smith, who became demonstrably worse as last season went on. After Week 6, Geno threw for six TDs and 13 INTs. How do you regress when you have no starting point to regress from? Only Geno Smith can pull that off.\n\nTo challenge Geno, the Jets brought in a bunch of TSA security guards. ZING. No, they brought in Michael Vick, who was destined to become a Jet at this point in his career. Now here's the fun part: The Jets have already anonymously complained about Vick not giving enough fucks to beat out Geno for the job. You're not supposed to start leaking shit like that until you start off 0-7. But the Jets, as always, aren't like other shitty teams. They waste NO time devolving into a complete mess. They drafted a quarterback, then threw that QB to the wolves, then brought in the one guy who didn't feel like challenging him, then cursed him out anonymously to the media. Somehow they have thrown two quarterbacks under the bus and the season hasn't even started yet. Only the Jets can do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's new that sucks: Well, one of the cornerbacks went missing and still refuses to explain why he left. What other team on the planet does this happen to? At least Dimitrius Underwood fled his team because he was mentally ill. Dimitri Patterson just up and left, like OH FUCK I'M ON THE JETS NOW NO WAY. Keep in mind that Patterson was the only free agent the Jets brought in to help fix a pass defense that was 22nd overall in yardage allowed last season. And he went fucking AWOL, and is now accusing the Jets of lying about him going AWOL. Again, the season hasn't even started yet. This is the Jets pre-fucking the season in advance. There is so much dysfunction that people sort of forget Rich Kotite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other news, the team paid a shitload of money to bring in Eric Decker, who signed with New York specifically so that he and his wife could be on a reality show. Decker scored 13 TDs last season. I wonder if those numbers will be affected now that Peyton Manning is not his quarterback and Wes Welker and Demaryius Thomas are not playing alongside him. TIME WILL TELL. The apparently unfireable Jeremy Kerley returns as the #2 wideout. Is it possible to be covered by fifteen men on a single play? Decker is about to find out.\n\nIn the backfield, the Jets brought in Chris \"Cop Speed\" Johnson, because nothing pleases the Jets more than importing washed up veterans who aren't all that interested in playing football anymore. CJ2BARFK will split carries with Bilal Powell and Chris Ivory in a shit-committee rotation. The Jets have promised to \"ride the hot hand\" at running back. There are no hot hands in that trio. There are only clammy flu hands. I drafted Chris Johnson this week. I don't even know why. I hovered on him, and then pushed the button, and it was like someone had temporarily possessed my hand when I did it, like OH GOD I'M DRAFTING CHRIS JOHNSON WHY AM I DOING THIS?!\n\nAlso, Revis Island is a Patriot now. Prepare for seventeen weeks of outright torture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat has always sucked: Are you aware that the Jets spent this offseason negotiating with Fireman Ed to come back, and that they lost that negotiation? They actually sent people to him to plead with him to come back (\"If we just get Fireman Ed back, we'll turn this whole thing around!\"), and he said no. And Fireman Ed BLOWS. He is the fucking worst. Only the Jets could validate Fireman Ed and be spurned by him in a single stroke.\n\nThe whole franchise should be nuked. Everything they touch turns to shit. Patterson vanishes. Favre comes to the Jets for one year and he starts sending dick pics. The only good thing to happen to this team in the offseason is that Mark Sanchez left, and somehow that guy became the hottest backup QB in football this preseason. MARK SANCHEZ!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fans only get excited when they can boo at a draft. They are Nassau County in miniature: Degenerate yokels stuck on hot, steamy stretches of asphalt, jabbering in some incomprehensible dialect. They are the asshole part of New York (which encapsulates most of New York) that the New York Times pretends does not exist. The Jets are that moment in every stupid action movie set in New York where a bunch of performatively ethnic first responders come together to help the hero and show that We're All In This Together and that you don't mess with New York. HEY THIS IS OUR TOWN, BUDDY. They are a Billy Joel song in football team form, and Billy Joel is the worst thing that American pop culture has ever produced. I am convinced he just buys every ticket to every show he plays at MSG now.\n\nThey are failure incarnate.\n\nWhat might not suck: The front seven is great, which means the Jets will be able to pull out enough 6-3 wins to guarantee a draft choice of minimum impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear it from Jets fans!\n\nJohn:\n\nI was just a 6 year old idiot who liked football like every other kid. I look up to my dad, so I figure if he is a Jets fan well then I should be too. My father begins to see that I am reaching an age where I will actually start to watch the game and learn about it. My father looked me in my eyes and told me that I didn't need to be a Jets fan just because he was. He told me that there are other teams you could like. \"Like the Bills\", he said. We lived in Rochester, NY which is about an hour from Buffalo. The Bills were good at that time (I know. Weird.), and my friends were Bills fans. It made sense. Nope. He rattled through a few other teams. The Steelers! The Cowboys! The 49ers! Nah. \"I like the Jets!\" my stupid self said. Within weeks I had Jets wallpaper, a green rug, and Jets pennants in my room. It was over. To this day he reminds me that he offered me a chance to get out.\n\nTom:\n\nYou know who was on the board when we drafted Stephen Hill? Alshon fucking Jeffery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhil:\n\nEven though we needed Wide Receivers and Cornerbacks, we signed a WR everyone in the media knows isn't a true #1, and drafted a Safety and a Tight End in the first two rounds of the draft. Let me tell you what those picks did in training camp. Our hard hitting safety, who's supposed to be an enforcer, got a concussion on the first practice where contact was allowed, on a punt protection play. The Tight End, who said he was going to become the next Tony Gonzalez, promptly forgot how to catch.\n\nRob:\n\nIn the Why the Titans Suck article, you asked \"Quick! Remember something that happened in a Titans game last year!\" and literally the only Titans play that came to my mind was when Geno Smith tried to put the ball behind his back to avoid a sack against the Titans last year. He subsequently stumbled backwards, hit the ball off his ass, fumbled it, and the Titans fell on it for a touchdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSean:\n\nVick's Instagram is filled with pictures of his old signature Nike shoes with sad, wistful captions.\n\nMatt:\n\nMy uncle (who had the season tickets in the family pre-Metlife) took me to my first game, against Oakland, when I was 7. It was one of 15 games they'd lose that season. The most exciting thing to happen that day was the fistfight that broke out between two Staten Island meatheads (both Jets fans) directly in front of me, spilled blood from which remains on my souvenir pennant from that day. That same uncle, who is otherwise a very smart person, once saw a Jets/Chargers game while visiting a friend in San Diego. When he and a crowd of other Jets fans began actively booing the team (led by Chad Pennington at the time), his Chargers fan friend expressed shock that these fans would go all the way to San Diego to boo their team. His response was simply \"We come to hate.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRob:\n\nWoody Johnson's name is Woody Johnson.\n\nJames:\n\nFast forward to fall of 2013 when I started dating my girlfriend. She's from California and couldn't know/care less about football. She finds out I am a fanatical Jets fan and hears me bitch about Mark Sanchez one day and says \"Oh I know that name, who is that?\" Once I inform her she says \"Ohhhh that's the football player my friend had sex with last summer. She said they took a bunch of Molly and he crashed at her place. He's super nice apparently.\" The only fact my girlfriend knew about professional football was an anecdote from Mark Sanchez's sex life. Rex Ryan has sex with his wife's feet.\n\nSeth:\n\nI've been a Jet fan for a long time and I've realized that since Woody Johnson has purchased the Jets, the organization needs some type of controversy at the quarterback position. Sadly the quarterback controversies that we normally have are shitty veterans that are shells of themselves going against unproven equally shitty rookies/ tenured players that have issues. Look at the \"controversies\" that have occurred since we've become the VH1 of the NFL. 2002: Chad Pennington (New, Shiny and not Oft Injured) vs Vinny Testeverde (Old) 2003: Chad Pennington (Shiny and not Oft Injured) vs Vinny Testeverde (Old) 2004: Chad Pennington (Chad Pennington) vs Quincy Carter (Cocaine) 2005: Chad Pennington (Oft Inured) vs Brooks Bollinger vs Vinny Testeverde (He won't die!!!) 2006: Nothing really other than Chad Pennington being Chad Pennington and the fan base getting sick of his shit 2007: Chad Pennington vs Kellen Clemens (Ineffective) 2008: Brett Favre (Signed, promply showed his dick and left) 2009: Good. 2010: Great 2011: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. 2012: Mark Sanchez (The Dirty One, still employed ran into another grown man's ass.) vs Greg McElroy (Ineffective) vs Matt Simms (Ineffective) vs Tim Tebow 2013: Mark Sanchez (Had a hit put out on him by Rex Ryan) vs Geno Smith (Appalachian Michael Vick) 2014: Geno Smith (Appalachian Michael Vick) vs Michael Vick (The Originator) Note that the coaches and the owner seem to be miffed at the fact that Vick seems ok with being the back up. I hope Geno Smith is good all things considered but fuck this team.\n\nRob:\n\nThe Jets celebrate first downs by screaming \"it's a Jets FIRST DOWN\" as if this were some Herculean accomplishment. Last year, I went to my first football game: the Jets v. the Saints. It was the Sunday after Halloween, so people were dressed in costumes. One guy dressed as a panda and would do a little dance when prompted by fans or music. Starting in the first quarter, some drunk ass fan started shouting, \"hey panda\" and continued to do so every 15 seconds straight through the game. Finally in the Fourth Quarter, some guy next to him shouts \"WE GET IT, HE'S WEARING A PANDA SUIT, SHUT UP.\" The \"hey panda\" guy looked like he was about to start a fight, but he was so drunk that he just fell back down in his seat. Oh, and by the way the Jets won and it was apparently an exciting game, but this guy and his friends who were egging him on were more interested in the guy wearing a panda suit... in a stadium full of people dressed in costumes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark:\n\nFor some reason, the media needs to get Joe Fucking Namath's opinion on EVERY decision made by the team.\n\nJohn:\n\nIn a league where quarterbacks are throwing for 5,000 yards every year, our management is happy with a secondary that consists of an injured 2nd year player and a pink flamingo lawn ornament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael:\n\nMy nephew is a Jets fan. So it should come as no surprise that he wanted me to take a Tight End in the first round of my fantasy draft.\n\nBrian:\n\nJets fans are basically Mets fans without the self-aware sense of humor to embrace their \"little brother franchise\" status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadar:\n\nWhen my niece was five months old a friend and I took her in her stroller down to National Mall near my apartment in DC. I had my niece in a Jets jersey and let her crawl around on the grass. An elderly man, probably around 80 walked over to us to comment how cute the baby was and then asked us where we were from. When I commented that we lived there in DC he said \"How dare you let that adorable baby where that Jets jersey! Don't you want more out of life for her then to be sad and depressed and only know failure?\" He did laugh because it was a Cromartie baby jersey though.\n\nFreeman:\n\nStephen Hill couldn't catch gonorrhea in a sanitarium full of infected nymphomaniacs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank:\n\nThe Jets are doing a new thing this year where season ticket holders get \"points\" for watching and attending games. I should get a billion fucking points for having sat there and watched the buttfumble against the Patriots in person.\n\nJack:\n\nI've witnessed my own father berate two teenagers in Patriots jerseys during a pre-game moment of silence at Metlife Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack:\n\nYears ago at the old Giants Stadium (epic shit-hole, good riddance to it), they were having a pregame ceremony honoring ex great linebacker Mo Lewis. I love Mo and was a kid during his great years. There was a blackout drunken guy in a Mo Lewis jersey next to me who, in a span of 30 seconds, went from saying \"the Mo man! Yeah!\" while clapping, to screaming, \"He didn't do shit for us! Fucking sucks! Booooo!!\"\n\nEben:\n\nAbout two years after every other team seemingly dismissed it, the Jets installed a Wildcat formation and dutifully trot it out at least once a game in a long yardage situation. It never fails to get no one excited except for the announcers because 1) announcers are stupid; 2) it's not like the offense has given them anything else to talk about, and 3) they get to remind everyone that the Jets don't call it the wildcat, as if some different name will fool the other team. THE JETS REFER TO THIS AS THE ILIKECHEESE FORMATION, JEEM! It doesn't matter, because no matter who lines up under center the play is always a run up the middle for one and a half yards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPat:\n\nThe area is completely charmless and when gathered together we validate every shitty Jersey stereotype.\n\nDavid:\n\nThey actually have a pre-game session where \"honored seasons ticket holders\" show everybody in the stadium how to execute the \"J-E-T-S\" chant, presumably because any fans smart enough to spell and who aren't locked into an underwater PSL mortgage won't bother going. Last year, their proposed solution was hiring New York's first all-white, all-bro drumline to almost no effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael:\n\nMy first F-word was, with all the malice that a 9 year old can muster, aimed at Doug Fucking Brien.\n\nDavid:\n\nLast year, my best friend (who converted me into a Jets fan, after being raised in a house of fairweather Giants fans) and I went to the game against the Raiders. I'd heard plenty of stories about both fandoms being absolute horrid assholes and maniacs, but for the most part, everyone was civil, having fun. But when we were on our way back from the game, this one drunk guy — possibly a high-schooler who snuck in his daddy's flask — was walking around in a Brett Favre jersey and a giant plush, green-and-white hat shaped like a jumbo Jet, in the terminal at Penn Station, hitting on every woman who walked by. He stood in one woman's way, trying to prevent her from passing him without giving him a hug. When she walked across the terminal pathway to avoid him, he started shouting at the top of his lungs, \"Fuck you, bitch! Hope you get AIDS!\" and proceeded to walk down the hall with the biggest \"check-out-my-swagger\" grin you've ever seen, like he handled the situation like a true pro. My best friend turns to me, shakes his head, and takes his jersey off in shame. \"I really was hoping we'd go the day without seeing something like that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorey:\n\nAll witnessed at one Jets game at the giant replica BOSE stereo that is Metlife Stadium: 1) Drunk lady who puked what looked like Cup Noodles all over herself and the seat in front of her 10 seconds after I told my buddy to move from that very seat 2) Another lady so drunk that she fell into the row in front of her when she leaned forward to talk to her friend. 3) A guy eating raw hot dogs out of a clear garbage bag with people around him chanting, \"M-E-A-T-MEAT-MEAT-MEAT!\" Those same people booed him when he decided he had enough uncooked hot dogs for one day (admittedly funny) 4) Jets fans fighting each other. One was apparently the boyfriend of the first drunk girl because he dragged her out of the stands when security told him he had to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris:\n\nLast season, I was heading up the escalator of MetLife Stadium (which looks more or less like a bedpan) to our seats before kickoff. Me and my father were minding our own business, talking about the Jets' offense, which apparently provoked the fine man in front of us to turn around and say, \"TheJets will never win with Geno Smith.\" At the time, Geno had started two career NFL games. My father asked why he thought that, to which the response was, quite simply, \"Because he's black.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris:\n\nThe last time I was at a game, Week 1 in 2011, the guy sitting behind me started screaming the words \" Mo Lewis\" thirty minutes before kick-off and continued doing so all game. He was middle-aged, obese, walrus-mustached. He was shirtless underneath an unzipped Starter jacket. Half his body and face was crudely covered in green paint. He screamed \"Mo Lewis\" every twenty seconds for over three hours, refusing to acknowledge anyone who cursed at him, threatened him or begged him to stop on account of nearby children. When the game ended, he wheezed for a while and left the stadium alone. For the record, Mo Lewis had been retired 8 years at this point.\n\nLouis:\n\nEvery conversation I have where I say I'm a Jets fan, I have to immediately say afterwards \"Don't worry, I'm not one of THOSE Jets fans.\" But that's bullshit, I'm a petty, petty man who gets way too drunk at parties and social gatherings and ruins everyone's fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim:\n\nNY Jets fans are the worst fans in professional sports. They are the worst elements of Long Island and New Jersey rolled into personality spoiled single child of a affluent owner of a car dealership. All the fucking do is complain. They feel they are cursed, they deserve better, they boo non-fucking-stop, constantly want the team to make the worst fucking decisions because they are panicked and then say shit like Same Old Jets when those decisions play out as one might expect they would play out. They want to cut players after a bad practice. They are pre-2004 Red Sox fans but instead of being racist assholes they are asshole racists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony:\n\nWe celebrated 8-8 in 2013 like we won the fucking Super Bowl. We think Matt Simms is the answer. We think Greg McElroy never got a fair shot.\n\nAdam:\n\nOver the past 25 years, the Jets have taken 9 position players in the 1st round of the draft. 4 of those 9 position players were Tight Ends (Johnny Mitchell, Kyle Brady, Anthony Becht and Dustin Keller), who accounted for exactly ZERO Pro Bowls. Also note - in 2005 then GM Terry Bradway traded his 1st round pick in exchange for a 2nd round pick and...you guessed it, another fucking tight end. But not just any tight end - they received the unproven barely serviceable Doug Jolley, who spent one season on the team, caught 29 passes, and was out of football eighteen months later.

  "latent_15247": "Arsene Wenger has defended his record as Arsenal boss in recent years despite the well-known fact the club hasn’t won a trophy since swapping Highbury for the Emirates.\n\nAsked ahead of this evening’s crunch clash at Goodison Park to comment on David Moyes’ achievements on Everton’s tight budget, the boss took the opportunity to ram some home truths down the throat of assembled journalists by pointing out that for all the speculation over the last seven years he hasn’t actually had a war chest full of gold bullion lying about for massive transfers and expensive contract extensions.\n\nIndeed, in the face of criticism both in the media and from the terraces, the boss was as frank as he’s ever been about the financial ties that have been in place for the best part of a decade stating that he knew it would be tough to compete at the top but that he opted to stick around in North London and guide the club through troubled waters all the same.\n\n“Of course I admire him [Moyes] but I can show you our transfer balance over the last 16 years and you would be astonished,” said the boss.\n\n“People forget we built a new stadium, that we had to go through limited resources, that we maintained the club at the top and we didn’t have the money available.\n\n“I accepted to stay and to do that. And I went through it. We maintained the club at the top and we are now going toward a period where we will be able to compete again financially with other clubs. It was an exciting period but a difficult one and you needed to be strong.\n\n“We just qualified for 13 consecutive years in the last 16 of the Champions League and, even with all the financial resources we have now, it is not sure we will achieve that in the next 13 years.”\n\nComing a few days after Arsenal announced a significant increase in sponsorship cash from Emirates, the boss said that he is now looking forward to operating on a more level playing field with big-spending Premier League rivals.\n\n“We are in a position where we can compete with the clubs for the transfer period. If you look at the recent years, we have lost players and not small players.”\n\nFans will of course be forgiven for waiting to see if this is indeed the case before believing it.\n\nThe club (acting as any business would) has been all too happy for stories of financial health and meaty available transfer funds to float in the ether. Building up expectations each summer ahead of season ticket renewals only to lower them again by Christmas is cynical behaviour and has done little for fan relations in the long-term.\n\nThat being said the board were hardly going to declare an inability to compete from the moment we moved. The billionaire ownership model was in its infancy, the team was still competitive and any suggestion of lowering expectations at a time when there were 60,000 seats to sell would have been business suicide.\n\nPresumably they did what they did with Wenger’s permission, with each party aware that the burden would fall on the man in charge of affairs on the pitch. That the boss has stuck around for the duration is testament to his loyalty.\n\nHe’s no martyr, he’s been handsomely rewarded doing one of the best jobs in football, but it does seem hard to believe many could have done better in the same situation.",
  "latent_15256": "Illustration by Dean Trippe\n\nAsking for US$40 million is never easy, but Theodore Brown knew his pitch would be a particularly tough sell. As vice-chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in the early 1980s, Brown had been tasked with soliciting a major donation from wealthy chemist and entrepreneur Arnold Beckman, a graduate of the university. Beckman was hesitant, believing that the university should receive most of its support from the state. So Brown decided to devise a project like nothing he had ever seen before.\n\nIn 1983, he and his colleagues put together a proposal for an institute that had little chance of being funded through normal channels. It would defy the powerful disciplinary cartography that defines many modern universities, bringing together members of different departments and inducing them to work together on common projects. Brown argued that it would allow faculty members to tackle bigger scientific and societal questions than they normally could.\n\n“The problems challenging us today, the ones really worth working on, are complex, require sophisticated equipment and intellectual tools, and just don't yield to a narrow approach,” he says. “The traditional structure of university departments and colleges was not conducive to cooperative, interdisciplinary work.”\n\nIt was an early example of the push for interdisciplinary research that is now sweeping universities around the globe. Although Brown was not completely alone — the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico was founded around the same time — he was advocating crossing boundaries before it became fashionable. And his proposal met strong resistance. Department heads fretted that faculty members — and their grants — would be snatched away. Some colleagues scorned Brown's idea of creating open office spaces to foster interactions between graduate students: surely the din would make it impossible to get serious work done. And then there was the stigma. “Interdisciplinary research is for people who aren't good enough to make it in their own field,” an illustrious physicist chided.\n\nBut Beckman liked the idea and committed the full $40-million asking price — at that time, the largest-ever private donation to a US public university. A few hectic years later, the 29,000-square-metre Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology was born.\n\nThe institute struggled to recruit a qualified director willing to take a chance on the new model, so Brown took the helm. Soon, large grants from organizations such as the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation poured in, hushing many critics. By the time Brown left the institute in 1993, other leading universities were sending delegations there to learn from the model. Researchers from Beckman — which now has more than 200 affiliated faculty members — have achieved attention-grabbing results, including helping to create one of the first graphical web browsers.\n\nSince the Beckman was founded, the interdisciplinary model has spread around the world, countering the trend towards specialization that had dominated science since the Second World War. Cross-cutting institutes have sprouted up in the United States, Europe, Japan, China and Australia, among other places, as researchers seek to solve complex problems such as climate change, sustainability and public-health issues. The interdisciplinary trend can be seen in publication data, where more than one-third of the references in scientific papers now point to other disciplines. “The problems in the world are not within-discipline problems,” says Sharon Derry, an educational psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies interdisciplinarity. “We have to bring people with different kinds of skills and expertise together. No one has everything that's needed to deal with the issues that we're facing.”\n\nEven so, supporters of interdisciplinary research say that it has been slow to catch on, and those who do cross academic disciplines face major challenges when applying for grants, seeking promotions or submitting papers to high-impact journals. In many cases, scientists say, the trend is nothing more than a fashionable label. “There's a huge push to call your work interdisciplinary,” says David Wood, a bioengineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “But there's still resistance to doing actual interdisciplinary science.”\n\nHighly disciplined\n\nThe idea of dividing academic inquiry into discrete categories dates back to Plato and Aristotle, but by the sixteenth century, Francis Bacon and other philosophers were mourning the fragmentation of knowledge.\n\nOne problem lay in the rapid growth of science: there was too much information spread across the disciplines for any one person to handle. Science historian Peter Weingart of Bielefeld University in Germany points to Carl Linnaeus's taxonomic treatise Systema Naturae as an example: between its first edition in 1735 and its last in 1768, the catalogue swelled from 10 pages to 2,300, covering 7,000 species.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the disciplinary boundaries of the modern university started to take root. The disciplines surged in number and power after the Second World War, as nations, particularly the United States, boosted their research support. “It's the moment when universities increased exponentially,” says Vincent Larivière, an information scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada. “And the size of the university increased by creating more departments.”\n\nTensions between the United States and the Soviet Union also played a part, says Weingart. The Soviets boasted a research programme geared towards solving societal problems, for example improving agriculture to boost food security. By contrast, US President Dwight Eisenhower argued that basic research should be untethered. “In the field of intellectual exploration, true freedom can and must be practised,” he said in a 1959 speech. And although basic research need not necessarily be disciplinary, it does not have the same pressure towards interdisciplinarity as does applied research.\n\nSpecialities proliferated as individual disciplines were repeatedly subdivided. Biology was split into botany and zoology, then into evolutionary biology, molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering and more. Late last year, Jerry Jacobs, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, counted the number of biology-related departments at Michigan State University in East Lansing. There were nearly 40.\n\n“We have to bring people with different kinds of skills and expertise together. No one has everything that's needed.”\n\nFrom this thicket, the term 'interdisciplinary' emerged. The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary dates back to December 1937, in a sociology journal. But even at that time, some believed that the word was already overused. In a report to the US Social Science Research Council in August that year, a sociologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois lumped 'interdisciplinarity' in with other “catch phrases and slogans which were not sufficiently critically examined” ( Items 40, 73–78; 1988).\n\nAs an academic movement, interdisciplinarity caught on during the 1970s and has been growing ever since, says Larivière. He credits that rise in part to libraries, which began to stockpile subscriptions and improved researchers' access to journals in alternative fields. A particle physicist could more easily browse biology journals, say. Furthermore, the US focus began to shift from basic research and scientific liberty back to societal problems such as environmental protection, which can rarely be tackled by a single discipline.\n\nThe United States was not alone: in 1994, an influential book partially sponsored by the Swedish Council for Planning and Coordination of Research called The New Production of Knowledge (Sage) predicted, among other things, an increasingly interdisciplinary future as science seeks to solve socially relevant questions. That book had an impact, says Larivière, particularly in the European Union's Fifth Framework funding programme, which ran from 1998 to 2002 and emphasized interdisciplinary, problem-oriented research.\n\nSoon, interdisciplinary institutes began to sprout up around the world, each with its own unique structure and purpose. One of the first, the Santa Fe Institute, founded in 1984, focused on applying advanced mathematics and computational skills to a range of disciplines. Others, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research in Cambridge, or the neuroscience-focused Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia, tackle questions within a specific discipline but draw in work from other fields. And some, such as the Monash Sustainability Institute in Clayton, Australia, focus on specific problems.\n\nEven as the trend gained momentum, interdisciplinary researchers continued to hit the same hurdles that Brown had encountered. In 1998, chemist Richard Zare at Stanford University in California helped to launch the interdisciplinary institute Bio-X. But an influential colleague urged him not to move his lab into the Bio-X building. Doing so would essentially take Zare away from the chemistry department and his committee and teaching duties there, the colleague argued, weakening the department.\n\nAlthough he was well established, Zare worried about going against the establishment. “It was very serious,” he says. The risk is even greater for young professors seeking tenure, he notes.\n\nIn 2004, in response to the growing interest in interdisciplinary work — and the challenges that face those who attempt it — the US National Academies released a report called Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research. The authors advised institutions to lower barriers, for example by making budgets flexible so that costs could be shared across departments.\n\n“There is constant pressure on me to make a cross-faculty, cross-institution alliance. If I want to build a new building, The more allies I have, the easier it is to raise the money.”\n\nThe publication drew a large audience. It has been downloaded more than 7,600 times and had impact beyond US shores. At Durham University, UK, says physicist Tom McLeish, administrators referred to the report when they were forging a series of on-campus interdisciplinary centres. Around that time, McLeish was serving as pro-vice-chancellor of research, and saw interdisciplinarity as a way to make the small university shine on the world stage. He battled with department chairs who feared that the centres would reduce their budgets, and he worked to set up a promotion system that rewards investigators on large team grants in the same way as those on single-investigator grants. The university now has interdisciplinary centres on topics ranging from resilience — both ecological and psychological — to the history of medieval science.\n\nThe interdisciplinary trend is also growing in Asia. In 2000, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) laid out a plan for interdisciplinary research, and universities have launched several cross-cutting centres over the past decade, including the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies at Peking University in Beijing. The NSFC plans to launch further interdisciplinary projects in the coming years, says Yonghe Zheng, deputy director-general of the foundation's Bureau of Science Policy. “China is a developing country,” he says. “So the universities and institutes can quickly set up some new centres which reflect the new trend in interdisciplinary research.”\n\nNanyang Technological University in Singapore established its Interdisciplinary Graduate School in 2012; it already has 335 students, out of a total graduate-school population of 2,000. Nanyang's interdisciplinary graduate programme, which bills itself as the first of its kind in Asia, was designed in part to expand the university's fundraising options, says Bo Liedberg, dean of the programme. Because industry is often focused on real-world problems that cross disciplines, an interdisciplinary programme could foster more collaborations with business, he reasons.\n\nThat focus on interdisciplinarity as a revenue stream is widespread, says Merlin Crossley, a molecular biologist and dean of the faculty of life sciences at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “There is constant pressure on me to make a cross-faculty, cross-institution alliance,” he says. “If I want to build a new building, the more allies I have, the easier it is to raise the money.” Arizona State University in Tempe saw its federal funding rise by 162% from 2003 to 2012 as it promoted interdisciplinarity across its campus.\n\nDespite this pressure, interdisciplinarity's reach remains modest. For every Nanyang or Durham, there are hundreds of universities that have not embraced significant change. Departmental dividers remain in place — and in power — at most institutions, says Nancy Andreasen, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who co-chaired the committee that wrote the National Academies report more than a decade ago. “It has been an enormous disappointment.”\n\nTeam work\n\nFor institutions or programmes that have embraced interdisciplinarity, the transition has not always been easy. The most common mistake is underestimating the depth of commitment and personal relationships needed for a successful interdisciplinary project, says Laura Meagher, a consultant based near St Andrews, UK, who coaches interdisciplinary teams. “You see people who think it's not much more than stapling a bunch of CVs to the back of a proposal,” she says. “They don't realize that it takes time to build a relationship.”\n\nWhen the push for collaboration comes from the top, some of that focus on personal relationships could be lost — leaving the project to suffer, she says. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) in London, which since 2004 has coordinated and carried out sustainable-energy research, learned how delicate interdisciplinary relationships can be, says Mark Winskel, a social and political scientist at the University of Edinburgh who evaluated the centre's first decade. Its initial five-year phase went well, he says, and culminated in a key publication: Energy 2050, which synthesized the institution's results and translated them into recommendations. But the next five-year phase failed to produce a similar achievement.\n\n“You see people who think it's not much more than stapling a bunch of CVs to the back of a proposal. They don't realize that it takes time to build a relationship.”\n\nWinskel surveyed members and found that changes in the UKERC's structure designed to open it to a wider community — for example by offering several rounds of fresh grants in the middle of phase two — had upset some established long-term relationships. “We became a more diverse community of scholars and disciplines,” he says. “But that also means you become less cohesive.” The UKERC learned from the experience: its third phase, launched in May 2014, aims to provide more stability for collaborative relationships.\n\nSocial scientists in particular often face that lack of cohesion, says Thomas Heberlein, a social psychologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. When funders emphasize the societal impacts of the work they support, social scientists are often called in to assess the broader implications of a project. But, he says, it is obvious — and insulting — when a social scientist is asked to join a project as a way to tick a box, without a true commitment to incorporating the discipline into the project.\n\nSocial struggle\n\nSeveral UK studies have found that social scientists are less likely than researchers in other disciplines to want to participate in interdisciplinary projects. For Heberlein, who has long collaborated with ecologists and environmental scientists, one of the stumbling blocks is what he calls “the hegemony of the natural sciences”. Those disciplines tend to be held in higher esteem than more qualitative fields such as the social sciences, and they are deemed more rigorous by funders and researchers, he says. That imbalance leads to frustration and undermines collaboration. Heberlein, whose speciality is in conducting surveys of public opinions, says that natural scientists often naively suggest that they can design and execute surveys themselves using an Internet tool such as SurveyMonkey. Heberlein disagrees: “It's really hard to do the stuff we do,” he says. “Our measurements are complicated.”\n\nLack of respect can run in many directions when different kinds of researchers come together. Wood says that bioengineers are always cautioned against having their grants reviewed by panels of biologists, who may be dismissive of engineering research goals and measurements. But he has also served on review panels in which engineers have recoiled at the limitations of clinical research.\n\nAs more researchers become involved with interdisciplinary work, the mutual suspicion has started to ease. There have also been some signs of success in the funding arena. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), for example, says that interdisciplinary proposals fare as well as, or slightly better than, more conventional applications. The European Research Council, by contrast, has noted that interdisciplinary grant proposals on average do not fare as well in review panels as projects that are narrower in scope.\n\nThe atmosphere for publishing is also mixed. Interdisciplinary researchers have long complained that it is difficult to get their papers into top-tier disciplinary journals. Heberlein says that the rise of interdisciplinary journals has helped in his field, but he worries about the standard of some of the papers they publish. And he questions the wisdom of training graduate students across disciplines before they have immersed themselves in the rigours of one area. “You've got to develop your disciplinary skills first,” he says. “The bad news is the quality of this research is pretty bad and may be getting worse.”\n\nMany view the institutional push for interdisciplinarity as an experiment in progress. “The celebrations have begun, but the actual data on what kind of difference this makes are not in,” says Scott Frickel, a sociologist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nAs more institutions adopt new ways to organize research, some are also trying to rethink their assessment processes, says McLeish. In July, Veronica Strang at Durham and McLeish released a report called Evaluating Interdisciplinary Research, and he was surprised when academic societies and funders flocked to learn more. “We didn't anticipate that we'd be launching this report into an atmosphere where everyone wants to know this,” he says.\n\nAnd the pace of change varies across the globe. In the United States, the NIH ran a programme to stimulate interdisciplinary research from 2004 to 2012. It resulted in some changes, such as starting to recognize multiple principal investigators on what had been considered single-investigator grants — a switch that removed a disincentive to collaborate. Since then, the agency has not perceived a need to follow up with any other incentives, noting that there are more than 4,000 active NIH-funded research projects that bill themselves as interdisciplinary. “Our general sense is that interdisciplinary research has become a very standard way of doing science,” says Betsy Wilder, head of the NIH Office of Strategic Coordination. “It really pervades NIH funding.”\n\nIn some other countries, the experiment has just begun. Chemist Ayyappanpillai Ajayaghosh, director of the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram, India, says that momentum is building in his country to promote more interdisciplinary projects. In Japan, theoretical physicist Tetsuo Hatsuda left the University of Tokyo in part because he felt that the boundaries between disciplines were too heavily enforced there. In 2013, he joined the RIKEN research institute in Wako, Japan, and launched an interdisciplinary team of theoretical physicists, chemists and biologists to work out techniques that will accelerate all three fields. He hopes that the effort will stimulate more interdisciplinary work in the country. “Japan is a little behind other countries,” he says. “Theoretical science is a good starting point because it is easy for us to interact.”\n\nSome 25 years after it opened, the Beckman Institute's experiment in interdisciplinary research has been a success, says Brown. The centre continues to attract distinguished faculty members and large team grants — last year it won a research contract worth up to $12.7 million from the federal government's Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity programme — even though competition for such money has increased as more universities build interdisciplinary teams.\n\nAnd Brown bristles at the suggestion that the global push for interdisciplinarity might be a fad. “The answer is a resounding 'no',” he says. “Things have changed — now people focus on big problems, and if you go for a big problem you need to be interdisciplinary.”",
  "latent_15414": "Good luck to U.S. voters looking for a presidential contender who believes in free trade. Protectionist policies have come into fashion, and \"globalization\" is regarded as a dirty word by those seeking to be the country's next president. That's great for all those Smoot-Hawley fans out there who may have forgotten how 1930's trade restrictions worsened the Great Depression, but it's a sad state of affairs for those who still favor economic growth.\n\nTake, for instance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the pro-business group that usually backs Republican candidates as reliably as \"Game of Thrones\" kills major characters. Their attack this week on Donald J. Trump, the party's presumptive nominee, was sharp and unapologetic, calling his views on trade \"flat out wrong.\" The chamber's beef? During a visit to the Ohio Valley on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called NAFTA the \"worst trade deal in history,\" harshly criticized the U.S. trade agreement with South Korea and described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a \"death blow for American manufacturing.\"\n\nThat sort of rhetoric wouldn't be shocking coming from Sen. Bernie Sanders (or any number of Democrats, frankly), but it's bizarre to see the GOP's standard-bearer espousing such business unfriendly views as forcefully as this. Mr. Trump was skeptical of the TPP before last week's Brexit vote, of course, but as the Chamber of Commerce acknowledges, he now seems to be \"doubling down\" on protectionism.\n\n\"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country,\" the New York billionaire and reality television star said during a stop in St. Clairsville, Ohio. \"That's what it is, too. It's a harsh word. It's a rape of our country.\"\n\nInappropriate imagery aside, Mr. Trump's effort to move to the political left of the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on trade is not just a populist political tactic: It could prove disastrous for the very middle class workers he claims to be representing, raising unrealistic expectations of what any president can do about the global economy or worse, ensuring the next occupant of the White House will be scrapping rather than inking trade deals like the TPP which, incidentally, Secretary Clinton now says she opposes.\n\nFirst, let's get the terminology straight. Globalization isn't new, it's just a term used these days to describe a process that is centuries old — the movement toward more integrated societies where people can travel, communicate, do business and trade more freely. Historically, the U.S. thrives when trade barriers are reduced. U.S. manufacturing has actually benefited overall from NAFTA, for instance, with sales to Canada and Mexico increasing 63 percent from 1993 to 2006 compared to 37 percent the 13 years before that. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers benefited from lower prices.\n\nThe shrinking middle class and growing income inequality within the United States aren't products of bad trade deals. The situation is more complicated than that and involves technology, tax policy, education and changing demographics. And while the loss of high-paying blue collar jobs is clearly a factor, the answer isn't to build a proverbial fence around livelihoods destined to go the way of buggy whip making — it's to increase U.S. competitiveness and productivity. Steelmaking and coal mining might have been big job producers a century ago, but it's far better for the U.S. to focus on technology, aerospace, advanced materials, medical technology, pollution controls, computer software, biotechnology and other sectors with high-growth potential. Under Armour may be working to bring manufacturing to Baltimore, but it's not talking about rooms full of low-skill workers with sewing machines. It's opening a facility with robots, 3D printers and workers in lab coats.\n\nThe outlook for the TPP is clearly bleak for this year — but with it could go the country's best chance of countering China's growing economic influence among Pacific nations. If the U.S. doesn't want these markets, China will be only too happy to do more business with countries that collectively represent about 40 percent of the global economy — an alliance that will carry negative implications not only for U.S. job growth but potentially for national security as well.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Trump is just bloviating again, but words matter. Just ask Brexit voters who are just now coming to realize that the country's choice to leave the European Union may not be as easy — or beneficial — as they thought prior to casting their votes. So much for nationalism over rational trade policies. Trade isn't Ms. Clinton's strong suit, given her estrangement from the Obama administration on the TPP, but Mr. Trump now appears anxious to prove himself even worse.",

He was traded away to Buffalo less than a week later. Kane has downplayed the incident in subsequent interviews. Byfuglien would only say, “I’m sure you have rules in your household … and if the kids don’t stick to it, you’ve got to discipline them. It is what it is.\"\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSpeculation about these long-time teammates ran rampant. Some said they had a beef that went back to their days in Atlanta. Some said it was a more recent falling out. Whatever the case, there was little that captured the dynamic between Byfuglien and Kane.\n\nUntil that photo hit the web.\n\nIt shows Kane, in shorts and a T-shirt, reaching out and touching Byfuglien as he walks by. It shows Byfuglien ignoring him, and giving him the finger.\n\n“This pic pretty much sums up Byfuglien’s and Kane’s relationship,” said one tweet. “Byfuglien does it right. Kane's always been a princess,” said another. “Big Buff has no chill,” said another.\n\nWhere the heck did this photo come from?\n\nIt was taken on Oct. 28, 2014, as the Jets left the locker room at Nassau Coliseum to take on the New York Islanders. Trevor Hagan, who snapped it, is a freelance photographer that was on a rare road assignment with the Winnipeg Free Press.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s interesting about the image – well, one of many things – is that it wasn’t included in the photo gallery from the game. It only surfaced last week, when the trade went down. Editors at the Free Press were searching for a photo that had both players in it, and the archived image came up. They opted to use it in a “Key of Bart” music parody video about the trade and then posted it to Instagram.\n\nFrom that point on, it went viral and has become the definitive photo of the players’ falling out. Which is something that admittedly makes Hagan feel uncomfortable, because the context of the image was lighthearted.\n\nKane was injured for the Islanders game. Hagan said he was riding an exercise bike as the Jets began filing through the dressing room hallway to the ice. He got off the bike and stood by rookie goalie Michael Hutchinson to fist-bump the players they hit the ice.\n\nLast in line? Byfuglien. Kane reached out. Buff “basically pretends that Kane wasn’t there,” said Hagan. He keeps walking, Kane gives him a playful shove and Byfuglien then gives him the finger.\n\n“He then nearly crushed me against a wall,” said Hagan of Byfuglien. “His jersey was about an inch from my lens.”\n\nHagan said the entire sequence was “all in good spirits” and that there was nothing “malicious” behind Byfuglien’s actions. “Kane was supporting the guys headed to the ice. He had a good laugh. Hutchinson had a good laugh. And it was just Buff being Buff. He’s the type that jokes around with the players and the fans.”\n\nHagan, a freelancer for over five years with the Free Press, said the context of the photo presented a challenge to the editors when they discovered it and wanted to use it to illustrate the relationship between the players.\n\n“The context is far removed from what happened in the last couple of weeks,” he said. “They debated about using it at all, or in what way to use it.”\n\nIn the end, the Free Press used it on the video and added context when it added the image to Instagram:\n\n\"In a playful mood earlier this season, Winnipeg Jets' Evander Kane jokes with Dustin Byfuglien prior to the game against the New York Islanders' during NHL hockey action at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY.\"\n\nHagan is struggling with the same conflict. He took a photo of a lighthearted moment between teammates that’s been redefined as the quintessential example of the players’ animosity.\n\n“I’m happy to be associated with a major event in Winnipeg. I happened to be in the right place at the right time. On the other hand, I didn’t want the trade to happen. I thought Kane had been playing fantastic, and I’m honestly really sad about the way things went,” said Hagan, a Jets fan.\n\nLike any photographer, he’s honored that the image has gone viral.

  "latent_15597": "Trump’s Appointments — Paul Craig Roberts\n\nTrump’s Appointments\n\nPaul Craig Roberts\n\nWhat do they mean?\n\nBefore I give an explanation, let’s be sure we all know what an explanation is. An explanation is not a justification. The collapse of education in the US is so severe that many Americans, especially younger ones, cannot tell the difference between an explanation and a defense, justification, or apology for what they regard as a guilty person or party. If an explanation is not damning or sufficiently damning of what they want damned, the explanation is interpreted as an excuse for the object of their scorn. In America, reason and objective analysis have taken a backseat to emotion.\n\nWe do not know what the appointments mean except, as Trump discovered once he confronted the task of forming a government, that there is no one but insiders to appoint. For the most part that is correct. Outsiders are a poor match for insiders who tend to eat them alive. Ronald Reagan’s California crew were a poor match for George H.W. Bush’s insiders. The Reagan part of the government had a hell of a time delivering results that Reagan wanted.\n\nAnother limit on a president’s ability to form a government is Senate confirmation of presidential appointees. Whereas Congress is in Republican hands, Congress remains in the hands of special interests who will protect their agendas from hostile potential appointees. Therefore, although Trump does not face partisan opposition from Congress, he faces the power of special interests that fund congressional political campaigns.\n\nWhen the White House announced my appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Republican Senator Bob Dole put a hold on my appointment. Why? Dole had presidential ambitions, and he saw the rising star of Republican Representative Jack Kemp as a potential obstacle. As I had written the Kemp-Roth bill that had become Reagan’s economic policy, Dole regarded me in the Treasury as a one-up for Kemp. So, you see, all sorts of motives can plague a president’s ability to form a government.\n\nWith Trump under heavy attack prior to his inauguration, he cannot afford drawn out confirmation fights and defeats.\n\nDoes Trump’s choice of Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary mean that Goldman Sachs will again be in charge of US economic policy? Possibly, but we do not know. We will have to wait and see. Mnuchin left Goldman Sachs 14 years ago. He has been making movies in Hollywood and started his own investment firm. Many people have worked for Goldman Sachs and the New York Banks who have become devastating critics of the banks. Read Nomi Prins’ books and visit Pam Martens website, Wall Street on Parade ( http://wallstreetonparade.com ). My sometimes coauthor Dave Kranzler is a former Wall Streeter.\n\nCommentators are jumping to conclusions based on appointees past associations. Mnuchin was an early Trump supporter and chairman of Trump’s finance campaign. He has Wall Street and investment experience. He should be an easy confirmation. For a president-elect under attack this is important.\n\nWill Mnuchin suppport Trump’s goal of bringing middle class jobs back to America? Is Trump himself sincere? We do not know.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump attacked the fake “free trade” agreements that have stripped America of middle class jobs just as did Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. We know that the Clintons made their fortune as agents of the One Percent, the only ones who have profited from the offshoring of American jobs. Trump’s fortune is not based on jobs offshoring.\n\nNot every billionaire is an oligarch. Trump’s relation to the financial sector is one as a debtor. No doubt Trump and the banks have had unsatisfactory relationships. And Trump says he is a person who enjoys revenge.\n\nWhat about the hot-headed generals announced as National Security Advisor and Secretary of Defense? Both seem to be death on Iran, which is stupid and unfortunate. However, keep in mind that Gen. Flynn is the one who blew the whistle on the Obama regime for rejecting the advice of the DIA and sending ISIS to overthrow Assad. Flynn said that ISIS was a “willful decision” of the Obama administration, not some unexpected event.\n\nAnd keep in mind that Gen. Mattis is the one who told Trump that torture does not work, which caused Trump to back off his endorsement of torture.\n\nSo both of these generals, as bad as they may be, are an improvement on what came before. Both have shown independence from the neoconservative line that supports ISIS and torture.\n\nKeep in mind also that there are two kinds of insiders. Some represent the agendas of special interests; others go with the flow because they enjoy participating in the affairs of the nation. Those who don’t go with the flow are eliminated from participating.\n\nGoldman Sachs is a good place to get rich. That Mnuchin left 14 years ago could mean that he was not a good match for Goldman Sachs, that they did not like him or he did not like them. That Flynn and Mattis have taken independent positions on ISIS and torture suggests that they are mavericks. All three of these appointees seem to be strong and confident individuals who know the terrain, which is the kind of people a president needs if he is to accomplish anything.\n\nThe problem with beating up on an administration before it exists and has a record is that the result can be that the administration becomes deaf to all criticism. It is much better to give the new president a chance and to hold his feet to the fire on the main issues.\n\nTrump alone among all the presidential candidates said that he saw no point in fomenting conflict with Russia. Trump alone questioned NATO’s continued existence 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nTrump alone said that he would work to bring middle class jobs back to America.\n\nAnd Trump said that he would enforce immigration laws. Is this racism or is this a defense of citizenship? How is the US a country if there is no difference between illegal aliens and citizens?\n\nCommentators of all stripes are making a mistake to damn in advance the only government that campaigned on peace with Russia, restoring middle class jobs, and respect for the country’s borders. We should seize on these promises and hold the Trump administration to them. We should also work to make Trump aware of the serious adverse consequences of environmental degradation.\n\nWho is blowing these opportunities? Trump? Mnuchin? Flynn? Mattis?\n\nOr us?\n\nThe more Trump is criticized, the easier it is for the neoconservatives to offer their support and enter the administration. To date he has not appointed one, but you can bet your life that Israel is lobbying hard for the neocons. The neocons still reign in the media, the think tanks, university departments of foreign affairs, and the foreign policy community. They are an ever present danger.\n\nTrump’s personality means that he is likely to see more reward in being the president who reverses American decline than in using the presidency to augment his personal fortune. Therefore, there is some hope for change occuring from the top rather than originating in the streets of bloody revolution. By the time Americans reach the revolutionary stage of awareness the police state is likely to be too strong for them.\n\nSo let’s give the Trump administration a chance. We can turn on him after he sells us out.",

Even with the cooling effects of a strong La Nina influence and low solar activity for the past several years, 2011 was one of the 10 warmest years on record.”\n\nHansen said that with the anticipated return of El Nino and a coming increase in solar activity, temperatures are likely to peak further in the coming years.\n\n“It’s always dangerous to make predictions about El Nino, but it’s safe to say we’ll see one in the next three years,” Hansen said.\n\n“It won’t take a very strong El Nino to push temperatures above 2010,” which tied with 2005 as the warmest year on record.",

Scott Brooks has said the Ian Mahinmi is doubtful for the game, so he won’t return to the rotation. Markieff Morris and Marcin Gortat have been outplayed this series, but that has been talked about enough and we must expect them to be outplayed for the remainder of the series. The big story is Jason Smith. If he is not able to play, who will be the backup center? Morris, Kelly Oubre, Otto Porter, and Bojan Bogdanovic can soak up his minutes at the 4, but Morris and Gortat will not be able to play all the minutes at the 5. Undrafted rookie Daniel Ochefu is the most likely candidate to play about 5 minutes if Smith and Mahinmi are both out, and this is a terrifying thought. Ochefu has played in 21 career NBA games, including the postseason, all of which have come in garbage time. In other words, if Smith and Mahinmi are both out, the Wizards will struggle down low.\n\nWILL THE WIZARDS START PLAYING DEFENSE?\n\nThe Wizards have not played defense since the All-Star Break, ranking 27th in the league in defensive rating with a 110.7 (stats via NBA.com). Only the Timberwolves, Lakers, and Cavaliers were worse (two teams who were not even close to making the playoffs and a team that won less than half their games after the break). They have made Dennis Schroder, a decent starting point guard, look like an All-NBA caliber player. Taurean Prince, a rookie who averaged 5.7 points per game during the regular season, has more than doubled his average to 12.3 points in the playoffs (stats via Basketball Reference). These are just two examples of the Wizards making players look a lot better than they actually are. They have shown no signs of playing consistently good defense and this could lead to their downfall in the playoffs.\n\nCAN THE WIZARDS WIN ON THE ROAD?\n\nSo far in this series, the home team has won every game. This trend looks like it will continue. Game 6 is in Atlanta, so unless Washington can somehow figure out to play well in Atlanta, I expect to see a Game 7 at Verizon on Sunday.\n\nPrediction:\n\nOne of Smith and Mahinmi plays, the game goes back and forth, and Wall and Beal play well, but the struggles of Morris and Gortat are too much to overcome on the road against a Hawks team that does not want to go fishing yet. Hawks 107 – Wizards 103 (I hope I’m wrong about this one)\n\nSeries Prediction:\n\nWizards in 7\n\nFollow me on twitter for more @pjhowley99\n\nAdvertisements",

It’s different to a lot of programming books, in that rather than focusing a specific language or API it focus on a particular set of problems and shows techniques that can be used to crack them.\n\nFor example I’ve known for a long time that it’s easy to create an abstract syntax tree (AST) in F#:\n\n/// Untyped expression tree\n\ntype Expression =\n\n| Multiply of Expression * Expression\n\n| Add of Expression * Expression\n\n| Subtract of Expression * Expression\n\n| GreaterThan of Expression * Expression\n\n| If of Expression * Expression * Expression\n\n| Constant of int\n\n| Parameter of int\n\nHere we present a simple AST for representing numeric expressions, while it’s easy to provide a function to evaluate such a tree:\n\n/// Given a list of parameters evaluate the tree\n\nlet evaluateExpression parameters =\n\nlet rec innerEval tree =\n\nmatch tree with\n\n| Multiply (x, y) -> innerEval x * innerEval y\n\n| Add (x, y) -> innerEval x + innerEval y\n\n| Subtract (x, y) -> innerEval x - innerEval y\n\n| GreaterThan (x, y) -> if innerEval x > innerEval y then 0 else 1\n\n| If (pred, tval, fval) -> if innerEval pred = 0 then innerEval fval else innerEval tval\n\n| Constant value -> value\n\n| Parameter pos -> List.nth parameters pos\n\ninnerEval\n\nI’ve often had problems coming up with nice simple examples of what you might want to do with such an expression. Well “Collective Intelligence” gave me a great idea of what you can do with such an expression: genetic programming. The example we’re going to look at is presented in chapter 11, pages 251 to 268. The idea is straight forward if you can abstractly represent a program as we can with our numeric expression AST then it’s possible to make random changes to our program. Wants we have made the random changes we can measure which programs are successful and use the successful ones to create a new generation of programs. So what kind of problems can we solve with this approach? Well here’s a nice one, suppose we have a set of points:\n\nX Y Result\n\n36 38 1485\n\n17 13 371\n\n13 2 217\n\n24 31 715\n\n13 0 213\n\n38 3 1569\n\n10 11 157\n\n11 32 223\n\n18 25 433\n\nAnd we want to find out what function fits best to these points, we can use genetic programming to solve this problem. I’ve given a program below that can solve this problem though genetic programming. I don’t want to go into too many details, you should really buy the book if you want a good explanation, but in a nutshell the algorithm works in the following way:\n\n- We create a bunch of random function\n\n- We test how close these get to the predefined points\n\n- If we find a function that fits we return it\n\n- Otherwise we breed the most successful function and loop to the testing step\n\nAnyway the full implementation is here, and version can be downloaded here [EDIT: link fixed]:\n\n#light\n\nopen System\n\nopen Microsoft.FSharp.Math\n\n/// Untyped expression tree\n\ntype Expression =\n\n| Multiply of Expression * Expression\n\n| Add of Expression * Expression\n\n| Subtract of Expression * Expression\n\n| GreaterThan of Expression * Expression\n\n| If of Expression * Expression * Expression\n\n| Constant of int\n\n| Parameter of int\n\n/// Given a list of parameters evaluate the tree\n\nlet evaluateExpression parameters =\n\nlet rec innerEval tree =\n\nmatch tree with\n\n| Multiply (x, y -> innerEval x * innerEval y\n\n| Add (x, y -> innerEval x + innerEval y\n\n| Subtract (x, y -> innerEval x -

  "latent_16295": "Revolutionary Iran: A History of the Islamic Republic. By Michael Axworthy. Allen Lane; 496 pages; £25. Buy from Amazon.co.uk\n\n“SLEEP easily, Cyrus, for we are awake,” assured Iran’s last shah, Muhammad-Reza Pahlavi, speaking at the tomb of his imperial ancestor in 1971. This staged event helped forge the myth that the Pahlavis were an adored monarchy stretching back millennia to the Achaemenid empire, a claim to which the shah clung dearly. Yet in less than a decade his embittered people had delivered his throne into the hands of an obscure Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. James Buchan’s elegant “Days of God”, which came out last November, focused on how all this came to pass. Now Michael Axworthy, a former diplomat and director of the Centre for Persian and Iranian Studies at Exeter University, goes over much of the same ground and explains how the Islamic republic has survived.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe shah’s gaudy fete at Persepolis, not far from Cyrus’s tomb, held to celebrate the monarchy’s 2,500th birthday, epitomised a half-century of montazh (from the French montage): a succession of flashy buildings and self-congratulatory statues which helped to conceal the dislocations of a society on fast-forward. Construction faltered for lack of cement; many of Iran’s ports became clogged with shiploads of imports. The minister of the shah’s court, driving through Tehran in his Chrysler Imperial in 1969, noticed dingy side streets with “not an ounce of asphalt”. Lashing out at the grandiose party at Persepolis, Ali Shariati, an Iranian leftist writer, denounced 5,000 years of deprivation and social injustice. Khomeini, then in exile in Iraq, thundered for the first time that Islam was fundamentally opposed to monarchy.\n\nA hodgepodge of Marxists and other leftists allied themselves at first to the religious fundamentalists in common cause against the shah, inspiring Iranian students, in particular, to rise up against his rule. Within a few years, though, the left had lost out to Shia Islamic political groups that were, Mr Axworthy writes, “more flexible, more charismatic, more in tune with Iranian realities and less hidebound”. Like Mr Buchan, Mr Axworthy has mined newly opened archives to good effect. He lays bare the failure of Western governments to keep abreast of fast-changing events. One British dispatch saw “no threat to basic stability” in late 1977; another asked whether Iranians were still “the epitome of idleness”. The Iranian hostage-takers were astounded to find that, of the four CIA officers in the American embassy in Tehran, none could speak Persian.\n\nBalancing scholarly precision with narrative flair, Mr Axworthy depicts an Islamic movement that exploited and distorted traditional Shia beliefs in order to seize and hold on to power. Cycles of protest and mourning, 40 days long and timed to coincide with Shia holy days—Mr Buchan’s “days of God”—were like “a great revolutionary lung”, inhaling indignation, exhaling more demonstrations. Khomeini’s theory of divine rule, velayat-e faqih, still unknown to most in 1979, represented a complete innovation in Shia religious thinking. The Shia Muslim tradition believes the Mahdi, its messiah, will return, but its adherents had not previously considered putting themselves in power.\n\nRevolutionary jargon justified purges and trials (the regime executed 2,946 people in 1981 alone, according to Amnesty International). Those who survived bombs set off by the radical left and other secularists were glorified as shaheed-e zendeh, or living martyrs. Fundamentalist rhetoric also fed popular fervour for an eight-year war against Iraq, framing the struggle as a continuation of the ancient fight between the evil caliph Yazid and the martyred Hussein, who was killed at the battle of Karbala in 680. Military offensives were named after that sacred Shia site; the last big assault, Karbala-5, fought around Fish Lake, a huge artificial basin on Iraqi defence lines, was also the most wretchedly wasteful. Around 20,000 Iranians are believed to have died.\n\nMr Axworthy does the best job so far of describing the Iran-Iraq war. He draws on first-hand accounts of pilots, lieutenants and militia, and challenges the accepted notion that the Iranian air force was inept. The attacks were carried out according to intricate plans drafted under the shah, whose highly trained pilots were released from prison. He also breaks from Mr Buchan’s thesis that Khomeini was bent on exporting Islamic government to Iraq, arguing instead that he saw the conflict as a just war to fend off a real threat. Drawing on Persian eyewitness accounts, he conjures up the chaos: the scramble for masks in nerve-gas attacks; paper-thin lungs blistered by mustard gas; fish, rotting and floating belly-up in an Iraqi lake brimming with barbed wire, electrodes and mines, “adding a new stench to the battlefield”.\n\nYet the repressive Islamic republic of today was not at all inevitable. Reformist Iranian presidents succeeded one another, from Mehdi Bazargan and Abolhassan Bani-Sadr in 1980 to Muhammad Khatami in 1997. Evidence shows that Khomeini genuinely wanted to work with progressive governments—not least because he needed their credibility to rule. Mr Axworthy paints a nuanced picture of the ayatollah, who let army generals lead the war and his assembly of experts end it, although the ceasefire was “more deadly to [him] than poison”.\n\nMr Axworthy’s analytical approach helps him demystify a revolutionary regime that has needed to feed off myths. He revisits, and convincingly reinterprets, defining moments of the Islamic republic. One is Khomeini’s infamous response to a journalist as he returned to Tehran in February 1979, to cheering crowds. He felt “nothing”, he said—not because of a cold indifference to the Iranian people, but because he believed himself to be only a vehicle for the mind of God on Earth. The strength of Mr Buchan’s rendering of Iran’s story lies in its detail and its delicious storytelling; Mr Axworthy’s, in his scholarly rigour and first-class analysis. Anyone interested in this most complex of revolutions would do well to read both.",

It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies,\" he wrote. It also mentioned \"watermelon smiles\".\n\nAt the debate, sponsored by the Evening Standard, Michael Eboda, former editor of New Nation, said that some of Johnson's writings had been offensive. \"These things are an extremely big obstacle to being able to work with what is 12% of London's population,\" he said. Johnson responded: \"I feel sad that people have been offended by those words and I apologise for them.\"\n\nLord Ouseley - the former chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, who recently wrote to the Tory leader, David Cameron, expressing concern about Johnson, said: \"I personally recognise that you have to move on, but there are other people who he will have to convince.\"",

Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and shields. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only a shield: You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and shield attacks.\n\nYou can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike and your shield can be used as a weapon. This die changes as you gain Shield Soldier levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of Table: The Shield Soldier .\n\n. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a your shield on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with your shield, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Shield Bond At 1st level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one round shield. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The shield must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the shield and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a shield to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that shield unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plan e of existence, you can summon that shield as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your arm. You can only have one bonded shield at a time. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor. Tactics Starting at 2nd level, your training has become so intense it allows you to perform powerful abilities called “Tactics”. Utilizing these tactics is draining and you can only use them so many times before needing to rest.. Your Shield Soldier level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Tactics Points column of Table: The Shield Soldier. You can spend these points to fuel various Tactics features. You start knowing four such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, Shield Defense, and Tactical Maneuver. You learn more Tactics features as you gain levels in this class.\n\nWhen you spend a Tactics point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended Tactics back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your Tactics points. Some of your Tactics features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Tactics save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 Tactics point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 Tactics point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Shield Defense You can spend 1 Tactics point to give yourself Half Cover as a bonus action on your turn, as long as your are wielding your shield, this lasts until your next turn. Tactical Maneuvering You can spend 1 Tactics point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Combat Control Tactics Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 1 Tactics point to combine a Combat Control Tactic with your Flurry of Blows attack. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\nIt must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 10 feet away from you.\n\nIt can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. Throw Shield Starting at 3rd level, as one of your attacks in the Attack action, you can make a thrown weapon attack with your shield, Range 20/40. When you gain Extra Attacks, you can expend an attack from the Attack Action to have your thrown shield or weapon ricochet and target one additional creature or object within 10 feet of the target prior. For each attack that you expend, you can target an additional creature. This does not include Flurry of Blows attacks. A separate attack rolls is needed for each individual target. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Slow Fall Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your Shield Soldier level. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Shield Slam Starting at 5th level, you gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield: If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 Tactics point and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\n\nWhen you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee shield attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taTacticsng this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 15 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed). Empowered Strikes Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Second Wind At 6th level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Evasion At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

  "latent_16476": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Obama administration is taking another swing at improving its main foreclosure prevention program.\n\nThe administration said it was expanding eligibility for its Home Affordable Modification Program, known as HAMP, to borrowers with higher debt loads and tripling the incentives it pays banks that reduce principal on loans.\n\nThe administration also said it would offer incentives to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce principal on loans. Previously, the government had only offered incentives to private lenders and banks. The program was also extended to December 2013. It was initially set to expire at the end of this year.\n\nThe changes were announced in a joint press conference held by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Assistant Treasury Secretary Tim Massad, and White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling on Friday afternoon.\n\nOriginally designed to help some 4 million mortgage borrowers when it was first introduced in February, 2009, HAMP has helped fewer than 1 million homeowners.\n\nWith these changes, HAMP is turning into an \"all of the above strategy to help responsible homeowners lower their costs and stay in their homes,\" said Gene Sperling, the Director of the National Economic Council, who also took part in the press conference.\n\nHere's a rundown of the new changes:\n\nExpansion of eligibility: HAMP was designed to bring the debt ratio of mortgage borrowers down to 31% of their incomes. Those whose mortgage payments were already below that level had been ineligible for a modification. They may qualify now. The new guidelines will allow for a more flexible approach that takes other debt into account when calculating debt-to-income ratios.\n\nHAMP was designed to bring the debt ratio of mortgage borrowers down to 31% of their incomes. Those whose mortgage payments were already below that level had been ineligible for a modification. They may qualify now. The new guidelines will allow for a more flexible approach that takes other debt into account when calculating debt-to-income ratios. Extension of eligibility to owners of rentals properties: The old HAMP rules applied solely to owner-occupied homes but now those who own rental properties may also qualify for a HAMP modification.\n\nThe old HAMP rules applied solely to owner-occupied homes but now those who own rental properties may also qualify for a HAMP modification. Triple balance-reduction incentives: The new HAMP will pay between 18 cents and 63 cents for every dollar that lenders take off the mortgage principal, up from between 6 cents and 21 cents.\n\nThe new HAMP will pay between 18 cents and 63 cents for every dollar that lenders take off the mortgage principal, up from between 6 cents and 21 cents. Pay Fannie and Freddie the same incentives: Currently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not offer principal reduction plans as part of their HAMP modifications. To encourage this assistance, Treasury said it will pay the same principal reduction incentives to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac if they allow servicers to forgive principal in conjunction with a HAMP modification.\n\nWhile the new changes could greatly expand the number of homeowners that receive help from HAMP, it could invite controversy. Subsidizing real estate investors with taxpayer money in a time of rising rents doesn't makes much sense to Anthony Sanders, a real estate professor at George Mason University, for example.\n\nYet, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said that it doesn't matter whether the house next door to you is occupied by a tenant or an owner.\n\n\"If the house goes vacant, the value of your house goes down $5,000 or $10,000 that day,\" he said. \"These are major problems for homeowners.\"\n\nFollowing the press conference, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, issued a statement that said it would consider the changes to the HAMP program.\n\nHowever, it noted that an analysis it recently conducted found \"that principal forgiveness did not provide benefits that were greater than principal forbearance,\" signaling that the housing authority may not support reducing the principal on loans as a way to help homeowners.\n\nNo new funds need be allocated for HAMP's expansion. Since less than $10 billion of the $29 billion set aside for the program has been spent so far, said Timothy Massad, Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability at the Treasury Department. The administration would not hazard a guess at how many more borrowers the expanded program would help.\n\nThe changes in HAMP do not take effect until the end of April, but a Treasury spokeswoman said any struggling homeowners should reach out and seek foreclosure prevention counseling immediately. That way, they can learn their options, which could include trying to hold on until the new HAMP is ready.",

Actually choosing not to mouth off about titties and pussies and riding women, writes Michele A’Court.\n\nI’d like to think there’s a men’s meeting going on somewhere with someone in charge making an important speech. “Fellers, look, you can have your fun and, sure, we all make mistakes. But just calm the fuck down, would you, on the public displays of douchiness – you’re making us all look bad.”\n\nBecause with every step forward – men speaking out against family violence, corporations endorsing policies of inclusion, the Icelandic government pledging to close the gender pay gap by 2020, your partner doing shit around the house without making a song and dance about it – just when you think, “We’re getting somewhere!” some numb-nut grabs you by the pussy and pushes us all 50 steps back.\n\nSometimes I feel like I’m living in a lady-version of The Truman Show – surrounded by good souls who are into fancy shit like consent, and listening, and kindness, and being respectful.

I don’t want to look at people in the biscuit aisle at the supermarket and wonder if they’re the person I just heard talking about Muslims and/or solo mums in a way that’s less than elevating.\n\nAnd so – let’s do this chronologically – Trump was shocking to me. Less what he has said, than the barrage of people defending it as locker-room banter. Really? You guys have a private world where this is OK? Is that really what happens when women aren’t there? Well, fuck me with an orange toupee. I’m going to look at you all a little differently for a while.\n\nAnd then along comes Max Key with his “real men ride women”. Though it was mostly his Dad’s response that infuriated me – the old diminish-and-dismiss one-two: “Clearly he didn’t mean to make the sort of comment that he made in the way he did, but he fully takes responsibility for it. I’ve told him it’s not appropriate, he’s apologised and assured me he won’t do it again.”\n\nSee also: Stop saying dumb shit, and other top tips for all the Kevins of the world\n\nIn defence of Warriena Wright: an open letter to a slut-shaming newspaper columnist\n\nLooking back on a total shitter of a week for women in New Zealand\n\nLook, we all love our kids – that’s our job – but that whole first sentence is patently bullshit. A) Max actually said it with his very own voice; B) it’s four words so sod-all wiggle room for getting anything round the wrong way and misrepresenting his intent; C) Max, apparently alone in the car, videoed himself shouting it at the cyclists, then D) hit stop and save on the recording; and E) satisfied with its content, uploaded it to the internet. That was exactly the sort of comment he meant to make. If he’d fucked it up, doubtless he would have driven round the block, come up behind the cyclists one more time and given himself a Take 2.\n\nAnd then Paul Henry. Again, it’s not what he said that shocked me. Blah blah genius, blah blah hate people. Up until the bit about his fellow diner, my response would have been a solid, “Meh.” And I guess it’s not even that a grown man goes into a lengthy lunchtime riff about breasts that bothers me – now that I’ve seen behind the cyclorama on The Ms Truman Show, I’m getting to grips with the idea that #notallmen are like the pleasant male humans I know personally.\n\nAs I’ve said somewhere else, it was the restaurant equivalent of shouting unwarranted commentary from a passing car at a woman trying to go about her day. Whether she heard him or not (maybe she zipped up her jacket because she was suddenly sitting in a draft) he had reduced her to an object for his judgement over quite some period of time. Long enough to ascribe geographical descriptions and ponder the effects of future motherhood on their terrain.\n\nBut there are two things that properly get on my own personal tits about this. First, that Henry thought this was appropriate for a news and current affairs host to say in a mainstream media interview. That you can commentate publicly about a real human person’s “titties” one minute, and ask probing questions about the housing crisis, or sexual violence, or an industrial dispute the next. Without your viewers wondering whether your interviewee has, in your expert and well-documented opinion, boobs that owe their provenance to Palm Springs or Rancho Mirage.\n\nAnd secondly, what annoyed me was not being able to dismiss the “titties” rant as the attitude and behaviour of an outlier. “Paul Henry just says out loud what everyone else is thinking!” Are you? Seriously? And here was me thinking he was saying what other people were too smart to think in the first place and/or too well-mannered to keep to them-fucking-selves. Because it is seriously not helping.\n\nAnd look, just a brief mention of Anthony Weiner. If that needy little dude’s dick-pics end up being the schlong that breaks the camel’s back and delivers Donald “No-one respects women more than I do” Trump to the Whitehouse, I’m walking off The Ms Truman Show set once and for all.\n\nI like to have people of substance to look up to. Journalists and broadcasters and politicians who are smarter than me, and also kind, and who have a bigger vision than me – but who have me (or someone like us) in mind when they ask their questions or make their decisions. So on a flagship news and current affairs show, I’d like to go, “That guy – he represents me and asks questions on my behalf because he cares about people like me.”\n\nWithout wanting to go all Hobson’s Pledge on your arse and get nostalgic for “God Save the Queen” at the movies, wouldn’t it be great to have more men of character and quality just, like, deliberately choosing to not talk about titties and pussies and riding women, or even just using their elevated position to punch up, rather than down.\n\nBecause I think it would be in all of our interests to get to a place where, when someone said something offensive about women, our first reaction was not to say, “Well, you know … That’s what men are like.” Someone really should call that meeting.",

  "latent_17118": "The actual version number for .NET 4.5 assemblies is 4.0.30319. If that looks familiar it is because that is also the version number for .NET 4.0 assemblies. Much to the chagrin of developers, Microsoft will be updating core assemblies “in-place”. Aside from making much harder to determine which version of .NET the user actually has installed, it creates numerous pitfalls for developers targeting .NET 4.0 with machines that have 4.5 installed.\n\nWhile Visual Studio is quite capable of keeping developers from accidentally using .NET 3.0 or 3.5 assemblies in projects targeting .NET 2.0 the same cannot be said for individual methods. Within the IDE there is no warning that method in a common library such as mscorlib.dll or System.dll didn’t exist in the older version. Unless a static analysis tool is used to programmatically check for such mistakes, the error will probably not be detected until the code fails at runtime. A good example of this is EventWaitHandle.WaitOne, which has overloads that were added via a service pack that shipped with .NET 3.5.\n\nWhile this is still a theoretical problem at this time, there are also several breaking changes in .NET 4.5 that will need to be accounted for.\n\nUnhandled, unobserved exceptions\n\nIn .NET 2.0 the semantics for unhandled exceptions changed. Prior to this version exceptions on a non-UI thread would simply be discarded and the associated thread terminated. As of .NET 2.0, unhandled exceptions would cause the entire application to crash. While this greatly reduced the possibility of data corruption and undetected errors, it also meant that all calls made on back-ground threads were handled a top-level exception handler.\n\nWhen the Task Parallel Library was introduced it followed this model. If a Task is faulted, its Exception property must be read before the Task is garbage collected. Failing to do so will cause the finalizer to terminate the application on the grounds that it had an unhandled exception.\n\nIn .NET 4.5 the rule for Tasks will change to be like the pre-2.0 rule for threads. While a global event will be raised for logging purposes, faulted Tasks will no longer crash the application.\n\nSystem.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration\n\nThe namespace System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration is not available and no explanation was given why.\n\nThese libraries were only available on non-server versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7 and are an extension to the Windows Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure. Being a rarely used subset of a rarely used technology, there is very little information on this namespace and it is unlikely to affect more than a handful of developers.\n\nWCF\n\nWhen the maxRequestLength or maxReceivedMessageSize quota is exceeded the HTTP status code has changed from 400 (Bad Request) to 413 (Request Entity Too Large).\n\nWPF\n\nThe default value of TextBoxBase.UndoLimit has been changed from -1 (unlimited) to 100. No explanation was given, but presumably this offers a performance advantage over storing an indefinite number of prior versions of the text box contents.\n\nXML/XSLT\n\nValidation errors throw by XDocument will now include the line number and position if LoadOptions.SetLineInfo was passed to the Load method.\n\nForward compatibility mode for the System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform class has been fixed.",
  "latent_17167": "Triaging large packet captures is a daunting task, even for the most seasoned security analysts. With a mountain of data and few leads, analysts need to find ways to pare down what they've captured and focus on the areas that have the highest chance of producing results. In this blog we present four TShark commands and strategies we use to tackle this challenge.\n\nIf analysis is being performed on a large packet capture -- something too large to reasonably work with in Wireshark -- and there are no initial leads to pursue, then a good starting point is to summarize what the capture contains. This information can inform the next steps of analysis and ultimately help remove the uninteresting parts. Using TShark, we will gather statistics of traffic within the capture to understand the most valuable pieces of information we need to begin: protocol use, infrastructure, and conversations.\n\n1. Protocols\n\nFirst, we will get a feel for the protocols in the capture. This helps identify low security value protocols and understand what devices are in the capture. It's important to recognize that protocol classifications can be incorrect, so questionable items may require a closer look later on. To view the protocol classification for a capture, we can use the following TShark command:\n\ntshark -q -r <pcap> -z io,phs\n\nThis produces a list of protocols in a hierarchical fashion, similar to the truncated example below:\n\nFigure 1. Sample Protocol Hierarchy Statistics\n\nThe more diverse the PCAP, the more complicated and messy this becomes. Focus on understanding the major protocols present and what percentage of the PCAP they represent. What is the breakdown of TCP vs UDP? How much HTTP, DNS, SSL, SMTP, SSH, SMB, and FTP traffic does it contain?\n\nThere is a wealth of information in these results to build filters for further analysis. We will dive deeper on how to utilize this information further in future blog posts. At this point use the information to hypothesize what the network represented by the PCAP looks like.\n\n2. Infrastructure - Hosts\n\nAfter understanding the protocol makeup, get a sense for the capture's infrastructure composition. Since we are looking to reduce the size of our dataset, we need to identify hosts that are likely associated with legitimate traffic. But we also want to keep a clear and concise filter, so we want to ensure that any filtered hosts have enough traffic to make filtering worthwhile. We can accomplish this by looking at traffic summary by hostname.\n\nTo generate a list of hostnames and associated IPs, use:\n\ntshark -q -r <pcap> -z hosts\n\nFrom this list you can begin to identify benign hostnames to filter. For example, removing legitimate services such as Google or Netflix. You can also use this command to identify suspicious hostnames for further investigation. Take it one step further by seeing how the hostnames rank on the Cisco Umbrella 1 Million List.\n\n3. Infrastructure - IPs\n\nSimilar to hosts, certain IPs may create a large amount of traffic that isn't interesting for security purposes. Displaying the top talkers is another effective method for identifying endpoints to filter. To get a sense of which IPs generate the most traffic in the capture, we use the TShark command:\n\ntshark -q -r <pcap> -z endpoints,ip\n\nBy default, the results are ordered by descending packet count. We are generally more interested in total byte count at this point, but packet numbers often correlate well with total byte counts. The output of this command will likely be a large list with some RFC1918 IPs at the top. It's usually worthwhile to look at the whois of some of the top non-RFC1918 IPs. Additionally, this data can be married with the hostnames output to identify which hostnames are involved with the majority of the traffic.\n\n4. Conversations\n\nOur final method for paring down the capture is based around large IP conversations. This can be a vital step in understanding why some of the IPs listed from the step above have so much traffic. Additionally it can inform you the role of certain IPs and highlight devices you can remove from the focus of your investigation.\n\nThis information can be produced using the command:\n\ntshark -q -r <pcap> -z conv,ip\n\nThis command will produce another long list, but it will likely highlight a number of noisy talkers.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nLarge PCAP files can contain a lot of information making timely triage a difficult task. After using these commands, you will have a number of data points with which to begin trimming down your packet capture. You should also use leads for the next steps of your investigation. In subsequent blog posts we will discuss how to further analyze these results.",

  "latent_17261": "\"Drag Race\" began as the gay dive bar; it's about to be discovered by the straights who come for the great playlists and sassy bartenders.\n\nLast Friday, the season 9 premiere of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” found its highest ratings ever, with nearly 1 million viewers. With its move to a new time slot (from Monday to Friday) and new channel (from Logo to VH1), and an epic appearance by Lady Gaga, a new era of “Drag Race” is upon us.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Stars Slam Wendy Williams for Past ‘Transphobic’ Incidents\n\nThe little reality show that could has struck a chord with a whole new audience, which is why it’s critical for newcomers to approach the franchise with the respect it deserves. “Drag Race” began as the gay dive bar that no one knew about, and it’s about to be discovered by all the straights who come for the great playlists and sassy bartenders. While it’s never been the kind of show where you’d see blowjobs in the bathroom (about the only reality-show staple that’s missing), newcomers would be wise to know their “Drag Race” herstory before jumping on the pride float.\n\nBut, with great popularity comes great responsibility, as RuPaul learned in Season 7 when he had to cut the catchphrase, “You’ve got shemale,” a degrading slur for trans women. And yesterday, “Drag Race” alums Detox and Alaska voiced their disapproval that Wendy Williams was co-hosting a “Drag Race” companion show on VH1, “Fierce Fridays.” According to New York-based drag performer Stephanie Stone, Williams once removed an audience member from her talk show for wearing drag, and Alaska added that Williams has said things about Caitlyn Jenner that were “beyond questionable.”\n\nLogo TV\n\nAs gay culture moves closer to the mainstream, there’s reason to be wary of those jumping on the bandwagon. Here are five things any new fan needs to know about why “Drag Race” is the smartest reality show on television.\n\nIt has all the elements.\n\n“Drag Race” works on many levels; the first is that is has all of the elements of a satisfying competition reality show. Truly: All of them. If you like “Project Runway,” the queens are often making their own garments under time constraints. For “Top Model” fans, the girls must walk the runway and serve face in photo shoots. “American Idol,” “X Factor,” “So You Think You Can Dance”? These girls have to sing, dance, perform comedy, write musicals, you name it. And these ladies can read each other to filth with far wittier zingers than any “Real Housewives” franchise (except maybe Atlanta).\n\nREAD MORE: Emmy Nomination Aside, RuPaul ‘Never Can Be’ Part of the Establishment\n\nAnd all the catchphrases.\n\nLet’s face it: When Tim Gunn unwittingly turned “Make it work” into a household phrase, he was probably echoing RuPaul’s hit song, Supermodel (You Better Work). RuPaul is like the hen that lays the golden eggs when it comes to catchphrases; they just keep coming, and they’re all priceless. From the show’s pun of a title comes, “Gentlemen, start your engines. And may the best woman win,” and RuPaul has an endless supply of lyrics to draw from for phrases such as “Sissy that walk,” “Shante you stay,” and of course, the always inspiring, “If you can’t love yourself, how the hell are you going to love somebody else?”\n\nVH1/Logo\n\nThe guest judges are all fans of the show.\n\nOne of the best parts the Season 9 premiere was seeing just how thrilled Lady Gaga was to be there, and how thoughtful and funny she was with her critiques. (When one comedic queen didn’t have the best look, Gaga saw potential.) RuPaul practically has his pick from gay-icon royalty when it comes to guest judges, who have included John Waters, Neil Patrick Harris, Paula Abdul, and Kathy Griffin.\n\nThe permanent judges are all funny.\n\nIn drag, you have to be able to get a laugh. Though the final decisions are always RuPaul’s, he has a grand time listening to the bickering of his best squirrel friend, Michelle Visage, comedian Ross Mathews, and the original gay-reality royalty, Carson Kressley. Each look that comes down the runway gets a barrage of jokes and puns, and the judges’ discussion is often the funniest part of the whole show. What other reality show can say that?\n\nThe show is a reality show in drag.\n\nBorrowing from the drag tradition itself, “Drag Race” takes influences from all over the reality television landscape, piling references so high it’s a wonder it doesn’t topple over under the weight of its own satirical wig. The show still operates on a fairly low budget for how slick it looks, an old drag queen trick. From behind RuPaul’s pun-spewing sparkling grin, he winks at the audience with the wisdom of a showbiz legend who knows what’s really important: “It’s all a game,” he seems to say, “let’s enjoy it while it lasts.”\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race” airs on VH1 on Fridays at 8 pm.\n\nStay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

  "latent_17300": "Am I too old for my life to change or be changed? Possibly, though one has to live in hope. Earlier this year I spent some time in the US, mainly in New York, St Louis and Chicago. I’d planned to spend a week in New York, but thanks to storms in the midwest it turned into 10 days, and I ended up hanging out in Greenwich Village, playing chess in Washington Square and making like it was 1963, drinking coffees in cafés, all of which claimed to have been regular haunts of Bob Dylan.\n\nI had always been a Dylan obsessive – I saw him first at Earls Court in 1978, I have all the albums, I’m saving up to buy the new six-volume Basement Tapes. Dylan was a given – always there, always will be. But the real discovery of my New York trip was Dave Van Ronk.\n\nBut not in the sense that I didn’t know who Van Ronk was. I knew he was one of Dylan’s mentors, and had heard his mildly embittered accusation that Dylan – the great magpie who never forgets a tune – stole his arrangement of The House of the Rising Sun. But I’d never really engaged with Van Ronk. Now, for the first time, I saw the places he played, read his wonderful memoir The Mayor of MacDougal Street, which is a brilliant account of the New York of the 1950s and early 60s, and started to listen to his music.\n\nMy trip coincided with the Coen Brothers’ fine, flawed film Inside Llewyn Davis, and probably with something of a midlife crisis too. The music and that era when anything seemed possible spoke to me powerfully, and one song in particular came to obsess me – Van Ronk’s interpretation of St James Infirmary, or the St James Infirmary Blues, to give this classic piece of Americana its proper title.\n\nVan Ronk’s guitar introduction is a thing of wonder, and his delivery is raw, committed, powerful – all the things his fans came to expect over his uncompromising 50-year career. I loved the song and what Van Ronk stood for, and wanted to believe downtown New York still had some of that spirit and wasn’t just an expensive hangout for investment bankers and media executives: a tourist recreation of the visceral, late-50s reality.\n\nWhen I got back to the UK, I sought out all the recordings of St James Infirmary I could find, and to my surprise unearthed one that was even more powerful than Van Ronk’s. James Booker had lived the sort of life depicted in the song, and found astonishing depths and a desperate poetry in it.\n\nI also discovered that this blues standard was derived from an 18th-century English folk song called The Unfortunate Rake about a soldier (or maybe sailor) who is dying of venereal disease. The blues version changes the story, but not the mood. The teller of the tale knows he is doomed but shows no self-pity: “I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers / Three pretty women to sing a song / Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon / Raise hell as I stroll along.”\n\nWhat other attitude to life could one have? It is how Van Ronk, increasingly marginalised as folk gave way to pop, lived his life, and how Booker dealt with his misfortunes, producing great music in the face of everything. As for the Village, it hasn’t seen the last of me, and those shiny new colonisers had better beware.",
  "latent_17332": "Hunting oscillation on railway wheelsets\n\nHunting oscillation is a self-oscillation, usually unwanted, about an equilibrium.[1] The expression came into use in the 19th century and describes how a system \"hunts\" for equilibrium.[1] The expression is used to describe phenomena in such diverse fields as electronics, aviation, biology, and railway engineering.[1]\n\nRailway wheelsets [ edit ]\n\nA classical hunting oscillation is a swaying motion of a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) caused by the coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead. Some trains, like the Talgo 350, don't have a differential, yet they are mostly not affected by hunting oscillation, as most of their wheels rotate independently from one another. The wheels of the power car, however, can be affected by hunting oscillation, because the wheels of the power car are fixed to the axles in pairs like in conventional bogies. Less conical wheels and bogies equipped with independent wheels that turn independently from each other and are not fixed to an axle in pairs are cheaper than a suitable differential for the bogies of a train. [2]\n\nThe problem was first noticed towards the end of the 19th century, when train speeds became high enough to encounter it. Serious efforts to counteract it got underway in the 1930s, giving rise to lengthened trucks and the side-damping swing hanger truck. In the development of the Japanese Shinkansen, less-conical wheels and other design changes were used to extend truck design speeds above 225 km/h (140 mph). Advances in wheel and truck design based on research and development efforts in Europe and Japan have extended the speeds of steel wheel systems well beyond those attained by the original Shinkansen, while the advantage of back-compatibility keeps such technology dominant over alternatives such as the hovertrain and maglev systems. The speed record for steel-wheeled trains is held by the French TGV, at 574.9 km/h (357 mph).\n\nKinematic analysis [ edit ]\n\nKinematics of railway wheel coning action\n\nWhile a qualitative description provides some understanding of the phenomenon, deeper understanding inevitably requires a mathematical analysis of the vehicle dynamics. Even then, the results may be only approximate.\n\nA kinematic description deals with the geometry of motion, without reference to the forces causing it, so the analysis begins with a description of the geometry of a wheel set running on a straight track. Since Newton's Second Law relates forces to accelerations of bodies, the forces acting may then be derived from the kinematics by calculating the accelerations of the components. However, if these forces change the kinematic description (as they do in this case) then the results may only be approximately correct.\n\nAssumptions and non-mathematical description [ edit ]\n\nThis kinematic description makes a number of simplifying assumptions since it neglects forces. For one, it assumes that the rolling resistance is zero. A wheelset (not attached to a train or truck), is given a push forward on a straight and level track. The wheelset starts coasting and never slows down since there are no forces (except downward forces on the wheelset to make it adhere to the track and not slip). If initially the wheelset is centered on the railroad track then the effective diameters of each wheel are the same and the wheelset rolls down the track in a perfectly straight line forever. But if the wheelset is a little off-center so that the effective diameters (or radii) are different, then the wheelset starts to move in a curve of Radius R (depending on these wheelset radii, etc.; to be derived later on). The problem is to use kinematic reasoning to find the trajectory of the wheelset, or more precisely, the trajectory of the center of the wheelset projected vertically on the roadbed in the center of the track. This is a trajectory on the plane of the level earth's surface and plotted on an x-y graphical plot where x is the distance along the railroad and y is the \"tracking error\", the deviation of the center of the wheelset from the straight line of the railway running down the center of the track (midway between the two rails).\n\nTo illustrate that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or screw on a flat table top and give it a push. It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a wheelset with extremely different diameter wheels. The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the pointed end is like a small diameter wheel. While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad wheelset behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change in such a way as to decrease the curvature of the path. Note that \"radius\" and \"curvature\" refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the wheelset and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. As the wheelset rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).\n\nMathematical analysis [ edit ]\n\nThe train stays on the track by virtue of the conical shape of the wheel treads. If a wheelset is displaced to one side by an amount \"y\" (the tracking error), the radius of the tread in contact with the rail on one side is reduced, while on the other side it is increased. The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a rigid axle), so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down. The wheel set steers around a centre of curvature defined by the intersection of the generator of a cone passing through the points of contact with the wheels on the rails and the axis of the wheel set. Applying similar triangles, we have for the turn radius:\n\n1 R = 2 k y r d {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{R}}={\\frac {2ky}{rd}}}\n\nwhere d is the track gauge, r the wheel radius when running straight and k is the tread taper (which is the slope of tread in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the track).\n\nThe path of the wheel set relative to the straight track is defined by a function y(x) where x is the progress along the track. This is sometimes called the tracking error.[3] Provided the direction of motion remains more or less parallel to the rails, the curvature of the path may be related to the second derivative of y with respect to distance along the track as approximately [4]\n\n| d 2 ⁡ y d ⁡ x 2 | ≈ 1 R {\\displaystyle \\left|{\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}y}{\\operatorname {d} x^{2}}}\\right|\\approx {\\frac {1}{R}}}\n\nIt follows that the trajectory along the track is governed by the equation:[5]\n\nd 2 ⁡ y d ⁡ x 2 = − ( 2 k r d ) y {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}y}{\\operatorname {d} x^{2}}}=-\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)y}\n\nThis is a simple harmonic motion having wavelength:\n\nλ = 2 π r d 2 k {\\displaystyle \\lambda =2\\pi {\\sqrt {\\frac {rd}{2k}}}} known as Klingel's formula (derived in 1883)[6]\n\nThis kinematic analysis implies that trains sway from side to side all the time. In fact, this oscillation is damped out below a critical speed and the ride is correspondingly more comfortable. The kinematic result ignores the forces causing the motion. These may be analyzed using the concept of creep (non-linear) but are somewhat difficult to quantify simply, as they arise from the elastic distortion of the wheel and rail at the regions of contact. These are the subject of frictional contact mechanics; an early presentation that includes these effects in hunting motion analysis was presented by Carter.[7] See Knothe[8] for a historical overview.\n\nIf the motion is substantially parallel with the rails, the angular displacement of the wheel set ( θ ) {\\displaystyle \\left(\\theta \\right)} is given by:\n\nθ = d ⁡ y d ⁡ x {\\displaystyle \\theta ={\\frac {\\operatorname {d} y}{\\operatorname {d} x}}}\n\nHence:\n\nd ⁡ θ d ⁡ x = d 2 ⁡ y d ⁡ x 2 = − ( 2 k r d ) y d 2 ⁡ θ d ⁡ x 2 = − ( 2 k r d ) d ⁡ y d ⁡ x = − ( 2 k r d ) θ {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\frac {\\operatorname {d} \\theta }{\\operatorname {d} x}}&={\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}y}{\\operatorname {d} x^{2}}}=-\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)y\\\\{\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}\\theta }{\\operatorname {d} x^{2}}}&=-\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right){\\frac {\\operatorname {d} y}{\\operatorname {d} x}}=-\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta \\end{aligned}}}\n\nThe angular deflection also follows a simple harmonic motion, which lags behind the side to side motion by a quarter of a cycle. In many systems which are characterised by harmonic motion involving two different states (in this case the axle yaw deflection and the lateral displacement), the quarter cycle lag between the two motions endows the system with the ability to extract energy from the forward motion. This effect is observed in \"flutter\" of aircraft wings and \"shimmy\" of road vehicles, as well as hunting of railway vehicles. The kinematic solution derived above describes the motion at the critical speed.\n\nIn practice, below the critical speed, the lag between the two motions is less than a quarter cycle so that the motion is damped out but, above the critical speed, the lag is greater than a quarter cycle so that the motion is amplified.\n\nIn order to estimate the inertial forces, it is necessary to express the distance derivatives as time derivatives. This is done using the speed of the vehicle U, which is assumed constant:\n\nd d ⁡ t = U d d ⁡ x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\operatorname {d} }{\\operatorname {d} t}}=U{\\frac {\\operatorname {d} }{\\operatorname {d} x}}}\n\nThe angular acceleration of the axle in yaw is:\n\nd 2 ⁡ θ d ⁡ t 2 = − U 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}\\theta }{\\operatorname {d} t^{2}}}=-U^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta }\n\nThe inertial moment (ignoring gyroscopic effects) is:\n\nF d = C d 2 ⁡ θ d ⁡ t 2 {\\displaystyle Fd=C{\\frac {\\operatorname {d} ^{2}\\theta }{\\operatorname {d} t^{2}}}}\n\nwhere F is the force acting along the rails and C is the moment of inertia of the wheel set.\n\nF = − C U 2 ( 2 k r d 2 ) θ {\\displaystyle F=-CU^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd^{2}}}\\right)\\theta }\n\nthe maximum frictional force between the wheel and rail is given by:\n\nF = μ W 2 {\\displaystyle F=\\mu {\\frac {W}{2}}}\n\nwhere W is the axle load and μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } is the coefficient of friction. Gross slipping will occur at a combination of speed and axle deflection given by:\n\nθ U 2 = μ W r d 2 4 C k {\\displaystyle \\theta U^{2}=\\mu W{\\frac {rd^{2}}{4Ck}}}\n\nthis expression yields a significant overestimate of the critical speed, but it does illustrate the physical reason why hunting occurs, i.e. the inertial forces become comparable with the adhesion forces above a certain speed. Limiting friction is a poor representation of the adhesion force in this case.\n\nThe actual adhesion forces arise from the distortion of the tread and rail in the region of contact. There is no gross slippage, just elastic distortion and some local slipping (creep slippage). During normal operation these forces are well within the limiting friction constraint. A complete analysis takes these forces into account, using rolling contact mechanics theories.\n\nHowever, the kinematic analysis assumed that there was no slippage at all at the wheel-rail contact. Now it's clear that there is some creep slippage which makes the calculated sinusoidal trajectory of the wheelset (per Klingel's formula) not exactly correct.\n\nEnergy balance [ edit ]\n\nIn order to get an estimate of the critical speed, we use the fact that the condition for which this kinematic solution is valid corresponds to the case where there is no net energy exchange with the surroundings, so by considering the kinetic and potential energy of the system, we should be able to derive the critical speed.\n\nLet:\n\nω = d ⁡ θ d ⁡ t {\\displaystyle \\omega ={\\frac {\\operatorname {d} \\theta }{\\operatorname {d} t}}}\n\nUsing the operator:\n\nω d d ⁡ θ = d d ⁡ t {\\displaystyle \\omega {\\frac {\\operatorname {d} }{\\operatorname {d} \\theta }}={\\frac {\\operatorname {d} }{\\operatorname {d} t}}}\n\nthe angular acceleration equation may be expressed in terms of the angular velocity in yaw: ω {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\nω d ⁡ ω d ⁡ θ = − U 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ {\\displaystyle \\omega {\\frac {\\operatorname {d} \\omega }{\\operatorname {d} \\theta }}=-U^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta }\n\nintegrating:\n\n1 2 ω 2 = − 1 2 U 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}\\omega ^{2}=-{\\frac {1}{2}}U^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta ^{2}}\n\nso the kinetic energy due to rotation is:\n\n1 2 C ω 2 = − 1 2 C U 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}C\\omega ^{2}=-{\\frac {1}{2}}CU^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta ^{2}}\n\nWhen the axle yaws, the points of contact move outwards on the treads so that the height of the axle is lowered. The distance between the support points increases to:\n\nd c o s ( θ ) = d ( 1 + 1 2 θ 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{cos(\\theta )}}=d\\left(1+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\theta ^{2}\\right)}\n\n(to second order of small quantities). the displacement of the support point out from the centres of the treads is:\n\n1 2 ( d + 1 2 d θ 2 − d ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}\\left(d+{\\frac {1}{2}}d\\theta ^{2}-d\\right)}\n\nthe axle load falls by\n\nh = 1 4 k d θ 2 {\\displaystyle h={\\frac {1}{4}}kd\\theta ^{2}}\n\nThe work done by lowering the axle load is therefore:\n\nE = 1 4 W k d θ 2 {\\displaystyle E={\\frac {1}{4}}Wkd\\theta ^{2}}\n\nThis is energy lost from the system, so in order for the motion to continue, an equal amount of energy must be extracted from the forward motion of the wheelset.\n\nThe outer wheel velocity is given by:\n\nV = U r ( r + k y ) {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {U}{r}}\\left(r+ky\\right)}\n\nThe kinetic energy is:\n\n1 4 m ( U 2 + 2 U 2 k y r + U 2 k 2 y 2 r 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{4}}m\\left(U^{2}+2U^{2}{\\frac {ky}{r}}+U^{2}{\\frac {k^{2}y^{2}}{r^{2}}}\\right)}\n\nfor the inner wheel it is\n\n1 4 m ( U 2 − 2 U 2 k y r + U 2 k 2 y 2 r 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{4}}m\\left(U^{2}-2U^{2}{\\frac {ky}{r}}+U^{2}{\\frac {k^{2}y^{2}}{r^{2}}}\\right)}\n\nwhere m is the mass of both wheels.\n\nThe increase in kinetic energy is:\n\nδ E = 1 2 m ( U k y r ) 2 {\\displaystyle \\delta E={\\frac {1}{2}}m\\left({\\frac {Uky}{r}}\\right)^{2}}\n\nThe motion will continue at constant amplitude as long as the energy extracted from the forward motion, and manifesting itself as increased kinetic energy of the wheel set at zero yaw, is equal to the potential energy lost by the lowering of the axle load at maximum yaw.\n\nNow, from the kinematics:\n\n2 U k y r d = ω δ E = 1 8 m d 2 ω 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}2U{\\frac {ky}{rd}}&=\\omega \\\\\\delta E&={\\frac {1}{8}}md^{2}\\omega ^{2}\\end{aligned}}}\n\nbut\n\nω 2 = − U 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ 2 {\\displaystyle \\omega ^{2}=-U^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta ^{2}}\n\nThe translational kinetic energy is\n\nδ E = − 1 8 U 2 m d 2 ( 2 k r d ) θ 2 {\\displaystyle \\delta E=-{\\frac {1}{8}}U^{2}md^{2}\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta ^{2}}\n\nThe total kinetic energy is:\n\nT = 1 2 U 2 ( C + m d 2 4 ) ( 2 k r d ) θ 2 {\\displaystyle T={\\frac {1}{2}}U^{2}\\left(C+{\\frac {md^{2}}{4}}\\right)\\left({\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\right)\\theta ^{2}}\n\nThe critical speed is found from the energy balance:\n\nW k d 2 = U 2 2 k r d ( C + m d 2 4 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {Wkd}{2}}=U^{2}{\\frac {2k}{rd}}\\left(C+{\\frac {md^{2}}{4}}\\right)}\n\nHence the critical speed is given by\n\nU 2 = W r d 2 4 C + m d 2 {\\displaystyle U^{2}={\\frac {Wrd^{2}}{4C+md^{2}}}}\n\nThis is independent of the wheel taper, but depends on the ratio of the axle load to wheel set mass. If the treads were truly conical in shape, the critical speed would be independent of the taper. In practice, wear on the wheel causes the taper to vary across the tread width, so that the value of taper used to determine the potential energy is different from that used to calculate the kinetic energy. Denoting the former as a, the critical speed becomes:\n\nU 2 = W a r d 2 k ( 4 C + m d 2 ) {\\displaystyle U^{2}={\\frac {Ward^{2}}{k(4C+md^{2})}}}\n\nwhere a is now a shape factor determined by the wheel wear. This result is derived in [9] from an analysis of the system dynamics using standard control engineering methods.\n\nLimitation of simplified analysis [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of a wheel set is much more complicated than this analysis would indicate. There are additional restraining forces applied by the vehicle suspension[10] and, at high speed, the wheel set will generate additional gyroscopic torques, which will modify the estimate of the critical speed. Conventionally a railway vehicle has stable motion in low speeds, when it reaches to high speeds stability changes to unstable form. The main purpose of nonlinear analysis of rail vehicle system dynamics is to show the view of analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles in a tangent track. This study contains Bogoliubov method for the analysis[11]\n\nTwo main matters i.e. assuming the body as a fixed support and influence of the nonlinear elements in calculation of the hunting speed are mostly focused in studies[12]. A real railway vehicle has many more degrees of freedom and, consequently, may have more than one critical speed; it is by no means certain that the lowest is dictated by the wheelset motion.\n\nHowever, the analysis is instructive because it shows why hunting occurs. As the speed increases, the inertial forces become comparable with the adhesion forces. That is why the critical speed depends on the ratio of the axle load (which determines the adhesion force) to the wheelset mass (which determines the inertial forces).\n\nAlternatively, below a certain speed, the energy which is extracted from the forward motion is insufficient to replace the energy lost by lowering the axles and the motion damps out; above this speed, the energy extracted is greater than the loss in potential energy and the amplitude builds up.\n\nThe potential energy at maximum axle yaw may be increased by including an elastic constraint on the yaw motion of the axle, so that there is a contribution arising from spring tension. Arranging wheels in bogies to increase the constraint on the yaw motion of wheelsets and applying elastic constraints to the bogie also raises the critical speed. Introducing elastic forces into the equation permits suspension designs which are limited only by the onset of gross slippage, rather than classical hunting. The penalty to be paid for the virtual elimination of hunting is a straight track, with an attendant right-of-way problem and incompatibility with legacy infrastructure.\n\nHunting is a dynamic problem which can be solved, in principle at least, by active feedback control, which may be adapted to the quality of track. However, the introduction of active control raises reliability and safety issues.\n\nShortly after the onset of hunting, gross slippage occurs and the wheel flanges impact on the rails, potentially causing damage to both.\n\nRoad–Rail vehicles [ edit ]\n\nIndependent rail wheel axles are common on road–rail vehicles\n\nMany road–rail vehicles feature independent axles and suspension systems on each rail wheel. When this is combined with the presence of road wheels on the rail it becomes difficult to use the formulae above. Historically, road–rail vehicle have their front wheels set slightly toe-in which has been found to minimise hunting whilst the vehicle is being driven on-rail.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nFor general methods dealing with this class of problem, see\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nIwnicki, Simon (2006).

Being under high rather than low cognitive load caused females compared with males to recall experiencing more intense emotional reactions to saddening stimuli (Experiments 1 and 2)., and relatively less intense reactions to angering stimuli (Experiment 2). Being directly primed with stereotypes about sex differences and being under high cognitive load both caused females to recall more intense reactions to saddening stimuli compared with females who were neither primed with stereotypes nor under cognitive load (Experiment 3). These results imply that the relative accessibility of stereotypes influences memories of emotion in a manner similar to stereotypes' influence on social perception. Implications of these findings for theories of emotion memory and for self-perpetuating stereotypes about emotional sex differences are discussed.",

The reason people take heroin is because they can’t handle pressure. Poor old Sid.\n\n“Her death is all entangled in mystery. It’s no real mystery, though. If you are going to get yourself involved in drugs and narcotics in that way accidents are going to happen.\n\n“Sid was a lost case. He was wrapped firmly in Malcolm’s shenanigans.\n\n“It became ludicrous trying to talk to him through the drug haze because all you would hear was, ‘I’m the real star around here’. Great. Carry on. We all know how that’s going to end. Unfortunately, that is where it ended. I miss him very much.\n\n“He was a great friend but when you are messing with heroin you’re not a human being. You change and you lose respect for yourself and everybody else.\n\n“The only good news is that I heard Mick Jagger got in there and brought lawyers into it on Sid’s behalf because I don’t think Malcolm lifted a finger. He just didn’t know what to do. For that, I have a good liking of Mick Jagger.\n\n“There was activity behind the scenes from Mick Jagger so I applaud him. He never used it to advance himself publicity-wise.”\n\nLydon was forming Public Image Ltd (PiL) after his time as Johnny Rotten in the Sex Pistols – with Vicious, guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook – had drawn to a close.\n\n(Image: PR)\n\nWhile Sid’s death in 1979 ended a huge chapter in punk history, Lydon has continued with his new outfit with singles such as Death Disco and the album Public Image: First Issue.\n\nHaving just completed PiL’s UK tour dates, the band have also played a special show to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Virgin Records, the label that took in the Sex Pistols in 1977.\n\n“Virgin offered to financially support a PiL gig. Yipee. Why not,” Lydon said. “They owe me more than that.\n\n“Quite frankly, how are they going to explain 40 years of their alleged success without giving a nod and a wink to John- boy here?”\n\nBack in the present, relaxing at the home he shares with wife Nora Forster in LA, the punk icon was in great form as he recalled his early Scottish visits.\n\nHe was with the Sex Pistols, who played a show at Dundee Technical College in October 1976, although gigs in Dundee and Glasgow that December were cancelled.\n\nLydon said: “It was unfortunate.\n\n“I never understood why the Lord Provost in Scotland banned us with the famous line, ‘We have enough hooligans of our own in Glasgow without importing them from south of the border’.\n\n“To this day I think of that as a real sense of achievement. It felt like he was giving us an award really.”\n\nRecalling another trip to Glasgow in 1976, John said: “Celtic were playing Rangers so I had quite a lot to deal with on the train.\n\n“I never made it to a radio station we were due at because some lads on the train had recommended a bar underneath a flyover. It was somewhere they said did great electric soup.\n\n“That was basically the slops of alcohol all mixed together in a big barrel and that was how it was.\n\nPiL eventually played the legendary Glasgow Apollo in 1983.\n\n“I have done practically every venue Glasgow has had to offer,” Lydon said. “You would think almost that we had a residency there. I miss the Glasgow Apollo, though. That one was special.\n\n“The height of the stage and the narrowness and length of the stage was all very bizarre, odd and dangerous to be on.\n\n“I’m half blind really so falling off that stage was always on the agenda.\n\n“But the absolute enthusiasm that the venue seemed to inspire meant it was always incredibly mad.\n\n“The way the balcony would vibrate with people jumping up and down was such an incredible atmosphere, one I’ve hardly seen anywhere else in the world able to compete with.\n\n“It was quite brilliant. Other venues don’t seem to be able to generate that bond that band and audience can have. I’ve never forgotten the Apollo.\n\n“You would think a 12ft-high stage would be a stumbling block between audience band and communication. But no.\n\n“It used to be hilarious watching people make human pyramids to get up on the stage and in a friendly way.”\n\nJohn – who had meningitis as a child – said the LA weather has improved his health after finding the British climate an endurance test. The police harassment in England drove me nuts,” he added.\n\n“It became unbearable. In LA, people tend to leave you alone.\n\n“For the first time in my life, I wasn’t ill all year long.\n\n“It never gets to be freezing so you don’t need to bother with the flus or viruses or bronchitis I would get every year in England.”\n\nBut despite enjoying the States, he’ll never become a Vegas act and said he can’t fathom Calvin Harris’s residency at the Hakkasan club.\n\n“I’ve been to a lot of these DJ shows as my curiosity level has been piqued,” he said.\n\n“I won’t turn my nose up at anything but I am utterly amazed that DJs are such major league celebrities to so many people when all they are doing is spinning other people’s music.\n\n“It’s odd how the ownership has been transferred from people who make music to those who turn the on button.\n\n“It’s a curiosity to watch crowds going apes**t to watching someone just pressing on and off.\n\n“I’m very far removed from a Las Vegas production, which seems to be the way most acts seem to adopt.\n\n“A Vegas show would be the kiss of death. That would be like a knighthood, something that absolutely terrifies me for sheer ugliness.\n\n“I’m not going to let the Queen near me with a sword. What’s that old expression? Off with their heads.”\n\nHis attitude towards royalty hasn’t really changed since the Sex Pistols released God Save The Queen in 1977.\n\n“I have nothing against them as human beings – just the institutions they are born into,” he said. “\n\n“I view them as victims rather than abusers. I’ve got a place in my heart for them because I know what it is like to be trapped.\n\n“If you are born into a council house you know you’re trapped. Theirs is a gilded cage and they’re led by the nose.”\n\nSo does he still consider himself a Punk of the British Empire even after those Country Life butter ads?\n\n“As if that was a negative,” Lydon snorted. “They are the only people who offered me any financial support.\n\n“You think I’m a fool? I’m a working class lad. “Any opportunity should be taken seriously.\n\n“As long as I’m not selling my soul. I’m most definitely not.\n\n“Look at the shape of me.\n\n“I’ve eaten an awful lot of Dairy Crest.”",

As a result, 98 percent of Haiti's forestland has been obliterated over the decades.\n\n\"The problem with that is you end up with a lot of deforestation, and it makes the country especially susceptible to really bad landslides and mudslides,\" Sarsalari said. \"I think that's going to be the worst part of this storm for them, as well.\"\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said Monday night that it was sending a disaster response team to the central Caribbean to coordinate relief and supplies. It said it was sending $400,000 in initial assistance to Haiti and Jamaica to help humanitarian organizations provide critical relief.\n\nRelated: Hurricane Has Haiti, Jamaica Bracing for Potential Chaos\n\n\"It's going to be quite devastating,\" said Jessica Pearl, Haiti country director for Mercy Corps, an aid organization. \"Haiti is very mountainous, and there's no system for channeling the water.\"\n\nAnd much of the population lives in ramshackle housing — tens of thousands of them in bare tents — considered likely to collapse in any major storm.\n\nPresident Jocelerme Privert urged residents Monday to \"leave these houses to take refuge\" in schools, churches or any of the 1,300 other shelters the country has opened — enough to house as many as 340,000 people, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe country has also been under siege from a cholera epidemic that the United Nations says has killed at least 10,000 people over the last six years — an outbreak likely to be \"exacerbated by the situation that populations will face after Hurricane Matthew,\" the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday.\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, the cholera epidemic began the same year as the devastating 2010 earthquake — which on its own killed more than 220,000 people, left 1.5 million others homeless and caused an estimated $14 billion in damage.\n\nA girl watches as authorities arrive to evacuate people from her house Monday in Tabarre, Haiti, ahead of Hurricane Matthew. Dieu Nalio Chery / AP\n\nMatthew has already killed its first Haitian victim, a fisherman from Saint Jean de Sud whose body was found Sunday, said Moise Jean-Pierre, central coordinator of the Haiti Civil Protection Agency. The man with whom he was fishing was still missing.\n\nThe government closed the borders, canceled school across the country and began evacuating people from southern coastal areas. It also closed Port-Au-Prince's airport.\n\n\"This is a country that has a long history with tropical storms and hurricanes, and often it does not really end well,\" Sarsalari said.",
  "latent_17397": "British Columbia has put three private health clinics under audit amid long-standing concerns about the practice of double-dipping, looking at doctors who work in the public system and who also charge some patients extra fees for quicker access to medical care.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jane Philpott and her newly appointed B.C. counterpart, Adrian Dix, say three of the province's several dozen clinics are being examined for billing patients extra for medically necessary care, a violation of the Canada Health Act.\n\n\"The audit will determine the extent to which extra billing and user fees have been a barrier to accessible care for people in British Columbia,\" Dr. Philpott said in a statement Thursday.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn June, a Globe and Mail investigation found significant, unlawful extra billing by physicians through private doctor-owned clinics, where patients increasingly pay out of pocket to access everything from medical appointments to surgery. Provincial laws forbid doctors who bill the public system from also charging patients to access any type of medically necessary service.\n\nRelated: Canadian patients, advocates speak out about illegal doctor double billing\n\nOpinion: Double-dipping doctors defy the spirit of Canadian health-care\n\nThe Globe found that because extra billing is not supposed to be allowed, prices that clinics charge for various services are unadvertised, unregulated and all over the map. Not only is the government not reining in those private fees, but, in contrast to the situation in the United States, insurance companies aren't allowed to step in to negotiate and cover the costs, either. Canadian patients are barred from buying private insurance to cover necessary medical services, except in Quebec, where the law allows it for minor treatments.\n\nPatients interviewed in The Globe investigation said they simply paid the asking price, without question – not necessarily because they had the money, but because they were desperate to get treatment. Some even took out bank loans, not unlike some Americans who have no health insurance.\n\nMr. Dix, a former B.C. NDP leader and health critic who became Health Minister last month, said he strongly supports the audit agreement, which was negotiated under the province's previous Liberal government.\n\n\"We have to act to ensure that access to medical care in B.C. is based on need and not on an individual's ability to pay,\" Mr. Dix said in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"That is the reason the law exists and that is something that has been fundamental to Canada's health-care system for a long time and is something we strongly support.\"\n\nMr. Dix was unavailable for further comment.\n\nLate last year, Dr. Philpott wrote to her provincial counterparts about double-dipping, singling out ways each jurisdiction could tackle the issue.\n\nHealth Canada and B.C. decided to proceed with the audits in March, Mr. Dix said to CP, noting that a considerable amount of planning has flowed from that decision.\n\n\"The results of the audit may have consequences … but the audits haven't been completed yet so commenting on conclusions that haven't been drawn would be incorrect and unfair,\" he said. \"We are not assuming the results of the audits.\"\n\nThe Canada Health Act, which imposes conditions on the provinces and territories in exchange for health-care funding, prohibits so-called extra billing or user charges for services that are deemed medically necessary. If extra billing or user charges are confirmed, a dollar-for-dollar deduction from that region's federal health transfer payment is required.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOttawa has the power to fine provinces that don't put a stop to extra billing, but British Columbia is the only province it has penalized in the past five years, with fines totalling a million dollars.\n\nAnd that is a drop in the bucket compared with the tens of millions of dollars that flow through private-billing facilities each year.\n\nOttawa gets its data from the provinces – on how much unlawful extra billing it should penalize them for – so the provinces have a vested interest in minimizing those figures.\n\nRoss Outerbridge, a surgeon interviewed in The Globe investigation, said he doesn't know if the Kamloops Surgical Centre he founded is being audited, but he said these actions are pointless as long as an unresolved court challenge involving a Vancouver surgery clinic drags on.\n\n\"It's clearly in the courts so they should leave it in the courts and have them figure it out first before they start auditing clinics,\" Dr. Outerbridge said Thursday.\n\nBrian Day, medical director of the Cambie Surgery Centre, a private Vancouver clinic, will return to B.C. Supreme Court this fall to continue his constitutional challenge of Canada's public health-care system.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe challenge was started a decade ago after the province told him that auditors were on their way.\n\nOn Thursday, Dr. Day said these three audits do not involve his centre, but he suspects the government might have begun them after he recently pointed out, in his court case, that other clinics have been allowed to continue charging the same fees.\n\n\"Since we started our lawsuit, they haven't targeted any other clinics [until now],\" he said.\n\nThe federal government is also engaged in the Cambie case, which it believes could have important implications for public health care across Canada.\n\nMr. Dix said \"some of the principles\" being defended by the government in the case are similar to the questions at play in the audits.\n\n\"It is what the Medical Services Commission in B.C. and the [provincial] ministry of health are defending in that case,\" he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDr. Philpott, meanwhile, has also warned other provincial counterparts about extra billing and user fees, noting Ottawa will not tolerate the practice.\n\nShe has applauded Quebec for its decision in January to ban user fees, and she has also been in discussions with Saskatchewan officials about upholding the Canada Health Act.\n\nIn addition, she has been pushing back against a Saskatchewan law that allows private MRI scans if they are ordered by a doctor and if the private clinic does a second scan to someone on the public waiting list at no charge.\n\nAllowing people to pay for private scans contravenes the act, Dr. Philpott says.\n\nThe situation is particularly acute in B.C., where there are now dozens of private medical facilities.\n\nWith a report from The Canadian Press",
  "latent_17407": "In supporting reported plans for a strike by Wal-Mart employees Brown University professor and Current TV contributor Tricia Rose criticized the corporation for treating its workers as less than human.\n\n“It’s grindingly aggressive, anti-human being statements,” Rose said on The Young Turks Monday. “Like, ‘Well, people are lining up for these jobs, we’ll just fire them. I mean, it’s just sort of, mistreat, mistreat, as low as possible, and expect people to get away with it.”\n\nOne reason the company is able to do that, Rose noted, was getting people to see themselves as consumers, rather than workers in their own right, thereby demonizing people looking to organize.\n\nWith Wal-Mart looking to kickstart the critical Black Friday weekend sales period early, a standoff has developed between the company and a workers’ advocacy group, Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart). The retailer has asked the National Labor Relations Board to curtail any employee walkouts, while accusing OUR Walmart of being a thrall of the United Food and Commercial Workers union.\n\n“We think what they’re doing is illegal,” the company’s vice president of communications, David Tovar, said in a Wal-Mart-sponsored segment on Fox News Monday. “They’ve been doing these kinds of demonstrations for more than 30 days, but this week, like I said, we are focused like a laser on Black Friday and we think it is going to be an awesome day at Wal-Mart.”\n\nAs co-host Michael Shure pointed out, even full-time employees at the company, who average 34 hours a week, make less than $9 an hour, placing them under the poverty line.\n\nBut media coverage of labor issues, fellow panelist and Buzzfeed contributor Michael Hastings said, tends to frame labor forces as being opposed to consumers, focusing on how strikes and demonstrations inconvenience customers instead of relaying the situations that lead to workers organizing in the first place.\n\n“I think the only way for people at Wal-mart to raise their wages is to do something like this, is to protest the fact that they’re actually putting their lives on the line at these Black Friday stores,” he said.\n\nWatch the discussion of the company’s treatment of its employees, aired Monday on Current TV, below.",

  "latent_17486": "Seeking starlight from a city may seem futile, especially here in Chicago, home of the orange glow. We are, after all, the literal poster city for light pollution, since the 2008 National Geographic cover story “The End of Night” outed us as the worst offender. Still, we can either be part of the problem or the solution.\n\nPROTECTING CITY BASED STAR GAZING\n\nOur designs for the Wild Blossom Meadery / Brewery, are nearing completion. As we specify details like light fixtures for various areas of the project we take all the program uses into consideration. In this case, one of those purposes is using the side yard for a little glimpse of the night sky.\n\nWe try not to overlight the outsides of our buildings in any case – a city dwelling usually has a lot of ambient light to take advantage of. Once directed downlights are placed near all the doors (to prevent key fumbling) we think twice before adding any more exterior light.\n\nSince Wild Blossom is specifically asking for stargazing conditions (our clients are avid amateur astronomers), we did a little research to see if there was a recommended type of light for stargazing – or at least to find out what kind of lights contribute least to general light pollution.\n\nDIRECT OUTDOOR LIGHTS DOWNWARDS\n\nUnshielded lights are a waste of energy, a safety hazard and a nuisance to neighbors. They also fill the sky with unwanted light pollution. Any outdoor light should have a directional shield that aims light where its wanted – at the ground adjacent to the light. Light that travels directly from the bulb to an eye causes glare (scroll down to see why that’s bad) and light that passes eye level is simply wasted … and contributes to light pollution. The below sketch based on illinoislighting.org.\n\nCHOOSE BULBS WITH CARE\n\nConsider carefully what the minimum amount of light needed for any outdoor situation is … and design close to that amount. Brightness in lights is measured in lumens. Choosing lamps which generate less light also makes for more energy efficient outdoor lights. Win, win!\n\nAnother aspect of choosing outdoor lights (or lights for any situation) is color spectrum. Different types of light bulbs throw (and let us see) different amounts of the visible spectrum.\n\nThe reason Chicago glows orange every night is that most of our streets are lit with High Low Pressure Sodium (EDIT: Its HPS, not LPS, as was brought to our attention by the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition) bulbs which put out light in the yellow orange wavelengths and everything they illuminate looks a uniform sepia toned orange. (This is starting to change.) LED bulbs, by contrast, throw an almost complete spectrum of color and can render very much like daylight which can make it more difficult to view the night sky. These and more spectrum examples, at the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station website here.\n\nFor Wild Blossom’s side yard, we are recommending a heavily shielded (light directed down) light fixture with a high pressure sodium bulb. Since those emit a smaller segment of the visible spectrum, they throw less light into the surrounding area.\n\nBUT WHAT ABOUT SAFETY?\n\nIn fact, the brightest lights don’t make the night time safer. Lights that are too bright (in contrast to the shadows around them) or cast light directly into your eyes (glare) force your pupils to constrict which makes it harder to see the world around you – not easier.\n\nFor a creepy example of how this works, check out these two images (see them superimposed on each other at the Florida Atlantic University Physics Department Website). On the left you can see the guy standing in the path. On the right, he’s still there. Look for his white sneakers and smudge of shadow where he stands just off the sidewalk in the deep shade. Eeep.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DARK SKY INITIATIVES\n\nThere are a number of organizations devoted to advocating for reduced light pollution and providing advice you can use. Check out the International Dark Sky Association at their website: darksky.org. Or, for research closer to home, you can turn to the Illinois Coalition for Responsible Outdoor Lighting to find out why … and how … to make our Chicago sky a little darker.",

  "latent_17546": "Malena Loonskin's family holds a picture of Malena.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nLast month, I was crashing on a friend's couch while driving north through Ontario to research a story about a young mother who had been murdered more than a decade ago. The friend asked why I was passing through and I told him. I was working on the latest in an ongoing series about missing and murdered Indigenous women. He mentioned seeing an earlier story in the series, \"She was 16 When She Went Missing, But the RCMP Didn't Tell Anyone for Three Years.\"\n\n\"Makes you wonder who's missing now that we don't know about,\" he said.\n\nHis words have stayed with me. As a journalist, I'm not bothered by the things people don't know; I'm galvanized by them. If there's something that people don't know, reporters can ask, and learn, and report. That's our job. What really confounds me are the things that people choose not to know.\n\nHow does a journalist make people choose to know? More than 1,200 Indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in Canada in just three decades. How do you both attract and inform readers who believe that this statistic is a \"native problem,\" when in fact it is a symptom of colonialism—which has Canadians valuing Indigenous artifacts and sacred objects (think white kids wearing headdresses), but not Indigenous people or their way of life?\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span id=\"selection-marker-1\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\" data-verified=\"redactor\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nSearchers: Drag the Red\n\nBack in January, when I began researching this series, my friend Adam Dietrich was reporting for a small weekly paper in northern Alberta. He began to flip me copies of RCMP press releases about missing Indigenous persons in the region. On average, he says he received one a week.\n\nAdam had become frustrated by what he perceived to be racial bias in the media coverage of the region's missing. He felt certain that the disappearance of a white person would be front-page news for the local weekly, while that of an Indigenous person would be relegated to the back pages, and might not even merit a photo.\n\nHis beliefs were not without evidence. The summer before, Adam had written a story about a 26-year-old Cree woman named Malena Loonskin who'd gone missing and then been found murdered. Malena's common-law husband was charged with the crime (the charges have since been stayed). Due to editorial constraints, his piece was essentially a rewrite of the RCMP's press release on the subject, and his primary source was the officer who wrote it. Adam told me it was the biggest news story that week, yet it ran on page ten. There was no photo of Malena.\n\nMore than a year later, Malena's murder still nags at Adam, and there's one aspect of the story that particularly nags at me. Malena's family says that 72 hours passed before police came to help them search for their loved one. Did that affect the quality of evidence gathered? Does that explain why the charges were stayed? Malena's family wonders, and so do I.\n\nChantelle Bushie, another missing woman. Photo courtesy Vivian Bushie\n\nIf there's a single thread that binds the stories in my series together, it's the attitude of the police and the judiciary toward Canada's Indigenous people. Occasionally, I'm able to report Indigenous amazement and gratitude for an investigation managed sensitively and competently, but usually, my stories report the pain and frustration caused by racist remarks, offensive assumptions, and legal standards that seem arbitrary at best, unjust at worst.\n\nI've met people who say: Not all cops. Not all men. People who blame the Indigenous woman who was being beaten by her husband, because she went back to him before he ultimately killed her. People who, when confronted with the story of the RCMP officer who brought an Indigenous woman home from jail to \"pursue a personal relationship,\" mention the video of the officer dancing at a powwow. People who say: They balance out somehow, right?\n\nA few weeks ago, I visited with a mother whose daughter was murdered, whose case was botched repeatedly. She was furious, her eyes wet with tears, but she told me vehemently that before her daughter's case she believed in the police, she trusted them. Experience has destroyed that trust.\n\nThe rocking chair memorial Doris keeps for her niece Krystle. Photo by Adam Dietrich\n\nWhen I think about the RCMP, inevitably I think about Krystle Knott, born 26 years ago.\n\nIf Krystle had enjoyed the opportunity to translate her childhood ambitions into adult passions, she might now be a veterinarian or a mechanic. She might still listen to Shania Twain. (She'd probably be as stubborn and willful as ever.) But her family will never know. Krystle was killed, together with 19-year-old Rene Gunning; the girls' remains were found in 2011. Who killed the two young women? That's just one more thing Krystle's family would like to know.\n\nMy first call to the police about Krystle was to an RCMP spokeswoman in Edmonton. I wanted to know why Krystle had been missing for three years before the RCMP said a single public word about her. I also wanted to explore the perception that her aunt, Doris Goulet, has of the case (which, to this day, remains unsolved): \"It's like: they're found, they're buried, so it's done.\"\n\nI asked the spokeswoman: Could you talk about that? Could you tell me about the procedures for staying in touch with families when cases drag on for years? Could you tell me how the RCMP tries to assure victims' families that it's still investigating?\n\nFor the second time in two months (the month before, I'd called about Malena's story), the spokeswoman was incredulous that it was a journalist calling, rather than the family itself. If the family has a problem with the investigation, she suggested, the family should call.\n\nDoris Goulet holding a photo of herself, her husband Dave, and Krystle Knott that was taken at a family wedding the summer before Krystle disappeared. Photo credit to Adam Dietrich\n\nKrystle's cousin, Wendy Goulet, knows why the family might not call.\n\nIf Wendy could rewind the clock, she would plaster Edmonton and northern Alberta with photos of her young, missing cousin, and she wouldn't wait to do it. She would go with her aunt Doris to the police station. Together, they would demand that Krystle's face be broadcast on the news, without delay.\n\nIf Wendy could rewind the clock, would it save Krystle and Rene? She doesn't know. She'll never know. What she does know is the feeling of three years of public silence in a missing-persons case. And she knows what it feels like to read a RCMP release that suggests a loved one's disappearance, while inexplicably failing to identify that person as anything more than \"another female\":\n\n[Rene] is believed to have left back to the Fort St. John area in the company of another female from Dawson Creek. The pair were thought to be hitchhiking for transportation.\n\nWhen the police don't tell people someone's missing, Wendy told me later, \"it changes your way of thinking. You know she's missing. [...] You can't do anything about it.\"\n\nAt this point, you may object: Not all police or Well, that's just one person's story. If so, I urge you to read the detailed and horrific report by Human Rights Watch: \"Canada: Abusive Policing, Neglect Along 'Highway of Tears.'\"\n\nA photo of Denise Bourdeau taken in 1993. Photo provided by Amy Miller\n\nOn the phone with the RCMP spokeswoman, I forged ahead with my questions about Krystle. Most of them she couldn't, or wouldn't, answer.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to speak to an ongoing investigation in specific details,\" she said at first.\n\nLater she told me, \"I don't have that information and we wouldn't be, I wouldn't be, providing that information.\"\n\nIt took a call to the Edmonton Police, another to the British Columbia RCMP, and another to the national RCMP before I got someone on the phone who would say more than Sorry, no. But even these answers—from a different spokeswoman with the Alberta RCMP, one who had been directed to return my call by the force's national officers—were vague. My attempts to gain answers through the\n\nAccess to Information system have been shut down lest the public knowing why Krystle's disappearance wasn't publicized interfere with the hunt for her killer.\n\nSadly, the RCMP's insistence on secrecy is not limited to Krystle's case. I've spent much of the past nine months posing variations of these questions in respect of several different Indigenous women who disappeared or were murdered. These women died or disappeared in different ways, in different places—but the police response is always fundamentally the same: the investigation is ongoing, and we need privacy in order to bring it to a successful resolution.\n\nBut only one case, that of Denise Bourdeau, abused and then killed by her common-law spouse, has been brought to a successful resolution. And having spent so much time in the homes of families desperate for any scrap of information—no matter how grim—about the fate of their loved ones, I have to believe that there must be a better way. The police must find a way to protect the integrity of its investigations, while at the same time ensuring that families awaiting news do not wind up feeling abandoned by the very system designed to protect and serve them.\n\nFollow Jane Gerster on Twitter.",

Cities, towns, and counties or other municipalities may enact only those laws and ordinances relating to firearms that are specifically authorized by state law, as in RCW 9.41.300, and are consistent with this chapter.\n\n(Source: http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290)\n\nThis law is a good thing - it protects civil rights of gun owners from arbitrary actions by local politicians in municipalities where a large majority of population is not educated or indifferent to guns.

Just like we don't want to allow a city of Alabama to pass legislation restricting civil rights of gay, lesbian or trans-gender people, we don't want the City of Seattle to restrict civil rights of the legal gun owners.\n\nAs this case winds through the courts, we have received a news that WAGR - the gun control organization who brought us I-594, and who supported this misguided \"tax\" - is working with Seattle City Council to build upon their \"success\" and enact further city-wide restrictions for legal gun ownership, such as a ban on \"assault weapons\", manufacturing of AR-15 receivers, and more.\n\nSince it appears that Seattle City leaders don't understand the meaning of preemption and are hell-bent on making the lives of Seattle's legal gun owners arbitrarily difficult, the State legislature should reassert its authority over the matter.\n\nCan you take a few minutes and write to your State Representative, urging them to include the language into the definition of RCW 9.41.290 which would specifically bans using taxation and restriction on types of weapons or weapons manufacture as a way to circumvent the state preemption law?\n\nYou can find your state legislators here: http://app.leg.wa.gov/DistrictFinder/.\n\nHere is a template of the letter you can use.\n\n\"Dear Representative or Senator:\n\nIn light of the City of Seattle's obvious attempts to use prohibitive taxation to work around RCW 9.41.290, the state preemption law on firearms legislation, I urge you to strengthen the law to explicitly protect the buyers and firearms dealers from this new assault on their civil rights.\n\nPlease amend the law by specifically stating that municipalities cannot use taxes or restrictions on firearms manufacturing or specific firearms types to abridge the laws of legal gun owners such as myself in circumvention of the State law.\n\nThank you,\n\nYour Name\n\nYour legislative district\"\n\nPlease take this action to protect your civil rights, as well as the rights of your fellow gun owners everywhere in our state.",

Its goal is wrest back some of the attention that Windows 8, Surface, the iPad, iPad mini and iPhone 5 have gotten over the past several weeks.\n\nThe Nexus 4 is the fourth annual \"Google phone,\" designed by the search giant and manufactured by one of its Android partners -- this time, LG. Google didn't say much about the device, other than that it has the latest quad-core mobile processor (that's fast), and a 4.7-inch screen (really big).\n\nGoogle's Nexus phones have never sold particularly well, but this time around Google is trying something bold. For $299, customers can buy a Nexus 4 without a two-year contract. That's quite cheap for an \"unlocked\" high-end smartphone. An unlocked iPhone 5, by comparison, costs $650.\n\nThe base model Nexus 4 comes with 8 gigabytes of storage, half the typical amount for a smartphone. A 16 GB phone is available for $349. Both will go on sale on Nov. 13 online at the Google Play store. T-Mobile customers can also get a 16 GB version with a two-year contract for $199.\n\nThe Nexus also works on AT&T (T), which uses a similar network technology, but it isn't compatible with Verizon's network or Sprint's, according to a Google spokesman.\n\nThe search leader also announced a new 10-inch tablet, dubbed the Nexus 10. With 300 pixels per inch, the Samsung device has the highest-resolution screen for any tablet, Google claims, including the iPad with Apple's Retina display. Apple (AAPL) says the iPad sports a 264-pixels-per-inch screen.\n\nThe Nexus 10 allows for multiple user accounts, so that a family can share the device and keep separate apps and settings for each user. It also has stereo speakers and a standard tablet battery that lasts for nine hours.\n\nThe price tag is competitive: The 16 GB version will go on sale on the Google Play store Nov. 13 for $399, and a 32 GB version will be available for $499. Comparable iPads are each $100 more expensive.\n\nGoogle also unveiled an update to its Nexus 7 tablet, which the company unveiled in June. A new 32 GB version of the seven-inch Asus device is now available with AT&T's 3G-HSPA+ service -- which AT&T brands as \"4G\" -- for $299.\n\n\"We think today's devices offer the very best that money can buy,\" Android chief Andy Rubin said in a blog post.\n\nThe Android software that runs Google's devices also got a minor update on Monday. New features include Photo Sphere, a 360-degree photo-taking app and wireless streaming support for Qualcomm's (QCOM) Miracast wireless displays. It also offers a keyboard that doesn't require typing: \"Gesture Typing\" lets users glide their fingers over the letters they want to type.\n\nGoogle Now, an app that surfaces important information from e-mail, calendars and social networks, added support for flight information notifications, restaurant reservations, hotel confirmations and shipping details, in addition to nearby attractions like movies times at local theaters.\n\nA launch event had been planned in New York, but it was canceled due to Hurricane Sandy. Google announced the devices in a blog post instead.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) will be holding a Windows Phone 8 launch event in San Francisco on Monday.",
  "latent_18231": "Onions. The humble bulb that was worshipped by ancient Egyptians (but then, wasn’t everything?), rubbed on the muscles of Roman gladiators to firm them up, and used as medicine in the middle ages to facilitate bowel movements and erections, and to relieve headaches, coughs, snakebite and hair loss.* Of all the ingredients that spring (ahem) to mind when you wade through the panoply of beer and food pairing, onions have to be pretty much near the bottom. Until now. Yes, when given the chance to try what has to be one of the more unique beers that you’ll ever hope to experience, the other day it seemed apt that the opportunity also arose to pair that beer with pretty much the exact set of flavours in food form. And we’re not even talking about regular onions here, either. No, the layers (ahem) of specificity went far deeper than that.\n\n* That’s quite a weekend\n\nThe gloriously named Aji Bhaji – a 7.5% Topaz-hopped amber with caramelised onions, spices and Aji Limon chillies – is just the latest in a series of left-field beers produced by Elixir Brew Co, with Ben Bullen being a sort of brewing equivalent of William Buckland (previous beers Ben has been involved with have included ingredients such as peas, lapsang suchong tea and cous cous). With the sort of happy co-incidence that so often happens when you flip the cap off an onion beer, that very evening it was discovered that Domino’s now offer onion bhaji pieces as a ‘guest topping’ on their build-it-yourself pizzas. The opportunity to pair liquid and solid bhaji goodness was just too enticing to withstand.\n\nAfter all, the three main pillars of beer and food matching are often stated to be the C’s of Cut, Complement and Contrast. With exactly the same ingredient in each, in front of us had to have been the ultimate ‘complementary’ moment. And so it proved, the beer had a twin dynamic of warming chilli (from the sweet, citrus fruity Aji) and the tangy hum of onions. And the pizza, well, it had fairly imperceptible pieces of gritty overcooked onion. But you could just about taste it, if you channelled everything else out. Onion to onion. Pull them from the soil, add them to pizza and brew with them. Craft.\n\nOnion bhaji beer paired with an onion bhaji pizza. The most specific food-pairing out there?",

  "latent_18254": "Lamosca\n\nBy now, nearly everyone from the president of the United States on down has admit­ted that the National Security Agency went too far. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the rogue NSA contractor who has since gained asylum in Rus­sia, paint a picture of an organization with access to seemingly every word typed or spoken on any electronic device, anywhere in the world. And when news of the NSA's reach became public—as it was surely bound to do at some point—the entire US intelli­gence apparatus was thrust into what The New York Times recently called a \"crisis of purpose and legitimacy.\"\n\nIt was a crisis many years in the making. Over the course of three decades, the NSA slowly transformed itself from the nation's junior spy agency to the centerpiece of the entire intelligence system. As the amount of data in the world doubled, and doubled again, and again, the NSA kept up with it—even as America's human intelligence capability, as typified by old-fashioned CIA spies in the field, struggled to do anything useful with the unprecedented quantities of signals intelligence they had access to. Trained agency linguists capable of parsing massive quantities of Arabic- and Farsi-language intercepts don't scale up nearly as easily as data centers do.\n\nThat, however, wasn't the computer geeks' problem. Once it was clear that the NSA could do something, it seemed inarguable that the agency should do it—even after the bounds of information overload (billions of records added to bulging databases every day) or basic decency (spying on allied heads of state, for example) had long since been surpassed. The value of every marginal gigabyte of high tech signals intelligence was, at least in theory, quantifiable. The downside—the inability to prioritize essential intelligence and act on it; the damage to America's democratic legitimacy—was not. As a result, during the past couple of decades spycraft went from being a pursuit driven by human judgment calls to one driven by technical capability.\n\ncommentators who \"trusted their gut\" about mitt romney had their gut kicked by nate silver, the stats whiz who called the election for obama.\n\nThis shift in US intelligence mirrors a definite pattern of the past 30 years, one that we can see across fields and institutions. It's the rise of the quants—that is, the ascent to power of people whose native tongue is numbers and algorithms and systems rather than personal relationships or human intuition. Michael Lewis' Moneyball vividly recounts how the quants took over baseball, as statistical analy­sis trumped traditional scouting and propelled the underfunded Oakland A's to a division-winning 2002 season. More recently we've seen the rise of the quants in politics. Commentators who \"trusted their gut\" about Mitt Romney's chances had their gut kicked by Nate Silver, the stats whiz who called the election days before­hand as a lock for Obama, down to the very last electoral vote in the very last state.\n\nThe reason the quants win is that they're almost always right—at least at first. They find numerical patterns or invent ingenious algorithms that increase profits or solve problems in ways that no amount of subjective experience can match. But what happens after the quants win is not always the data-driven paradise that they and their boosters expected. The more a field is run by a system, the more that system creates incentives for everyone (employees, customers, competitors) to change their behavior in perverse ways—providing more of whatever the system is designed to measure and produce, whether that actually creates any value or not. It's a problem that can't be solved until the quants learn a little bit from the old-fashioned ways of thinking they've displaced.\n\nNo matter the discipline or industry, the rise of the quants tends to happen in four stages. Stage one is what you might call pre-disruption, and it's generally best visible in hindsight. Think about quaint dating agencies in the days before the arrival of Match .com and all the other algorithm-powered online replacements. Or think about retail in the era before floor-space management analytics helped quantify exactly which goods ought to go where. For a live example, consider Hollywood, which, for all the money it spends on market research, is still run by a small group of lavishly compensated studio executives, all of whom are well aware that the first rule of Hollywood, as memorably summed up by screenwriter William Goldman, is \"Nobody knows anything.\" On its face, Hollywood is ripe for quantifi­cation—there's a huge amount of data to be mined, considering that every movie and TV show can be classified along hundreds of different axes, from stars to genre to running time, and they can all be correlated to box office receipts and other measures of profitability.\n\nNext comes stage two, disruption. In most industries, the rise of the quants is a recent phenomenon, but in the world of finance it began back in the 1980s. The unmistakable sign of this change was hard to miss: the point at which you started getting targeted and personalized offers for credit cards and other financial services based not on the relationship you had with your local bank manager but on what the bank's algorithms deduced about your finances and creditworthiness. Pretty soon, when you went into a branch to inquire about a loan, all they could do was punch numbers into a computer and then give you the computer's answer.\n\nFor a present-day example of disruption, think about politics. In the 2012 election, Obama's old-fashioned campaign operatives didn't disappear. But they gave money and freedom to a core group of technologists in Chicago—including Harper Reed, former CTO of the Chicago-based online retailer Threadless—and allowed them to make huge decisions about fund-raising and voter targeting. Whereas earlier campaigns had tried to target segments of the population defined by geography or demographic profile, Obama's team made the campaign granular right down to the individual level. So if a mom in Cedar Rapids was on the fence about who to vote for, or whether to vote at all, then instead of buying yet another TV ad, the Obama campaign would message one of her Facebook friends and try the much more effective personal approach.\n\nOakland, 2002—when data geeks moneyballed the national pastime. Dave Kaup/Getty Images\n\nMost strikingly, the campaign perfected the art of A/B testing—the practice of testing alternate versions—when it came to fund-raising emails. Writing effective language for such appeals, and designing them in the best possible manner, has traditionally been considered an art—but all gut intuition was discarded in favor of raw data about what worked and what didn't. One email in June, headlined \"I will be outspent,\" raised $2.6 million on its own, while projections based on their testing indicated that other emails would have raised less than a fifth of that. Everything was A/B tested, from the background color (yellow worked better than white for some reason) to the greeting, the subject line, and the size of the request.\n\nAfter disruption, though, there comes at least some version of stage three: over­shoot. The most common problem is that all these new systems—metrics, algo­rithms, automated decisionmaking processes—result in humans gaming the system in rational but often unpredictable ways. Sociologist Donald T. Campbell noted this dynamic back in the '70s, when he articulated what's come to be known as Campbell's law: \"The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making,\" he wrote, \"the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.\"\n\nOn a managerial level, once the quants come into an industry and disrupt it, they often don't know when to stop. They tend not to have decades of institutional knowledge about the field in which they have found themselves. And once they're empowered, quants tend to create systems that favor something pretty close to cheating. As soon as managers pick a numerical metric as a way to measure whether they're achieving their desired outcome, everybody starts maximizing that metric rather than doing the rest of their job—just as Campbell's law predicts.\n\nonce quants disrupt an industry, they often don't know when to stop—and they create systems that encourage cheating.\n\nPolicing is a good example, as explained by Harvard sociologist Peter Moskos in his book Cop in the Hood: My Year Policing Baltimore's Eastern District. Most cops have a pretty good idea of what they should be doing, if their goal is public safety: reducing crime, locking up kingpins, confiscating drugs. It involves foot patrols, deep investigations, and building good relations with the community. But under statistically driven regimes, individual officers have almost no incentive to actually do that stuff. Instead, they're all too often judged on results—specifically, arrests. (Not even convictions, just arrests: If a suspect throws away his drugs while fleeing police, the police will chase and arrest him just to get the arrest, even when they know there's no chance of a conviction.)\n\nThe same goes for the rise of \"teaching to the test\" in public schools, or the perverse incentives placed on snowplow operators, who, paid by the quantity of snow cleared, might simply ignore patches of lethal black ice. Even with the 2012 Obama campaign, it became hard to learn about the candidate's positions by visiting his website, because it was so optimized for maximizing donations—an easy and obvious numerical target—that all other functions fell by the wayside.\n\nThe most profound example of overshoot, of course, happened in finance, where the rise of quantification could concentrate decisionmaking—and moneymaking—within a relatively small group of people at a bank's headquarters. Soon they were trying to optimize their algorithms to maximize profit, minimize risk, and make millions of dollars for themselves. Global regulators didn't help: In 2004, in sympathy with the over-leveraged, hyper-quantified banking system, the Basel Committee—the Switzerland-based body that oversees world finance—put out the Basel II accord, more than 250 pages of regulations that effectively placed individual banks in the driver's seat. The accord essentially embraced all of the quantitative techniques used by the wizards who would end up blowing up Wall Street, and it allowed banks to operate with astonishingly high levels of debt. As everybody knows, all of that ended in catastrophe in 2008. (You can read more about the particular math of that cataclysm in my March 2009 cover story for WIRED, \"A Formula for Disaster.\")\n\nIt's increasingly clear that for smart organizations, living by numbers alone simply won't work. That's why they arrive at stage four: synthesis—the practice of marrying quantitative insights with old-fashioned subjective experience. Nate Silver himself has written thoughtfully about examples of this in his book, The Signal and the Noise. He cites baseball, which in the post-Moneyball era adopted a \"fusion approach\" that leans on both statistics and scouting. Silver credits it with delivering the Boston Red Sox's first World Series title in 86 years. Or consider weather forecasting: The National Weather Service employs meteorologists who, understanding the dynamics of weather systems, can improve forecasts by as much as 25 percent compared with computers alone. A similar synthesis holds in eco­nomic forecasting: Adding human judgment to statistical methods makes results roughly 15 percent more accurate. And it's even true in chess: While the best computers can now easily beat the best humans, they can in turn be beaten by humans aided by computers.\n\nIn finance too we're starting to see at least the outlines of a synthesis. In Septem­ber 2010, the Basel Committee came out with Basel III, and while it doesn't fully dismantle Basel II, it does add layers of common sense on top of all the rocket science. As well as raising the required capital ratio, it sets a leverage ratio (effec­tively a maximum size that a bank can grow to, given the amount of capital it has) and liquidity requirements that experienced bankers know create a cushion for the whole system. Essentially, while the algorithms were given free rein under Basel II, there's a host of overrides in Basel III that put power back where it belongs, in the hands of experienced regulators. Basel III isn't perfect, but no international system of bank regulation could ever hope to be. In a few years' time, if and when it gets fully implemented, it's going to be a vast improvement on what preceded it.\n\nThat's what a good synthesis of big data and human intuition tends to look like. As long as the humans are in control, and understand what it is they're controlling, we're fine. It's when they become slaves to the numbers that trouble breaks out. So let's celebrate the value of disruption by data—but let's not forget that data isn't everything.",
  "latent_18258": "Close\n\nThe Southeast Alaska's Alexander Archipelago wolf is not an endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Despite a serious decline in the species' population on the Prince of Wales Island, the Alexander Archipelago wolf doesn't merit protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\nIn November 2015, the USFWS's Species Status Assessment suggested that the Alexander Archipelago wolf's numbers on the Prince of Wales Islands had decreased by 75 percent. The species on the island declined from 356 to just 89 between 1994 and 2014.\n\nThe USFWS identified several factors that affected the species' declining numbers: climate change, timber harvest, wolf hunting and road development. The agency noted that most of the external factors have indirect, not direct, effects on the wolves.\n\nWolf hunting directly affects the species' mortality. Timber harvest and climate change-related events can lower the deer population on the area, which are the main sources of food for the wolves. Road development seems to indirectly affect the species as well, as it gives the hunters more access to the wolves. Still the USFWS said the species didn't qualify for protection under ESA.\n\n\"We determined that many of the life-history traits and behaviors of the Alexander Archipelago wolf, such as its variable diet, lack of preferential use of habitats, and high reproductive potential, increase its ability to persist in highly modified habitats with numerous stressors,\" said the USFWS.\n\nMany wildlife advocates raised their concerns and said the USFWS has given up hope on the species. Greenpeace's Forest Campaigner Larry Edwards said the USFWS has overlooked some of the important factors affecting the species.\n\nEdwards added how odd it was that the USFWS acknowledged the 75 percent decrease but decided that the species do not merit protection under ESA. The U.S. agency's prediction of the total remaining population of the wolves was somewhere between 850 to 2,700 individuals. About 62 percent reside in British Columbia. Approximately 38 percent remain in southeastern Alaska.\n\nProtection advocates attacked the USFWS' wide-range population estimates to be a lack of knowledge about the species' actual remaining numbers and status.\n\nA direct remark from USFWS' Regional Endangered Species Coordinator Drew Crane resulted in an indirect admission that the U.S. agency might be sacrificing the species' small population on Prince of Wales Island.\n\n\"But Prince of Wales Island in general only constitutes six percent of the range-wide population of the Alexander Archipelago wolf,\" said Crane. Still the agency predicts that the remaining population on Prince of Wales Island will decline in the succeeding 30 years by as much as 14 percent.\n\nPhoto: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarters | Flickr\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The council made its decision under the Local Government Act and was entitled to do so. There were people against an elected Mayor who stood and were resoundingly beaten. I’d have thought that sent a clear signal about this issue.”\n\nI read in the ECHO (July 1) about the scandal of children in schools going hungry and that there are 2.4m children living in absolute poverty.\n\nThis on the day of reports that MPs are getting a £10,000 pay rise. If local MPs were to donate this pay rise they can’t refuse to the council’s school meals budget, how many starving children would get fed each day?\n\nGraham Manley, Old Swan\n\nThe Mayor says: “Five Liverpool MPs’ pay rises = £50,000. Average cost of free school meal = £1.80. Therefore, total meals MPs’ pay rise could buy = 27,778. Total number of children in school = 62,119. Total number receiving free school meals = 18,471.\n\n“Therefore, the pay rise wouldn’t pay for even two full days’ worth of free school meals to those who already claim it in Liverpool, let alone any extra children on top of that. The reality is the vast majority of MPs, certainly in Merseyside, do a fantastic job, work really hard and do long hours away from home.”\n\nAs Everton have said they are looking for a new ground in the Anfield/ Walton area and Liverpool have now said they are going to extend Anfield, why not give Everton Stanley Park?\n\nIf it was good enough for LFC, then I’m sure EFC would go for it. Good idea?\n\nBrian Campbell, Liverpool 4\n\nThe Mayor says: “Nothing is impossible if the money is there and that applies to Liverpool, Everton, a shared stadium or any issue – like the Football Quarter. Regarding Stanley Park and EFC, if EFC show me the colour of their money and their investment, then everything is on the table.”\n\nAs a fellow shipping enthusiast, will we ever see P&O ships at the Pier Head? Also, do you think we will be able to join and leave various worldwide cruises in the foreseeable future from the Pier Head as I am getting on a bit?\n\nRoy Laycock, Burscough\n\nThe Mayor says: “This is something we will achieve. We’ve already had two P&O ships here recently and my ambition is to have more than 100,000 visitors coming to our city through cruises. And we’ve got some ambitious plans that will hopefully be revealed shortly.”\n\nAre we getting a marathon in 2014?\n\nJim Price, Orrell Park\n\nThe Mayor says: “Yes. We’ve got a preferred partner and I will announce the date shortly.”\n\nJoe, I’m a supporter of yours and, while this is a personal question, I feel it relevant. I recall you last year talking about the concerns you and your family had for your health after a heart scare you went through (days after he was elected, the Mayor was admitted to hospital and his heart was put back into rhythm – Tony Blair underwent a similar procedure).\n\nSeeing the way you operate and the scraps you get into – not just with Rex Makin – I’m sure there will be many who will be concerned. How is your health today and do you think you should change your full-blooded approach?\n\nJ Carter, Liverpool 17\n\nThe Mayor says: “The job is full-on. I work an average 60 hours a week and most weeks it’s 70. I’m passionate about this city. This is a stressful job . . . but I’m fine. I’m still under treatment with the marvellous team at the Royal Liverpool hospital and I’m managing that. It can happen to 20-year-olds, 56-year-olds and people who are thin, fat or good-looking – like myself!\n\n“I will constantly challenge people who misinform and make mischief with gossip. If ECHO columnists Rex Makin or Joe Riley want to spend a week at the city council to see how hard we work, then they are both welcome.”\n\nWhy don’t you get up off your knees and start fighting these cuts instead of implementing them? We now have a situation where the Government say “cut” and you say “How much?” and follow it through. You have people being threatened with eviction from houses they have lived in for 30 years or more because of the spiteful bedroom tax, and you are part of that – and you go out and borrow £200m for fixing pot holes, yet you slag off the Labour Party in the ’80s for going out and borrowing money to keep people in work.\n\nYou’re a disgrace to the Labour movement. Obviously at some time in the future there will be a knighthood coming your way for services rendered to this vicious and evil government. I hope you sleep well at night.\n\nRoy Dixon, via email\n\nThe Mayor says: “Clearly this is a guy who wants me to set an illegal budget. The reality is the period of Militant rule cost this city hundreds of millions of pounds of investments and thousands of jobs. Even Derek Hatton says what we are doing now is right because times have changed. And, no, I don’t sleep well at night because I’m often worried about how we are going to be doing things in the coming weeks.”\n\nCan you name just two things that you have been able to achieve for Liverpool as Mayor that you could not have done as council leader?\n\nP Morrison, Liverpool 12\n\nThe Mayor says: “We wouldn’t be represented at the World Mayors’ Forum. We’ve got mayoral development zones and a single investment pot for building schools and houses wouldn’t have come without the City Deal negotiated on the mayoral model. When I went to Brussels, I had meetings with three commissioners in one afternoon – Europe and the rest of the world recognise mayors. Our governance model was not modern and needed repairing.”\n\nWhy did the council make the decision to refuse our nomination to give Brian Epstein, posthumously, the Freedom of the City?\n\nWe suggest that you now urge Liverpool city council to reconsider and reverse this negative and wrong decision as soon as possible.\n\nJohn James Chambers, Liverpool 11, Liverpool Beatles Appreciation Society International\n\nThe Mayor says: “I don’t think we have ever awarded a posthumous Freedom of the City and it’s not something we would do. If we do it for Brian Epstein, we would have to do it for many others. I did choose to rename the Neptune Theatre the Epstein Theatre and we clearly recognise his contribution.”\n\nIs there anything you can do, personally, about a modern-day menace – cyclists on pavements?\n\nA concerned pedestrian, Liverpool city centre\n\nThe Mayor says: “We are looking at improving cyclist routes . . . but he is absolutely right and I would expect police officers to challenge those cyclists who are a danger to pedestrians.”\n\nI know there have been lots of cuts in the council but I would like to know why the funding has been cut for LACES (Liverpool City Council Looked After Children’s Education Service). These looked after children need this service, and so do other children who are in school with them. I think that it is an essential service to all, especially the teachers as they cannot give all their attention to one child when there are up to 30 children in a class . . . I think this is a matter that needs looking at again and re-assessing.\n\nJane Dodd, via email\n\nThe Mayor says: “The team has seen some changes and efficiencies made but the quality of the service remains the same. Headteachers continue to give positive feedback.”\n\nThe Echo handed the Mayor three similar sets of detailed questions about the plan to sell and build on Sefton Park Meadows. They included, from Kenneth Aspinall, of Liverpool 18 : “Why, in the face of overwhelming opposition by the people of Liverpool, are you carrying on with this ill-conceived proposal?”\n\nThe Mayor says: “I am aware of the objections. I’m also aware of the desperate financial state of the city . . . There are about 235 acres of prime park land and this is not in the park. It’s not used by people and it’s not fair for them to argue that it is. Every fair-minded person in the city knows it’s not part of the park.”\n\nWhat response has Mayor Anderson had from speaking directly to Europe regarding plans to divert £270m of funding away from Merseyside?”\n\nPaul McDermott, via email\n\nThe Mayor says: “I raised this when I met the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn. I’ve since written to him and said it’s now happened as I predicted and I await his response. I have also written to the Government to say it’s an absolute travesty of justice.”\n\nDangerous dogs have become a problem all over the country, and also in Liverpool, especially those owners who do not have their dogs on a lead. Have you any plans to stop this?”\n\nAndrew, Liverpool, via email.\n\nThe Mayor says: “I’d love to see things go further and dogs chipped and muzzled in public spaces, irrespective of what type of dog it is.\n\nIt then removes that question of what it is. It’s such a grey area – some Jack Russells are the feistiest, most robust little creatures you’ll ever see.\n\nIt’s about irresponsible owners but we can’t paint a cross on someone and say they are the irresponsible owners because we just don’t know.\n\nSo we have to try and protect people using our public open spaces and living in properties. Doing nothing means we end up with fatalities and attacks on people. This isn’t punishing those who behave. I think most responsible owners would recognise we’ve got to do something.”\n\nOn a scale of one to 100, what chances are there of a shared stadium for EFC/LFC? I reckon 0% – because there are so many blinkered, negative moaners here (I think you referred to this problem we have recently while talking about the reaction to the Anfield regeneration).\n\nSensible Red, name and address supplied\n\nThe Mayor says: “About 20%. As the months go on, that will reduce because LFC, once they start their investment, then that stops any chance, I believe, of a shared stadium.\n\n“If an investor comes in and talks to EFC, or takes over, they may well want a dialogue with LFC.”",
  "latent_18465": "SPRING HILL — Two Hernando County men and one from Pasco are facing multiple charges in connection with a statewide crackdown on Internet gambling and sweepstakes establishments.\n\nAnthony William Alascia, 52, and John Nichols Cucciniello, 46, both of Spring Hill, and Charles Bartlett, 69, of Hudson, were arrested Tuesday. According to affidavits, the men operated Gin Lin Sweepstakes locations at 3270 Commercial Way, 2402 Commercial Way and 7269 Forest Oaks Blvd. in Spring Hill.\n\nAlascia faces two racketeering counts, four counts of possessing a slot machine, four counts of operating a lottery, four counts of keeping a gambling establishment and eight counts of money laundering/transferring more than $100,000.\n\nCucciniello faces two charges of racketeering, three counts of possessing a slot machine, three counts of operating a lottery, three counts of keeping a gambling establishment and six counts of fraud and money laundering of more than $100,000.\n\nBartlett faces a charge of maintaining a gambling establishment and 45 counts of possession of a coin-operated gambling device. All three were booked at local jails, then transferred to the Seminole County jail, where they are being held without bail.\n\nThe men were all linked to Allied Veterans of the World, a nonprofit organization that operates dozens of Internet cafes throughout the state and is the subject of a statewide racketeering and fraud investigation in which search warrants were sought for 50 sweepstakes locations throughout Florida.\n\nAt the cafes, customers buy Internet time loaded onto a card and get free sweepstakes entries they can reveal by playing games on computer screens that mimic slot machines.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in Oklahoma to obtain the search warrants, Internal Revenue Service investigators wrote that Allied \"engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to defraud\" the public into believing that proceeds from the sweepstakes were going to a charity affiliated with the Veterans Administration.\n\nThe Florida Times Union reported that three men associated with the Allied — Jerry Bass, head of the veterans group; Mike Davis, an executive with the group, and Kelly Mathis, the group's attorney — were arrested in connection with the investigation.\n\nIn addition, Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, a former state lawmaker who owned a public relations firm that represented Allied Veterans, announced her resignation Wednesday, one day after she was questioned by authorities investigating the group.\n\nInvestigators with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the IRS on Wednesday carried boxes out of GinLin LLC 52 on Forest Oaks Boulevard and GinLin LLC 45 on at 2402 Commercial Way, two of the Internet sweepstakes locations run by Alascia, Cucciniello and Bartlett.\n\nWhile the businesses remained closed Wednesday, a sign on the front door of the Forest Oaks location said it would reopen today.\n\nJoe Vanilla and his wife, Florence, both regular players at GinLin LLC 45, were surprised to learn that the Internet sweepstakes business had abruptly closed. The couple said they intended to visit another Internet cafe in the same shopping complex.\n\nAlascia and Cucciniello have several ties to the Spring Hill business community. Cucciniella is listed in state corporate records as owner of Extreme Fitness in Spring Hill. The men are married to Susan Alascia and Nikki Cucciniello, who are listed as principal owners of Passports Restaurant in Spring Hill. The women are not the subject of the state investigation.\n\nIn addition, state corporate records show that Anthony Alascia is associated with Jac Sweeps LLC, a company that operates an Internet sweepstakes room in Sarasota that was also part of the statewide investigation.\n\nBartlett has a history of gambling-related arrests. In 2005, he was charged with keeping a gambling house for an establishment at 3270 Commercial Lane. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.\n\nLast year, after Pasco Sheriff's deputies raided Achievers Internet Sweepstakes in Holiday, Bartlett was charged with running a gambling establishment and 45 counts of owning slot machines. The disposition of that case was unclear Wednesday.\n\nBartlett also owned Reel Fun of Pinellas, a Palm Harbor Internet cafe that was shut down in 2011.\n\nStaff writers Jon Silman, Tony Marrero and Octavio Jones and Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report.

  "latent_18676": "For the first time since the 1930s, participation in Republican primaries exceeds participation in Democratic primaries, according to a report by the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University.\n\nThe study, which looked at elections held through Sept. 1 of this year, found that more than four million more voters cast ballots in Republican primaries than in Democratic primaries. While it is unclear whether higher levels of Republican primary participation spell doom for the Democrats in November, a closer look at the data shows reasons for leaders of both parties to be concerned — the number of nonvoters continues to outpace voters. In a primary season where the narrative tends to be about partisanship and anger, the statistics through the end of the summer suggest that voter participation remained relatively consistent with the last couple off-year election cycles.\n\nAccording to the study, voter turnout rebounded slightly from the 2006 primary season (which, with slightly less than 17 percent of the voting age population voting, holds the record for the lowest turnout for a midterm election on record). It is consistent with turnout from the 1998 and 2002 primaries, in which slightly less than 19 percent of the population voted. Compared to 1994, participation in the 2010 primary runs about two percentage points lower.\n\nSince 1966, when more than 20 percent of the voting-age population voted in Democratic primaries, participation among Democratic primary voters has steadily declined. With the exception of a slight upward blip in 2002 (only one-third of a percentage point), a smaller and smaller percentage of the voting age population has voted in a Democratic primary each year. On the Republican side, the trend appears to be substantially flatter, especially across the last three decades. Still, participation in Republican primaries is down by one-third between 1966 and 2006 (and down by one-sixth between 1966 and 2010).\n\nWhy is participation in partisan primaries on the decline? Are voters increasingly apathetic, or channeling their anger elsewhere? The most likely answer seems to be that fewer voters are eligible to participate in primary elections. Evidence on changing partisan identification, coupled with state-by-state eligibility requirements for participation in primary elections, suggests that declining turnout in partisan primaries reflects voters’ retreat from partisan identifications.\n\nA minority of states conduct open primaries, in which registered voters can vote in a partisan primary regardless of whether they’re registered with that party. In Georgia, for instance, registered voters can select whether they want to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary, regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nThe majority of states, however, hold closed primaries. In closed primaries, like those held in Florida. registered Republicans vote in Republican primaries, registered Democrats vote in Democratic ones, and those not affiliated with a political party can’t vote in primary elections.\n\nWith closed primaries dominating the political landscape, long-term trends in self-identified partisan affiliation suggest that fewer people are eligible to vote in partisan primaries. According to the General Social Survey, more than 47 percent of Americans self-identified as Democrats in 1972 (the inaugural year of the General Social Survey). That number declined to about 30 percent of Americans in 2006, before bouncing back up six percentage points with the Obama election in 2008. Republican self-identification, on the other hand, rose through the 1970s and the 1980s, peaking at about 33 percent in the early 1990s before experiencing a parallel decline to Democratic self-identification in the last two decades (with a small resurgence during the Bush presidency).\n\nAlthough the General Social Survey data for 2010 is not available yet, recent Gallup polls on Partisan affiliation suggest that the percentage of self-identified Democrats has returned to about 30 percent, and about 28 percent of Americans self-identify as Republicans.\n\nThe tricky part for primary elections, though, involves how organizations measure voter turnout. Voter participation rates, like those used in the study by the Center for Study of American Elections, use the voting age population, rather than the number of voters eligible to vote in the primary, as the denominator.\n\nAssuming that the decline in partisan identification is accompanied by a decline in partisan registration, declining levels of participation in partisan primaries reflects a declining pool of eligible voters. (Of course, declines in partisan registration likely lag somewhat behind Democratic self-identification.) The trends, though, are pretty clear in the graph below. Over the last three decades, the percentage of self-identified Democrats has steadily declined alongside the percentage of the voting-age population that participates in Democratic primaries. On the Republican side, partisan self-identification peaked in the early 1990s – as did the percent of the electorate voting in Republican primaries – before declining.\n\nAlthough these national trends help explain declining participation rates in partisan primaries nationwide, they mask substantial variation in state-level trends. Participation rates fluctuate substantially within states, reflecting, in large part, the electoral competitiveness of individual races. In the state-level data from the 2010 primary season, one state stands out for its remarkable increase in voter turnout: Colorado. Participation in the 2010 primary elections in Colorado increased by 114 percent over 2006. Surely, competitive races on both sides of the aisle, as well as for both statewide offices, drove turnout. But, for the first time, Coloradans had the option of voting by mail, rather than voting in person. In fact, in almost three-quarters of Colorado counties, all-mail primaries required voters to vote by mail. Like most states, Colorado has a closed primary that restricts participation to registered partisans. Yet, the state’s effort to make voting easier seems to have generated real returns for participation rates. More than twice as many voters voted in Colorado’s 2010 primary than voted in the 2006 primary election.\n\nAbsent a reversal in trends in partisan identification, efforts to make voting easier could be the antidote to primary seasons continually marred by declining levels of participation.",

  "latent_18965": "According to an India Today report India has successfully tested its most sophisticated missile a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM), codenamed K-4 MISSILE, capable of striking targets over the range of 3,500 kilometres.\n\nA submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) is a ballistic missile capable of being launched from submarines. Modern variants usually deliver multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) each of which carries a nuclear warhead and allows a single launched missile to strike several targets.\n\nIndia’s K-4 MISSILE is an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable, submarine-launched ballistic missile. K-4 MISSILE together with the K-15 Sagarika SLBM, will give the Arihant-class of nuclear submarines, and her successors, their nuclear strike capabilities, completing India’s undersea nuclear deterrent capability and giving India a nuclear triad (A nuclear triad is the ability to launch Nuclear weapons from air, sea & land). The K-15 has a considerably shorter range than the K-4 MISSILE. At a maximum strike range of approximately 750 kilometers, Arihant-class submarines would have to move close to enemy shores to successfully deploy the K-15 SLBMs, increasing the chances of being detected by enemy submarines.\n\nThe K-4 MISSILE with a considerably longer range helps overcome this shortcoming.\n\nThe missile measures 12 metre in length and 1.3 metre in width. It weighs 17 tonnes and can carry a nuclear payload of 2,000 kilograms. Its engine is solid fuelled. DRDO scientists claim that the missile is highly accurate with a near zero circular error probability (measure of a weapon system’s precision). According to publicly available information, the K-4 MISSILE uses a Ringer Laser Gyro Inertial navigation system.\n\nThe K-4 MISSILE will undergo two more development tests before it will be fired from the Indian Navy’s first indigenously developed ballistic missile nuclear submarine (SSBN), the INS Arihant. The submarine is equipped with four vertical launch tubes, which can be armed with either four K-4 MISSILE or 12—three per launch tube—K-15 missiles, another member of the K-series of missiles with a maximum range of 750 kilometers (466 miles). There have also been some reports that DRDO is also working on a new top-secret variant of the K missile family with a 5,000 kilometer (3,106 miles) range. India’s nuclear warfare policy is centred on a No First-Use (NFU) doctrine. The K family of missiles is meant to boost India’s second strike capability and will be the cornerstone of the sea leg of the country’s nuclear triad. India still maintains a policy of keeping its nuclear warheads de-mated from the missiles.\n\nImage Courtesy: New Indian Express",
  "latent_19213": "Upon first listen, many people assume that James Blake is black. And when they do set eyes on the 26-year-old white Englishman singing, they're taken aback.\n\n\"He's like a white Erykah Badu,\" one smitten YouTube user commented on a video clip of Blake's 2013 live performance on the Late Show With David Letterman. \"I'm a kid all over again, and it's all because of a white boy with a black voice.\"\n\nRacial stereotypes aside, it's not often that the pop music world finds a male voice with Blake's pristine, shimmering tone and voluptuously soulful expression, redolent of the great black gospel singers.\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\"I think if anyone wants to sing pop music, and they want to leave out the black contributions to popular music, they may find themselves wanting as a singer,\" Blake tells Crossfade.\n\nSee also: Review & Photos: James Blake Makes Florida Debut at Basel 2014, Plays New Song \"Forever\"\n\n\"Some of the greatest music in pop is black. In fact, quite a large portion of it. Anyone in their right mind who wants to learn about singing should listen to at least some of the singers that I grew up with, like Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, the Reverend James Cleveland, and earlier gospel.\n\n\"I try to learn from those people, but I guess in equal amounts, I've learned from white singers and everything in between,\" he adds. \"I think it's helpful to educate yourself on all types of singing, like Irish or English folk singing. Some of the great folk artists I've listened to have influenced me just as much. In some way, it must be linked to folk music in general -- that is more key, regardless of race.\"\n\nOf course, for all of its gospel and folk leanings, James Blake's production sound is ostensibly electronic -- minimal broken beat and deep dub bass arrangements led to his earliest releases being characterized as \"post-dubstep\" by the music media. And as an innovative young producer living and working in the electronic music capital of London, it makes sense that Blake would be careening through that particular musical avenue.\n\n\"I think the post-dubstep thing is just the next generation of kids trying to do something which the people they respect are making,\" says Blake. \"Failing miserably, I think, but ultimately coming up with something new. I guess that's how music moves on.\"\n\nHaving moved on himself, from the stark future bass stylings of his earlier work to a maturer jazz- and soul-inflected electronic melancholia, Blake's 2013 sophomore album, Overgrown, was universally acclaimed and has seen him emerge as something of a transatlantic indie-pop phenomenon -- the kind of authentic natural talent with material of substance which this decade's vapid pop music zeitgeist was in dire need of.\n\nSee also: EDM's Five Greatest Delusions\n\nIt speaks volumes of Blake's one-per-generation caliber of talent that Brian Eno -- legendary producer and muse for heavyweights like Talking Heads and U2 -- signed on to work with him on the track \"Digital Lion.\"\n\nOn working with Eno, Blake says: \"He was very influential on me during that period, just because, as a person, he was so reassuring in that I was going in the right direction that I felt validated by it and ultimately more at ease with how my album was sounding.\"\n\nOnce you get past the spellbinding effect of Blake's voice, his lyrics reveal deeply personal and introspective subject matter. \"Retrograde\", the hauntingly beatific standout on Overgrown, reads like an intimate love letter written in the private interpersonal code of two lovers. It's not the sappy formulaic love expression of a million pop songs before it -- the song is aching with raw vulnerable longing.\n\n\"I was inspired when I heard a quote about writing about what's in front of you,\" Blake explains. \"It's a natural way to write and, of course, often the most effective. There's a well of information with the things that are going on in front of you, which essentially might mean people or situations. Firsthand experience, really, is the subject of my music.\"\n\nWhen it comes to his songwriting, it turns out Blake is a poet before a musician. \"It always comes lyrics first, and then I set the melody to lyrics -- which is why some of my lyrics I don't sing too well,\" he says, self-deprecatingly.\n\n\"With some artists, the lyrics can sometimes sound secondary to the melody itself, and maybe it's because when they were writing, they sang the melody first and then the lyrics took shape eventually.\n\nA lot of my lyrics end up being sung how they were written on the page, which often makes them sound clunky and awkward.\"\n\n\"I try to edit as much of that out as I can, but I often fail at that, and have these slightly voluptuous lyrics. Maybe that's the wrong word. Maybe spiky,\" he laughs.\n\nSee also: EDM's Five Biggest Hacks\n\nFans should be excited to know that Blake is making major headway on his new album: \"I'm probably about 70-percent done with it,\" he discloses. \"I'm working hard and doing my best -- I'm aware that people want to hear this next record, so I'm not being complacent.\n\n\"I should hope that [the new album] will be a step on, as much as the second one was to the first,\" he adds. \"I guess I've taken a focus on the songwriting again, even more closely, and I'm dabbling in some different production techniques, things I've developed.\"\n\nAs always, fans can expect emotions running high on the album with heartfelt personal lyrics.\n\n\"I'm currently single, so that's changed,\" Blake confesses.\n\n\"A lot of things have changed in my life since the last record, and overall for the better, so I'm in a good place, I think. I'm in a good place to write in general, and I have been for quite a while.\"\n\nOne highly notable tidbit about the new album is the possibility of a collaboration with Kanye West. (This is not as shocking as it might sound, as it wouldn't be the first time Blake has collaborated with a Grammy-winning rapper -- RZA of Wu-Tang fame has credits on Overgrown.)\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for [Kanye], for what he has been releasing for years,\" says Blake. \"We haven't done a great deal of work in the same room yet, but we've done a few things, kind of helped each other with our own music. In terms of the actual collaboration for this record, it looks like we should be able to get something done. I know that there's a specific song I would like him to be on, and if he can do that by the time my record comes out, that would be fantastic.\"\n\nBlake's upcoming Basel week concert just might be this year's most highly anticipated event among indie music lovers -- if only because it will be his first time performing in Florida. But one more reason to look forward to this show will be his unveiling of works in progress from the new album.\n\n\"We're going to be playing new things, to show people a taste of what it will sound like,\" he says. \"There's a number of songs I want to play, but only two or three I think we should, just because it's early -- we still have about five months before the record comes out. So we'll hammer them out and see what people think.\n\n\"I've never been to Miami before, so I'm very excited.\"\n\nJames Blake. A live performance.

  "latent_19445": "Journalists, artists, and the purveyors of other potentially controversial material have reason to be wary that their content may be taken down and censored, even more so as some of the top United States journalists warn that Donald Trump’s administration could have a chilling effect on journalistic freedom.\n\nOnline domains that are registered with DNS (Domain Name System) are registered under centralized control and are ultimately able to be taken down, meaning that a website can be essentially censored at whim by a sufficiently controlling government. NameCoin set out to solve this vulnerability by creating a distributed domain name registration system, unable to be taken down through centralized control. However, due to various developmental flaws, NameCoin never reached more than a historical and novelty significance.\n\nBipCoin aims to successfully rectify this shortcoming. A CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency, which recently released a graphical user interface (GUI) wallet before more popular CryptoNote coin Monero, BipCoin aims to add decentralized DNS functionality, solving the many issues that prevented NameCoin from catching on, including domain squatting. Its development team has released a plain-English whitepaper as well as a fundraiser to add distributed DNS functionality.\n\nCointelegraph spoke to Michael Dean, BipCoin developer, about the future of censorship-proof domains.\n\nCointelegraph: So first, why is decentralized \"DNS\" important?\n\nMichael W. Dean: Governments control DNS, and it is the easiest way for them to steal a website they don't like, even if it is not breaking the law, and there is very little recourse when that happens to you.\n\nCointelegraph: NameCoin attempted this, correct? Were they successful, and if not, why?\n\nMichael W. Dean: A number of reasons. Mainly they made it almost free to register a domain, so they all got squatted, and five years later they still don't really have a way for the non-technical to resolve a NameCoin domain (Dot-Bit). There was FreeSpeechMe, a plugin that I named and promoted for the NameCoin team, and raised money for, it was a start, but came out three years after their launch. Then there was MeowBit, that I also named, which BipCoin Dev team member Derrick Slopey made and we worked really hard to promote that, but the underlying framework of NameCoin was broken in the ways I described above. This was two years ago. I've been thinking non-stop since about how to do it, and I really think I've solved all the issues. And enumerated the plan in the whitepaper.\n\nIt may seem that the BipDev writing this whitepaper has it out to bash NameCoin and the NameCoin devs. However, there is no possible way to accurately explain what was wrong with NameCoin, and what to do right in moving distributed DNS beyond NameCoin, without mentioning the many many mistakes of the NameCoin devs.\n\nDistributed DNS is one of the things always mentioned in any introductory article about \"the wonders of the Blockchain.\" Sometimes they even mention NameCoin or some of the new corporate Blockchains. But these articles always act like it is already a done deal. It's not.\n\nThey never mention that while this is technically possible, no one is actually using this yet.\n\nAs no one has solved the main problems or made it easy to use for everyone. Henry Ford did not invent the internal combustion engine, nor was he the first person to put one on a carriage to make it work without a horse. But he did put a car in every carriage house. And when he started most people had never even seen a car. He made cars practical and affordable. We plan to do this for distributed, difficult-to-censor DNS. NameCoin established some amazing concepts. BipCoin will take these ideas and make them easy to adopt for everyone.\n\nCointelegraph: Cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to be gravitating towards financial anonymity these days. Is censorship resistance a blind spot?\n\nMichael W. Dean: Yes. It's a huge blind spot. It's all fine and well to have dark sites, and they serve a purpose, though they're none of my business, but they are not for everyone or everything. A lot of the internet that is legal many politicians would love to take down. Hell, on the campaign trail, the next president of the United States promised to punish journalists who piss him off. And it would be possible to use Dot-Bip to make human-rememberable addresses for TOR and other hidden activist sites.\n\nHowever, what we are looking to do with Dot-Bip is help a lot of the web have backups. You would still have your .com address, but the Dot-Bip would be an alternative in case you are ever seized. Lots of sites are seized where the owner is known but never arrested. It’s so easy to seize the sites, that government thugs consider that enough.\n\nEven if Dot-Bip became acceptable as a \"just in case\" thing that many sites have, if it were ever needed, it would be there, and people would have the means to access it. If they are there and people can access them and test them but they're never needed for any of that web user's favorite sites, they are still useful, as a thought experiment, like Cody Wilson's printable gun.\n\nI mean, no one really is going to carry a Liberator for self-defense. You can make a better zip gun in your garage. But it's the fact that you can make a Liberator that is important. This is not to say that Dot-Bip would just be a thought experiment.\n\nI’m saying it would be an added feature if you never need it, to help liberate minds, and remove one more monopoly. Governments want monopolies on everything. This week it's fake news. Who knows what it will be next week. For that matter, a lot of what they'll try to shut down as \"fake news\" is real news, or parody, or humor. And Dot-Bip can help protect that too.\n\nCointelegraph: What do you think about practicality? Will it be easy enough to use Dot-Bip for the common man to care?\n\nMichael W. Dean: Yes, I think it could be that easy. In our first beta, it will be a little harder than accessing dot-coms, but more for the webmaster than the web user. But that will get easier too. I mean, Bitcoin wasn't easy to use at first. Hell, neither was the web when I first got on it in 95. But our first beta, which will use the existing BipCoin Blockchain, will still be much easier than NameCoin, for the webmaster, and especially for the web user, the end user.\n\nCointelegraph: Do you foresee any trouble from governments seeking to maintain the final word on what stays online?\n\nMichael W. Dean: I hope not. However, if any member of the Dot-Bip team is ever found dead of a drug overdose, a car crash or an apparent suicide, a government agency was behind it.\n\nCointelegraph: Bonus round: do you have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton?\n\nMichael W. Dean: No f..ing comment.",

  "latent_19620": "Posted Monday, October 22, 2012 11:08 am\n\nSunday October 21, 2012\n\nRICHMOND\n\nHave the Democrats gotten their mojo back? Did Joe Biden do his job as the exorcist? Did the president compensate for his laxness? Is Michelle Obama looking a bit rejuvenated? Election day will tell.\n\nBut the thing that has reverberated with me since the vice presidential debates is that a Democrat finally reacted on a national forum to the Republican claim that Mitt Romney did an outstanding job when he was governor of Massachusetts. Romney also has been clamoring that he left Massachusetts a big surplus for the future, made our schools No. 1 in the whole nation and cut taxes 19 times.\n\nRomney took over the governor's office in 2003 with ideas of Bainizing the legislature, which was 87 percent Democratic. He wanted to do the same for state schools of higher learning and sensibly convert the various transportation departments into one administrative body.\n\nHe was going to bring in new businesses to be run by thousands of new workers. During his administration, unemployment dropped less than one percentage point in four years.\n\nThe legislature agreed with him that the health and human services departments were redundant and his efforts were rewarded by saving something under $7 million a year. He announced plans to reform the civil service and the pension systems but the only major thing that came out of that was Romneycare, and in that he made a Democratic vision into a reality.\n\nOn the whole, Romney id not have the personal skills to persuade the Democratic majority to follow his leads. It was the same as what President Obama got from the Republican House. Despite Romney's exper ience and good manners, the legislature neither trusted nor liked him.\n\nRomney responded by vetoing bills at an inordinate rate, twice what Gov. Bill Weld had done before him. Some of them deserved to be vetoed as they were little more than veteran Democrats taking care of their buddies. One of his aides said many of the vetoes provided \"chuckles\" as they pondered how best to drop the bomb. There was one little hitch; the legislature kept overriding his vetoes.\n\nIn 2004, Romney had it up to here with Democrats and spent $3 million of Republican funds to back any willing GOP candidates for office. This annoyed the Democrats, who upped their own pressure.

As for the 19 tax cuts he brags about, many were one-day sales tax holidays.\n\nHis top booboos occurred in 2003 and 2004 when he deeply cut local aid, forcing towns to save where they could, especially on education funding.

Instead of raising taxes, he doubled down on fees for everything from licensing cosmetologists to programs for college students.

The liberal District of Columbia government had passed a ban on individual handgun possession, which even prohibited guns kept in one’s own house for self-defense. A three-judge panel struck down the ban, but Judge Garland wanted to reconsider that ruling. He voted with Judge David Tatel, one of the most liberal judges on that court. As Dave Kopel observed at the time , the “[t]he Tatel and Garland votes were no surprise, since they had earlier signaled their strong hostility to gun owner rights” in a previous case.

  "latent_19723": "ALMOST seven years ago, a letter arrived at the home of Bailey Rice inviting him to spend a day at Carlton as a part of its program for father-son prospects.\n\nHe went, met then-coach Brett Ratten, heard from captain Chris Judd and wondered what it would be like to stay there for longer and follow his dad Dean as an AFL player.\n\n\"That's when I started to realise what it all meant being a father-son, but I still didn't know much about it and how it worked,\" Rice said.\n\nRice, who is aiming to be picked at this year's NAB AFL Draft, had a bit to wrap his head around. Not only is he a father-son prospect, the speedy half-back is a rare case in that he has two clubs he is eligible to join under the rule: St Kilda and Carlton.\n\nDean played 116 games for the Saints before finishing his career with the Blues in 118 games, including the 1995 premiership win.\n\nBailey is a lifelong Carlton fan, but a year or two after that initial meeting with the Blues, St Kilda invited him to one of its meetings of future father-son prospects. Earlier this year he spent a week training with the Saints, and soon will begin to go to the club one morning a week to see how it runs.\n\nAlthough the Saints have shown more interest to this point, the 18-year-old knows he still needs to prove he is good enough before he gets to choose where he ends up.\n\n\"I try not to think about it too much. I try to play footy and do the best I can, do everything right and block it out for now,\" Rice said.\n\n\"Dad has spoken a little bit about his career but he keeps to himself, unless I ask him. He's told me to play footy the best you can, enjoy it, to use your strengths and try not to worry about other things.\"\n\nRice isn't the only father-son candidate at TAC Cup club the Dandenong Stingrays, with teammate Jake Lovett, an inside midfielder who goes forward, the son of former Melbourne flanker Brett.\n\nJake has already spent a week training with the Dees, who have given him a fitness program to follow.\n\nJosh Dunkley will create most interest of the father-sons: the Victorian will decide later in the year if he wants to join the Sydney Swans or enter an open draft. It could depend on what the bidding system looks like, and if the club has enough picks to fit him in with academy star Callum Mills if it's changed.\n\nTom Wallis knows his way around Essendon, where his dad Dean is a premiership player and former assistant coach, while Darcy MacPherson's rehabilitation from a shoulder reconstruction will be monitored by the Western Bulldogs, the club his father Steve represented in 188 games.\n\nThere are more players who fit as possible picks ups. Jordan Matera (the son of Peter) will be watched by West Coast throughout the year, while Carlton will also have its eyes on tall forward Jack Silvagni and speedy midfielder Jake Bradley (Craig's son).\n\nStephen Silvagni, who recently started as Carlton's list manager, has already said he will sit out of any discussions surrounding his son.\n\nThe Bombers could add to their rich history of Danihers with key position prospect Harvey Daniher (Chris' son), while developing tall Daniel Rendell, the son of Collingwood recruiter and former Fitzroy ruckman Matt Rendell, is in the Sandringham Dragons' squad and is eligible to join the Brisbane Lions.\n\nTyler Roos, another father-son for the Lions to watch, will also play for the Dragons again after being overlooked at last year's drafts.\n\nFor Rice, the season can't come soon enough. He started his summer with an average beep test and it jolted him into action, enjoying a strong pre-season to get ready for a role in the midfield and back line this year.\n\nThe Vic Country squad member is quick, can kick on both feet and marks well, and has even booted a bag of 10 goals at school level. He's ready for what the year holds.\n\n\"I'm a bit nervous and excited, but I'm looking forward to it,\" Rice said.",
  "latent_19825": "Last month, when the UFC visited Brooklyn, it made sure to set up a date for Khabib Nurmagomedov to visit Brighton Beach. Given the slush and cold and the assortment of papakha hats and tracksuits, it might as well have been Rostov-on-Don. His Russian faithful showed up to a little theater and enthusiastically asked questions of the Dagestani fighter — mostly about Conor McGregor, but a few regarding Tony Ferguson — which he answered in grumpy monotone.\n\nAnd for a brief moment, it all became clear: So this is what the fight world would be like if Nurmagomedov were to take it over. A gray February day with some pirozhki warming over a Sterno. If the UFC ever does make it to Russia, and brings Nurmagomedov as its champion, it’s going to be a lot of strange fun.\n\nNurmagomedov has a chance to make a big splash at UFC 209, when he fights Ferguson in what Ariel Helwani would call the “People’s Main Event.” This is the first really big platform for fans to effectively essentialize him, in the way that McGregor was essentialized through stops in Boston and Dublin. Honestly, it’s surprising it’s taken this long for Nurmagomedov’s “it factor” to come into focus. So many its.\n\nNurmagomedov is undefeated in the UFC, and undefeated in mixed martial arts, which are good things. He does ridiculous stuff in the cage, sporting and otherwise. There was the time he took Abel Trujillo down something like 17,000 times, becoming a performance art piece that was all about oppression (okay, it was 21 times…but still, 21 freaking times). Once he gets an opponent on the canvas, there’s really no telling. His ground and pound is unique in that it’s both vicious and chatty, as evidenced when he fought Michael Johnson at Madison Square Garden. In between a fierce right hand and an elbow, Nurmagomedov casually told Johnson as he was slipping into survival mode, “you have to give up…I have to fight for a title…you know this…I deserve it.”\n\nWe thought Ivan Drago was cold. Khabib is machine-beating-the-chess-masters cold.\n\nAnd here he is, some four months later, fighting for an interim title. We won’t call Nurmagomedov “Nostradamov” just yet, because he hasn’t ascended to those kind of “Mystic Mac” levels of psychic busywork, but if there’s a selling point for Nurmagomedov it’s that he’s preternaturally unsupernatural. Everything he does is purposeful, industrial, and comical. As in, there’s nothing fancy about smashing a face. But there is something uniquely heartwarming in hearing him talk about smashing a face. His humorlessness on topics like that are filled with mirth.\n\nSay what you want, but that’s a rare trait.\n\nShould Nurmagomedov beat Ferguson, in what is one of the most compelling fights on the calendar right now, the UFC will have itself another star. It’s unclear if Nurmagomedov can sell pay-per-views, but toppling “El Cucuy” in any kind of dramatic fashion, and getting on the microphone afterwards to ream McGregor as a chicken or absentee landlord (or whatever) would go a long way. Nurmagomedov has said that McGregor and Ireland are small fries next to him and Russia. When geography is part of a fighter’s corner, you’ve got the makings of something special.\n\nThe truth is, Khabib does have Russia. He has Siberia and the Road of Bones. He has Eastern Europe, and the people of the Caucasus.\n\nHere in the States, we are just beginning to really celebrate who Nurmagomedov is. Did you see the thing The Chive did, having him try and guess the plots of specific romantic comedies? For Love Actually he said, “I don’t like watch movie about love, too much movie make your heart weak.” That is Nurmagomedov in a nutshell. Step to him with Emma Thompson, and he becomes Ivan the Terrible. There’s a market for that.\n\nBottom line is this: The UFC needs stars. Khabib Nurmagomedov is poised to become just that. One of the more interesting things he said at Brighton Beach last month was that if the UFC ever gets to the point where it believes McGregor is getting too big for his britches, he’s a phone call away. That’s a refreshing way of looking at it. A company hit man? Who volunteers his services to humble stars? Who’d love to bring the pestle to nine-digit dreams and turn the prince back to pauper for the sake of restoring order?\n\nThat’s the kind of thing that will translate in the fight game, no matter which language you speak. Nurmagomedov has a chance to truly arrive on Saturday night, but — even if it took a minute to see it — he’s been that guy all along.",
  "latent_20000": "Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is a 2017 American computer-animated comedy film that is based on the children’s novel series that operates under the same name by Dav Pilkey. It was produced by DreamWorks Animation and Scholastic Entertainment, with animation production provided by Mikros Image Montreal. It was directed by David Soren from a screenplay that was written by Nicholas Stoller, and features the voices of Kevin Hart, Ed Helms, Thomas Middleditch, Nick Kroll, Jordan Peele, and Kristen Schaal. The plot follows two imaginative elementary school pranksters named George Beard and Harold Hutchins who hypnotize their mean-spirited principal, Mr. Krupp, into thinking that he is Captain Underpants, a superhero who fights crime while only wearing undersea and a cape who George and Harold write comic books about.\n\nOriginally making its premier on May 21, 2017 at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles, California, it was later released to the United States on June 2, 2017 in 3D and 2D. Overall, the film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $116 million worldwide against an operating budget of $37 million; making it the lowest-budgeted computer-animated feature of DreamWorks Animation’s history. This was the last DreamWorks Animation film that was distributed by 20th Century Fox, before Universal Pictures will take over distribution in 2019 with the release of How to Train Your Dragon 3.\n\nThe Film Itself (5/5):\n\nI was a little hesitant going into Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie because I’m very selective with my movies that are more directed toward children. However, after reading a lot of positive reviews about this film, I decided to pick it up to give it a shot. And after watching through it last night, I am beyond glad that I decided to grab this movie. While the story is geared more toward kids, there are bits that include subtle pieces of humor that are geared toward the adults that are watching this too. Not to mention, the occasional fart joke that would allow kids and adults to laugh together. The story itself is really nicely done and one that holds up very well as the movie progresses, and I have absolutely no regret about giving this movie its chance.\n\nPicture Quality (5/5):\n\nWhile Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is an animated feature film, the CGI itself is all done in 2K. But, the inclusion and use of HDR throughout the 4K UHD release does an absolutely great job at offering a beautiful presentation to viewers. The animation is beautifully done and the overall colorization of the film is so vivid that my wife and I were in complete awe as we watched through this.\n\nAudio Quality (5/5):\n\nPackaged with a Dolby Atmos audio track, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie offers an all out immersive experience for viewers. Making full and complete use of all of the available tracks, it does a great job at putting audiences right in the middle of the action. The elevation aspect of this release is notable as it does a great job at accentuating the experience. Some of the other nicer aspects of the audio track were the inclusion of the bass during some of the more intense sequences, as well as the songs musical accompaniment.\n\nThe Packaging (4/5):\n\nCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movie comes packaged in your standard two-disc 4K UHD amaray case. Within that case is the standard 4K UHD disc of the film as well as the standard Blu-ray copy of the film. Each of the discs do feature a different piece of artwork that is relative to the film and differs from the overall case art. There is also a digital copy redemption pamphlet that’s been included as well as a slipcover that’s been made available during the initial pressing of the release. The 4K UHD release also includes, while for a limited time, a Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie cape so the children at home can feel more immersed in the film and allow them to follow alongside Captain Underpants as he works to take down Dr. Poopypants.\n\nSpecial Features (4/5):\n\nI was surprised to see the amount of additional content that was made available with the 4K UHD release of Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. There is a decent amount of content that allows audiences to explore the film further as well as various elements of the movie itself. I do wish that there were more “behind the scenes” featurettes available because you can tell that the production crew put a lot of work into giving us a solid release like this. Included with this release is:\n\nThe Really Cool Adventures Of Captain Underpants Motion Comic\n\nThe Captain Underpants Guide To Being A Hero\n\nThe Professor Poopypants (Totally Original & Supercool) Guide To Being A Villain\n\nMissing Underpants: The Deleted Scenes Of Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie\n\nCaptain Underpants Lyric Video By “Weird Al” Yankovic\n\n“A Friend Like You” Lyric Video By Andy Grammer\n\nTighty-Whitey Q&A With The Stars – Part 1\n\nTighty-Whitey Q&A With The Stars – Part 2\n\nKevin Hart & Ed Helms Surprise Fans\n\nLunch Lady PSA With Kristen Schaal\n\nSock Puppets Real Stars\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nThe World Of DreamWorks Animation\n\nSneak Peek\n\nTechnical Specs:\n\nVideo\n\nCodec: HEVC / H.265\n\nResolution: 4K (2160p)\n\nHDR: HDR10\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\n\nOriginal Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\n\nAudio\n\nEnglish: Dolby Atmos\n\nEnglish: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit)\n\nFrench: Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nSpanish: Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nSubtitles\n\nEnglish SDH, French, Spanish\n\nRuntime\n\nOriginal Film: 89 minutes\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLike I said, I was really glad that I ultimately decided to give Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie its fair chance. While I wasn’t completely sure before grabbing it, I was really happy with the overall experience that the 4K UHD release provided. The story was great, the jokes were good, the film is an all-around great release. The overall audio and video presentation of this release were exceptionally stellar, and should be considered a feature piece for ones home entertainment system if they are fully equipped to make use of all of the available technologies. There’s a lot of additional content that’s been provided, however not too much of it really shows the behind-the-scenes work that went into the release from the production crew. If you’re on the fence about picking this movie up, I would absolutely hands down recommend that you grab this movie for your collection. Especially if you have kids and are unsure of whether or not they would enjoy this. Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is available now, so go get it!",

  "latent_20202": "Flickr/Therese Göterheim As the Eurozone flails about to keep its chin above the debt crisis that is drowning periphery countries, and as the European Union struggles to duct-tape itself together with more \"integration,\" Sweden is having second thoughts: never before has there been such hostility toward the euro.\n\nSweden is a special case. It joined the EU in 1995 after its people had graciously been allowed to express their will in a referendum in 1994—with 52.3% voting in favor.\n\nAs every country that joins the EU, Sweden signed an accession treaty that obligates it to adopt the euro, but without deadline. So in 2003, the government thought time had come to make the move. It asked the people in a non-binding referendum if they wanted to accede to the Eurozone. September 14 was the day.\n\nThe people rebelled. And demolished the euro, with 55.9% voting against it and 42% for it. They didn't want to trade in their beloved krona for the newfangled currency. They didn't want to give up sovereignty over their monetary policy.\n\nIt shook up eurocrats, member governments, finance ministers, and heads of state around the continent. And the European power structure learned a lesson: don't let the riffraff decide; it was the last time that people in the EU had been allowed to vote on the euro.\n\nBut in Sweden, the euro is on the table twice a year via a survey by the Swedish statistical agency that asks people how they'd vote if a referendum were held \"today\" on joining the euro. The results of the survey conducted in November just came out. Sobering results: 82.3% would vote against joining the euro, only 9.6% would vote for it, and 8% were betwixt and between. The euro's descent into utter unpopularity hell set a new record.\n\n(In an amusing aside of unknown unimportance, more women than men had trouble making up their minds with 10.2% of the women straddling the fence versus 5.8% of the men.)\n\nThere was a dramatic change of mind among those who in the May survey had voted to join the euro: 52% of them switched to no, 11% switched to undecided. Disillusionment is spreading even among the euro's erstwhile supporters. Only 37% stuck to their original yes-vote. Of the naysayers in May, however, 95% stuck to their no-votes.\n\nHistorically, the no-vote has dominated the yes-vote in Sweden. Since the survey series started in 1997, there were only three periods when the yes-crowd—if that's the right word—outnumbered the naysayers: a blip in 1999; from May 2001 through November 2002; and then another blip in 2009 during the financial crisis when the economy went into a horrific swoon. Perhaps they thought there was strength in numbers.\n\nBut in 2010, the economy rebounded vigorously. The budget deficit diminished and by 2012 nearly disappeared. Conversations about cutting taxes were heard in polite company. Meanwhile, in the Eurozone, the debt crisis, and its evil twin, austerity, were spreading far and wide. They mangled periphery countries, squashed GDP growth in other Eurozone countries, and started to gnaw even on Germany that had considered itself above the fray. Swedish opposition to the euro skyrocketed.\n\nAlas, Statistics Sweden also asked the people how they'd vote if a referendum were held \"today\" on remaining in the EU—the very issue voters had already decided by referendum in 1994.\n\nThe popularity of EU membership, after an initial rough patch, had been climbing for years and peaked, or rather plateaued, from late 2008 through 2011 with around 55% of the people voting for it. But the debt crisis with its non-solutions, its sacrifices by the lower levels of society, its convoluted undemocratic taxpayer-funded bailouts of bondholders and banks finally had an impact. The yes-votes fizzled. In the November survey, only 45% voted for membership and 26% voted against it. And it set a record: 29% couldn't decide.\n\nEU membership is becoming unpopular in Sweden. And the euro is despised. Not a good omen. And not only in Sweden. The ills of the euro have infected the larger community of countries and their cohesion. People have expressed their anger in massive protests. Now, the very efforts to keep the Eurozone together are tearing up the fabric of the EU: the first one out may be the UK. Read....

  "latent_20269": "A series of primary wins last week has reinvigorated Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, and he has new polls, donations, and endorsements to back it up.\n\nWith Wisconsin's primary on the horizon, Sanders on Monday welcomed the support of the state's former Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton, who said she had \"never before felt greater urgency in a political campaign.\"\n\n\"This election gives us the opportunity to rebuild America’s middle class and restore stability at the core of our democracy,\" Lawton said in her announcement. \"We must to realize both economic and national security, for all. That is why I endorse Bernie Sanders for president of the United States.\"\n\nSanders also got a boost from a new poll, out Tuesday, which shows the senator from Vermont closing the national gap with frontrunner Hillary Clinton. The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds that Clinton now leads Sanders by only six points, 49 to 43 percent, down by half from her 12-point lead in the same survey just last week.\n\nThe poll was conducted online from March 21-27 and surveyed 6,521 adults, including 5,741 who say they are registered voters.\n\nThe new support comes after Sanders won a string of West Coast primaries over the weekend, in Washington, Hawaii, and Alaska, following success in Utah and Idaho last week.\n\nOn Sunday, the senator's campaign manager Jeff Weaver called for Clinton to agree to a debate ahead of the April 19 primary in her home state of New York. Clinton rejected the demand, calling it a \"stunt\" by a \"struggling\" campaign.\n\nHowever, as The Intercept pointed out on Tuesday, Clinton in 2008 was \"taunting her opponent Barack Obama for not being tough enough 'to debate anytime, anywhere.'\"\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts\n\nThe Intercept's Zaid Jilani writes:\n\nIn late April 2008, Clinton called for a 90 minute, “Lincoln-Douglas”-style debate with Obama. This was after the Democratic candidates had faced each other in 26 debates — far outnumbering the eight debates that Sanders and Clinton have had this election season. “Honestly, I just believe that this is the most important job in the world, it’s the toughest job in the world, you should be willing to campaign for every vote, you should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere,” she told the the Sioux Falls Argus Leader a few weeks later, as she defended staying in the race.\n\nWatch below:\n\nAt the time, there were 130 pledged delegates still available between Clinton and Obama.

  "latent_20428": "Certain corners of the internet were abuzz this week when voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammill hinted at possible animated adaptations of two classic Batman storylines: Hush and A Death in the Family.\n\nIf you’re a comics-obsessed dork, you’ve already read A Death in the Family. If you aren’t, you should read it because it’s fucking incredible. The comic is an amazing artifact of Reagan-era conservative panic, a fevered nightmare where Robin is a moody Gen X street kid, Batman is aided by his friends in the CIA, and the Joker is dealing arms to Hezbollah. The only thing missing is a scheming Japanese business tycoon.\n\nBringing the whole thing together is an insane Mamma Mia! plot where Robin tries to discover the identity of his mother: Is it the Mossad agent Sharmin Rosen? The mercenary Shiva Woosan, who is training Arab terrorists? Or Sheila Haywood, the famine relief worker in Ethiopia?\n\nBatman, the story of an orphaned billionaire who fights crime in his hopelessly corrupt city using only his own intelligence and ingenuity, is an essential American myth. The way we tell and re-tell his stories reflects a lot about our culture.\n\nA Death in the Family is both an important piece of the Batman canon and an indispensable text for analyzing the Reagan era. In the story, Jason Todd – the second Robin – dies at the hands of the Joker shortly after Batman’s archnemesis crippled Batgirl Barbara Gordon. In real life, comic book readers voted by dialing a 1-900 number to kill the unpopular, Generation X Robin. Earlier in 1988, the year the arc began, writer Jim Starlin introduced the character KGBeast, a superpowered Soviet assassin.\n\nThis book not only uniquely captures the moral terror of late-80s conservatives, it illustrates the pathologies running through large parts of American culture at the time. In A Death in the Family Batman becomes an avatar of the moral superiority of American capitalism, using all the tools at his disposal to battle the legacy of liberalism gone mad, rampant moral perversion, and the threat of Shia Islam to Western hegemony in the Middle East, all of which are threatening to destroy the future, a generation of ungrateful, disaffected slackers.\n\nWhich is to say, there’s a whole lot to unpack here.\n\nThe book begins with Batman and Robin beating the hell out of a kiddie porn ring.\n\nRobin is an aggressive and broody teen, a street kid by the name of Jason Todd that Batman adopted when he found him stealing the hubcaps off of the Batmobile. He represents Generation X, a bunch of latchkey kids born in the late-70s recession that the era’s adults were simultaneously terrified of (think of the devil children of Carrie, The Omen, and Halloween) and terrified for (think of the moral panics around Satanic ritual abuse and Dungeons & Dragons). Note that in the opening scene, they’re fighting people who prey on children.\n\nRobin flies off the handle and uses excessive force, even by Batman’s standards, against the pornographers, and he takes him off duty. Robin is out walking in his old neighborhood when a woman hails him from an abandoned building and gives him a box of his father’s belongings. Robin is examining his birth certificate when…\n\nTWIST! It turns out that Catherine Todd isn’t his real mother. The smudged-out name on his certificate begins with an “S” and there’s only three names beginning with “S” in his father’s address book.\n\nAny plotline with mommy stuff is a big red flag telling you to look deeper. Here, Robin’s three possible mothers are competing fantasies about mother figures. Sharmin Rosen, the Mossad agent, represents the protector mother; Shiva Woosan, mercenary, is the dangerous, exotic mother of Oedipal lust; and Sheila Haywood, the famine relief worker, is the nurturer mother. A large part of this comic is the Reagan right figuring out which of these mother figures created this new wayward generation about which it feels so ambivalent.\n\nIt’s also hilarious that this is the exact plot of the ABBA jukebox musical Mamma Mia!.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joker has broken out of Arkham Asylum again and he’s headed for the Middle East with a stolen cruise missile armed with a nuclear warhead.\n\nBatman is on the case.\n\nLike America, his membership in an “internationally recognized organization” legitimizes his actions. But also like America, he isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, stepping outside the confines of international law and flexing the power afforded him as a capitalist of considerable means.\n\nObviously, if Batman is America, then the “internationally recognized” Justice League in this analogy is the UN. Like America, Batman takes advantage of the legitimacy the Justice League lends him without being too squeamish about actually obeying the conventions of international law. This is extremely good.\n\nBatman makes a deal with his friend at the CIA, an operator named Ralph Bundy who has no issue dealing with a mentally ill vigilante in a bat costume: He will take out a group of “Shi’ite extremists” who have captured a Navy C-130 if he can first examine the plane. These extremists are clearly Hezbollah, because it’s the 80s and Hezbollah and Iran (who we’ll get to later) are the main Middle Eastern bad guys.\n\nUnbeknownst to Batman, Robin has also flown to Beirut in pursuit of Possible Mommy #1: Mossad Agent Sharmin Rosen. Telling his cabby (in Farsi, because everyone in Lebanon speaks Farsi in this comic) to take him to “the worst section of this city, a place where criminals gather,” he finds a Beirut “in turmoil…torn apart by armed polarized factions, each trying to seize control.”\n\n“Seems everyone’s either armed or crippled by the war. You can feel the tension in the streets,” he observes. “This is not a place for an American.”\n\nThat everyone in Lebanon speaks Farsi in this comic speaks to a larger theme at work here where all Shi’ite Muslims are basically interchangeable and are also all pretty much evil. The baddies that have the Navy plane are referred to simply as “Shiite extremists.” Later, Lady Shiva is training another group of terrorists are also referred to only as “Shiites.” In three different times in the story arc, Starlin makes a joke of an American referring to a Middle Eastern person as “Abdul,” not caring what their actual name is.\n\nBatman and Robin bump into each other on the street in Beirut, they realize the people they’re tracking (Rosen and an arms dealer named Peter Brando) are at the same hotel and in fact, Rosen seems to be working Brando. They track Rosen and Brando to the Israeli border where Brando and Rupert, the Joker’s fedora-wearing henchman, are brokering the deal between the Joker and the terrorists.\n\nBatman and Robin spring into action to stop the terrorists and the Americans that brokered the deal, who have pointed the nuke at Tel Aviv.\n\nDespite the help of “Sharmin Rosen, Israeli agent” in beating up the terrorists, Rupert and the main terrorist try to launch the missile, but it blows up on pad. The main terrorist guy is killed, but Rupert is thrown to safety. Sharmin tells Batman and Robin that she had never had any children in Gotham City. Satisfied, they give her a ride back to Beirut on their hang gliders.\n\nSoon, Batman and Robin find themselves in the Beqaa Valley, “the very heartland of Shiite terrorist activity.” Possible Mommy #2, Shiva Woosan, the mercenary also known as Lady Shiva, appears to have been kidnapped; however, after they beat the hell out of all the terrorists, it turns out that she has actually been hired to train them.\n\nAfter defeating Lady Shiva in hand-to-hand combat, Batman and Robin bring the Arabs a safe distance away and set off all the explosives in the camp, “enough to level a major city.”\n\nThey drug and interrogate Lady Shiva to find out whether she had any babies. Under the effects of Batman’s sodium pentothal, she reveals that she has not. After the drug wears off, Batman sets he free. Because this is the uncivilized Levant, there are no authorities to bring her to.\n\n“Unfortunately, training terrorists is not against the law in this country,” Batman tells her. “You’re free to go.\n\nMeanwhile, way ahead of Batman and and Robin, the Joker has already found Possible Mommy #3 in Ethiopia. You see, after Batman foiled his nuke sale, Joker needs money. And despite his ability to walk away with millions of dollars worth of US military machinery, he’s decided on a scheme to blackmail Sheila Haywood, an American doctor distributing medical supplies in famine-stricken Ethiopia.\n\nIt turns out that Haywood, Robin’s real mother, isn’t the ideal, nurturing mommy figure the wayward Boy Wonder needs. She is actually an on-the-lam, baby-murdering “operationist” (Starlin and/or his publishers at DC can never bring themselves to use the word “abortion,” leading to numerous awkward references to Haywood’s illegal and sloppy “operations”) who would rather help steal medical supplies from starving Africans than face justice for her crimes.\n\nHaywood represents the perverse morality of liberalism run amok. Behind the veneer of the loving nurturer who is out to care for the needy is a self-obsessed interior twisted to the point of infanticide. Birth control, drugs, women in the workplace multiculturalism: these are the evils that created this generation of aimless brooders.\n\nThe Joker also represents liberalism run amok, with an emphasis on the amok part. He cares most about making the world mad like him and he lacks any moral or spiritual compass to guide him. Money to him is merely a means to an end and, of course, he blames his personal financial hardship on President Reagan.\n\nBatman and Robin show up in Ethiopia shortly thereafter and are made incredibly sad by the starvation. Bruce Wayne is so moved by what he sees that he resolves to do the only thing in his power as a billionaire superhero to help the starving Africans: write them a check and forget about them.\n\nSoon they find Dr. Haywood who is stunned to be confronted by the child she abandoned in order to flee from justice. After a brief reunion, she shunts them aside to meet with the Joker, who, with Haywood’s help, is stealing medical supplies and replacing them with his deadly laughing gas.\n\nBatman takes off after the supply convoy in his mini-copter, leaving Robin to watch the warehouse where Haywood and the Joker are. Being a disaffected Gen X teen with a death wish, Robin rushes in to rescue his mother, revealing his secret identity in the process. Haywood, already established as a baby-killer who would abandon her own child to protect herself, promptly turns him over to the Joker.\n\nHaywood is such a bad mother that she’ll even kill the starving Ethiopians she’s supposed to be helping by embezzling money from crucial aid efforts. She’d rather her only child die than be caught for her crimes.\n\nBatman stops the convoy, unloads the crates of chemical weapons, and leaves them “for the army to deal with.” This is presumably the army of Mengitstu Haile Miram, the Ethiopian president later convicted of genocide. He commandeers an empty truck and drives back to the warehouse, where the Joker has been beaten Robin nearly to death with a crowbar and tied him and Haywood up with a bomb.\n\nDespite the sudden appearance of Haywood’s maternal instincts, just as Batman pulls up, the bomb explodes, killing her and her son.\n\nThe Joker is selling the stolen medical supplies to whomever his buyer is (it’s not really clear), when he is approached by members of the Iranian secret service who want to discuss a business proposition. They bring him in to meet one of the ultimate 1980s bad guys: Ayatollah Khomeini himself!\n\nThe Ayatollah, whose sole ideology, like all Shi’ites in this comic, is wanton evil, names the Joker as Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBatman sees what this means right away. Joker will now be able to commit any crime he wants free from repercussion, even from Batman, who, despite being a criminal vigilante himself, is bound to respect diplomatic immunity, lest Iran come after American diplomats.\n\nEven though he doesn’t want to play along, Superman and CIA Agent Ralph Bundy, representing the spineless bureaucrats whose slavish adherence to the rules allows evil to triumph, tell Batman that the Joker is off-limits and that President Reagan has brought in Superman to ensure compliance.\n\nThanks to Bruce Wayne’s status as a billionaire, Batman is able to gain access to the UN General Assembly despite his alter ego’s “reputation as a playboy dilettante.” In his address, the Joker (wearing the ghutra and agal more associated with Iran’s nemesis Saudi Arabia, but as with the Farsi-speaking Lebanese, Muslim-y stuff is pretty interchangeable for Starlin) lays out the reasoning behind the Ayatollah appointing a mass murderer and international crook as UN ambassador.\n\nBecause he’s the Joker, he then sprays the room with his signature Joker Gas from a tank concealed beneath his Middle Eastern robe.\n\nLuckily, Superman has also s nuck in. Disguised as a security guard, he inhales all the gas, saving the UN delegates from laughing themselves to death. The Joker then detonates a bomb he’d had planted in the assembly hall and pulls out a gun and starts firing. Several delegates are killed as the Joker makes his escape to the roof. Batman follows Joker into his escape chopper, which is downed by the erratic shooting of a henchman.\n\nLike American conservatives facing the beginning of Reagan’s second term and the impending 1990s, Batman ends the book facing an uncertain future.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_20552": "The film was adapted from a script titled The Girl Who Wouldn't Die , [2] and was originally conceived as a thriller with no association with American Psycho . It was not until production began that the film's script was altered with the incorporation of the Patrick Bateman subplot. [3]\n\nThe film starts with a 12-year-old girl whose babysitter is on a date with serial killer Patrick Bateman. After Bateman kills and starts to dissect her babysitter, the girl stabs him with an ice pick. Fast forward to the present day and the girl, who is named Rachael Newman, is now a college student studying criminology under Professor Starkman, a former FBI agent. Rachael aspires to join the FBI and is determined to get the teaching assistant position under Starkman, which would make her a shoo-in for the FBI training program.\n\nTough competition for the position stands in her way, and Rachael proceeds to kill off classmates one by one. During her killing spree, she decides to see the school psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Daniels. Realizing that Rachael is a textbook sociopath, Daniels tries to warn Starkman, who mistakenly thinks the psycho student is Cassandra Blaire, with whom he had an extramarital affair. When Cassandra reveals that her affair with Professor Starkman has guaranteed her the TA position, Rachael decides to murder her as well. After she does so, Professor Starkman discovers Cassandra's body and calls Daniels to tell him that \"she's dead\". But he does not identify the victim, and Daniels assumes it must be Rachael. Distraught, Professor Starkman leaves his teaching position, which angers the obsessed Rachael. She reveals that she is not Rachael Newman; she killed the real Rachael at the beginning of the semester and assumed her identity.\n\nDuring spring break, Rachael stays on campus and locates an intoxicated Starkman, impaired by the effects of Valium and alcohol, and tries to seduce him to get the job. However, Starkman sees she is wearing a dress and necklace he had given to Cassandra. She then confesses her crimes to him, her \"crush\" on him, and that she knew about his affairs with various women (which included her former babysitter, whom he indirectly killed, since he had told her about Bateman and she decided to track him down), as he backs up towards the window in a state of confusion and fear. Rachael blows him a kiss, and he falls out the window to his death. As she leaves, Rachael realizes a janitor has witnessed Starkman's death, and she murders the janitor, too. Driving away from campus with Starkman in her car, Rachael is stopped by campus security, whom she stabs to death with an ice pick.\n\nAs the film reaches its conclusion, Daniels and two cops pursue Rachael in a car chase, started when she sped by the cops who had Daniels in the car. It ends with Rachael driving off a cliff, resulting in the car exploding. At this point, she is presumed to be dead by the cops who witnessed the event and the media.\n\nTwo years later, Dr. Daniels is giving a lecture on Rachael's mind and how he wrote a book about her. When he looks up from speaking with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman's last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes there is no point in committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and she is confident he will not divulge this information because it would make a farce of his best-selling book in which he proclaimed to completely understand her and witnessed her death in the fiery car. The body that was in the car was the real Rachael, whose decaying body had been kept in the killer's dorm closet. It was revealed by another student that she is the youngest agent to be drafted to the Bureau in her sophomore year. As Rachel walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is visibly shaken by what he had just learned.",
  "latent_20557": "Jared Kushner and President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, his wife, walk down the West Wing Colonnade on Feb. 10 in Washington. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe family of Jared Kushner is apparently ignoring any conflict-of-interest concerns and is publicly trying to get overseas money for U.S. projects, raising questions about the way President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser could profit from his government post. On Saturday, Kushner’s sister Nicole Meyer tried to convince more than 100 Chinese investors to invest in a Jersey City housing development.\n\nTo woo investors, Meyer touted what is known as an investor visa. The EB-5 program gives a path to citizenship to anyone who invests at least $500,000 in an American development project. An ad for the event held at the Ritz-Carlton laid it out explicitly: “Invest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States.”\n\nIn a Beijing ballroom Kushner family charges $500,000 for entry into the USA with ‘investor visa’ to wealthy Chinese https://t.co/YOhNM4UMqT pic.twitter.com/9MwUvWRMZO — JoeFaz™® VetsResistSquadron (@joefaz) May 6, 2017\n\nBoth the Trump Organization and Kushner’s family business have used the controversial visa program to attract investors before, but now the president has vowed to tighten the border—and that is being used as a selling point. “Invest early, and you will invest under the old rules,” one speaker said at the event.\n\nAlthough the event in Beijing was publicly advertised, New York Times and Washington Post journalists were kicked out of the event. “At one point, organizers grabbed a reporter’s phone and backpack to try to force that person to leave,” notes the Washington Post. “Later, as investors started leaving the ballroom, organizers physically surrounded attendees to stop them from giving interviews.”",

  "latent_20590": "NATO forces led by the U.S. completed their combat mission in Afghanistan on December 31, 2014 as planned. The new role for the U.S. will involve support and training within the framework of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Realizing the significance of BSA for his government, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was quick to ink the BSA and SOFA, doing so on his second day in office.\n\nLast year was both a difficult and eventful one for Afghanistan. Successful security and political transitions were the major developments. The country had started receiving economic shocks well before 2014, partly because of the uncertainty surrounding the political dynamics and partly due to the very real impacts of the dwindling financial resources resulting from the drawdown of international forces. According to the World Bank annual GDP growth dropped from around 12 percent in 2012 to around 3 percent in 2013, remaining at about that level in 2014. With a new government in place, and a recently announced cabinet set to be endorsed by the Parliament, there is a growing sense of optimism that the economy will gradually improve.\n\nUnemployment across the country has been held down by the large number of Afghans engaged in international aid operations. With foreign troops and aid workers leaving the country, an economic impact in inevitable. Yet the repercussions of the NATO pull-out are not all negative. It also means Afghan ownership of the development process and a first step towards efforts for self-reliance, provided that the new National Unity Government is able to fulfill expectations.\n\nFor the past 12 years, Afghan economy has been virtually dependent on foreign aid. According to the Ministry of Finance, almost 100 percent of its development budget and 45 percent of its operating budget is externally financed, with the U.S. being our major donor. National revenues struggle to fund even a small share of the national budget. Since 2002, with the new government in power after the collapse of the Taliban, the Afghan economy enjoyed reasonably steady growth. GDP increased from $3 billion in 2002 to $20 billion in 2012. In the absence of a viable economic base, however, there are no grounds for concluding that the reported economic growth was sustainable. With an unstable political environment and deteriorating security, the government never managed to build viable institutions that could have paved the way for sustainable economic growth by tapping the country’s vast natural resources.\n\nAfghanistan also struggled to attract any notable domestic and foreign investment, hamstrung by political uncertainties, excessive bureaucratic procedures, the lack of an adequate legal and regulatory framework, and systemic corruption within the government machinery. The associated risks prevented potential national and international investors from becoming involved in major business ventures. The construction industry was the only sector where significant growth was witnessed, mainly because of the availability of generous foreign funding for infrastructure development where the business community could receive quick and highly profitable returns. In fact, construction thrived, with thousands of construction firms issued licenses by the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA). The Agency encouraged construction investors with simple registration procedures. But in the absence of strong institutional and enforcement framework, the government was unable to collect taxes from an industry that otherwise could have contributed significantly to national revenues. Construction has been rife with tax evasion, mainly because of rampant corruption and the powerful political players with a stake in the industry.\n\nIn sharp contrast to construction, the manufacturing and service sectors have seen negligible growth due to a lack of infrastructure and energy supply, insufficient institutional capacity, not enough support from the government, and longer payback periods with associated risks. Agriculture development is another unhappy story. In the absence of any strategic and integrated approach towards developing the farm sector, most foreign assistance ended up financing micro level projects, building capacity, or paying international consultants to produce reports as bulky as they were unnecessary.\n\nA substantial portion of the aid money that flowed into Afghanistan over the past decade ended up in private hands, in the form of bribes, kickbacks and embezzlements. That money now appears in the form of high-rise buildings, huge foreign bank balances, and lucrative private businesses owned by the few, both within the country and abroad. It is true that ordinary Afghans have benefited from billions of dollars of international assistance during the past decade. But since the foreign aid has not created sustainable economic growth in the country, the departure of the international community is a major blow to ordinary Afghans, given unemployment and the economic implications.\n\nAs a key advisor to Ghani when he was chairman of the security transition commission, I am well aware of the overall framework of the transition process. From the very beginning, it was envisaged that the security transition must promote development, the rule of law, and good governance – considered to be three pillars of transition. Yet the civilian aspects of the transition received little attention from the ISAF and Afghan government as security overshadowed the entire process. It is noteworthy, though, that Ghani was unhappy at the Afghan government’s performance and its lack of proper attention the reforms that could have helped improve the security environment by increasing government credibility.\n\nNow that the international community in general and NATO countries in particular are entering into new partnerships with Afghanistan, it is time to redefine the relationship in more credible terms based on realistic benchmarks and results-based indicators. The next decade following NATO’s completion of its combat mission and the peaceful transfer of power in Afghanistan has long been termed the decade of transformation. This decade can only bring transformation if genuine efforts are made. It is now up to the national unity government to fulfill expectations and achieve that vision.\n\nIn spite of all the challenges, Afghanistan commands a strategic location as gateway to Central Asia as well as a land bridge between Central and South Asia. As such, the country offers enormous opportunities for both national and international investors in sectors ranging from natural resources and infrastructure development to the service industry and tourism. Preliminary investigations suggest Afghanistan has mineral resources worth around $3 trillion. Yet without sustainable security, strong economic and political institutions, and international technical support, the mineral wealth cannot be utilized and will remain a cause of international rivalry rather than a source of economic growth and prosperity.\n\nAjmal Shams is President of the Afghanistan Social Democratic Party, or Afghan Millat National Progressive Party, and is based in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was Director of Planning and Policy at the Ministry of Urban Development. He served as Policy Advisor to President Ashraf Ghani when the latter chaired the security transition commission.

  "latent_20673": "A groundbreaking report on classified FBI documents reveal the federal agency has quietly investigated U.S. law enforcement links to white supremacy and racism in America. The documents published Tuesday by The Intercept show President Donald Trump \"has inherited a vast domestic intelligence agency with extraordinary secret powers\" – as well as one of the world’s most expansive law enforcement systems in which racism seems to be a severe and prevalent issue.\n\nInternal intelligence assessments indicate concern within the FBI over white supremacist groups actively participating in infiltrating local and federal law enforcement to \"covertly advance white supremacist causes.\" The news follows Senate confirmation hearings for Trump’s pick for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a lifelong conservative who failed to become a federal judge in 1986 after a Senate Judiciary Committee found him to be too racist to preside over court cases, and whose lifelong colleagues can’t seem to agree on whether he would defend the rights of all Americans, according to several interviews conducted with International Business Times.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nSessions would serve as Trump’s top advisor on law enforcement throughout the country. Meanwhile, the FBI documents noted \"domestic terrorism investigations focused on militia extremists, white supremacist extremists, and sovereign citizen extremists often have identified active links to law enforcement officers.\"\n\nFBI documents also revealed \"lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States,\" according to a 2009 study quietly conducted out of the public eye by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSessions' nomination appears to be an easy victory from Trump’s administration, with just enough Republicans to officially appoint him as the next attorney general without a single Democratic vote. Trump fired Monday acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she declined to defend the president’s controversial travel ban from seven Muslim-majority nations, which many activists and Democrats have noted appears to be in direct violation of constitutional rights.\n\nThe White House said Yates was relieved for \"refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\" What impact Sessions' upcoming attorney general nomination could have on reforming the criminal justice system or local law enforcement practices nationwide remains to be seen.\n\nRead The Intercept's full report on white supremacy in U.S. law enforcement here.",
  "latent_20720": "It’s been a rough week for the legacy of the Obama administration. Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee launched a Democrat-endorsed probe into former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s conduct during the campaign – when it’s widely believed she colluded with the Clinton’s to “soften” the FBI’s probe into Hillary’s mishandling of classified information. Earlier, sure-thing Democratic neophyte Jon Ossoff lost a special election in Georgia that he was supposedly guaranteed to win, leading America’s least—preferred party of overly brazen corporatists to an embarrassing 5-0 defeat, and stoking calls for Nancy Pelosi - the Dem’s longtime leader in Congress - to step aside.\n\nAnd as if all that wasn’t enough, revelations that Russian hackers targeted voting systems in 21 states – and the Obama administration did nothing about it – have inspired the president’s fellow Democrats to turn on their once-revered leader.\n\nAs the Hill reports, Democrats are criticizing no-drama Obama for being too cautious with his disclosures about “the Russia problem” in the run-up to the 2016 election, claiming that he shouldn't have hesitated to inform the public about the allegations:\n\n“The Obama administration is under fresh scrutiny for its response to Russian meddling in the election after new details emerged this week about how the White House weighed its actions against the 2016 political environment. Then-President Obama was too cautious in the months leading up to the election, frustrated Democratic lawmakers and strategists say. “It was inadequate. I think they could have done a better job informing the American people of the extent of the attack,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee who co-chairs the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan, who recently challenged Pelosi for leadership of the party, is leading a small group of Congressional Dems in criticizing Chuck Schumer, Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership's irrational focus on the Russia investigations. Ryan believes the focus on making the Dems appear out of touch to working Americans who care more about economic issues than the Trump witch hunt, as the Hill reports. Ryan's attempt to lead from behind comes as some of his peers push for the creation of a 9/11-style Commission to launch what would be the fourth investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nEven though the contradiction here is obvious - Dems are complaining that the party is too focused on Russia, while criticizing Obama for not releasing more scurrilous details about alleged interference -at least Ryan recognizes that the focus on Russia will hurt the Dems where it counts: In next year's midterms.\n\n\"We can't just talk about Russia because people back in Ohio aren't really talking that much about Russia, about Putin, about Michael Flynn,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) told MSNBC Thursday. “They're trying to figure out how they're going to make the mortgage payment, how they're going to pay for their kids to go to college, what their energy bill looks like. “And if we don't talk more about their interest than we do about how we're so angry with Donald Trump and everything that's going on,” he added, “then we're never going to be able to win elections.”\n\nTurning back to Obama, the president's motives in withholding the information definitely leave room for speculation. Was he worried that the public would interpret the disclosure as transparent fearmongering intended to benefit the Clinton campaign – or maybe he thought it would make the Democrats and Clinton look ineffectual in the face of a problem that couldn’t be solved with a couple of well-timed drone strikes? For what it's worth, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says Obama withheld the information because he didn’t want to play into Trump’s claims that the election was being “rigged.”\n\n\"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Wednesday told lawmakers that the White House held back on responding to Russia because it didn’t want to play into fears, propagated by then-candidate Trump, that the election would be “rigged.” “One of the candidates, as you'll recall, was predicting that the election was going to be rigged in some way,” Johnson said. “And so we were concerned that, by making the statement, we might in and of itself be challenging the integrity of the election process itself.” Trump had repeatedly claimed that the outcome of the election would be “rigged” against him, alleging widespread voter fraud and inaccurate polling. He provided no evidence to back up his claims, but critics feared that his rhetoric could undermine public trust in the outcome of the election.\n\nIn any event, Obama’s decision to withhold the information has made the Dems look weak, desperate and disorganized. And now they’re rightfully worried that the administration’s countermeasures – kicking out a few dozen diplomats – have helped them lose what little credibility they still had in the eyes of the public. Meanwhile, President Trump has a few questions of his own;\n\n'Some Republicans argue the Obama administration only started to take the Russia threat seriously after President Trump had won the election. Trump has called the influence operation a “hoax” and dismissed the various inquiries into Russian interference in the election — which include looking for possible collusion between his campaign and Moscow — as a “witch hunt.” “By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?” Trump tweeted Thursday.\n\nThe Obama administration announced on Oct. 7 that the theft and release of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails was part of a widespread campaign “intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.”\n\nSo what’s next for the Dems? Obama, who has already pivoted from politician to social-media celebrity, will probably continue to chime in every now and then from the peanut gallery. Meanwhile, we wait to see if the DOJ or any other interested parties piggy-back on the Senate’s investigation into Lynch’s blatant attempt at obstruction, and wonder: Could this be the controversy that leads to the unraveling of the modern Democratic Party?\n\nOf course, President Trump couldn't resist taking a shot at his predecessor on Twitter:\n\nJust out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2017\n\nBy the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017",

(TSX:ACB) (\"Aurora\"), and Aurora's investment in Hempco Food and Fiber, Radient's accelerated entry into this valuable market segment is possible.\n\n\"Within the Proposals we see validation of Radient's business model, its partnership with Aurora, and the potential to be a clear leader in a high-value segment of the cannabis supply chain, domestically and internationally,\" said Mike Cabigon, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Radient. \"Moreover, we are proud to be a participant in Canada's cannabis landscape, which is rapidly progressing as an example to the world in terms of governance, growth, and the elimination of the black market.\"\n\nAbout Radient\n\nRadient extracts natural compounds from a range of biological materials using its proprietary \"MAP™\" natural product extraction technology platform which provides superior customer outcomes in terms of ingredient purity, yield, and cost. From its initial 20,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Edmonton, Alberta, Radient serves market leaders in industries that include pharmaceutical, food, beverage, natural health, personal care and biofuel markets.

  "latent_21252": "Turkey, Israel reach deal to normalize ties: Israeli official\n\nANKARA\n\nIsrael and Turkey have reached an agreement to normalize relations after six years of strained ties a senior Israeli official told reporters, according to Reuters.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım is expected to announce the deal on June 27 at 1.00 p.m., private broadcaster CNN Türk has reported.Israeli and Turkish teams met in Rome on June 26 amid reports suggesting that the two countries’ delegations were close to putting the final touches on a deal that will be announced shortly.The Israeli delegation, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s special envoy, Joseph Ciechanover, and the Turkish delegation led by Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, also a former ambassador to Israel, met in Rome on June 26, Büşra Arslantaş of CNN Türk reported.Turkish-Israeli relations were suspended in 2010 after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stormed the Mavi Marmara, part of the Gaza-bound “Gaza Freedom Flotilla,” which was trying to break the Israeli blockade on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Ten Turkish activists were killed in the raid.Following the six-year rupture in ties, the two erstwhile allies are expected to put their signatures on an agreement in July, CNN Türk added.Turkey has demanded Israel fulfill three conditions prior to any normalization in ties, namely, an apology for the Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, compensation to the families of the deceased and an end to the embargo on Gaza.In March 2013, through U.S. President Barack Obama’s mediation, Netanyahu called the then-prime minister, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and apologized for Israeli “operational mistakes” that resulted in the loss of Turkish lives aboard the ship leading the 2010 flotilla. However, Israel refuses to apologize for the act of stopping the ship, which it regards as a legitimate act of self-defense.Israel, which is known to have agreed to pay compensation to the families of the victims, is not expected to lift the blockade, but ease it.An eventual deal is not expected to have any provision regarding Hamas as signaled by recent remarks by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, as well as a recent visit by Hamas’ exiled political chief, Khaled Mashaal.Erdoğan met Mashaal in Istanbul on June 24, state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Erdoğan and Mashaal discussed how to resolve the disagreements among Palestinians as well as Turkish humanitarian assistance, the report said, citing an unnamed source from Erdoğan’s office.Last week, Çavuşoğlu made clear that any deal between Turkey and Israel to normalize their strained relations depended on action taken by Tel Aviv, adding that Turkey’s relationship with Hamas in Gaza could not be a subject for the talks.“Whether a balance is to be struck or not in the first next meeting – this depends on the steps that Israel will take. Our conditions are extremely plain, these [conditions] need to be fulfilled, like how our demand for an apology was fulfilled,” Çavuşoğlu said June 22 at a press conference in Ankara.On June 26, Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the declaration expected June 26 was made possible following understandings the sides reached 10 days ago about Hamas activities in Turkey. Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, who went on a secret visit to Turkey, agreed with National Intelligence Organization (MİT) Undersecretary Hakan Fidan on the framework of the deal.Accordingly, Turkey will not enable Hamas to conduct, plan or direct any military activity against Israel. However, Hamas offices may continue to operate in Turkey for the purpose of diplomatic activity, Haaretz said, without citing any source.Turkish Foreign Ministry officials, approached by the Hürriyet Daily News concerning the report by Haaretz, declined to comment.The Jerusalem Post reported claims by Hamas which said Turkey had renounced the condition that Israel lift the siege on Gaza as part of its prerequisites for reconciliation.The daily quoted unnamed Hamas officials as saying in a conversation with the London-based Arab newspaper Rai al-Youm: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced to Hamas’ leadership that he has done everything possible to lift the siege or ameliorate it, but the Israeli government stubbornly rejected his attempts.”“Erdoğan told the leadership that he must make progress on the normalization deal with Israel in order to serve Turkey’s interests,” the same official in Hamas was quoted as saying.The unnamed Hamas officials said “they expect Turkey to take strong measures against senior Hamas officials residing in Turkey, mainly by limiting their freedom of movement within the state, to meet Israel’s condition for normalization.”“Saying that Turkey has given up one of its two remaining conditions, which is lifting the embargo and blockade on Gaza, would mean humiliating the people’s intelligence. If Turkey had given up these [conditions], then relations would have been normalized by now,” said Çavuşoğlu.An eventual deal would pave the way for multibillion-dollar natural gas contracts as Israel seeks to export fuel from its largest field and Turkey looks to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. However, the deal is not expected to outline such a particularity because the development of natural gas reserves require legal arrangements to be adopted by the Knesset – something that is likely to take three or four years.",

camera by hitting custom key 4 (also has to be assigned)\n\n* Smartphone (needed to receive cam broadcast)\n\n* MobilePhone (no function yet)\n\n* Canteen (double click to drink or refill with water at water sources and sea water)\n\n* PlasticBottle (same as above)\n\n* Waterpurificationtablets (double click to purify dirty water in canteen or plasticbottle)\n\n* Franta Soda (doubleclick to drink

be cooked whenever pointing at a source of fire which is closer than 2m\n\nModule Usage:\n\nYou find three new modules within the MISC module folder in the game editor\n\na. \"rickb_a3items\" (only needed once on the map / position doesnÂ´t matter )\n\n=> activates survival simulation (hunger & thirst) + simple jump script activation\n\nb. \"rickb_lootspawn\" (place one for every loot area / position marks center of loot area)\n\n=> activates lootspawn (4 categories civ/mil/industrial/civ guns) in the area (distance, kind of loot, chance of loot can be customized by clicking the module)\n\n=> play around with the loot probability -> default is 7% which means: there is a 7% chance on each house position within the area you defined for that module\n\n=> loot despawns when no player is around\n\n=> not every kind of loot will spawn in every building\n\nc. \"rickb_customloot\" (only needed once on the map / position doesnÂ´t matter)\n\n=> lets you define custom loot tables for each loot category => put your own items classnames in between the brackets like this: [\"rb_handycam\",\"rb_smartphone\"]\n\n-> smartphone and handycam will be the only loot spawned in this category\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- Does not work in multiplayer (yet).\n\n- Ambient rabbits can not be gutted, mod spawned rabbits can (to not waste ammo, only shoot rabbits in hunting areas).\n\nFuture

It is important that we get something special out of this season because we deserve it but that will happen only if we work hard in these last few games.”\n\nSpurs are close to securing a place in the top four, which should guarantee them a spot in next season’s Champions League. The top three in the Premier League will go straight into the group stages, with the fourth-placed side contesting a two-leg play-off.\n\nThe side finishing fourth could miss out if Manchester City and Liverpool win the Champions League and Europa League respectively. Mauricio Pochettino’s team are 12 points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who have a game in hand.\n\nTottenham vs Manchester United Player Ratings 23 show all Tottenham vs Manchester United Player Ratings 1/23 Player Ratings Who stood out at White Hart Lane? 2/23 Hugo Lloris: 6 Little more than a spectator in the first half, Lloris was not forced to make a significant save until the hour mark but did not kick particularly well. 3/23 Kyle Walker: 6 The Spurs full-back was often pinned back by Anthony Martial but did threaten whenever he managed to get into the final third. 4/23 Jan Vertonghen: 7 There was no sign of cobwebs from the Belgian, despite a nine-game absence, as he produced a typically solid display. 5/23 Toby Alderweireld: 7 As reliable and composed as ever, the Belgian got the goal he deserved too. The centre back's performances will only improve further now his defensive partner has returned to action. 6/23 Danny Rose: 8 His influence at Spurs continues to grow. Exhibited a superb range of passing and made sure Juan Mata was often heading back towards his own goal. Notched an assist for Lamela's strike. 7/23 Eric Dier: 6 The midfielder shielded the Spurs defence well, sitting deep and snuffing out any danger. Crucially, he avoided a 10th booking and the slate will now be wiped clean. 8/23 Mousa Dembele: 6 While the majority of Tottenham's players struggled for composure early on, Dembele was not among their number. Calm and composed presence in the centre of the pitch. 9/23 Erik Lamela: 7 The Argentine's afternoon threatened to be defined by a poor header but he made amends with an assist for Alderweireld and a fine finish of his own. 10/23 Dele Alli: 7 A relatively quiet afternoon from the teenager and was visibly frustrated before he swept home the opening goal, which lifted the mood among a delighted White Hart Lane crowd. 11/23 Christian Eriksen: 7 The Danish midfielder found his rhythm quickly and was not afraid to let fly from long range. Produced dangerous set-piece deliveries throughout and showed great vision to pick out Alli for the opener. 12/23 Harry Kane: 7 Starved of opportunities but worked tirelessly and forced David De Gea into a couple of smart saves. Relished his aerial battle with Chris Smalling. 13/23 David De Gea: 6 Denied Kane from point blank range and was not to know the lineman's flag had been raised. Could do little about any of the goals he conceded. 14/23 Timothy Fosu-Mensah: 6 Pushed forward at every opportunity and looks be a real prospect for the Red Devils. Could yet move into an advanced position if his touch and composure are anything to go by. Withdrawn due to injury.\n\nMatteo Darmian: 4 Surely the Italian only got the call from the bench because Fosu-Mensah picked up a knock and now has a battle on his hands if he is to reclaim his place. 15/23 Chris Smalling: 6 The England international battled with Harry Kane throughout and did not give his opposite number a minute's peace. 16/23 Daley Blind: 5 Struggled against Walker's pace and was caught out of position on a couple of occasions. Technical ability does not mask his failures. 17/23 Marcos Rojo: 4 The Argentine is fraught with inconsistencies and simply did not do enough to attempt to deny Alderweireld for the second goal. 18/23 Morgan Schneiderlin: 5 The Frenchman struggled against a midfield which was full of what fans came to expect from United during Ferguson's reign. 19/23 Michael Carrick: 5 Solid but powerless once Spurs had taken control. 20/23 Juan Mata: 5 Did not appear to be up for the fight, the Spaniard made little impact in the final third and was left exposed in his own half. 21/23 Jesse Lingard: 5 Failed to make an impact in attack and does not looked well suited to a No. 10 role. 22/23 Anthony Martial: 6 One of few bright spots for the visitors. He looked the most likely to open the scoring but missed a vital chance at 0-0, and fell away during the closing stages. 23/23 Marcus Rashford: 6 Involved in plenty of nice interchanges in the first half but was withdrawn at the break for Ashley Young.\n\nAshley Young: 5 Introduced at centre forward but, unsurprisingly, did little of note. 1/23 Player Ratings Who stood out at White Hart Lane? 2/23 Hugo Lloris: 6 Little more than a spectator in the first half, Lloris was not forced to make a significant save until the hour mark but did not kick particularly well. 3/23 Kyle Walker: 6 The Spurs full-back was often pinned back by Anthony Martial but did threaten whenever he managed to get into the final third. 4/23 Jan Vertonghen: 7 There was no sign of cobwebs from the Belgian, despite a nine-game absence, as he produced a typically solid display. 5/23 Toby Alderweireld: 7 As reliable and composed as ever, the Belgian got the goal he deserved too.

  "latent_21654": "Posted on 2:18 PM by Sameer Shah\n\nRussia reacted furiously today to an announcement that Poland is to host an American global anti-missile shield.\n\nGeneral Anatoly Nogovitsyn said that by accepting the missile defence battery Poland \"is exposing itself to a strike\".\n\n\"By hosting these, Poland is making itself a target. This is 100 percent certain,\" Russia's Interfax news agency quoted General Anatoly Nogovitsyn as saying.\n\n\"It becomes a target for attack. Such targets are destroyed as a first priority.\"\n\nThe general's hawkish comments came amid Moscow's fears the missile shield makes Russia a target of the United States.\n\nThe two former Cold War superpowers are locking horns over fighting in Georgia.\n\nToday American President George Bush warned Russia that it does not want \"contentious relations\" with the United States, demanding Moscow leave Georgia.\n\nUS Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice echoed him from Tbilisi, where she was meeting with Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili: \"Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" she said. \"This is no longer 1968.\"\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev responded cautiously, saying Moscow would strike back \"in the same way we have responded\" if it were further attacked.\n\nReferring to the missile shield, General Nogovitsyn said that Russia's military doctrine sanctions the use of nuclear weapons \"against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them,\" Interfax said.\n\nThe US Patriot missile battery in Tel Aviv. Washington has agreed to move a similar battery from Germany to Poland\n\nMedvedev said the deal \"absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier - the deployment has the Russian Federation as its target.\"\n\nHowever, speaking at news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today, he appeared to take a softer position than Nogovitsyn's, saying \"it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent, but it is not dramatic.\"\n\nMore...\n\n* Bush demands 'bullying' Russia get out of Georgia - but Medvedev warns Moscow will respond if attacked\n\n* Video: Reporter shot in eye covering Georgia conflict as team come under rebel fire\n\nTensions between Russia and the West have soared over the brutal fighting that erupted last week between Russian and Georgian forces over the separatist Georgian region of South Ossetia.\n\nToday Bush warned Russia that \"bullying and intimidation\" are no longer acceptable methods of foreign policy.\n\nHe said Russia does not want \"contentious relations\" with the United States, demanding Moscow honour its commitment to a cease-fire in Georgia.\n\nAbkhazian separatist soldiers stand in front of the debris of a Georgian military base\n\n\"Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected,\" said Bush, speaking at the White House before traveling to his Texas ranch for a two-week stay.\n\n\"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century,\" the president said.\n\n\"Moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all Georgian territory.\"\n\nIn response Medvedev cautiously warned: \"If someone continues to attack our citizens, our peacekeepers, we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded. There should be no doubt about this.\"\n\nEven before the crisis in Georgia, tensions between Washington and Moscow have been rising over disputes such as the independence of Kosovo, NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders and U.S. plans for a missile defence system in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Poland deal may appear to Russia as confirmation of its fears about that defence system as it swiftly responded with Cold War nuclear rhetoric today.\n\nStill, Bush said, \"The Cold War is over. The days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us.\"\n\nIncreasing diplomatic pressure on Moscow, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Russian President Dmitry Medvedev today to tell him Russia's actions in Georgia had gone too far.\n\nPressure from Berlin is significant because Germany is Russia's biggest trading partner and Moscow generally regards it as reliable and sympathetic.\n\nMedvedev hit back quickly against Merkel and Bush, however, saying cagily that Georgia's breakaway regions are \"unlikely to live together with Georgia.\"\n\nRussian forces went deep into Georgia in the fighting, raising wide concerns that Russia could be seeking to occupy parts of its small, pro-U.S. neighbor, which has vigorously lobbied to join NATO, or even to force its government to collapse.\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev, right, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in Sochi today where she applied diplomatic pressure\n\nUnder the agreement that Warsaw and Washington reached yesterday, Poland will accept an American missile interceptor base.\n\nWashington has agreed to move a battery of Patriot missiles from Germany to Poland as part of the deal. They would provide protection against short-range ballistic missiles such as the SS-21 system used by Russia in Georgia.\n\n\"We have crossed the Rubicon,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, referring to U.S. abrupt consent to Poland's demands after more than 18 months of negotiations.\n\nWashington says the planned system, which is not yet operational, is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from possible attacks by missile-armed \"rogue states\" like Iran or terrorist groups like al Qaeda.\n\nMoscow still insists the shield is a threat to its security, despite US assurances to the contrary, and feels it will worsen tensions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, left, and Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili meet in Tbilisi today where she has flown to give Georgia American support\n\nRussia's envoy to Nato said the deal showed the system was aimed at Russia.\n\n\"The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations-between Russia and the US over the situation in Georgia shows that, of course, the missile defence system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia,\" Dmitri Rogozin said.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov cancelled a trip to Warsaw. The deal, signed by deputy Polish foreign minister Andrzej Kremer and US chief negotiator John Rood, must be endorsed by both governments and Poland's parliament.\n\nPolish prime minister Donald Tusk had insisted the US provide more military co-operation in return for consent to host 10 interceptor rockets.\n\nThe deal, signed by deputy Polish foreign minister Andrzej Kremer and US chief negotiator John Rood, must be endorsed by both governments and Poland's parliament.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk had insisted the US provide more military co-operation in return for consent to host 10 interceptor rockets.\n\nIn what appeared to be a first sign of Moscow's displeasure, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov cancelled a trip to Warsaw.\n\nRefugees cross the bridge over the Inguri River as they enter the Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia\n\nIf everything goes to schedule, the interceptor base would be ready by about 2012.\n\nIn an interview on Poland's news channel TVN24, Tusk said the U.S. agreed to help augment Poland's defenses with Patriot missiles in exchange for placing 10 missile defense interceptors in the Eastern European country.\n\nHe said the deal also includes a \"mutual commitment\" between the two nations to come to each other's assistance \"in case of trouble.\"\n\nThat clause appeared to be a direct reference to Russia.\n\nPoland has all along been guided by fears of a newly resurgent Russia, an anxiety that has intensified with Russia's offensive in Georgia.\n\nIn past days, Polish leaders said that fighting justified Poland's demands that it get additional security guarantees from Washington in exchange for allowing the anti-missile base on its soil.",
  "latent_21702": "And now it's time for our semi-regular feature: let's all close our eyes and hope really hard that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is going to happen some day, despite the lack of firm confirmation or evidence to suggest that it will. It worked for Mirror's Edge 2 dammit, it can work for this - and series creator Michael Ancel is only too happy to fuel our optimism. This time, he's suggesting the game could be re-announced in the next year.\n\n\"We need to build the team and retrieve the elements that we worked on,\" Ancel said in an interview with Eurogamer . \"I don't want to say things in terms of time that will make people disappointed - it will really depend on the speed that we will make things for that game.\n\n\"We've made a lot of things already. Now we need to put them together and make that game. If there would be any communication it will be in the next year, just trying to talk about the fact we are on it. But so many people in Ubisoft want to make that game, honestly.\n\n\"It was not the time when we worked on it before, it was too ambitious, honestly. And this is the game that we want to do at the right time. So now that we have the right team and the right tools, this would be a good time to do it.\"\n\nTo recap: Ancel still needs to build a team, retrieve elements, and says this would be a good time. If there is a reason to believe that this time really will be BG&E2's moment, it's that we're about to tick into a new round of consoles - giving what Ancel admits were over-ambitious plans the tech they need to be realised.\n\n\"In Beyond Good & Evil 1 at first it was a full planet, you could go to the North Pole and see the eternal day,\" he said. \"But we had to limit it as we were only 35 people. We couldn't fill the whole world with all the things we wanted. We were frustrated at the end of BG&E1, and when we started the sequel we started again with this idea - you're free and can investigate and travel the world as much as you want.\"\n\nOn the otherside of this long-spinning coin, there's a potential roadblock: management. \"They [the Ubisoft bosses] have done really well with the different games that are coming out right now and the ones they've already released,\" Ancel said. \"They're in a good place in terms of the business, and it could be very interesting to make a game like that as there aren't too many games out there right now that would be like ours. So I think it's the right time and I'm confident that they will follow the team.\"",

  "latent_21859": "And I'm not talking about everyone who lives on the Eastside and shops at Wacko and eats Yuca tacos. Those tacos are good, and people have to buy their hot rod and bondage literature somewhere.\n\nBy \"hipsters\" I am not referring to the radical college kids, the animal rights activists or the anarchists in their mohawks and Black Flag shirts. Because whatever it is, at least they stand for something.\n\nThat feeling of resentment strikes a chord with me, because I notice that people who came of age in the 70s and 80s punk rock movement seem to universally hate “hipsters”. And that sentiment seems to be seeping into the general zeitgeist.\n\nOne thing that particularly struck me about Hype! was the grunge scene's intense resentment against the greater culture for appropriating the look and style elements of their subculture. Anti-fashion became the fashion. It lost all meaning. It fell victim to something I call the “Punk Rock Quincy” phenomenon.\n\nThe main theme of the seminal grunge documentary Hype! is how something that by its very nature was anti-commercial became commercialized.\n\nHipsters are the ones walking around Los Feliz and Silver Lake with two-toned pink and black hair. The ones wearing expensive \"alternative\" fashion. Hipsters go to the latest, coolest, hippest bar. They listen to the latest, coolest, hippest band. But they don't seem to subscribe to any particular philosophy or to have an allegiance to any particular genre of music. Whatever it is, as long as it is the latest and the coolest and the hippest, they have to have it. They are like soldiers of fortune of style.\n\nI look at the hipsters, and I think, \"Well, I like that haircut. I like those pants. I like Coop's devil girl and Bettie Page and and tikis and tattooes. I like Eames chairs and Millie's omelettes and funny blue-tinted drinks.\" So why do I resent these people for liking them?\n\nMy friend Janet says that one reason it pisses her off is because that look used to be a code. It meant something. If you saw someone walking down the street dressed the same way you were, with the same haircut you had, you immediately knew that they listened to the same records that you did.\n\nNow that look has become generic and meaningless. People with blue hair listen to top 40. People spend hundreds of dollars trying to look like they shop at the thrift store. They have appropriated the style, yet discarded everything that the style stood for. Another friend, John, complains about the younger generation taking over his neighborhood while ripping off a lifestyle they don't really understand, \"...I should be glad that I still have the opportunity to chase them off my yard to keep them from stealing my teeth or something. Not that they'd know how to fucking bite anything with them\".\n\nI guess what it comes down to is that once upon a time, we had really good cake. It was good and it was good for you. We were waging a war agains Reaganomics, nuclear weapons and the Star Wars defense system. We had a solid left-wing agenda. We had seen the scars of Viet Nam and learned from them. We were picking up the mantle that the hippies dropped when they all bought yuppie \"Beamers\" and became \"the man\".\n\nWe had the Minutemen. We had the Descendents. The Ramones were all still alive. The fashion was fun, and goofy, and like bandannas in our back pockets, it let us know who each other were. It helped us find each other in a hostile society.\n\nIt was fucking cake, and the blue hair and the cartoonish clothes were just icing on the cake.\n\nI think the reason people hate the hipsters so much is that they only have the icing. And who wants to just sit down to a big bowl of icing? It makes your teeth hurt.\n\nPhoto by Markltb via Flickr",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nCould the main obstacle to Hillary Clinton testifying about Benghazi be Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chair of the special House committee set up to investigate the 2012 terrorist attack that killed US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans?\n\nClinton and Gowdy have been in a tug-of-war for the past few weeks. At the end of March—following the news that Clinton, the leading Democratic 2016 candidate, had used a private email account when she was secretary of state and that her emails about Benghazi and all other official matters were not originally kept by the State Department—Gowdy asked Clinton to come before the committee for a private interview to discuss the emails she had exchanged concerning Benghazi and Libya. After such a session, Gowdy noted, the panel would schedule a time for her to testify publicly about the event itself.\n\nLast month, Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, responded and said there was “no reason to delay her appearance or to have her testify [about the emails] in a private interview.” It was a clear sign that the Clinton camp would like to get her inevitable appearance before the GOP-created Benghazi committee over and done with. This move came just as Gowdy’s committee signaled that it may not release its findings until soon before the 2016 election. Reacting to that news, John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, huffed that the committee’s admission “is the most telling evidence yet that their investigation is solely about playing politics in the 2016 presidential campaign.”\n\nThen, on April 23, Gowdy fired back with a letter to Kendall insisting that Clinton submit to either a private “transcribed interview” or a public hearing to discuss her emails and other documents (but not to talk about the actual Benghazi attack). Only if that interview or hearing assured Gowdy that “all documents needed to have a constructive conversation with the Secretary are in the Committee”s possession” would he then hold a hearing with Clinton to examine what happened in Benghazi. That is, no public hearing on the substance of the matter until Clinton testified (privately or publicly) about the emails and convinced Gowdy that the committee now possessed all the related emails and documents.\n\nAnd that’s the rub. Can Clinton, whose official emails were first kept on a private server and then vetted by her own aides before being turned over to the State Department, say under oath that she knows beyond doubt that every single Benghazi email she sent or received now resides within the committee’s files? And will Gowdy ever accept an assurance from her that all her Benghazi emails made it to the State Department and were subsequently shared with the committee?\n\nThis political dance played out at the end of last week. In an interview with USA Today‘s Susan Page, Gowdy indicated that he might be willing to accept Clinton’s word if she said under oath that all her emails have been provided to his committee. “If she were, under some theory, able to say, ‘Yes, I can promise you under penalty of perjury you have every single document you’re entitled to,’ that would probably shut off that line of inquiry,” Gowdy said. “If she can, then it will be a short conversation.”\n\nBut Gowdy also left himself plenty of room to be unpersuaded by Clinton. He noted, “If she testified under oath [that all emails and relevant documents were turned over], I think my first question would be, ‘Madame Secretary, with all due respect, how do you know that? Because you’re not the one who went through the emails; your lawyer did.'”\n\nIt looks as if Gowdy might be setting a trap for Clinton. (At least one conservative pundit sees it this way.) If Clinton cannot say with 100 percent certainty that Gowdy’s committee has every digit of her data related to Benghazi, then she cannot testify on what happened—and the committee will drag out the proceedings further into the 2016 campaign season.\n\nClinton is trying to avoid being so cornered. On Monday, Kendall sent a letter to Gowdy, asserting there was no need for two rounds of testimony. “Respectfully,” he wrote, “there is no basis, logic, or precedent for such an unusual request.” Clinton, he added, was prepared to come before the committee and stay as long as necessary to answer all queries about the Benghazi attack and her emails. Kendall reminded Gowdy that Clinton has already testified about Benghazi before other House and Senate committees (which, by the way, have found no wrongdoing or conspiracies on her part). In a not-so-veiled jibe at Gowdy, Kendall noted that Clinton “believes that the Members of the Committee are able to decide how much they will focus on the tragic deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, including what can be done to keep those who serve our country safe—and how much they will focus on how she e-mailed.”\n\nAfter all this parrying, the question is: Does Gowdy want to have Clinton testify about what transpired in Benghazi (and Washington) and proceed with the investigation—the House GOPers have already spent more time investigating Benghazi than Congress devoted to the Iran-Contra scandal—or does he want to play cat and mouse with Clinton far into the election cycle? By the standard Gowdy cited during his interview with Susan Page, Clinton will not be able to satisfy him about the emails. After all, given how she and her aides handled those records, there is no way for her to provide an iron-clad guarantee. But will Gowdy exploit that to drag out his inquiry and prevent Clinton from an appearance in which she presumably will defend her actions and swat aside the various Benghazi conspiracies (as she has previously done)?\n\nAt this stage, Clinton is eager to address the core issues and move on, and Gowdy is focusing on the emails and establishing potential grounds to stop her from testifying publicly about the attack itself. If no deal is sorted out, the committee could end up blocking Clinton from testifying about the main event. That could look odd to some. But any delay—as politically brazen as it might appear—could well inconvenience Clinton more than the committee.",

  "latent_22236": "The 2016 presidential election wasn’t the first time Russian trolls used Facebook to mess with another country’s political system. And it wasn’t the first time Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered a weak defense of his company’s role in facilitating Russian online aggression.\n\nYears before Russian trolls organized pro-Trump flash mobs, advertised fake news to tens of millions of Americans, and promoted anti-immigrant hate, they pushed and pushed to get Ukrainian activists suspended from the social network. And it worked, those activists say.\n\nThe anti-Ukrainian trolls lodged endless complaints with Facebook, claiming that their anti-Kremlin posts were really hate speech or porn. The social network would dutifully comply with the trolls’ requests.\n\n“I’ve been blocked [from Facebook] because of a post about a rainbow. I put a picture of my city [with] a picture of [the] rainbow. The picture said, ‘Everything will be okay,’” one Ukrainian activist, Yaroslav Matiushyn, told The Daily Beast. “I was blocked for a month.\n\n“One was a text post. It wasn’t erotic text—no porno, nothing erotic. They complained there is some nudity in it,” he said. Matiushyn was banned again after, he said, trolls bombarded Facebook with nudity reports.\n\nFacebook’s inability to tackle Russia’s troll problem in Ukraine reached a fever pitch in 2014 and 2015, with several Ukrainians writing into Zuckerberg’s May 2015 call for question submissions at a Facebook town hall. The top 20 questions worldwide were about Russian trolling of the website’s report button to silence Ukrainian accounts. The top question received 45,000 likes. And even Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko asked the company to create a Ukrainian Facebook office to deal with Ukraine. The request was rebuffed.\n\n“The users whose opinions differ from those of the Kremlin are blocked, though they do not violate any community rules,” one user wrote on Zuckerberg’s call for questions.\n\nZuckerberg addressed the question at an employee town hall on May 15, 2015.\n\n“The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, actually sent in a question, as well,” a Facebook employee said, as colleagues laughed.\n\nZuckerberg argued that a good number of the posts contained “hate speech” and anti-Russian “slurs.” He did not address the Russian trolls and their often spurious allegations, even though the trolls were referenced in most of the questions.\n\n“We did the right thing according to our policies in taking down the posts. I support our policies in taking down hate speech,” he said.\n\nZuckerberg then apologized to some users whose posts “were accidentally [taken] down because the post contained nudity instead of hate speech.”\n\n“That was a bug in the software we were running,” he said, laughing. “We’ll try not to make that mistake anymore.”\n\nIndividuals and groups who maliciously report posts that comply with site guidelines pose a unique problem for social networks, Emerson College communication studies professor Vincent Raynauld told The Daily Beast.\n\nOften, such tactics are an attempt to “slow down the mobilization, and slow down the discourse as well,” said Raynauld, whose published work focuses mostly on microtargeting and social media impacts on elections.\n\nSocial networks use algorithms and track patterns to help them crack down on violations of their policies, as well as on faulty reports. But Reynauld said they are in a “perpetual beta” because the strategies used to evade detection constantly evolve.\n\n“There is no way to ensure a free discourse on these platforms,” Reynauld said. “But there’s a way for Facebook to engage more with its user pool.”\n\nIn December of 2016, over a year after facing public questions about Kremlin-sponsored trolling and abuse on his platform, Zuckerberg referred to fake news on Facebook as a “very small amount of content” and said “I think it’s a pretty crazy idea” that Kremlin-sponsored propaganda “influenced the (American) election in any way.”\n\n“I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,” he said. “If you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message the Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.”\n\nNine months—and a torrent of public criticism—later, Facebook announced in September that it had identified several Kremlin operations disguised as American Facebook groups. After some initial resistance, company representatives shared some of their findings with congressional intelligence committees and with special prosecutor Robert Mueller. (North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence committee, said on Monday that his panel has not received a complete report from Facebook, however.)\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported, the Facebook pages, with names like “Secured Borders” and “Being Patriotic,” created real-life pro-Trump rallies on American soil, established fake “voter fraud hotlines” on Election Day, and wrote posts with divisive, racist, and anti-immigrant sentiments.\n\nFacebook’s less-than-urgent responses to these examples of an autocratic foreign power interfering in the domestic affairs of a democratic country shouldn’t be altogether surprising, however. The company has a track record of acquiescence to the demands of authoritarian regimes. Rohingya activists told The Daily Beast that the social network had been taking down their posts about the intensifying ethnic cleansing in Burma. In 2016, Facebook also developed a censorship tool to appease the Chinese government and allow the company to suppress posts on a regional basis, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe company likewise bowed to Turkey’s demands of censoring images of the prophet Muhammad to get access to that market, just weeks after the Charlie Hebdo attacks.\n\nAnd in Russia itself, the social network blocked a page in support of Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most vocal challenger. When it debuted the Facebook gay pride reaction button, users in Russia and other anti-gay countries were unable to access it.\n\nNavalny later co-signed a petition demanding Facebook change their approach to an “army of shills on state payroll” blocking Ukrainian posts on the site. The petition racked up almost 10,000 signatures.\n\nIt’s a sea change for the social network once hailed as a key enabler of the Arab Spring.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian authorities threatened to block access to Facebook in the country if it doesn’t begin to store data of Russian citizens on Russian servers. Russia has already banned LinkedIn for not complying with the same data storage requirements.\n\nThe Ukrainians who felt silenced by Facebook’s moderation system at the height of tensions with Russia are still grasping for answers about what happened to their messages—and who was to blame for their disappearance.\n\n“We’d heard around that the people looking into the complaints on most of the Slavic languages was Russian,” Michael Baskin told The Daily Beast.\n\nBaskin was one of the first to file a high-profile public complaint to Facebook about the Russian troll campaign against Ukrainian accounts.\n\n“Such obvious mismanagement encourages further informational war between Ukrainian and Russian people and benefits the state that has been recognized worldwide as the aggressor,” he wrote in a post addressed to Zuckerberg that was liked over 3,000 times.\n\nBaskin, a Ukrainian living in Dublin, said he’d asked Facebook employees and their friends, who had relayed the theory of incidentally pro-Russian comment moderation, and that he didn’t believe it “was only one lady’s decision,” but “probably someone up in management.” Facebook’s European headquarters are also located in Dublin.\n\nIn his 2015 Facebook town hall, Zuckerberg called Baskin’s theory a “meme that was floating around that the content moderation was done out of a Russian office by Russians who were anti-Ukrainian” and said that it’s “not true.”\n\nIn that case, Baskin said, he still wants answers for why Ukrainian activists had accounts repeatedly shuttered while Kremlin propaganda abounded—both in Ukraine in 2015 and the U.S. in 2016.\n\n“These trolls were fighting for the brains and thoughts of others on Facebook. It was in very serious, extreme scale,” he said.\n\nBut, according to a Facebook representative, it wasn’t enough to prompt a change in policy.\n\n“We removed a lot of content for violating our standards on hate speech, including the use of racial slurs. The content we removed was done so consistent with our Community Standards,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast in a statement. “Anyone can report content to us if they think it violates our standards. One report is enough to take down content if it violates our policies but multiple reports will not lead to the removal of content if it meets our standards. That is true today as it was then.”",
  "latent_22293": "Winter is coming\n\nI've always been fascinated by liquid-cooling setups for PCs. When I started building my own computers about a decade ago, liquid cooling had an exotic mystique. It was the mark of the most dedicated enthusiast, a mad-scientist-y whirl of custom water blocks, home-brewed tubing setups, and radiators pressed into Frankensteinian service from wherever they could be found.\n\nThose mad scientists are still out there, but liquid cooling has become much more egalitarian of late. There's a dizzying array of closed-loop liquid coolers, or CLCs, available to the PC builder. CLCs do away with the complexity of fully custom loops in favor of plug-and-play designs.\n\nThat brings me to the cooler I'm looking at today, Cooler Master's $130 Nepton 240M. The Neptons represent the high end of Cooler Master's CLC lineup. These offerings include larger-diameter flexible tubing, higher-quality fans, and a more advanced water block design than the company's less expensive Seidon CLCs. With a 240-mm radiator, the Nepton 240M should have enough thermal capacity to handle even the hottest-running of today's processors. Let's take a look at the goodies Cooler Master has packaged with the Nepton 240M, and then we'll put it in the hot seat.\n\nOverview\n\nAt first glance, it's easy to dismiss CLCs as a \"seen one, seen 'em all\" deal, but that would be a mistake. While the general principles remain the same from one to the next—an integrated pump and water block unit circulates coolant through a sealed radiator loop—there's still plenty of room for manufacturers to put their own spins on the concept.\n\nLet's start with a look at the pump and water block on the Nepton. According to Cooler Master, the water block in the Nepton series features \"ultra-fine micro channel\" technology, which makes for an internal surface area that's four times larger than water blocks from \"the competition.\" While I can't tear into the Nepton 240M to verify this claim, more surface area in the water block should make for better heat dissipation, so long as the ultra-fine fins don't impede coolant flow.\n\nThe copper mating surface on the water block isn't polished to a mirror sheen. Instead, it's ever-so-slightly grooved, perhaps to ensure that thermal paste can be squished into contact with as much of the plate as possible.\n\nThe pump inside the Nepton 240M isn't a run-of-the-mill unit, either. Cooler Master says it can move 120 liters of coolant per hour while producing only 11 dBA of noise. The company doesn't say how it arrived at this impressive noise figure, but the cheaper Seidon 120V has a vaguer \"less than 23 dBA\" noise rating, so the Nepton pump should be noticeably quieter than its sibling. (In my experience, the Seidon's pump is pretty coarse-sounding.) When the Nepton 240M is powered on, a white LED illuminates the Cooler Master logo on the pump, too. Fancy.\n\nThe business end of the Nepton 240M is its 240-mm radiator. This heat exchanger is joined to the pump by a pair of flexible, ribbed tubes. True to Cooler Master's specs, these tubes have a noticeably larger diameter than those used on the Seidon 120V. The radiator is about as thick as the Seidon's—just doubled in length. Out of the box, the radiator had zero bent fins, which I find reassuring from a quality-control standpoint.\n\nThere's a fill port on the radiator, but it's plastered with \"warranty void if removed\" stickers. (This is a sealed system, after all.) Should a problem arise with your Nepton 240M, Cooler Master backs up the Nepton line with a five-year warranty.\n\nOn the active-cooling front, two of Cooler Master's new Silencio 120 fans ship with the Nepton 240M. In contrast to the seven-bladed fans packaged with the Seidon 120V, these 120-mm blowers each have five broad blades with much more aggressively swept tips. True to their name, the Silencios are rated to produce only 11 dBA of noise in operation. Cooler Master includes a rubber gasket that's designed to sit between the fans and the radiator, hopefully dampening unwanted vibrations from these air movers.\n\nThe final element CLC buyers will likely consider is CPU socket compatibility. Cooler Master includes mounting hardware to secure the Nepton 240M to virtually every Intel and AMD socket that one might find in use today, from LGA775 and Socket AM2 to LGA2011 and Socket FM2+.\n\nOverall, the Nepton 240M appears to have all of the right stuff for a high-end CLC. It comes at a price, though. Cooler Master's MSRP for the Nepton 240M is $129.99, which is about $15 more expensive than the best 240mm CLCs from Corsair and other manufacturers. Let's hope that its performance matches this lofty figure.\n\nNext, I'm going to strap the Nepton 240M to a processor and see how logical and user-friendly the mounting system is.",

Res. 59, the “Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014,” to ensure the uninterrupted funding of the federal government into the next fiscal year at spending levels consistent with P.L. 112-25, the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce fully recognizes the importance of restraining federal spending, both discretionary spending and mandatory spending, to reduce federal budget deficits, contain the growth of federal debt, and thereby re-establish fiscal discipline in the near-term and for the long haul. However, as the Department of Labor’s recent lackluster jobs report reminds us, the U.S. economy continues to underperform, reinforcing the need for the federal government to preserve its normal operations pending a successful outcome of broader budgetary reforms. It is not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown that might trigger disruptive consequences or raise new policy uncertainties washing over the U.S. economy.\n\nLikewise, the U.S. Chamber respectfully urges the House of Representatives to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner and thus eliminate any question of threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has indicated the Treasury may exhaust its borrowing capacity and cash management tools as early as mid-October.\n\nThe nation faces many serious fiscal issues on which the Congress and the President have thus far yet to reach agreement. These issues include correcting the unaffordable path of entitlement spending to stabilize federal finances and the need for fundamental tax reform to strengthen the American economy. These issues also include the need to correct the many grave deficiencies in the Affordable Care Act. The Chamber believes each of these and related issues demand immediate attention. The Chamber also asks the Congress to work to clear the individual spending bills so that the improvements and changes reflected in this year’s work may be signed into law.\n\nIt is readily apparent none of these important issues are ripe for resolution. We therefore urge the House to act promptly to pass a Continuing Resolution to fund the government and to raise the debt ceiling, and then to return to work on these other vital issues.\n\nSincerely,\n\nR.

  "latent_22654": "Apple has published a great free learn to code course for Swift — on GitHub\n\nJohn Weatherford Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 16, 2015\n\nTL;DR: Apple has apparently, via some sort of collaboration with a university professor, published last week — during WWDC — a really solid-looking learn-to-code curriculum for Swift that is kind of on iTunes U but that is really on GitHub.\n\nI teach an introductory app design course at the University of Georgia’s New Media Institute. We teach mainly non-computer science students, and I had tried out a couple of different online courses targeted at that audience. Each had its strengths, but neither was perfect.\n\nAt the end of this last semester, a student recommended Stanford’s iTunes U course on Swift. I’d begun evaluating it this week, and it’s great — clear instructions, good production values, everything you could want. There was just one problem: the course assumed that students would have a strong object-oriented programming (OOP) background, which my students definitely don’t have. I hopped back to browse iTunes U in search of an introductory OOP course I could use to supplement the Swift course, when I saw this:\n\nHuh! A course on Swift from Apple Education — is that even a thing? Super-cool, though, right? I start poking around the curriculum, and all it is is a bunch of PDFs. Weirdly, it references a bunch of Xcode projects but doesn’t have any links to download them.\n\nAfter some quick Googling, I was pretty surprised to find what looked to be a link to the same curriculum…on GitHub.\n\nI clicked through, and I wasn’t disappointed: not only did the GitHub page include the exact same content as the iTunes U course, but it looked better and included the missing Xcode project downloads — plus Keynote files for class lectures on various design concepts.\n\nThis all seemed awesome, but it seemed very un-Apple — since when do they publish stuff to GitHub? Just to be sure this really was Apple, I decided to poke around a bit.\n\nFirst, Apple Education on iTunes U looked to be legit:\n\nBut, the author on most of the content (here, for example, Higher Ed Computer Science) was “Apple Education”:\n\nOn this new course, though, the author was Yong Bakos:\n\nI Googled Yong, and it appeared that he was…a professor at SMU? Weird. But, his bio included this tidbit:\n\nI found Yong on Twitter, and it appeared that this was in fact his project:\n\nSo, Yong was definitely the guy I was looking for. I still wasn’t 100% sure that this was an official Apple project, though, so the poking around continued.\n\nI found this at developer.apple.com/education:\n\nThe “Join the community” link did in fact point to the project on GitHub — progress! I reached out to Yong for more details:\n\nA very Apple-y non-answer, no? It appeared that I had found a reasonably satisfactory conclusion:\n\nApple has apparently, via some sort of collaboration with a university professor, published last week — during WWDC — a really solid-looking learn-to-code curriculum for Swift that is kind of on iTunes U but that is really on GitHub.\n\nWeirdly, the official Swift Twitter account hasn’t mentioned this project (do they even know about it?). I suppose they had bigger fish to fry last week, but it *does* seem to be exactly the sort of thing that would jibe with the imminent open-sourcing of Swift.\n\nFollowing that same train of thought, Apple recently dropped the paid developer account requirement for casual iOS development (this likely explains why they let the iOS Developer University Program fall into the state of disrepair that it was in.)\n\nPut all this together, and it seems like Apple is really making a push to help carve out a prominent place for Swift for student developers — a win for educators, a win for students, and a win for Apple.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, follow me on Twitter @JohnWeatherford or click “Recommend” below.

  "latent_22872": "For example, samples examined by the F.D.A. of a Chinese-made product called Kleancolor Frameous Lash & Brow, which sells for just $1, contained hazardous levels of mold, given that its intended area of use was the eye. The F.D.A. also found dangerous levels of mercury — it can cause kidney and nervous system damage — in a product made in Mexico called “Crema Piel De Seda,” or “Silky Skin Cream.” It was marketed to whiten skin, treat acne and remove various skin blemishes.\n\n, The real problem was that the agency has no way of knowing how widespread the problem is with imported cosmetics, given that it is doing so few inspections, said Deborah Kotz, an F.D.A. spokeswoman. But she said that the agency inspects only imported cosmetics it has a reason to suspect might have problems, which inflates the rate of adverse findings. The 20 percent adverse-findings figure does not mean that the problem is that widespread in imported cosmetics over all.\n\n“The F.D.A. believes that the vast majority of cosmetic products on the market are safe, but our information on the universe of cosmetics is limited,” said Linda Katz, director of the office of cosmetics and colors, in a written statement.\n\nMr. Pallone, in an interview, said that the data the F.D.A. provided could help convince Congress to take up legislation to strengthen regulation of imported cosmetics. The idea has been embraced by some congressional Republicans as well as many major companies in the industry, who could benefit if cheap imports (including sometime counterfeits of their brand-name products) are subject to more scrutiny.\n\n“The time is ripe to deal with the cosmetic issues, given the problems with imports,” Mr. Pallone said. He intends to reintroduce his proposal to expand the regulation of cosmetics, including imports, as part of a larger bill that would fund greater oversight of over-the-counter drugs.\n\nLisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the Personal Care Products Council, which represents the nation’s largest cosmetics makers, declined to comment on F.D.A. statistics regarding problems found with imported products, saying she had not seen the agency letter.\n\nCraig Weiss, an executive at the Consumer Product Testing Company, which does thousands of tests a year on cosmetics products on behalf of companies in the industry, said he questioned how serious the health threat was, as most of the issues the F.D.A. finds were minor — for instance, labeling flaws or the use of color additives that happen not to be approved in the United States.",

There’s a lot of cool components that can be really really useful if you can understand what each one does.\n\nBig data is exactly what it says, it’s “big data�?\n\nWikipedia states that;\n\n“Big data is an all-encompassing term for any collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data processing applications.�?\n\nBig Data in today’s context is driven by 3 the three V’s\n\nVolume - This is the simply a large amount of data, and as defined by wikipedia, generally the volume equation of big data is a set of data that is too large or complex to be dealt with using traditional dataprocessing methods.\n\nVelocity - Velocity is the rate at which data is being introduced into your ecosystem, and velocity is usually increasing over time. According to IDC1, mankind will have 40 Zettabytes of data stored by 2020, that’s 40,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Bytes! That represents a steady increase in data velocity.\n\nVariety - Data doesn’t have to be limited to just database table, according to many analysts such as IDC, Gartner and others, up to 80% of all data in the world is “unstructured�?, things such as presentations, word processing documents, text files, pdf’s, spreadsheets, and so on.\n\nWhat is a data platform?\n\nSo we’ve defined that big data is big, comes from many sources, and is growing at a staggering rate. This is the problem that a data platform is trying to solve. It’s more than just a large storage pool, NoSQL database and map reduce. A data platform is a set of tools that is designed to solve the inherent problems of handling, analyzing and getting actionable intelligence from big data.\n\nSee image of data platform\n\n(source http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-modern-data-architecture )\n\nA data platform can be a complex beast and it’s important to try to understand what each component does, but the main takeaway is that it’s more than just map reduce, it really is a platform, and in the HortonWorks platform it is quite correct to describe YARN as a Data Operating system as it is the platform you can build your big data solutions on. YARN supports (very simplified):\n\nContainers for your applications (processes in an OS)\n\nResource Management & scheduling (CPU, Memory etc in a traditional OS)\n\nYARN is way more than just what I’ve listed above, the key idea is that YARN is distributed and is the foundation for a modern, scalable data platform.\n\nI could write an entire article on YARN in detail, but that would not be in scope for this article. But to sum it up YARN is a re architecture of the original Hadoop framework to make it more agile and flexible, YARN is also designed to support non mapreduce and near real time workloads as well, better supporting the “data platform�? idea.\n\nYou can find out more about YARN at http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-hadoop-yarn-background-and-an-overview/\n\nIt’s about applications, mixing and matching technology to meet customer needs.\n\nSo the business case for big data is to try to derive value out of the data that a company possesses or acquires. Here are some examples\n\nMachine learning, matching and suggestion engines. Learning algorithms can suggest to customers based on previous activity\n\nFull text indexing a large document store indexing a large companies documents and allowing employees to search for documents and items.\n\nCorrelating data Looking through unstructured data and linking it to customers, employees, suppliers\n\nLooking for patterns in data In 2013, Google actually tracked the flu better than the CDC by tracking searches http://www.google.org/flutrends/\n\nApplications of this type of technology are endless and only bound by your imagination.\n\nIdentifying what you need from a data platform.\n\nSo you’ve decided it’s time to build a big data system on a data platform, like any process, you need to identify what your requirements will be.\n\nWhat sort of data do you want to put into big data?\n\nWhere is the data coming from?\n\nWhat do you want to do with it?\n\nWhat sort of latency is acceptable? Near real time? Batch process?\n\nWhat skills do you need?\n\nBig data is not for the feint of heart, you and your team must be willing to master many disciplines in order to be successful. You’ll need understanding of code, hardware, Virtualization, networking, databases (SQL & NoSQL), ETL, Cloud, and more.. Don’t fool yourself, you’ll need some serious skills on-board.\n\nBut it’s definitely achievable for a team that’s willing to educate and apply themselves to the task, and if you don’t see it as a fun challenge, or you maybe don’t have the team in place to execute such an ambitious plan, there’s lots of companies with expertise in building big data expertise such as HortonWorks and others that you can partner with.\n\n1http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/idc-the-digital-universe-in-2020.pdf\n\nsee original blog post http://www.kevinedaly.com/blogs/hadoopismore",
  "latent_23012": "You are lucky to be a lady! Smart, strong, beautiful, and you’ve got a heck of a lot of clothing options!\n\nThis four part guide will give you ideas on how to dress with an ostomy. It will also inspire you!\n\nWant to skip ahead?\n\nIntro\n\nThis guide has been made possible by the generosity of over a dozen women, who not only sent in their photos, but provided tips as well. I have listed contributors at the end of this guide (part four), along with their contact links. To those ladies who have helped me on this project – this post is dedicated to you! Lots of love, Eric\n\nHERE. My men’s guide to dressing with an ostomy can be found\n\nDisclaimer: I’ll be mentioning many brands in this guide, but they have only been included for your convenience. NONE have been added because of sponsorship or paid endorsement.\n\nWhile many ladies can certainly wear their favorite clothes without too much trouble, there are a few useful options that can come in handy in certain situations. None of these are necessary for an ostomate, but they can improve your quality of life.\n\nStoma Guards\n\nIf you have a stoma that’s at or near your belt line, you might find that a stoma guard can come in handy with certain outfits.\n\nIn addition, they are extremely useful for protecting your stoma during sport, seat belts or unexpected impact (like from kids or pets).\n\nBecause stoma guards come in many shapes and sizes, not all will be suitable for wearing under light clothing, so it’s important to do some research and ask questions before ordering one. I’ve put together many reviews, including ones for stoma guards, which you can find HERE.\n\nAn alternative to guards, which has been designed specifically to help wear your appliance under clothing, is the StomaTuck. The StomaTuck clips onto your waistband and helps to give space for your appliance. My review can be found HERE.\n\nSupport Garments\n\nOffering more support than wraps or bands, support garments are often custom made to each ostomate’s requirement.\n\nThese can include products like the Stealth Belt or the “Eh-Ok” products, both of which I’ve reviewed. There are other products available, but they may only be sold in certain countries.\n\nOstomy Support Wraps and Bands\n\nI’m a big fan of ostomy wraps, not only because of their simplicity but because they do a great job supporting and concealing an ostomy appliance.\n\nOne of the things that was really good for me as an ostomate was the OstomySecrets wraps. The first one I got was the Intimacy Wrap. I loved that it kept my bag close to me. It was so comfortable, that I bought 3 regular wraps (black, white and beige). Not only do they keep your bag secure and close to you, but they also have pockets on the inside for you to tuck your bag into them! Also, they are way more comfortable than those dinky little belts the hospital gives you.

I prefer the knickers over the boxer shorts because you’re able to see the short ‘lines’ under your clothes. And I also prefer the knickers over the wrap because I find that the wrap can rise whilst you’re walking and come out-of-place and be uncomfortable. I love the vest although it is a little tight. These 4 products are amazing for wearing under your clothes to hide your ostomy. They help you feel supported and secure. Bethany Purnell: Instagram @ bethanypurnell\n\nSue is another fan of Comfizz:\n\nI wear a Comfizz waist band to help support a full bag, and give me a smooth line underneath my clothing. Sue Hill\n\nIf you prefer, you can even use maternity bands (like the Bellaband) to achieve similar cover and support. Maternity bands tend to be less expensive, but don’t have an inner pocket to hold your pouch.\n\nPouch Covers\n\nMostly used for fun or to hide the contents of a clear pouch, pouch covers are most often made by individuals who have an ostomy, although commercial pouch covers are available.\n\nAs Bethany states below, they can also be useful in helping to disguise a dangling pouch.\n\nIf you’re the crafty type, you can even design and make your own pouch covers, just as my friend Meg has done below!\n\nHERE. I’ve reviewed several pouch covers, which you can see\n\nSeat Belt Covers\n\nWhile not a necessity for driving, these can be useful if you have a stoma that gets squished by your seat belt (like mine does).\n\nWhile I haven’t seen many brands of seat belt covers being sold for ostomates, they are around if you look hard enough. I reviewed one called the Comfee Drive (which, unfortunately, is no longer available), and it’s an accessory I use every time I’m in the car; although when I’m wearing a stoma guard, I don’t have to one.\n\nAn alternative to the Comfee Drive is the Ostomy Protector (review HERE) or stoma guards.\n\nBut there’s more!\n\nWhile these accessories can be incredibly helpful, you’re still going to want to wear clothes during the day, right? Great, because I’ll be covering clothing options in part two and three, as well as more tips in part four, so I’ll see you there!",

  "latent_23219": "From now on, the Impreza will be the company's core model, boasting a fuel-efficient, naturally aspirated 2.0-liter boxer engine. The car's wheelbase has been slightly lengthened, while the A-pillar has been brought forward to maximize interior space and comfort levels. At this point, it is unclear if Subaru will attempt an Impreza-based performance model to bridge the gap until the new WRX arrives, but it appears unlikely.\n\n\"Up until now, the Impreza and WRX used many common parts, which translated into entry-level Imprezas that were over-engineered,\" the source continued. The basic chassis and suspension had to employ certain parts needed for the WRX. That drove costs up, and many entry-level customers did not want or understand the significance of such high-tech parts, stresses our insider.\n\nThe WRX, on the other hand, will employ the very best from Subaru's parts bin, starting with an updated version of the company's rally-proven AWD system and a turbocharged boxer engine.\n\n\"The first thing you must understand about our all-new WRX is that we have developed it from the ground up to win in motorsports events. That's why we have focused so heavily on weight issues, not to mention a shorter wheelbase that permits faster, more precise turn-in. Marry that to our proven AWD system, and we think we have a winner,\" explains our source.\n\nIf you look at the Sebastien Loeb's multiple-championship-winning Citroen C4 in the World Rally Championship, you can see where Subaru is coming from -- or going to. They want to build a WRX that can beat the Citroen while still offering driving enthusiasts something special for their garages. The company has pulled out of WRC, but with the new WRX, a return looks possible. Above the WRX, Subaru will still offer a low-production flagship STI, a model our source calls a \"race car for the road.\"\n\n\"Obviously the rally model will be based on the top-of-the-line STI car, but unlike previous Impreza WRXs, this new WRX will be more hard-core and less forgiving on bumpy road surfaces,\" adds our source. Collaboration with Toyota on the FT-86 project also seems to have something to do with the direction of the new WRX and STI. \"If the truth be known, we were able to focus so deeply on the motorsports element with the new WRX because we developed a sister car with the Toyota FT-86. Bosses gave us permission to go all out because that car exists,\" says our insider.\n\nOur source also revealed what is going on in the bowels of Subaru's R&D. On the short list for the WRX's powerplant is a turbocharged 1.6-liter boxer pumping as much as 270 hp, and a twin-charger system involving a supercharger is being tested as well. The car's body is rumored to be a little bigger than a Toyota Yaris, while its tread width is said to expand significantly. As for the STI, we are told that the flagship will also employ the WRX's 1.6-liter boxer turbo, but that the engine will be reworked to generate upwards of 300 hp for motorsport competitiveness.\n\nSubaru bosses see the new WRX initially competing in domestic rallies and gymkhanas, but they are also targeting Europe's World Touring Car Championships as well as the long-awaited return to the WRC.\n\nBottom line? Get used to saying Subaru WRX (most of us enthusiasts do, anyway). Expect unprecedented levels of AWD handling and performance at a bargain price -- the vehicle should land in showrooms in roughly two years in the $26,000-$29,000 range.",
  "latent_23283": "(Photo: Spaxia/Dreamstime)\n\nIgnore the howls of rage from ‘net neutrality’ advocates; news of the FCC’s decision to revisit an Obama administration power-grab is welcome.\n\nAs usual, John Oliver is not helping.\n\nEarlier this month, the HBO funnyman revived his crusade for “net neutrality,” taking a segment of his show to scold and mock newly appointed Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who is aiming to roll back regulations on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) established by the Obama administration. “Every internet group needs to come together like you successfully did three years ago,” declared Oliver. “We need all of you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree years ago is when Oliver made his first push for “net neutrality” rules, backing a call from President Obama to impose on ISPs the “strongest possible regulation” to prevent monopolistic behavior. Since Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu coined the term “net neutrality” in 2003 to describe the principle that ISPs should not be allowed to discriminate among Internet traffic — i.e., that Comcast, Verizon, and other companies that provide Internet access to consumers should not be allowed to, say, prevent users from watching YouTube while letting Netflix play, or cause CNN’s website to load slower than Politico’s — activists have maintained that the Internet faces a dire threat to the principles of openness and transparency that have long governed its use. They are desperate to, in their words, “save the Internet.”\n\nIn 2014, after the D.C. Circuit Court reined in a second attempt by the FCC to regulate broadband beyond its legal ambit, Oliver and thousands upon thousands of activists pressured then-chairman Tom Wheeler to reject a compromise plan and do what he had previously deemed unacceptable: buck longstanding precedent and reclassify broadband as a “telecommunications service,” bringing it under the purview of Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. In the spring of 2015, that is what he did, ramming the scheme through on a party-line vote, and making ISPs subject to a statute written to defang the Bell System telephone company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNet neutrality was always a solution looking for a problem. When, in 2010, the FCC announced its first extensive regulations on ISPs (what would become the core of the 2015 rules), it could cite just four examples of anticompetitive behavior, all relatively minor. In 2005, for example, a North Carolina telephone company blocked the Internet phone service Vonage. In 2007, Comcast slowed down (“throttled”) the operations of file-sharing service BitTorrent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo prevent this kind of anticompetitive activity, the FCC instituted its own anticompetitive regulatory scheme, the so-called Open Internet rules. Under Title II, the FCC can regulate the rates that ISPs charge, using its supervisory mandate to dismiss as “unreasonable” or “unjust” any business models of which it disapproves; it can partially regulate the capital investment of existing companies, and regulate which companies (if any) can enter the ISP market; and it can impose taxes on Internet use, such as those long imposed on telephone service (the “Universal Service Fee”). What’s more, the nebulous “Internet Conduct” standard that the FCC applies as its metric for assessing abuse is subject to amendment at any time, for any reason; there is no certainty that today’s decisions will also be tomorrow’s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it is, telecommunications companies are generally subject to higher state and municipal taxes than other businesses, meaning that more capital will be diverted into government coffers, and smaller ISPs, already straining under the new regulatory burden, will have even more trouble getting off the ground. The result is likely to entrench already-existing players, making ISP markets less competitive. That will disproportionately harm rural and low-income Americans, often underserved by major industry players not willing to invest the time or resources to expand into less-profitable areas.\n\nIt’s Economics 101 that this type of onerous regulation will affect long-term capital investment, and while there is significant debate about the precise impact the rules have had so far, USTelecom — whose numbers former chairman Wheeler regularly cited as authoritative — reports that broadband capital expenditures among the dozen largest ISPs fell 5.6 percent from 2014 to 2016.\n\nNet neutrality was always a solution looking for a problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was necessary. There was very little evidence that ISPs were engaging in the sorts of malpractice that net neutrality was designed to prevent — and even if they had been, it would not have followed that reclassification was the proper remedy. In fact, a more honest appraisal of the sequence of events is that the Obama administration and left-wing activists succeeded in pressuring the FCC into a maximal power-grab that is likely to do much more damage to Internet freedom than Comcast was doing. Why is the FCC’s monopoly not as concerning as that of any given ISP?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulatory hustle that the Obama-era FCC worked was based on a myth: namely, that the Internet circa 2015 was in imminent danger, or “broken,” and needed to be “saved.” That was, and is, nonsense. Insofar as regulation may be required to sustain the Internet’s longtime dynamism, a much simpler alternative is available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, oversight of anticompetitive activity among ISPs should be transferred to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC’s express purpose is to monitor and intervene to stop anticompetitive business practices and fraud, and it has a credible track record on both counts. Allowing the FTC to intervene on a case-by-case basis would be a much less disruptive remedy than the FCC’s sweeping rule change, especially given that there have been very few documented instances of such anticompetitive behavior up to now. The FCC is simply not well-equipped to conduct this type of oversight, and the legal machinations that it has had to perform to give itself the authority to do so suggests that it was never intended to have that kind of latitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the FCC can play an important part in encouraging competition among ISPs by working with Congress and other federal agencies to free up wireless broadband spectrum for commercial use. With more and more Americans consuming large quantities of data via cell phone and tablet, the available quantity of spectrum has diminished, driving up prices and retarding investment. But the federal government, which allocates spectrum, has been slow to release more for commercial use, despite the obvious need. Incentivizing federal agencies to relinquish spectrum for commercial use should be a congressional priority. House members Brett Guthrie (R., Ky.) and Doris Matsui (D., Calif.) recently reintroduced the Federal Spectrum Incentive Act, which would allow federal agencies to auction off spectrum holdings to private companies.\n\nFinally, municipal governments should look for ways to encourage, rather than discourage, broadband investment. Local governments and their public utilities are notorious for charging broadband companies exorbitant prices for access to publicly owned “rights of way,” without which they cannot erect the infrastructure necessary for Internet service. These municipal monopolies are among the chief reasons that many places have little or no competition among ISPs. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Kansas City, Austin, and Provo all hammered out favorable agreements with Google Fiber, the Internet giant’s ultra-high-speed broadband project, and several other cities have followed suit. Kansas City officials partially credit the arrangement for the city’s ascendancy as a tech hub. Meanwhile, other ISPs have increased their offerings to compete: Verizon and AT&T both recently announced plans to offer higher-speed Internet hookups for customers in select areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, the FCC voted (2–1, along party lines) to begin a review of the 2015 regulations, launching the process by which the current rules could be overturned. Predictions of apocalypse have ensued: Democratic senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii accused Republicans of trying to “end the Internet.” In reality, it is more nearly the opposite. The “Open Internet” regulations promulgated in 2015 threaten to turn the Internet into one more fiefdom of the federal government, and thereby to strangle the impulse toward innovation and improvement. A smarter regulatory framework would make the government a partner to a dynamic, competitive Internet, not an enemy.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nNet Neutrality Is Government Censorship\n\nA Truly ‘Open Internet’ Would Be Free of Burdensome FCC Regulation\n\nU.S. Must Not Allow Russia and China to Threaten Internet Freedom",

Revealing that Chinese regulators consulted with him for information and asked for his opinions prior to announcing the official ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) then subsequently issuing a shutdown to Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHe further speculates that a future collaboration between NEO and the Chinese government is a possibility in the future but doesn’t see the deal happening soon.\n\n“I do not expect the government to call me in the short term and say, ‘Let’s use Neo as the blockchain technology infrastructure in China.’ But in the medium term? Why not?

That's what my Uncle Rando used to say when he'd be passed out on our couch and I'd start jabbin' him with an iron poker cuz I wanted to watch cartoons. He always stank of a slaughterhouse, drank all our beer and one time pissed on the dog. But as much as my mom hated her brother-in-law, she was always patient with him cuz he was family. And that's exactly how teams gotta be with their players and prospects.\n\nNow I know everybody in Colorado is saying, \"Oh yah, Matt Duchene, he was never gonna be traded,\" but is it a coincidence that they're saying that only now that he's playing well and the Avalanche are winning again? The point is, things are so politically correct these days. A player gets caught smoking weed at a concert IN THE SUMMER and the coach dumps the guy.

But then I'd sober up and win the fucking Stanley Cup basically all on my own because I learned my lesson. Think about a guy like Tyler Seguin—he's one in a million and the Bruins were like, \"Oh, he's got the wrong attitude,\" just cuz he liked to giv'r and hated sleep.\n\nIt's not like we're all born a librarian or a barbarian, and a guy can't ever change. You gotta burn some wood to make a fire. I don't really know what that means, but when I was a baby I couldn't build a fire for shit and now I'm pretty good, and I bet Seguin is the same way.\n\nI suppose you're all wondering what happened to my Uncle Rando, right? Well, Rando did some time for theft under $1,000, but then he learned how to jog at the Kingston Penitentiary and now he's a gym teacher. Classic success story.\n\nShe's pretty much common knowledge that the only reason we have the shootout is cuz Gary Bettman was trying to grease up the fans after the big 2004-05 lockout. I'll admit, I was kind of into it at first cuz it was kind of exciting at the time. But it's been ten years now, and the shootout has turned into the hockey version of the bearded lady—cool at first, but we've all seen enough of her, and she's starting to be gross.\n\nREAD MORE: The NHL Must Reinvent Itself to Address the Rapid Decline in Scoring\n\nIn this case, the players (the beard) are the same size, but the goalies (the lady) are getting bigger and bigger. So now what started as a freak show is outta control, cuz we got this huge-assed lady with a tiny little beard and nobody can fuckin' score anymore and now the ringmaster is like, \"OK, let's make the ring bigger.\" FUCK OFF, don't touch the ring, you IDIOTS!! (The ring is the net.)\n\nLook, I'll give you the simplest, pain-free way to increase scoring in the NHL. No need to file down the fuckin' posts into a prism, to carve down the goalie's gear or give the net the penis pump treatment. No. All you gotta do is add Pilsner.\n\nEvery time your team gets a penalty, your goalie has to shotgun a beer. This will guarantee more goals, and might even crack down on the cheap shots. Cuz if you take a stupid double minor in overtime and they score after your goalie shotguns two beers, he's gonna lay a major beat down on yah after the game.

It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach,” the statement read. “Decisions made by officials in the U.S. Attorney’s office and at MIT contributed to his death.”\n\nSwartz, long regarded as one of the major proponents of a free and open Internet to further the spread of information, was indicted in July of 2011 on federal charges of illegally accessing documents on JSTOR, the online digital library that hosts academic journal articles, books and primary sources. His alleged crime involved downloading nearly 5 million articles off the service from MIT’s on-campus network.\n\nHe faced upwards of 30 years in prison, along with $1 million in fines.\n\nAfter Swartz turned over his hard drives, JSTOR decided not to pursue any legal action against him.\n\n“The case is one that we ourselves had regretted being drawn into from the outset, since JSTOR’s mission is to foster widespread access to the world’s body of scholarly knowledge,” JSTOR wrote on Saturday in a statement to the public hosted on its Web site. “At the same time, as one of the largest archives of scholarly literature in the world, we must be careful stewards of the information entrusted to us by the owners and creators of that content. To that end, Aaron returned the data he had in his possession and JSTOR settled any civil claims we might have had against him in June 2011.”\n\nBut U.S. Attorneys Carmen Ortiz and Steve Heymann, backed by Federal government, continued to pursue the prosecution of Swartz, with the tacit support of MIT behind them.\n\nSaid Ortiz in 2011: “Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars.”\n\nEarlier on Saturday, acclaimed academic and friend to Swartz, Lawrence Lessig, suggested that Ortiz’s steadfast pursuit of Swartz was outlandish and unnecessary, and part — though not the direct cause — of what brought Swartz to the grim solution he chose.\n\n“From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way,” Lessig wrote on his personal blog. “… [A]nyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.”\n\nNeither the U.S. Attorney’s office in Massachusetts nor MIT immediately responded to emailed requests for comment.",

The train was bound for Indianapolis and the Third National Soldiers Reunion, where thousands of Union Army veterans planned to rally, reminisce, and march in a parade the New York Times would later describe as “the grandest street display ever seen in the United States.” It was Sept. 19, 1876, more than a decade since the Civil War had ended. Wallace had grayed a bit, but still wore the sweeping imperial moustache he’d had at the Battle of Shiloh. “Is that you, General Wallace?” the man in the nightgown asked. “Won’t you come to my room? I want to talk.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Ingersoll, also a veteran of Shiloh, was now the nation’s most prominent atheist, a renowned orator who toured the country challenging religious orthodoxy and championing a healthy separation of church and state. Wallace recognized him from earlier that summer, when he’d heard Ingersoll, a fellow Republican, make a rousing speech at the party’s nominating convention. Wallace accepted his invitation and suggested they take up a subject near to Ingersoll’s heart: the existence of God.\n\nIngersoll talked until the train reached its destination. “He went over the whole question of the Bible, of the immortality of the soul, of the divinity of God, and of heaven and hell,” Wallace later recalled. “He vomited forth ideas and arguments like an intellectual volcano.” The arguments had a powerful effect on Wallace. Departing the train, he walked the pre-dawn streets of Indianapolis alone. In the past he had been indifferent to religion, but after his talk with Ingersoll his ignorance struck him as problematic, “a spot of deeper darkness in the darkness.” He resolved to devote himself to a study of theology, “if only for the gratification there might be in having convictions of one kind or another.”\n\nBut how to go about such a study? Wallace knew himself well enough to predict that a syllabus of sermons and Biblical commentaries would fail to hold his interest. He devised instead what he called “an incidental employment,” a task that would compel him to complete a thorough investigation of the eternal questions while entertaining his distractible mind. A few years earlier, he’d published a historical romance about the Spanish conquest of Mexico, to modest success. His idea now was to inquire after the divinity of Christ by writing a novel about him.\n\nIt took four years, but in 1880, Wallace finished his incidental employment. He called it Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. It’s one of the great if little known ironies in the history of American literature: Having set out to win another soul to the side of skepticism, Robert Ingersoll instead inspired a Biblical epic that would rival the actual Bible for influence and popularity in Gilded Age America—and a folk story that has been reborn, in one medium or another, in every generation since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nII.\n\nThe ongoing celebration of the Civil War’s 150th anniversary has focused thus far on the conflict’s traditional heroes. Ulysses S. Grant is the subject of a best-selling biography; Abraham Lincoln just won an Oscar. Lew Wallace is not one of those heroes. He lacked Grant’s training and instincts for war, and possessed nothing akin to Lincoln’s political genius or personal charm. Wallace was brave but overconfident on the battlefield, impatient and impertinent off of it. The Union’s two greatest generals, Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, both rebounded from early missteps—Sherman was so spooked after the Union’s defeat at First Bull Run that critics openly questioned his sanity. Wallace, however, couldn’t live down his early stumble, at Shiloh, and spent much of the war on its sidelines.\n\nYet Wallace’s unlikely journey from disgraced general to celebrated author is as thrilling as any story of his era, and his fame in his own lifetime surpassed that of all but a handful of his comrades in arms. Few men participated so completely in the postbellum American experience. Wallace had a Zelig-like knack for insinuating himself into the defining moments of his day. A lawyer by training, he served on the tribunal that tried the Lincoln assassination conspirators and presided over the one that convicted Henry Wirz, the commandant of the notorious prison camp at Andersonville, Ga., and the only Confederate executed for war crimes. During the disputed election of 1876, the Republican Party sent Wallace to oversee the original Florida recount. For his role in delivering the White House to Rutherford B. Hayes, he was rewarded with the governorship of the New Mexico territory. The duties of office included putting down a range war in Lincoln County; among the combatants was William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid. Initially charmed by the young gunslinger, Wallace once asked him for a demonstration of his marksmanship and was impressed by his handling of both six-shooter and rifle. He soon tired of the Kid’s homicidal antics, however, and put a $500 bounty on his head.\n\nHis role in the life and death of Billy the Kid earned Wallace a bit part in the dime novels that burnished the outlaw’s legend, but it was nothing compared to the celebrity his own novel brought him. He had begun the book in his native Indiana, writing in the shade of what would come to be known as the Ben-Hur beech, and would finish it in Santa Fe. At night, after he’d wound down the territory’s affairs, he would retreat to a dismal back room of the adobe governor's palace and bar the doors and windows. Sitting at a rough pine table, he composed the novel’s eighth and final book by the light of a solitary lamp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace’s novel has since been eclipsed in the American imagination by a bronzed, bare-chested Charlton Heston, careening around the Holy Land in William Wyler's 1959 film adaptation of Ben-Hur, which won a record 11 Academy Awards and was a blockbuster hit for MGM. But the book was wildly popular in its day, selling perhaps as many as a million copies in its first three decades in print. The story of the Jewish hero Judah Ben-Hur, whose life Wallace ingeniously intertwined with that of Jesus Christ, captivated readers despite winning little affection from contemporary critics, who found its romanticism passé and its action pulpy. On a visit to Boston, home of the literary old guard, Wallace noted with pique that William Dean Howells, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. all declined invitations to parties held in his honor. “Why did they not come?” he wrote to his wife Susan. “Would their presence have been too much of a sanction or endorsement for the wild westerner?”\n\nBen-Hur found admirers in other high places. Grant, who hadn't picked up a novel in a decade, read Ben-Hur in a single, 30-hour sitting. President James A. Garfield, a former professor of literature, devoured it nearly as fast, stealing chapters between meetings. He woke at 5:30 one morning so he could finish it in bed. \"With this beautiful and reverent book you have lightened the burden of my daily life,” he wrote to Wallace later that same day. Ben-Hur’s publisher, Harper & Brothers, soon produced a Garfield Edition, with the president’s letter reproduced as a foreword; the lavishly illustrated two-volume set sold for a then astronomical $30.\n\nThe novel’s readership wasn’t confined to Union veterans. In an Indiana newspaper, the historian S. Chandler Lighty discovered Varina Davis’ account of reading Ben-Hur aloud to her father “from 10 o’clock until daybreak, both of us oblivious to the flight of time.” Her father was Jefferson Davis, the former Confederate president. Men and women on both sides of the Mason-Dixon could enjoy Wallace’s tale of martial virtue set safely in the distant past and embrace its message of Christly compassion triumphing over Old Testament vengeance. The story of Ben-Hur’s success is, in part, the story of how Americans put the divisions of the war behind them in the waning days of Reconstruction.\n\nIt’s also the story of how they welcomed a new era of economic opportunity. Among other things, Ben-Hur is a rags-to-riches story, in the mode of Wallace’s contemporary, Horatio Alger. Judah’s virtuousness is tested, and richly rewarded, throughout the novel. The Gospel of Matthew teaches that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. In Ben-Hur, Wallace suggests that piety brings with it prosperity—an alluring prospect to readers eager to take part in Gilded Age affluence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace himself had struggled financially through much of his life. His correspondence is full of enthusiastic accounts of railroad investments and mining prospects that never pan out; he patented unprofitable improvements to railway ties, automatic fans, and the fishing rod. But Ben-Hur opened the doors of opportunity. The novel so impressed President Garfield that he offered Wallace the position of minister plenipotentiary to the Ottoman Empire (annual salary: a princely $7,500) and encouraged him, when not attending to U.S. interests, to gather material for a new novel. By the time Wallace returned from Constantinople four years later, Ben-Hur had become Harper & Brothers’ top-selling title. A steady stream of royalty checks freed Wallace from the practice of law (“that most detestable of occupations,” he called it) and from his creditors. “I contemplate with great satisfaction the pains that will wrench his little pigeon heart when he hears that all my debts are paid,” Wallace wrote of one of them, his brother-in-law.\n\nCourtesy of Indiana Historical Society, M0292\n\nWallace enjoyed his newfound wealth. He built the finest luxury apartment building in Indianapolis—the Blacherne, named for an imperial palace in Constantinople—and kept a grand apartment for himself. Next to his home in nearby Crawfordsville he erected an idiosyncratic study—Ben-Hur’s face peers out from a frieze above the entrance—where he could pursue his avocations. He played the violin and made his instruments by hand. He was also an accomplished visual artist. During the Lincoln conspiracy trial, Wallace passed the time making sketches of the accused, which he later used as the basis for a large oil painting. Having grown up in the woods of the Old Northwest, he was an avid outdoorsman, and spent much of his leisure time hunting and fishing at his newly acquired game preserve, Water Babble.\n\nYet for all the worldly comfort Ben-Hur brought its author, Wallace was restless. He wasn’t just a writer of romances; he was a romantic himself, with a chivalric sense of honor, and he was plagued by the blot left on his reputation by the Battle of Shiloh. That battle, in which 26,000 men were killed or wounded, scarred all of its participants. Robert Ingersoll, then a Union cavalryman, spent the first day corralling infantry as they fled the slaughter of the front lines; when a storm broke that evening, he wrote that the rain fell \"slowly and sadly, as though the heavens were weeping for the dead.\" Even the usually imperturbable Grant was taken aback. Writing of Shiloh in his memoirs, he recalled a field “so covered with dead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing, in any direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.” Shiloh wouldn’t be the bloodiest fight of the war, but it was the first to intimate the horrors to come, and it dispelled any hope of a quick end to hostilities. After Shiloh, Grant wrote, “I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest.”\n\nIt’s difficult to comprehend death on this scale; now try to imagine being blamed for it. On April 5, 1862, Lew Wallace had been the youngest major general in the Union Army, a promising if brash officer who’d fought ably during the early months of the conflict. But on April 6, when the Confederates attacked and nearly succeeded in overrunning Grant’s Army of the Tennessee, Wallace failed to bring his sorely needed troops to the field of battle, and he shouldered a heavy portion of the blame for the dire toll. He was rumored to have gotten lost on the short journey to Shiloh’s front lines—or worse, to have lost his nerve. Within a few months, he was relieved of his field command. He spent the rest of the war trying to win back the confidence of his superiors and the rest of his life trying to prove his innocence. In Ben-Hur, Wallace had written a novel that would help America forget the Civil War. But its author never could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIII.\n\nOne of Lew Wallace’s earliest memories was of hiding amid a hillside stand of ironweed and watching his father drill the local militia of Covington, Ind. The Sauk leader Black Hawk was doing battle with settlers in neighboring Illinois—where a young Abraham Lincoln had volunteered for service—but his campaign to win back his people’s land would soon be defeated, to the relief of Covington’s home guard. Though David Wallace was a West Point graduate, most of his men carried umbrellas and cornstalks in lieu of muskets during their training exercises. To his 5-year-old son, however, “nothing of military circumstances half so splendid and inspiring had ever taken place.”\n\nThe Wallaces were a prominent if not a wealthy family. David, a lawyer, would eventually serve a term as Indiana’s governor and move his family to the state capital. But Lew spent much of his boyhood in the country, on what was then still the American frontier. In his posthumously published autobiography, he describes a boy who would have been at home in Tom Sawyer’s gang, forever fleeing instructors and marching off to do imaginary battle with a sword made of old clapboards. In 1842, when Wallace learned of Texas’ War of Independence, he and a friend provisioned a canoe and set out down the White River to offer their services to James Bowie and Davy Crockett. Lew’s grandfather apprehended them a few miles downriver. Wallace was 15.\n\nCourtesy of Indiana Historical Society, M0292\n\nThough he disdained the schoolhouse, Wallace was from an early age an avid reader, consuming the works that would shape his literary sensibility and further whet his appetite for war. The romances of Sir Walter Scott and Jane Porter’s account of William Wallace’s heroism in the face of British oppression made him long for a chance to prove his own mettle. In the meantime, he would carry himself like a goodly knight. A neighbor described him as having “the bearing of a soldier and the manners of a courtier.” That courtly manner, and his striking good looks—tall, sinewy, with “a dark and beautiful face, correct in every line,” in the words of one admirer—would help him win the hand of Susan Elston, who married Wallace despite her father’s dim view of his prospects and memories of prior offences. As a boy, Wallace had snuck into the stately Elston home to behold two domestic items unfamiliar to him: a sofa and a piano.\n\nWith reluctance, Wallace followed his father into the legal profession, and he was preparing for the bar exam when the United States declared war with Mexico in 1846. The 19-year-old tried to complete his studies, but his mind was already in Matamoros. “Of what consequence was a license to practice law?” he wrote. “How petty the soul which could be screwed down to prefer a court to a camp!” In his autobiography, which unlike his fiction admits a touch of humor, he recalled appending a note to his hastily completed bar exam:\n\n“Dear Sir,—I hope the foregoing answers will be to your satisfaction more than they are to mine; whether or not, I shall go to Mexico.”\n\nA few days later, the examining judge replied:\n\n“Dear Sir,—The court interposes no objection to your going to Mexico.”\n\n“The communication was unaccompanied by a license,” Wallace wrote. He volunteered his services to the U.S. Army.\n\nWallace imagined the conquest of Mexico would be full of the “gallantries” he’d read about in novels. Instead, his regiment was ordered to garrison an unnamed camp at the mouth of the Rio Grande, across the river from a small Mexican smuggler’s outpost, which the soldiers called “Bagdad.” The camp was soon beset with an epidemic of diarrhea so fatal that the survivors ran out of wood for coffins. The men heard of Gen. Zachary Taylor’s victories from passing steamboats. But if Mexico failed to live up to Wallace’s romantic notions of war, it also failed to disabuse him of them.\n\nIV.\n\nWhen he returned from Mexico, Wallace hung a black-and-white shingle outside a small office in Covington advertising his services as a lawyer. Though he’d finally acquired a license to practice, business was not brisk. One day, Wallace accompanied a colleague to a tavern in nearby Danville, Ill. There the young lawyers met a man Wallace described as “the gauntest, quaintest, and most positively ugly man who had ever attracted me enough to call for study.” The man was engaged in a storytelling contest with several local lawyers, and, despite his rough aspect, was running away with the competition, exhausting all comers with a seemingly endless store of well-spun yarns. It was Wallace’s first glimpse of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nBy the time Lincoln was inaugurated in 1861, Wallace’s fortunes had improved slightly. He had worked as a prosecutor, won election to the state Senate, and defected from the Democratic Party to the Republican, more out of a commitment to the Union, and a growing admiration for Lincoln, than any ardent abolitionist feeling. When Fort Sumter came under fire in April, Indiana’s Republican governor, Oliver P. Morton, called on Wallace to help him organize Indiana’s volunteers, a duty Wallace accepted on the condition that he might command one of the state’s six regiments once they’d been mustered. Morton agreed, and Wallace was commissioned a colonel. He was about to get his second taste of war, and his first chance to realize his dream of winning honor in the line of duty.\n\nIn a full-page illustration by Winslow Homer, published in Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly in 1861, Wallace sits astride his horse in a pair of billowing trousers, an exotic-looking kepi perched on his head. He is wearing the uniform of the Zouave, elite units of the French Army that borrowed their tactics and uniform style from Algerian fighters. Zouaves moved swiftly, reloaded their weapons on the ground (as opposed to making a target of themselves standing up), and communicated by bugle calls rather than verbal orders, which could be drowned out in the din of war. According to Robert and Katharine Morsberger, Wallace’s most comprehensive biographers, he first encountered the Zouaves in a magazine article. The modified tactics must have pleased Wallace the tinkerer; the uniforms surely satisfied his taste for pageantry. When he’d taken command of the 11th Indiana volunteers, he’d resolved to train and outfit his men in the manner of the Zouave.\n\nCourtesy of Indiana Historical Society, P0455\n\nIn June, before the war’s first major battle was fought at Bull Run, Wallace’s regiment was ordered to Cumberland, Md. to support Union activities in the vicinity of Harper’s Ferry, then in rebel hands. Alerted to the presence of a Confederate garrison in a nearby town, Wallace decided to put his Zouaves into action. After a 20-mile march under cover of darkness, the 11th Indiana surprised a small unit of Confederates holed up in the town of Romney, in what is now West Virginia. The regiment’s unfamiliar tactics “frightened the rebels and they all took to their heels like scared cats,” as one of Wallace’s men put it in a letter cited by Gail Stephens, a student of Wallace’s military career. The enemy withdrew after a brief skirmish, leaving behind their supplies and slaves. A Zouave who sustained minor injuries after being shot in the belt buckle represented the lone Union casualty.\n\nThe victory at Romney was of minor strategic value, but it was early evidence that the Union Army could hold its own against the vaunted rebels and, to Wallace, proof of his ability as a commander. A friend in Washington told Wallace that President Lincoln had spoken of his “splendid dash on Romney.” Harper’s Weekly sent an illustrator to make a series of drawings of the now famous 11th Indiana. Depicting scenes of after-hours horseplay—one Zouave bounds around camp on a pair stilts—they capture the innocence of that early moment in the war.\n\nIn his autobiography, Wallace writes that the acclaim the Zouaves won at Romney “astonished nobody so much as ourselves.” But that has the ring of revisionist modesty. Wallace never lacked for confidence, even as an inexperienced volunteer. In the months that followed, he wrote to Susan despairing of the war’s progress (“defeat follows defeat—mismanagement after mismanagement”) and offering detailed explanations of how he would quickly bring the Confederacy to its knees were he in command.\n\nAfter his success at Romney, Wallace was sent to the war’s western theater, where Grant was preparing for his invasion of Tennessee. Wallace was rising rapidly through the ranks—he was soon promoted to brigadier general—but was impatient for further glory and frequently unhappy with the role he was assigned in the campaign. After being left on guard duty during the army’s initial advance on Fort Donelson, Wallace grumbled to Grant’s aide-de-camp, a Captain Hillyer. “You are not going to be left behind,” Hillyer reassured him. “I know Gen. Grant's views. He intends to give you a chance to be shot in every important move.” Wallace’s eagerness to lead every charge would only make his disappearance at Shiloh that much harder to fathom.\n\nV.\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston found himself in an unenviable position. After a series of defeats at the hands of Grant, the rebels had been forced to yield central Tennessee and consolidate their forces in Corinth, Miss., home to a strategic railroad crossing. Johnston commanded a force about 40,000 strong; Grant, encamped 20 miles north on the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing and Shiloh Church, had 40,000 men of his own, though he was soon to be reinforced with 35,000 more from Don Carlos Buell’s Army of the Ohio. The dilemma before Johnston was whether to dig in at Corinth and wait for a superior Union army to advance, or to bring the fight to Grant while the odds were still close to even.\n\nCourtesy of Library of Congress\n\nJohnston chose to attack, hoping the element of surprise would tilt the balance in the Confederates’ favor. The relative ease with which Grant had pushed the rebels out of Tennessee had certainly left him complacent. The Union general had decided against entrenching; despite being deep in enemy territory, Grant felt the initiative was his. He did, however, take the precaution of posting Lew Wallace and his 7,500 men 6 miles upriver, where they could keep an eye on the Union flank.\n\nAt dawn on the morning of April 6, a patrol of Federal scouts made an unhappy discovery: Thousands of men in gray uniforms advancing on Union soldiers who were just sitting down to breakfast. When word of the attack reached Grant, he ordered Wallace’s Third Division to help turn back the surging Confederates, who were overrunning the hastily assembled Union lines. But Wallace never showed.\n\nWallace’s detractors would later claim that he had simply lost his way in the Tennessee woods. The truth is more complicated. From Crump’s Landing, where he’d been stationed, there were two roads leading to the Union front: one that hugged the river to Pittsburg Landing, the other a so-called shunpike that led to Shiloh Church, where Sherman was camped. Having surveyed his position in the days prior to the Confederate attack, Wallace had judged the shunpike to be the most passable, and had ordered his cavalry to make further improvements to it in case he needed to march his division quickly to the front.\n\nIt was around 11 a.m. when Grant’s summons reached Wallace. Grant’s order, issued verbally and transcribed and delivered by an aide, was lost in the course of the battle; its contents would become the subject of acrimonious debate. Grant claimed that he ordered Wallace to march to Pittsburg Landing, via the river road. Wallace said the order simply instructed him to join up with the right of the Union lines. He took the shunpike.\n\nIn her thorough study of Wallace’s military career, Shadow of Shiloh (2010), Gail Stephens makes a compelling case that Wallace’s version of events is the most logical. Timothy B. Smith, a former Park Ranger at the battlefield and a historian who has written extensively on Shiloh, agrees. Wallace may have enjoyed playing armchair general-in-chief in his letters to Susan, but he was not in the habit of disobeying orders, and he’d never shown anything but an appetite for battle. (Grant had made good on his promise to put Wallace in the line of fire at Fort Donelson, and his poised performance had earned him another promotion, to major general, then the highest rank in the army.) Wallace had also made his preference for the shunpike known prior to the Confederate attack, alerting the commander of the neighboring division of his plans to use that road, though that information never reached Grant. It seems likely that either due to a mistaken assumption on Grant’s part (that Wallace would necessarily take the river road), or an omission on the part of his messenger, Wallace believed his orders were to join up with the Union army as quickly as possible, and he chose the road he believed best suited to that task.\n\nWhat Wallace didn’t know was that by the time his men began marching, the Union army was no longer where he thought it was. Sherman’s position had been overrun, pushed back toward the river. Had Wallace marched to the end of the shunpike he’d have found himself behind enemy lines, cut off from the rest of the Union army. Impatient for Wallace to arrive, Grant sent an aide to speed his progress around 1:00. The aide found him on the shunpike, headed unwittingly toward the Confederate rear. Informed of the new disposition of Union forces, Wallace reversed course and marched his men to the new lines. He arrived as night was falling, too late to fire a shot in the first day’s fight.\n\nVI.\n\n“Well, we’ve had the devil’s own day, haven’t we?” Sherman is said to have remarked to Grant on the night of April 6. “Yes,” Grant replied. “Lick ’em tomorrow, though.” With Wallace’s division finally in place, and Buell’s reinforcements having arrived overnight, Grant unleashed a vicious counterattack on April 7, pushing the rebels back over ground still littered with the dead and dying from the previous day’s fight. Realizing they were now outnumbered, the Confederates beat a retreat in the afternoon.\n\nCourtesy of Library of Congress\n\nShiloh was initially hailed as a Union triumph. Among the Confederate dead was Albert Sidney Johnston, who’d been shot while leading his men in a charge; he would be the highest-ranking officer on either side to be killed in action during the war. But as casualty figures made their way north, newspapers began to portray the battle as a scandalous failure. Questions arose regarding Grant’s competence; there were rumors he’d been drunk during the battle. Lincoln’s famous quip about Grant—“I can’t spare this man; he fights”—came in the wake of Shiloh, as members of Congress, and even the governor of Grant’s home state of Ohio, called for his head.\n\nGrant’s career survived Shiloh; Wallace’s did not. The north needed someone to blame for the heavy casualties, which exceeded those of all the war’s previous battles combined. Wallace’s “dilatoriness” gave Grant cover for his own lack of preparedness, and he implicated Wallace in his official reports. The press, with the help of Grant’s staff, grabbed hold of the story of the missing division. Though Wallace received no official reprimand for his actions, by July he had been relieved of his field command. He spent the rest of 1862 and all of 1863 a general without an army—and worse, for Wallace, a soldier robbed of his honor.\n\nHe spent his idle time ill-advisedly, peppering the Union command with letters, maps, and affidavits in an attempt to clear his name. His superiors had other things to worry about, and largely ignored him. At one point Wallace demanded a court of inquiry to investigate his actions at Shiloh. He was only talked out of it by Sherman, who knew Wallace well enough to play expertly on his vanities.\n\n“Keep quiet as possible and trust to opportunity for a becoming sequel to the brilliant beginning you had,” he wrote. “I do not think that Gen. Grant or any officer has unkind feelings toward you, [though some] may have been envious of your early and brilliant career.” Sherman prescribed a course of political expedience: “Avoid all controversies, bear patiently temporary reverses, get into the current events as quick as possible, and hold your horses for the last home stretch.”\n\nVII.\n\nSherman was right. Wallace did get a chance at redemption in the last home stretch. In the summer of 1864, the Confederate general Jubal Early made a dash for Washington. Grant had left the city largely undefended as he tried to pin Lee down at Petersburg, Va. Wallace, then stationed in Baltimore, was the only man between 13,000 Confederates and the Union capital. Piecing together a rag-tag army of 6,000, he fought a hopeless battle at Monocacy Junction, yet managed in defeat to slow Early’s advance for a crucial day, buying time for Grant to send reinforcements. Were it not for Wallace’s stand, the capital might have fallen. A Navy warship had been idling near the Sixth Street docks to speed Lincoln to safety.\n\nGrant praised Wallace’s actions and warmed to him personally. One day, he invited Wallace to visit him at his headquarters in Virginia. Wallace arrived on his horse Old John, a red bay with white feet and a piebald face. The horse was unusually tall and unusually fast. “Old John in full gallop looked like the incarnation of the wrath to come,” said a friend who had seen him in action. He was beloved by Wallace and by his men. At Fort Donelson, Old John had gone without forage for two days. Wallace’s soldiers crumbled up their hard tack, put it in their hats, and offered it to the general’s horse.\n\nGrant and Wallace rode out to inspect a fort on the left of the Union lines. Grant, a gifted horseman, admired Old John and proposed a race back to camp. Wallace assented, but reined his horse in as the race began. “Let him out!” barked Grant, seeing that he was being afforded a handicap. Wallace did as he was ordered, and though Grant was in a furious gallop, Old John easily sprinted ahead. After a mile or two, Grant called a halt—and offered to buy Old John on the spot. Wallace refused. “Neither love nor money,” he said, “can buy Old John.”\n\nPhoto by Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nAn account of the impromptu race appeared in the Denver News on Feb. 19, 1905, a few days after Wallace had died. The article was written by J. Farrand Tuttle Jr., the son of the president of Wabash College (located in Wallace’s hometown of Crawfordsville) and a friend of the family. Wallace himself never wrote of the race. Perhaps, in a rare demonstration of tact, he realized it wasn’t to his advantage to brag of beating Grant at a favorite pastime. Or perhaps Tuttle was merely relaying a local legend, a story passed around the Wallace paddock.\n\nOr maybe Wallace did write of the race, but only under the veil of fiction. In every incarnation—novel, play, the 1925 silent film, Wyler’s 1959 spectacle—Ben-Hur’s most celebrated scene has always been the chariot race between Judah and his friend-turned-rival Messala. Early in the story, Messala betrays his boyhood companion, accusing Judah of a crime he didn’t commit: the attempted murder of Judea’s Roman governor. After years of suffering in exile, Judah is afforded an opportunity to avenge himself in the arena. Though Messala is heralded as the greatest charioteer in the empire, he can’t contain the superior horsemanship of Judah, who rides to victory.\n\nIt’s hard not to read some wish fulfillment into Judah’s triumph. In the wake of the chariot race, Judah is cleared of the charges that have tarnished his good name, and, having goaded Messala into betting heavily against him, his victory also wins him a fortune to rival the emperor’s. Whatever satisfaction Wallace may have felt racing Grant through the fields of Virginia, it did nothing to improve his reputation or finances. But Ben-Hur would indeed fulfill its author’s wishes, making him fantastically wealthy and dimming the memory of Shiloh—in the public imagination if not Wallace’s own.\n\nVIII.\n\nBen-Hur wasn’t an immediate success. Sales were slow for the first few months as the book absorbed mixed reviews. With its story of a noble prince endeavoring to save his family and restore his good name (winning the heart of a humble but beautiful Jewess in the process), the novel resembled the romances Wallace had loved as a child, which had long since fallen out of critical favor. With its chariot race and sea battle, it shared something with the dime novels then enjoying wide popularity but no literary esteem. Always a lover of the bold stroke, Wallace had written out his final manuscript in purple ink, a color his critics would have found apt for some of the novel’s loftier passages.\n\nCourtesy of Indiana Historical Society, M0292\n\nYet what the critics dismissed the reading public soon came to love. Tracking book sales in the 19th century is an inexact science, but the Morsbergers, Wallace’s biographers, estimate that Harper Brothers sold a million copies of the novel between 1880 and 1912; in 1913, Sears, Roebuck ordered a million more, at the time the largest book order ever placed. James David Hart’s The Popular Book: A History of America’s Literary Taste (1950) cites a study conducted in 1893, which found that only three contemporary novels were held by more than 50 percent of public libraries. Ben-Hur was first among them, present in 83 percent of the collections surveyed. (The other two were Little Lord Fauntleroy and Ramona.) “If every American didn’t read the novel, almost everyone was aware of it,” Hart concludes.\n\nCarl Van Doren, in The American Novel (1921), credited Ben-Hur with winning “practically the ultimate victory over village opposition to the novel,” arguing that it was likely the first work of fiction many Americans ever read—or at least the second, after Uncle Tom’s Cabin. As Howard Miller, a professor emeritus of history and religious studies at the University of Texas, has argued, if Harriet Beecher Stowe’s novel played a role in dividing the Union in the 1850s, “Wallace's Ben-Hur helped to reunite the nation in the years following Reconstruction.”\n\nWallace’s novel is about the visceral thrill of vengeance and the spiritual thrill of forgiveness. The chariot race is rightly the most famous scene in Wallace’s novel, a stirring set piece and a surprise if you’ve only ever seen the 1959 movie. In Wyler’s film, Messala outfits his chariot with vicious metal spikes that shred the wooden wheels of his competition. Hollywood’s Messala is a villain through and through, not only responsible for Judah’s exile, but a cheater in the arena too. But in the novel, Judah is the aggressor, running down Messala’s chariot, wrecking it from behind with \"the iron-shod point of his axle\" and leaving its driver to be trampled by oncoming horses.\n\nHaving vanquished Messala in the Antioch arena, Judah sets out for Jerusalem to continue his campaign of retribution, a Jewish William Wallace bent on freeing Judea from its Roman oppressors. But when he arrives in the Holy Land he encounters a rabbi from Nazareth, a man promising not an earthly kingdom but a heavenly one. (Lest Judah have any doubt as to the truth of the rabbi’s teachings, the Nazarene cures his mother and sister of the leprosy they’ve conveniently contracted while wasting away in a Roman jail.) After witnessing Jesus’ arrest and crucifixion, Judah lays down his sword and instead takes up the work of honoring Christ’s message of forbearance. The novel closes with Judah deciding to spend his vast wealth to finance a catacomb where Christian martyrs can be buried and venerated.\n\nOffering the satisfaction of a revenge plot while preaching the gospel of compassion, Ben-Hur resonated with a country that was moving from vengeance to forgiveness itself. The National Soldiers Reunion that Wallace and Ingersoll attended in 1876, at the tail end of Reconstruction, was a strictly Union event, with speeches and parades honoring the North’s just cause. But at the Reunion held just two years later, in Cincinnati, blue mingled with gray: Joe Johnston, John Bell Hood, and Robert E. Lee’s nephew Fitzhugh were among the invitees, and the order of the day was celebrating the heroism of combatants on both sides of the conflict. Ex-rebels were now in the halls of power as well. Wallace’s first official duty as minister to Turkey was to relieve his predecessor—Former Gen. James Longstreet, the trusted Lee lieutenant who had fought at Chickamauga, Antietam, and Gettysburg. After the war, Longstreet had joined the Republican Party and been embraced by his former enemies.\n\nCourtesy of General Lew Wallace Study and Museum\n\nThe details of Wallace’s interview with Longstreet are lost to history, but it’s likely the meeting was cordial. Wallace had presided over what would be the Union’s only act of retributive justice after Appomattox: the trial of Henry Wirz, the commandant of Andersonville. If he had any misgivings about executing Wirz (whose degree of culpability for the camp’s atrocities has long been a matter of dispute), he didn’t record them. The drawing he made during the proceedings—of a Union soldier who’d been shot while trying to get a drink of clean water—suggests he was content to see the commandant hang. But by 1880 Wallace harbored no grudge against his former adversaries; on the contrary, ever the romantic, he held the sacrifices they made in high esteem. Speaking at the dedication of the Chickamauga battlefield, he described the Confederates as having made “an honest mistake.” He encouraged his audience to remember “not the cause, but the heroism it invoked.”\n\nWallace’s admiration for the heroes of the Lost Cause seeped into his novel. As the literary historian David S. Reynolds has noted, in Ben-Hur’s portrait of the Jewish people, readers in the American South could find a subjugated, slave-holding, and yet noble people sympathetically described. And indeed, despite being authored by a Union general, the book found an avid readership in the former Confederacy, making Ben-Hur among the first mass entertainments to transfix all corners of the reborn nation. One of the earliest fan letters Wallace received came from Paul Hamilton Hayne, a respected poet and editor and a Confederate veteran. “It is—me judice—a noble and very powerful prose poem!” Hayne wrote. “Simple, straightforward, but eloquent.”\n\nWallace was thrilled to learn that a former rebel had enjoyed his novel. In his reply to Hayne, he expressed delight at receiving such high praise from “the Singer of the South.” He then delicately asked the poet if he had any objections to Wallace’s publishing the letter. After his long string of financial failures, he was eager to join in the prosperity of the nascent Gilded Age, and hoped testimonials like Hayne’s would help him move copies.\n\nFor Wallace as for many Americans, the profit motive had extinguished any lingering sectional enmity. That Judah Ben-Hur finds Christ and wins a great fortune was surely not lost on the novel’s newly affluent readers, North and South. (The most popular of the many of novels of Christ that followed in Ben-Hur’s wake picked up this theme; In His Steps (1897) imagined a small town whose citizens earn spiritual and financial reward by constantly asking themselves “what would Jesus do?”)\n\nBen-Hur’s action-packed middle section undoubtedly accounted for much of its popularity, but the novel also benefitted greatly from its interpretation of the life of Christ, which opens and closes the novel. As Reynolds demonstrates in his study of American religious literature, Faith in Fiction (1981), Biblical novels had already begun to flourish in America by the time Wallace sat down to write Ben-Hur, books like David Ingraham’s epistolary novel The Prince of the House of David (1855) and William Ware’s Julian: Or, Scenes in Judea (1856). But Ben-Hur was among the first American novels to make Jesus a full-fledged character in its story.\n\nWallace was in some ways cautious in his treatment of Jesus: His speaking part is small, and the dialog is taken verbatim from the King James Bible. But in other ways Wallace was daring. At the outset of Judah’s trials, as he’s being marched off to slavery, a young man in Nazareth wordlessly offers the prisoner a drink of water:\n\n“...looking up, [Judah] saw a face he never forgot—the face of a boy about his own age, shaded by locks of yellowish bright chestnut hair; a face lighted by dark-blue eyes, at the time so soft, so appealing, so full of love and holy purpose, that they had all the power of command and will.”\n\nThe scene is remarkable for having been created out of whole cloth; inventing occurrences in the life of Jesus simply wasn’t done in 19th-century Biblical fiction. It’s also notable for its detailed physical portrait of Christ, who is described as he’d rarely been before, in the Gospels or elsewhere. Wallace wrote of the pallor of Jesus’ complexion, the “reddish golden” highlights the sun leaves in that chestnut hair, and even the impressive length of his eyelashes. Iras, the novel’s femme fatale, derisively refers to Jesus as “the man with the woman’s face”—perhaps with a touch of jealousy.\n\nWallace was equally attentive to the geography, topography, and even flora and fauna of ancient Judea. (Rarely in American fiction has the camel been described so extravagantly.) He spent long hours researching the setting of his story, travelling to libraries in Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston. When he later traveled to Jerusalem during his term as minister to Turkey, he congratulated himself on his accuracy: “At every point of the journey over which I traced [Judah’s] steps to Jerusalem, I found the descriptive details true to the existing objects and scenes.”\n\nWallace’s careful descriptions are not incidental to the novel’s appeal. He made the figure of Christ, and the times in which he lived, come alive for readers at a moment when faith was under assault, by the speeches of Robert Ingersoll, the writings of Charles Darwin, and the lingering trauma of the Civil War. “The horrors of battle and the magnitude of the carnage were difficult to put aside,” writes Drew Gilpin Faust in This Republic of Suffering (2008). “The force of loss left even many believers unable to abandon lingering uncertainties about God’s benevolence.” One of the only rivals to Ben-Hur’s popularity in the 19th century was Elizabeth Stuart Phelps’ The Gates Ajar (1868), which painted for its readers a detailed, and comforting, portrait of the heaven that awaited the thousands of dead soldiers. In Ben-Hur, Wallace gave readers a flesh-and-blood Jesus who walked through a realistically rendered landscape, reassuring the wavering reader of Christ’s divinity by making the case for his historicity.\n\nLetters Wallace received from readers attest to the novel’s descriptive power. “The messiah appears before us as I always wished him depicted to men,” wrote a Roman Catholic priest. “The various descriptions surpassed in their attraction, glowing colors, and truthfulness all I have ever read before.” According to a contemporary newspaper account, pastors and school superintendents were fond of pointing out that “the most vivid picture of the Holy Land in the time of Christ was in Ben-Hur.” As a result, “no boy who went to Sunday school could have escaped the story if he tried.” (Teachers who ignored the novel may have done so at their peril. In Anne of Green Gables (1908), the young heroine sneaks Ben-Hur into her Canadian history class. “I had just got to the chariot race when school went in,” she later confesses. “I was simply wild to know how it turned out.”)\n\nThe novel had a strong effect on its readers, young and old. “I feel that I am a better man for having read it,” wrote Samuel Moore to the author, on the stationery of Moore, Morgan & Co, Wholesale Dry Goods and Notions of Lafayette, Ind. “In my knowledge of books it has but one superior, and that is The Book.” For others, it accomplished what even the Bible could not. Perhaps the most remarkable response Wallace received was from a man named George Parrish, a self-described “drunkard” who had lost everything to his addiction. “I had no future to hope for,” he wrote to Wallace from a YMCA in Kewanee, Ill. “No past but of which I was ashamed.” Ben-Hur, however, inspired Parrish to find religion, and recovery. “It seemed to bring Christ home to me as nothing else could,” he explained, and “resting on his strength, I stood up again in this community and was a man.” Parrish wrote that it had been a year since he read the novel, and he’d “faltered” not once in that time. “I want to thank you for that book,” he wrote to Wallace. “Thank you as a man who has come up from midnight into midday.”\n\nIX.\n\nAs the novel’s popularity spread, theater companies hoping to bring Ben-Hur to Broadway besieged author and publisher with lucrative offers. But Wallace was reluctant. He worried that audiences would not permit a depiction of Christ on stage. (In 1879, a passion play in San Francisco had landed its star in jail, still wearing his halo.) But years of lobbying by the New York producers Marc Klaw and Abraham Erlanger eventually broke him down. The agreement between the parties stipulated that no actor would play the role of Jesus. He would instead be represented by a 25,000-candlepower light.\n\nCourtesy of Library of Congress\n\nThe play was a runaway hit, a fixture of Broadway and the regional theater for the next 20 years. And like the novel, it soon overcame any clerical objections. One clergyman wrote to Wallace of “the immense missionary work Ben-Hur has done. I am sure the author will receive the blessing of the Master of the Harvest for the countess souls his labor has garnered.” William Jennings Bryan called it “the greatest play on stage when measured by its religious tone and moral effect.” The evangelist Billy Sunday liked it so much that he volunteered his services as a spokesman.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just a hit in New York; like the novel, it found a truly national audience. Regional theaters were so eager to host the show that they conducted renovations in order to accommodate the elaborate production. In the 1904-05 season alone it played in Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Columbus, St. Louis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Galveston, Houston, New Orleans, Mobile, Birmingham, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Chicago, Louisville, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, and the former Confederate capital, Richmond. If the novel had introduced many Americans to fiction-reading, the play introduced even more to the theater. Newspaper accounts of the traveling production describe audiences filled with first-timers, many of them devout churchgoers who’d previously been suspicious of the stage. Texas’ Howard Miller, an expert on the play, points to newspaper coverage of a 1907 performance in Toledo, Ohio. When the curtain fell after the crucifixion, many in the rapt audience failed to applaud—not because they hadn’t enjoyed the production, but because they weren’t accustomed to clapping for Christ.\n\nKlaw and Erlanger had created an impressive spectacle, with a massive cast, a reverent treatment of the Christ story, and exhilarating interpretations of the novel’s action scenes. The chariot race was performed using real horses, which galloped on hidden treadmills—a not-unprecedented trick, but a breathtaking one nonetheless. As had been the case with its source, the play failed to impress critics (“the piece rises above the level of ordinary melodrama in only two or three scenes,” wrote the New York Times), but audiences couldn’t stay away. Miller notes that for many Americans, seeing Ben-Hur became an annual rite, akin to Christmastime pilgrimages to The Nutcracker today. Irving McKee, Wallace’s first biographer, estimated that by the time the show’s two-decade run came to an end, 20 million people had seen it.\n\nWallace was awestruck when he first saw the Ben-Hur stage sets. “My God,” he said. “Did I set all of this in motion?” What he had set in motion was an entertainment that had reached more Americans than perhaps any other story save the original tale of the Christ. Though he couldn’t know it, Ben-Hur’s success on stage augured its future as a blockbuster silent film in 1925 and feature film in 1959—few folk stories in American history have proved as durable. Wallace, however, remained convinced that his legacy had been written not under the Ben-Hur beech but on the road to Shiloh Church.\n\nX.\n\nIn 1884, Century Magazine commissioned a series of firsthand accounts of Civil War battles. With his literary star on the rise, Wallace was asked to contribute one of the first, on Fort Donelson. His article appeared in December, alongside serial installments of Huckleberry Finn and William Dean Howells’ The Rise of Silas Lapham. Whatever satisfaction Wallace took in keeping such august company was soon replaced by apprehension, however, when he learned that Grant, deeply in debt and suffering from cancer, had also agreed to write for the Century series after years of refusing to revisit the war. His subject would be Shiloh. Wallace’s ignominious role in the fight threatened to return to the national stage.\n\nPhoto by Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nWallace wrote Grant imploring him to use the article as an occasion to absolve him of wrongdoing. The letter left no argument for his blamelessness unexplored. He reminded Grant that he’d fought bravely at Donelson and acted with dispatch to save Washington in 1864. He asked Grant to consider what motive he possibly could have had to “play you falsely that day.” He even suggested that had Grant’s aide, Rowley, not caught up to him on the shunpike, Wallace might have saved the day at Shiloh. In wistful detail, he painted a counterfactual history of April 6 in which he bravely charged the Confederate lines from the rear. It reads like a page out of one of his novels:\n\n“The enemy had used the last of his reserves. I would have taken the bluff on which Sherman had been camped in the morning and without opposition affected my deployment. The first of the rebels struck would have been the horde plundering the sutlers and drinking in the streets of the camp. Their fears would have magnified my command …”\n\nNot trusting that his letter would have its desired effect, Wallace also visited Grant to plead with him in person. His talent for horning in on history did not fail him. He arrived on the same day that Twain was paying a call to the former president, bearing an offer to publish his memoirs (and to pay his friend a handsome 70 percent royalty). “There’s many a woman in this land that would like to be in my place,” said Julia Grant when the two callers met in the parlor, “and be able to tell her children that she once sat elbow to elbow with two such great authors as Mark Twain and General Wallace.”\n\nOnly one of the great authors got his wish that day. Grant’s article not only failed to absolve Wallace, it reaffirmed his conviction that the Third Division had taken the wrong road and that its absence had cost the Union dearly on the first day of fighting. It was worse than perhaps even Wallace had dared to fear.\n\nShortly after the article was published, however, Grant had a change of heart. The widow of a general who had been killed in action at Shiloh had come across a letter from Wallace to her husband, dated April 5, 1862. It was the letter Wallace had sent to the commander of the neighboring division at Shiloh, announcing his plans to use the shunpike should trouble arise. It convinced Grant of what Wallace had long argued. The letter “modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew. Wallace at the battle of Shiloh,” Grant wrote. He still maintained that he’d ordered Wallace to take the river road, but allowed that his wishes may have been lost in the fog of war: “My order was verbal, and to a staff officer who was to deliver it to General Wallace, so that I am not competent to say just what order the general actually received.”\n\nIt was the vindication Wallace had longed for since 1862. But even this failed to satisfy him. The Century article, with its repetition of the standard account of Wallace’s mistakes, became the Shiloh chapter of Grant’s memoirs. The exoneration appeared as a footnote, one that Wallace worried would be ignored by most readers. Rightly, as it would turn out: A Blaze of Glory, Jeff Shaara’s recent novel of Shiloh, and The Man Who Saved the Union, H.W. Brands’ recent biography of Grant, both describe Wallace as having been lost on April 6.\n\nUnsatisfied with Grant’s pardon, Wallace continued his efforts to clear his name, taking any chance he could get to refight the battle. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison tapped his fellow Hoosier to write his campaign biography, hoping to leverage some of Wallace’s celebrity for his presidential run. (“That is excellent,” wrote a waggish friend of Harrison’s when Wallace accepted the assignment. “He did so well on Ben-Hur that we can trust him with Ben Him.”) Wallace began the chapter on Harrison’s Civil War service with what he euphemistically called “the great Union victory” at Shiloh, taking a few pot shots at the high command before moving on to battles in which the subject of his biography actually took part. In April 1862, when Shiloh was fought, Benjamin Harrison was still practicing law in Indianapolis.\n\nWallace just couldn’t let the battle go. In a moving letter to Susan from the waning days of his appointment in Turkey, Wallace reflected on his long, varied career and looked forward to passing his final days “in the old man’s gown and slippers, helping the cat keep the fireplace warm.” He was proud of the diplomatic work he’d done, and pleased by Ben-Hur’s success. Only one cloud hung over his head: “Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them?” he wrote. “If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.”\n\nXI.\n\nIn the spring of 1898, as tensions between the United States and Spain mounted, Lew Wallace sent a telegram to Secretary of War Russell Alger. He offered to raise a brigade, or even a division, of volunteer troops from the black population of the Midwest and lead them into battle himself. “The most magnificent regiments in the Turkish army consist of negroes,” he wrote. “I think it could be duplicated in our country.” Alger’s reply was prompt and polite, thanking the general for his “patriotic action in this matter.” But the McKinley administration had little need for a 71-year-old general. “In the event of war,” Alger wrote. “You will be duly notified.” Don’t telegram us, we’ll telegram you.\n\nCourtesy of Carol M. Highsmith/Library of Congress\n\nWallace’s attempt to join the war effort may look like a publicity stunt, but his offer seems to have been made in earnest. As the Morsbergers document in their biography, Wallace used all of his political capital in an attempt to win a commission, sending a wave of friends in Washington to petition the McKinley administration on his behalf.\n\nThe Civil War was fading further into memory, and its events took on a rose-colored hue. Though Grant’s hard-nosed essay on Shiloh was a notable exception, Century Magazine’s “Battles and Leaders” series had tended toward the celebration of great men committing valorous acts. A new generation of young men now longed for a chance to demonstrate their courage in a war with Spain, and indeed a renewed martial spirit was likely a factor in Ben-Hur’s popularity in the last decade of the 19th century. Judah’s manly exploits appealed to Gilded Age Americans wary of what the historian Jackson Lears has termed “overcivilization”: the soft, domestic comforts of bourgeois metropolitan life in a country with a now-closed frontier.\n\nSome of Wallace’s comrades-in-arms rejected post-war sentimentalism, perhaps none so completely as Ambrose Bierce, whose essay “What I Saw of Shiloh” (1881) described the battle in ghastly detail. He recalled the sight of a sergeant, still breathing “in convulsive, rattling snorts” despite having been shot through the skull. “I had not previously known one could get on, even in this unsatisfactory fashion, with so little brain,” he wrote. To Bierce, death was “a dismal thing, hideous in all its manifestations.” But Wallace had never lost the romantic view of war that had taken hold of him as a boy. He had his doubts about America’s nascent imperialism, but if there was to be a fight, he wanted to be in the thick of it.\n\n“How many there are who spend their youth yearning and fighting to write their names in history,” observes the narrator of A Prince of India, Wallace’s 1893 follow-up to Ben-Hur, “then spend their old age shuddering to read them there!\" Wallace still shuddered at the way his name had been written into history, and he surely also saw the war with Spain as one final chance at a revision. When McKinley failed to commission him a general, he visited his local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private. “If I can not serve in the one capacity, I should be happy to serve in the other,” Wallace told the Indianapolis News, calling the rank of private “no less honorable” than that of major general. The recruiter, citing his age, turned him away.\n\nXII.\n\nWallace died of stomach cancer on Feb. 15, 1905, at the age of 77. In the days following his death, nearly every newspaper in the country carried an obituary, many of them as lead stories that jumped to full-page spreads. The Cincinnati Enquirer announced the news with a headline overwrought even by fin de siècle standards, though not atypical of the coverage:\n\nEnded\n\nIs the Chariot Race\n\nIn Which He Drove Pegasus to Lasting Fame\n\nAnd General Lew Wallace Succumbs to Death\n\nAuthor of Ben-Hur Had Hoped to Be Restored\n\nBy the Gentler Agencies of Spring\n\nBut Failed to Muster the Necessary Strength\n\nTo Resist Winter’s Rigor and the Encroachment of Disease—Sketch of His Career\n\nSome of these career sketches revisited the scandal of Shiloh, but the success of Ben-Hur was the dominant theme of most. “Throughout the rank and file of our steady churchgoing people the man who is ignorant of Ben-Hur, who cannot relay vividly every point of the chariot race, is set down as beyond the pale in both literature and religion,” wrote the New York Post. “Shakespeare and Milton are above the range of honest folk, the Bible they are often content to take at second hand, but Ben-Hur brings grandeur nearer our common dust.”\n\nWallace is buried in his hometown of Crawfordsville, in a cemetery near Indiana Route 231. Over his grave stands a gaudy marker of which he surely would have approved—an obelisk draped in a granite rendering of Old Glory. His epitaph is a line taken from Ben-Hur: “I would not give one hour of life as a Soul for a thousand years of life as a man.”\n\nPhoto by John Swansburg\n\nThat line is spoken by Balthazar, one of the three Wise Men who arrive in Bethlehem to herald the virgin birth, and, in Wallace’s novel, the man who shepherds Judah Ben-Hur toward a belief in Christ’s divinity. Wallace professed that writing the novel led him to his own belief in Christ, though he never joined a church. (“Not that churches are objectionable to me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable,” he explained.) There’s no reason to doubt the sincerity of Wallace’s faith, and yet it’s hard to believe that he ever came to share Balthazar’s disdain for earthly endeavor. Few men in American history have made more of their time in this life, or been so concerned with the legacy they were leaving behind.\n\nIt would surely please Wallace to know that he achieved a kind of immortality in this world. Though his name is not well remembered today, his novel has never disappeared from the American landscape. Earlier this month, scholars convened at Rutgers for a daylong conference on the book, covering everything from its theology to its geology. This Easter weekend, the Ovation channel will air the American premiere of an excellent Canadian miniseries adaptation of Ben-Hur, starring, among others, Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey. MGM, meanwhile, has just bought a script for a new feature film version. In the item reporting MGM’s acquisition, Deadline Hollywood noted that scripts about Pontius Pilate, Noah, and two about Moses have lately attracted attention from powerbrokers like Brad Pitt, Ridley Scott, and Steven Spielberg—attention that is sure to intensify in the wake of the record-setting ratings success of the History Channel’s The Bible miniseries. That Americans can’t resist a Biblical epic may seem intuitive in 2013, but it wasn’t in 1876. All of these productions owe something to Lew Wallace.\n\nWallace, in turn, surely owed some part of his literary success to his military failure. Unable to live up to his romantic ideal of the gallant soldier, he was left to imagine such a soldier in his fiction. In Judah Ben-Hur, he created the hero he wished he’d been at Shiloh, a paragon of strength and pluck.\n\nWallace returned to Shiloh several times after the war, surveying the land for new evidence to support his version of events. During one trip, made after Ben-Hur had won him fame and fortune, he found the tree next to which he’d camped one night. It had been a sapling then; it was now full-grown. Wallace broke a branch from its trunk and sent it off to Tiffany & Co., in New York, which outfitted it with an elegant ivory handle. Cane or scepter? A symbol of frailty or power? It could be either. Shiloh had laid Wallace low—and set him on his roundabout road to glory.",

Ates has been under police protection since opening the mosque as she has faced vile death threats.\n\n“I’m not alone with this idea. It is a movement, it’s a revolution,” she told the Guardian.\n\n“I may be the face of the liberal mosque, but I alone am not the mosque. We have millions of supporters all over the world.”\n\nThe 54-year-old said, of whether she is scared for her safety: “Yes, a little bit. I could be in danger. People recognise me.”\n\n“There are more and more people wanting to break the chains. In many countries you can find people who are practising what we’re doing, but they are doing it under cover, privately,” she added.\n\n“Liberal and secular Muslims are squeezed out by radical Islam, so they decide to be silent. It’s not so easy for liberal Muslims to be ‘out’. It’s like being homosexual. They are tarnished as the ‘enemy of Islam’.”\n\nSpeaking to the Times earlier this month Ms Ates said: “Since setting up the mosque I have received so many death threats through social media that the police decided they have to protect me around the clock.\n\n“The hostile reactions proved how necessary the project was.”\n\nAs well as receiving threats, Ms Ates has been called “the Devil incarnate” and some social media posts have called for her to “burn in hell”.\n\nThe mosque founders have also been condemned by Turkey’s main authority for Muslims, Diyanet.\n\nThe authority said the liberal mosque represents a threat to Islam.\n\nIn a statement, Diyanet said: “The mosque’s practices “do not align with Islam’s fundamental resources, principles of worship, methodology or experience of more than 14 centuries, and are experiments aimed at nothing more than depraving and ruining religion.\n\n“We are convinced that all fellow believers will keep their distance from such provocations.”\n\nMs Ates added: “They are labelling us as terrorists. Instead of engaging in a sensible religious debate, we’re being pilloried politically. That’s woeful.”\n\nThe mosque is currently located at a Protestant church in Moabit, Berlin.\n\nJust a few dozen worshippers currently attend, but police have been forced to stand guard at Friday prayers following death threats.",

One of the keys to finding that path is getting better play from quarterback Blake Bortles.\n\nIn an interview with the Florida Times-Union last week, Marrone said they hope to do that by going back to the beginning as Borles heads into his fourth NFL season.\n\n“We have to go back and build [Bortles’] foundation from the beginning,” Marrone said. “We told him [in January] we wanted him to make sure his arm was ready to go because there will be an increase in reps, which will help him.

  "latent_25216": "The most carefully planned data analysis may not survive the intervention of a boss (or a client or other reviewer), whether well intentioned or not. Your aim may be to generate sound data and conduct a thorough and valid analysis, but your boss may have different motives and concerns. He or she may have budget or schedule constraints, not to mention business vulnerabilities and office politics to contend with. So be prepared when the unthinkable happens … like just a few days before you planned to start collecting data your boss calls you into his office and says:\n\nChange This Before You Start\n\nAdd a sample, reword a procedure, drop a measurement, and other requests that will defile the perfect data collection and analysis plan you spent so much time creating. What do you do?\n\nAdding a sample or measurement may not be a problem so long as you have the equipment and sampling supplies available. Changing a survey shouldn’t be a big deal if you haven’t already printed the questionnaires. Do what the boss wants and don’t worry about it too much.\n\nChanging sampling procedures or rewording survey questions may or may not be a problem. Keep an open mind. It’s when the validity of the sampling procedure or meaning of the survey question is changed that you have to be careful. Sometimes the changes may seem subtle. For example, changing the order in which samples are collected may seem inconsequential but it may have an impact on the results. Asking survey respondents if they do something once a week is not the same as asking if they do something often. Asking if something is good, is not the same as asking if something is better than expected.\n\nDropping a measurement or question is problematical. If you didn’t need it, you wouldn’t have included it in the first place, but your boss won’t see it that way. Metadata and supporting measurements seem to be a favorite target of bosses looking to put their stamp on your plan. They might not understand that you really need those survey questions that characterize the respondents. These omissions are tough to lose but it’s better to have something over nothing. Make sure the boss knows what he’ll be losing and go with what you can.\n\nWe Can’t Afford This\n\nThat’s more than I expected to spend is a mantra statisticians hear often. You may even have said it yourself to the dealer of that hot red convertible you want, or to the plumber who came to fix your broken water main, or to the tax preparer you finally cornered at 5:00 pm on April 15. Did you pay up, pass on the offer, or negotiate something in between? Likewise, there are three things that your boss can do in this situation:\n\nRelent and pay for the study\n\nNegotiate a reduced price\n\nCancel the study (or get someone cheaper to do it).\n\nYou want the first thing to happen and can live with the second, but the third would be a disaster.\n\nSo put yourself in your boss’s position. Is the analysis something he has to do? If so, gently review the consequences of not doing it. What is it he doesn’t want but might get if the study isn’t done? Will his boss be upset? Will a regulatory agency come calling? Paint a picture of the cost of the consequences compared to the cost of the study. If the analysis is something he doesn’t have to do, you’ll have to convince him that it is something he wants to do it, or even better, he needs to do. Consider what the boss is looking to do with the results. Show him how your data analysis will add value to his operation. Give him a clear vision of what the payback will be.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, try working out a compromise. Just remember, a cut in price has to be balanced by a cut in scope, otherwise you’ll have no credibility. If the cuts will impair the analysis so much that little will be gained, it’s better to pass on the study and survive to analyze another day.\n\nThat’s Too Many Samples\n\nHaving your boss (or client) ask if you can get by with fewer samples is almost a given. Unless the boss understands statistics and variability, it’s unlikely he’ll see the need for as many samples as you planned to collect. Agreeing to reduce the number of samples is a self-inflicted but nonfatal wound. The margin of error will be bigger but quantifiable. Let the boss know what he’ll be getting. He should appreciate the concept of trade-offs since he has to deal with them all the time in his own work. This assumes, of course, that the boss is at least in the same ballpark as you. If you want 800 samples, and he was thinking of just asking a few customers some questions over lunch, you’re toast.\n\nHere Are the Samples You Should Take\n\nAfter spending a lot of time ensuring that your samples will be truly representative of your population, your boss gives you his list of samples to be collected. Will your boss’ list fairly represent the population or is there some perhaps unintentional bias? Does the boss want you to survey the biggest or oldest customers, or worse, the customers who will give the best reviews? Does he want you to sample only the processes or waste streams that he knows are already within specifications? What do you do?\n\nThis can be a deal breaker from your perspective. There’s no reason to collect data and do a statistical analysis with a judgment sample let alone a highly biased judgment sample. You’ll only be deluding your boss and yourself. Try to convince your boss that his directed samples will invalidate the study. If you can’t, take a list as a window onto your boss’s real reason for conducting the survey. He may just want something flattering to show his boss. If you still have to analyze the results even with the biased list, be sure to caveat your findings.\n\nWe’re Not Going to Do This After All\n\nThere are two common reasons the boss will pull the plug on a survey he asked for. The first is that he didn’t get approvals from his bosses. If you raise the level of attention of the survey in the organization early in the process, like when you go in search of data, this shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nThe second reason is funding. Some bosses relax during the first two quarters of the fiscal year then suddenly realize in the third quarter that they aren’t going to make their business plan unless they take drastic measures. Your survey will be the first thing to go, deferred if you’re lucky, canceled if you’re not. Try to schedule your survey for early in the fiscal year.\n\nThe Results Aren’t What We Expected\n\nIf your boss says he is surprised with your results, it could mean a couple of different things.\n\nIf the boss says either that the results were too general to tell anybody anything or that the results were too detailed for anybody to figure out, it’s a presentation problem. That’s actually a good thing. It can be fixed. Don’t be reluctant to get a communications specialist to help translate your work into a better presentation. You will benefit from more people being able to understand what you did.\n\nIf the boss is surprised by your results, and it’s not the presentation, it’s a virtual certainty that the results are unfavorable. There are at least four possible scenarios to consider:\n\nThe boss is really surprised by the results because he is out of touch with his business or whatever it is you studied. In this case, watch how he reacts as you explain some of the intricacies of the findings. As long as he doesn’t become defensive, it could be a great opportunity for both of you. If he does become defensive, try stressing that the results don’t take into consideration all the constraints he is under. Protect his fragile ego. You need him to take the next step and do something positive.\n\nThe boss is really surprised by the results because he thinks there may be a problem with the data or analysis. Double-check your work to be sure nothing is amiss statistically, and keep an open mind. The boss may be aware of some aspects of the data that may have skewed your results.\n\nThe boss is not surprised by the results but doesn’t want to admit it because he was hoping for something different. He’s playing dumb. This is his way of trying to deflect some responsibility away from himself. Play along. Remember, the only important thing is that he takes some positive action based on your results.\n\nThe boss was not surprised by the results but doesn’t want to admit it because the results don’t match what his boss wants to see. There’s not much you can do about this. The boss will probably take the results, and you’ll never hear of it again. Consider it a valuable life experience.\n\nJust Give Me the Results; I’ll Take Care of the Rest\n\nEverybody who has a boss has lived this alternative reality, whether you’re analyzing customer satisfaction data for the CEO or wrapping burgers for hungry customers. You give your work to the boss who becomes the face of the product. The boss gets all the accolades, and perhaps, an occasional complaint, while you get little if any recognition.\n\nTrue, some bosses do this to try to claim credit for work they didn’t do, but this is usually transparent to anyone who matters. The CEO knows your boss neither conducted the analysis nor has the knowledge or the time to have done it. He is responsible, though, for the work you do. You know when you go to a restaurant that the host didn’t prepare the food. You know when the politician cuts the ribbon at the opening of the new library that he didn’t build the building or shelve the books. Those people represent the work of many.\n\nBut a boss may want to be the spokesperson for your work for other reasons. He may want to bury unfavorable results. He may want to control access to the results because knowledge is power. Even more important, he may want to control access to you. Your demonstrated skills make your boss even more powerful. Finally, it’s possible that your boss doesn’t want you involved in decisions made as a result of your work. While this judgment is usually blamed on ego flexing, it may also be attributable to self-loathing over the decision-making process. If you think data analysis is messy, you should see what decision makers do. They are often illogical and inconsistent. They choose paths of least resistance over avenues of greatest effectiveness. They pay more attention to anecdotes than data. They worry about obscure possibilities and ignore likely consequences. They have a penchant for inaction and a desire to preserve the status quo. Unless you have a frustration deficit in your life, it might be better to let this one go.\n\nOne big issue with this response is that you don’t get any feedback. It’s nice to get recognition for your work but it’s absolutely essential that you get feedback. That’s how you grow as a professional and as an individual. If you can’t get any feedback from your boss, look elsewhere. Do any of your colleagues have opinions about the study? How did the high priest of the database like working with you? Do you ever run into the CEO or other managers in the hallway who might be familiar with what you did? Take whatever you can get (without making your boss paranoid) and put the knowledge to good use.\n\nRead more about using statistics at the Stats with Cats blog.

  "latent_25244": "Every so often I like to completely wipe out my computer and start it over from scratch. This isn't because I particularly enjoy the pain of setting up a system from scratch, but it does come with some advantages:\n\nYou get rid of the stuff you didn't need.\n\nYou have a chance to try things that came out since you last reinstalled.\n\nYou have a clean install that isn't choking from years of cruft.\n\nI took it upon myself to perform this task when I upgraded to OS X Lion and thought it would also be a great chance to write one of those \"how to get a Ruby development machine going from scratch\" posts since that's what I'd be doing anyway. So here's the process of how I got my machine set back up to work the way I want it to on Apple's latest.\n\nApplication Avalanche\n\nSlide table\n\nGoogle Chrome has been my browser of choice for the past year or so. I never would have thought I could give up Firebug, but the speed difference was enough for me to learn to love the Web Inspector. iTerm2 is new to my roster. I don’t know too much about it other than that it can do split-pane views which is something I love in all of my apps. XCode is a big huge download, and while I don’t use the IDE I need the build tools for just about everything else in my dev toolchain. Adium is my universal IM client of choice. It’s simple, customizable, and always there when I need it. I roll with the AdiumIcon icon set, the Mnmlsm message style, and the Leopard Sidebar contact list style. Mailplane gives me exactly what I want in an email client: the GMail web interface but in its own dedicated application. While the benefits over something like a Fluid window for GMail aren’t necessarily enormous, email is core enough to my daily routine that it was worth a little cash for a little better experience. MacVim is my editor of choice although I don’t pretend to be a “real” Vim user. I switched to Vim *solely* because it allows me to edit with split pane windows, and I still treat it more like Textmate than I’d normally like to admit in public. Note: If you’re planning to use ZSH you’ll want to install a snapshot release of MacVim, otherwise it will occasionally hang. Growl is an obvious must-have for any Mac user, developer or not. Presently and HipChat are my desktop coworker communication tools and I’d be lost without them. Alfred is another new addition to my roster, replacing the Google Quick Search Box. I haven’t used it much yet, but I had heard good things so I’m going to give it a go. VLC has a well-deserved reputation for being able to play just about everything. If I could remove Quicktime entirely and replace it with VLC, I would. Spotify is what I’ve been using the last week or two. I’ve tried both it and Rdio and I’m honestly pretty torn as to which I like more. But let’s be honest, my primary listening point for music recently has been Turntable.fm. The Official Twitter App is the client I’ve used since its release. I’m not a power user (and all of the searches that I care about I handle via Twilert so it works well enough. Cloud is an extremely useful little app to have for quickly sharing screenshots and files. I use Skitch as well when I need to be able to annotate the shots quickly. Adobe CS5 gives me the tools that I need for putting together logos and design assets. I was going to say “and mocking up sites” but since CSS3 I don’t really use Photoshop for mockups that often these days, I just go straight for the markup.\n\nSlide table\n\nCommand Line Commando\n\nOnce I had gotten the easy stuff out of the way, it was time to actually set up all of the development tools that I would need to get my machine up and running the way I needed it.\n\nFirst up is installing Homebrew. Homebrew is without a doubt the simplest and most \"it just works\" package manager that I've used for OS X. Installing it is as easy as:\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)\" 1 / usr / bin / ruby - e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)\"\n\nOnce Homebrew is installed, we can go on a mad tear of package installation. Here are some of the tools that I set up right away:\n\nbrew install wget git redis node imagemagick brew install postgresql brew install mongodb 1 brew install wget git redis node imagemagick brew install postgresql brew install mongodb\n\nAnother new entry for this round, I thought I'd take my coworkers advice and switch to ZSH with Oh My ZSH. Installed like so:\n\nwget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh 1 wget -- no - check - certificate https : //github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n\nNext up we'll install RVM so that we can manage multiple Rubies with ease. I'll also be installing the Rubies that I use on a regular basis and setting the default Ruby to be 1.9.2 since that's what I'm using 90% of the time.\n\nbash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer ) rvm install 1.9.2 rvm install jruby rvm use 1.9.2 --default 1 bash < < ( curl - s https : //raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer ) rvm install 1.9.2 rvm install jruby rvm use 1.9.2 --default\n\nAfter that I needed to follow the instructions printed out by RVM to make sure it was working in my shell. Magnificent! Now we're almost all done with our basic development stack. We need something to run our web apps, and Pow is definitely my favorite nowadays. We'll also install the powder gem to make it super simple to manage our Pow links.\n\ncurl get.pow.cx | sh gem install powder 1 curl get . pow . cx | sh gem install powder\n\nNow I've got my development tools up and running, but I still need a little bit more out of my editor. Like I said, I'm a training wheels Vim user, so I like to install Yehuda/Carl's janus to get a good set of Vim plugins that make Rails development super easy in MacVim.\n\ncurl https://raw.github.com/carlhuda/janus/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh 1 curl https : //raw.github.com/carlhuda/janus/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh\n\nWe're getting quite close now. The only thing to do before enjoying my new setup is to make it so that I can clone my repositories off of the various services I use. So I followed the GitHub, Unfuddle, and Heroku setup instructions and I was up and running.\n\nSummary\n\nSo that's pretty much it! Everything went pretty much as expected once I actually got a fresh-drive install of Lion working. The biggest pain was waiting for multi-gigabyte downloads like XCode, but leaving them overnight worked well enough to solve that. So for those who are curious, Ruby development is alive and working on Mac OS X Lion. Is there anything in my setup that you'd do differently? Let me know in the comments!",
  "latent_25586": "Gender Bender: A Look at Modern Misogyny\n\nViia Beaumanis March 8th, 2017\n\nMarch 8 marks International Women’s Day, and we’ve come a long way, baby – or have we? Here, a look at modern misogyny … When I was hired as a columnist in the late ’90s, the message on my answering machine. “You’ve got the job,” said my new boss, “even though you didn’t put out.” The newspaper’s offices were out in the sticks, so we had met at a downtown restaurant for a drink and interview the evening before. I’d pitched him on why I was ideal for the position; he’d agreed. Then he got drunk and wrapped things up by attempting to paw me in a taxi. I gamely fended him off until I was able to leap out at my address, deploying the nuanced rebuff with which women in this situation are all too familiar – the one where your disinterest is conveyed but in a jovial manner that won’t offend the man who’s offending you. After all, you do want the job.\n\nIt’s a memory, and one that seems sepia-quaint by today’s standards, that came back to me last year as the Jian Ghomeshi scandal detonated. Of all the sordid details, what struck me most was an anecdote by former Q producer Kathryn Borel who’d been openly groped, massaged and dry humped by Ghomeshi, who had also relayed during a workplace meeting in the company offices that he’d like to “hate f***” her. Reporting his lewdness to CBC higher-ups, Borel was advised to “figure out how to cope with” her boss, who “was the way he was.” In other words: quit or deal with it. As another woman told the media in the wake of the Ghomeshi tsunami, things over on Parliament Hill weren’t much better. A 22-year-old intern at the time, Jasmine Ali was fired from the office of a Liberal MP in 2007 after objecting to the conduct of her supervisor. “Parliament is not a place for women,” he’d announced on her second day at work, pointing to his erection, while defining the capital as “a men’s locker room where it’s all about whose thing is bigger.” During her second week, he informed her, “Women can’t sue for sexual harassment on the Hill. It’s the one place exempt.” She rejected his advances; he sabotaged her efforts to impress their boss, took credit for her work and made her wash his dishes. The treatment would cease, he noted, if she agreed to date him.\n\nJerks on the loose in their private lives? I’m old enough not to be surprised. That women in the 21st century – navigating office hard-ons and “hate f***” asides – are told they are responsible for a male colleague’s arrant sexual entitlement stuns me. Raised by a Ms. Magazine subscriber in the most liberal of Canadian milieus, I thought we were over this garbage by the ’90s. Or, assuming men now “knew better” that, at the very least, we’d moved passed its more boorish articulations. Instead, decades after women fought for equal rights at work, we’re circling back. We may now have legislation on our side, but a familiar dynamic, only more vulgar, has insinuated itself. It’s helped along, as usual, in that women don’t want to be “difficult,” branded the office harridan or impede their professional advancement by making a “fuss.” Coddled by this convenient silence, (some) men feel free to behave badly. There’s nothing new in this stale equation, the question is: what’s at the root of this prickly brand of post-modern misogyny? Discussing the recent, well-documented wave of Flintstone gender politics with friends, one demurred with, “I think if you asked a secretary from the ’60s, she’d say it was worse then.” Most pointed to social media. “It’s the CNN effect,” offered a university professor. “Things aren’t worse – they just seem worse because we hear about everything now.”\n\nActually, there’s a lot of “everything now”: it’s been a banner time for misogyny. From the litany of domestic abuse by NFL players and the 2014 California Elliot Rodger massacre, through Gamergate, which exposed online anti-woman harassment in the video game culture and the flood of campus rapes, there seems to be an entrenched acceptance of the behaviour despite some attempts to punish the perpetrators. In 2014, though suspended from the NFL and dropped by his team, men dressed up as Raven’s linebacker wife-beater Ray Rice for Halloween, proudly issuing Instagram posts (#hitabitch, #illtaketheelevator). Across America, hundreds of high schools invited “motivational speaker” Justin Lookadoo – whose maxims include “dateable girls know how to shut up” – to address their students. In Canada, undergraduates in Dalhousie’s dentistry program formed a “gentlemen’s” Facebook forum in which to banter about chloroforming women, compare classmates they’d like to have “hate sex” with (that again…) and share images of a scantily clad female with the tag line: “Bang until stress is relieved or unconscious.” A stance with which a shameless Bill Cosby – hitting 50 on the alleged Quaalude-induced rape charts – could only concur? Professor Françoise Baylis, one of just four Dalhousie faculty members who filed a formal complaint demanding suspensions, told CTV News, “We’re at a very unique cultural moment [where we’re] able to name the problem publicly – to call this misogyny.”\n\nLast May, CityNews on-air correspondent Shauna Hunt was treated to the sport’s world’s fun new lark: men screaming “F*** her right in the p****!” as a female reporter broadcasts live from a game – an affront so popular that it enjoys its own meme: #FHRITP. Covering the Toronto FC’s opening soccer match while a man shouted the vulgar epithet at her, Hunt turned the camera to confront him, coolly inquiri ng how his “mother would feel if she saw him talking like that.” The moron’s equally boorish companion, Shawn Simoes, informing Hunt – on air – that she was “lucky” they didn’t have a “f***ing vibrator” while dismissing his pal’s vulgar inventive as “f***ing hilarious.” A civil servant, Simoes was summarily fired from his job at Hydro One – before the government-owned utilities corporationwas forced to reinstate him to his $100,000-plus post after he took his case to arbitration. A verdict his female coworkers could only have been thrilled with – another victory for the doucheoisie.\n\nSwap “woman” for “black person” in any of the above incidents, and we’d call it a hate crime. While terms like “toxic masculinity” aren’t often bandied about outside of Women Studies programs, let’s connect our culture’s blasé acceptance of a sexually malevolent status quo to a wider context of increasingly normalized misogyny – and the probability that “hate f***” makes it into Webster’s this year.\n\nOne might look to Marc Lépine, who massacred 14 women at Montreal’s École Polytechnique in 1989 while shrieking “I hate feminists!” to make the case that lady-hating lunatics are nothing new. But that was a different era and set of circumstances. Lépine was born Gamil Gharbi to a first-generation Algerian immigrant who – lugging some Old-World baggage that included noxious views about women – beat his wife while insisting she exhibit no affection toward their son, whom he also abused, before abandoning both when the boy was seven. Armed with an aberrant gender perspective earned at his father’s knee, Lépine would nonetheless have had some trouble locating a bustling like-minded peer group back in the ’80s, while, today, any man who thinks violence toward women is a righteous, even sexy, idea merely requires a Wi-Fi connection to drum up a global support team where thousands of anonymous allies urge each other on in a porn- and vitriol-soaked vacuum. We’ve come a long way, baby. In the mid-century, we had male chauvinism (“the belief that men are superior to women”) with all the glass ceiling pats on the ass and maddening paternalism that came with it. Now we have Postmodern Misogyny (“the hatred of women”), a spikier class of assumed supremacy embraced by the sort of men who, maladapting in an era of gender parity, react poorly to the “pressure.” They then recoil into Internet-enriched delusions, incapable of assessing their own conduct. In 2014, “dating coach” Julien Blanc caused a media maelstrom when an online video appeared of him in Japan, encouraging men to grab random women by the neck and shove their faces into their groins. “In Tokyo,” schooled Blanc, “if you’re a white male, you can do whatever you want.” Blanc is a disciple of Real Social Dynamics (RSD), cofounded by Canadian Owen Cook, whose company runs $2,000 three-day boot camps on how to pick up women. Tips include dealing with females who are “not in the mood” (“throw her on the bed”). The RSD corps also includes California-based executive coach, Jeff Allen, who tools around San Francisco in his vibrantly painted self-proclaimed “rape van.” This is a multi-million dollar a year business. When Elliot Rodger snapped, he drove to a sorority – as he wrote in his infamous manifesto before slaughtering half a dozen people – to give the “female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures I deserved from them.” Gee, wonder where he got ideas like that between free 24-hour Internet porn, the culture pushed by machismo goon squads like RSD and the bitch-conspiracy theories that fuel the emerging Men’s Rights movement? Employing the same backward logic as “white rights” factions, the central forum for “male empowerment” is the site A Voice for Men, a website flagged as a ‘hate site’ by Norton Symantec’s virus software in 2013. The site hawks Feminists Are Stupid T-shirts and Femi-Nazi posters that co-opt Third Reich imagery. Advancing from whining online to hosting public symposiums, the organization held its first conference in 2014 to dismiss rape and place blame for domestic assault on women.",
  "latent_25928": "… and it looks like this:\n\nThis is the main checkout area at the Walgreens at the corner of North Avenue and Wells St. in Chicago. As you can see, it has no human cashiers at all; just a guy (in the striped sweater) roving and troubleshooting if customers have problems during the checkout process.\n\nI’m in Chicago at my Mom’s place for Christmas, and over dinner last night we were talking about Race Against the Machine and the steady pace of automation (because what else do I talk about these days?). She and her husband Gene told me that the Walgreens in their neighborhood didn’t have any human cashiers any more.\n\nI told them they must be mistaken. I’ve seen plenty of self-checkout stations, but they’ve always been accompanied by at least one human cashier to accommodate customers who for whatever reason — unfamiliarity, techno-fear, the desire to chat, whatever — don’t want to deal with a machine. I assumed the same would be true at this Walgreens. Mom and Gene were adamant that it was 100% self-checkout, so we got bundled up and walked over to get the straight dope.\n\nThey were right and I was wrong. There are six NCR self-checkout kiosks at the entrance / exit, and no cashiers at all there. There are human cashiers at the photo lab and the pharmacy and customers can take their purchases to these two locations if they want, but at the main checkout area you can’t get rung up by a person any more.\n\nThe NCR machines accept cash and credit / debit cards, and Mom and Gene told me that they work pretty well most of the time. A friendly and helpful Walgreens manager named Tony, who came over when he saw me taking pictures, agreed. He said that his store had been cashier-free for a couple years, and was one of only three in the country to have taken the leap to 100% self-checkout. The machines were easy enough to use and pretty reliable, he said, and didn’t change the amount of shoplifting one way or the other because “if people are going to steal, they’re going to steal.”\n\nThe store is in Chicago’s Old Town neighborhood, which is a diverse place. It’s gentrifying quickly now, but was home to the infamous Cabrini-Green project. So the Walgreens at North and Wells gets customers of every age and every level of education and affluence. And self-checkout can evidently handle all of them.\n\nA March 2011 article in the Los Angeles Times by Alena Semuels highlighted that the retail industry has been automating rapidly.\n\nIn an industry that employs nearly 1 in 10 Americans and has long been a reliable job generator, companies increasingly are looking to peddle more products with fewer employees. … Virtual assistants are taking the place of customer service representatives. Kiosks and self-service machines are reducing the need for checkout clerks.\n\nLast night I saw first-hand evidence of how advanced this trend is. As we become more comfortable interacting with technology, as credit and debit cards proliferate, as inventory management systems improve, and as everything gets a bar code, how long will it be until a human cashier is a curiosity?\n\nI say less than a decade. Do you agree?",
  "latent_25938": "Washington (CNN) -- Top White House officials believe expectations were set so low for Democrats that they just may keep control of the House and Senate by grinding out victories in individual races, and there are signs emerging that the most powerful Republican business lobbyist may privately agree with that assessment.\n\nCNN has learned that Tom Donohue, the powerful president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has vowed to spend more than $75 million on key House and Senate races, has privately told colleagues in recent weeks he believes Democrats will just barely hold on to the House majority.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the conversations said Donohue has privately said he's gone over every single key race in the House, and he believes Republicans will lose a few seats -- losses he believes they don't see coming -- because it is more of an anti-establishment election than an anti-Democratic election.\n\nChamber spokesman JP Fielder told CNN he could not comment on private conversations Donohue may or may not have had, but stressed that this election season has already been highly unpredictable.\n\n\"If there's anything we learned from last week, it's that many surprises lay ahead in this election cycle,\" Fielder said in reference to the Senate primary results in Delaware, in which Republican Christine O'Donnell shocked the political world by using Tea Party support to defeat moderate Rep. Mike Castle.\n\nPerhaps Donohue is just trying to temper Republicans' high expectations. On the other side of the aisle, top Democrats like Vice President Biden may be trying to manage expectations as well.\n\nIn August, Biden publicly all but guaranteed that Democrats will keep their majorities in the House and Senate during remarks at a Democratic National Committee meeting in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n\"If it weren't illegal, I'd make book on it,\" the vice president quipped.\n\nBut CNN has learned that in recent weeks Biden and President Obama each paid quiet visits that were not on their public schedules to former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas, who is recuperating from surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.\n\nObama is from a different generation and never served in the Senate with Dole, and CNN was told his visit on August 30 was respectful but quick. The president was at Walter Reed to visit wounded troops a day in advance of his Oval Office address on Iraq, and he stopped by to wish Dole well.\n\nBut Dole told CNN the president hinted about the deep partisan divide he is facing, which is only expected to increase after the election, when there is likely to be either Republican control or Democratic control with slimmer majorities.\n\n\"He was kidding me, 'I wish you were in the Senate now,' \" recalled Dole, who was known for working across the aisle despite his staunch Republican credentials.\n\nBiden, as is his way, was a bit more talkative than Obama and stayed with Dole for an hour and 15 minutes during a separate visit earlier this month.\n\n\"You know Old Joe, once he gets going,\" Dole said jokingly.\n\nThe two men served together in the Senate for decades, and Dole said they had time to commiserate about the upcoming midterm elections. Biden didn't back down from his promise of Democratic victories, but he seemed to suggest the obvious: Holding both majorities will be an uphill battle.\n\nAs Dole put it, \"I think he knows they have a big fence to climb.\"\n\nBiden spokesman Jay Carney confirmed the meeting with Dole, but stressed there is no change from what Biden has said previously.\n\nCarney noted the vice president has \"always said this midterm election year was going to be tough and that Democrats should not take anything for granted,\" which is why last week he went to Delaware to campaign for Senate candidate Chris Coons, even though many pundits have predicted the Democrat will beat O'Donnell easily.\n\n\"There is absolutely no difference between what the vice president has been saying about the midterms in public and what he says in private,\" Carney said. \"In public and in private, he says the same thing: 'It's going to be tough, but Democrats are going to win.' I wouldn't think it's a surprise that Sen. Dole, a former Republican leader, is emphasizing the 'going to be tough' part, but this is what the vice president says all the time.\"",
  "latent_26113": "When it comes to erotic writing, the more explicit it gets – the more heaving, the more panting – the more I want to laugh. Erotic writing is said to have a noble pedigree: the goings-on in Ovid, the whipping in Sade, the bare-arsed wrestling in Lawrence, the garter-snapping in Anaïs Nin, the wife-swapping in Updike, the arcs of semen hither and yon. But it’s so much sexier when people don’t have sex on the page.\n\nYet if you were a working-class boy in the 1970s, badly written books about fucking – quickly followed in the 1980s by badly written books about shopping-and-fucking – were the kinds of book your mother read, and so, to be fair, did your father, and to be even fairer, 400 million other people. When I was about ten I went to a jumble sale to buy books only to discover that everything that wasn’t a copy of Jaws was by Jackie Collins, Harold Robbins, Sidney Sheldon, or Danielle Steel. I noted this cultural deﬁcit in my compendium of things to complain about to God but I read The Bitch myself on the way home and remember a very fruity passage in which the heroine, a woman who owned a disco and was called Fontaine, has sex in a hot tub with a very unsuitable man who might or might not have been in the Maﬁa. I also read Jaws but scarcely got beyond the sex scene on the beach before I came across the gouging Great White and the word ‘sinew’, which I’d never encountered before. I had more trouble with The Carpetbaggers. I’m not saying I knew much about the world of discos or killer sharks, but Robbins’s world of Hollywood high living and eternal shagging was a challenge to my imagination. The term ‘blow-job’ was a legendary beast that stalked the imagination of Ayrshire boys for many years. But the style of the book remained with me, too: suddenly there was ‘thrusting’ and ‘quivering’ and ‘juddering’ and ‘pulsating’. My father gave me a funny look when Robbins’s name came up during an episode of Fawlty Towers. ‘Pornographic muzak,’ Basil says to his wife as he addresses her liking for the great man’s oeuvre.\n\nRobbins and Collins liked a plush car with a smooth chassis. They liked champagne and caviar and jets you could shag in. They liked big desks. They liked jacuzzis. But what these gazillion-selling authors liked most was a human being perpetually on the brink of a soaring orgasm. Women just had to be approached, sometimes just looked at, and a ‘shuddering’ event would occur in their ‘sex’. Sometimes it wasn’t called ‘my sex’, and the word ‘clitoris’ made its debut in our lives. Men sometimes had cocks but more usually they had a ‘member’ or a ‘shaft’ or just an ‘erection’. More likely, they had a ‘towering erection’ or a ‘colossal shaft’, and that was worrying. Things didn’t improve a great deal in the 1980s, when women came on TV wearing lakes of lipgloss. Jackie Collins’s sister Joan was chief among them in Dynasty, pouting for England and surrounded by gay men with big hair who were keen to get on with the shafting. By this point in the evolution of the genre, ‘shafting’ could also mean something else, and the enduring aspect of 1980s sex novels was their obsession with new money. Time was when a romantic hero could be a soldier or a doctor or, heaven help us, a priest. But in the age of Jilly Cooper and Judith Krantz he had better be a polo player. Work is for pigs, and anyone without enough money to coat themselves in leisure had no place in a Krantz novel. There was something nouveau about the new bonkbusters that perfectly suited the times. A point made by Clive James in these pages in a review of Princess Daisy: ‘Mrs Krantz would probably hate to hear it said,’ he wrote, ‘but she gives the impression of having been included late amongst the exclusiveness she so admires. There is nothing wrong with gusto, but when easy familiarity is what you are trying to convey, gush is to be avoided.’[*] Each era gets the erotic writing it craves, or deserves, if that doesn’t sound too much like I’m asking you to spank me into an ecstasy of submission.\n\nThe ﬁrst thing to say about this decade’s multi-million-selling contributor to the art of terrible writing about sex is that she will not easily be mistaken for Andrea Dworkin. It’s not that Fifty Shades of Grey and E.L. James’s other tie-me-up-tie-me-down spankbusters read as if feminism never happened: they read as if women never even got the vote.[†] Before we get to the designer labels – and in this, like so much else, James has learned a lot from the Jackies and the Judiths, to say nothing of the Harolds – we have a female protagonist who thinks like the scullery maid in a Victorian wank mag. To say the woman in this book is submissive won’t cover it. She likes to compare herself to the heroine of Tess of the D’Urbervilles, which is nice. But Tess has the whole of Victorian hypocrisy to contend with while Anastasia just has to worry – between delicious ‘humiliations’ – whether she’s got the right music on her iPod.\n\nThe time is now and the place is Vancouver, USA. When we meet Anastasia Steele she is fussing with her hair before catching a plane for Seattle, where she’s to interview a tycoon called Christian Grey for her student magazine. She’s a clever student – that’s made clear – and she has a clever student’s weariness of experience, but it all melts like snow off a dyke when she meets the gaze of Mr Grey. Just to get it out of the way: he’s not the Elephant Man. He’s handsome, very handsome, devastatingly handsome, ‘the most beautiful man on the planet’, with unruly brown hair and the kind of chest you can only achieve if you swim a lap every time you make a million dollars. It’s true he’s very rich but he’s also very generous; he wants to feed the world’s poor. Christian Grey was adopted, you see, and he has quite a lot of secrets, and that explains why he’s sometimes arrogant, autocratic and cold. He’s 27. He’s single. He ﬂies his own helicopter. He has a voice like caramel. Her legs are like Jell-O. Their ﬁngers brush.\n\nAna likes to offer hostages to fortune. ‘Sometimes I wonder if there’s something wrong with me,’ she says. ‘Perhaps I’ve spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes.’ She follows Emma Bovary in nothing very much, except in her habit of blaming her crazy love life on her reading matter. If she’s looking for parallels, Ana might look towards American daytime soaps, where the men are coiffed and the women are grateful; the men are rich and the women want to be seen for who they really are. Ana has no time to be Young and Restless: she’s too busy following the ‘dangerous’ Christian Grey from place to place, or feeling a ‘current’ going through her whenever he turns up. A current that goes all the way down to her sex. In fairness to Ana, there are several things that attract her to the multi-millionaire industrialist. Did I tell you Christian Grey has nice hair? And that he would never harm small animals or children?\n\nAna is one of those people who wants everything she wants. And everything she wants has to be ‘hot’. She comes out of university like a heat-seeking missile fired straight into Christian Grey’s house. That’s after he helped her out when she got drunk on tequila by holding her hair back so she could vomit. (He’s nice that way.) It’s a while before something happens but then it happens fast. Within seconds his tongue ‘explores’ her mouth and they’re off for a drive in a ‘beast of a car’. Everything is now moving rapidly towards Christian’s ‘red room’, the place where he keeps the chains and the whips. Before her heart begins pounding and the electric current travels southwards again, Ana has a nanosecond of thinking like someone who isn’t in a schlock novel. ‘He likes to hurt women. The thought depresses me,’ she says. But not for long. She soon feels a strange and probably quite modern lurch.\n\nHe’s The Dominant. She’s The Submissive. But that’s not the end of it, because Fifty Shades of Grey has in store a further 300-page gala of repetitive sex, most of it – give or take a few smacks on the arse – completely conventional. I suspect the book has taken the world’s mums by storm because there’s no mess on the carpet and there are hot showers afterwards. Everybody is comfortable and everybody is clean: they travel ﬁrst-class, the rich give presents, the man uses condoms, and everything dark is resolved in a miasma of cuddles. In some quarters the publishing phenomenon of the year has been called ‘ﬁlthy’. But that must be a joke. It is a litany of swelling breasts and spent individuals, none of whom would be terriﬁcally out of place at the more modest end of Mills & Boon. The expensive silk tie on the cover tells you everything about the acquisitive vibe behind the whole thing, the appeal for mothers who wouldn’t mind a slightly naughty son-in-law if he also had tousled hair, an Audi R8 Spyder, several apartments and a general handiness with the black Amex. Anastasia, in a few hours, goes from being a virgin with a liking for the Brontës to being a woman who sucks her rapey boyfriend off in the bath while calling him ‘sir’. She ditches the integrity almost as fast as she learns the new rules. ‘My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves,’ she offers.\n\nIn the absence of good comedy there is always the appeal of bad seriousness. Laughter arrives early here and it never stops coming – ‘in waves’, as the author might say. A great deal of fun can be had by noting the many comforts offered for a life of mild depravity: people in these novels don’t wear underpants they wear Calvin Kleins; they don’t wear sneakers they wear Converse; they don’t drink wine they have Pinot Grigio; nobody wears sunglasses they wear Ray-Bans; the girl doesn’t listen to music she listens to Snow Patrol. It’s not that having these things is at all unusual, but the speciﬁcity implies a desire much larger here than any desire people might have for kinky sex. They are buying the books because the books invite them to be submissive too, not to punishment, but to a 1980s-style dominance of money and power and products. (The word ‘ﬂog’ has more than one meaning.) Soft porn marries money very easily, a wish for diamonds especially. The conjunction would not have shocked Anita Loos, who liked a breathless girl, though the ceaseless gasping might have brought her up short:\n\nI close my eyes, feeling the build up – that delicious, slow, step-climbing build. Pushing me higher, higher to the castle in the air. Oh yes … his stroke increases fractionally. I moan loudly. I am all sensation … all him, enjoying every thrust, every push that ﬁlls me. And he picks up the pace, thrusting faster … harder … and my whole body is moving to his rhythm, and I can feel my legs stiffening, and my insides quivering and quickening. ‘Come on, baby, give it up for me,’ he cajoles through gritted teeth, and the fervent need in his voice – the strain – sends me over the edge. I cry out a wordless, passionate plea as I touch the sun and burn, falling around him, falling down, back to a breathless, bright summit on Earth. He slams into me and stops abruptly as he reaches his climax, pulling at my wrists and sinking gracefully and wordlessly onto me.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey deploys every bonkbuster cliché in existence – powerful men, private planes and multiple orgasms. But the trilogy also responds to a new measure of doubt in the recession culture of today: Anastasia, towards the end of the ﬁrst volume, becomes uneasy about the money thing. Before splitting up with Chris – don’t worry, they’ll be back on the thwacking sled, and more vigorously, in Fifty Shades Darker – she gives him back the laptop, the car and the BlackBerry. There’s a crunch to the gravel beneath her feet as she walks away: I’m not a whore, she thinks. If you want to buy me you’ll have to up your game and tell me who you really are. I deserve love. The real deal. Then we can go to the Red Room and then we can spend your money.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nDec. 27, 2016, 10:10 AM GMT / Updated Dec. 27, 2016, 4:06 PM GMT By Bill Neely\n\nPart 2 in a Series\n\nDonald Trump was elected on a platform of politics not as usual. So it is fitting he inherits a world in flux. Post-World War II rules are dying, old alliances are shifting and traditional roles are being shed. While Trump is a giant question mark on the world stage, NBC News’ Chief Global Correspondent Bill Neely looks at major international challenges the president-elect faces upon inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nNorth Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un pose an uncompromising challenge to the new administration.\n\nKim Jong Un Wong Maye-E / AP\n\nWithin four years, some experts warn Kim may have a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the West Coast of the U.S., as well as submarines able to conduct swift surprise attack on America’s allies. So it will be crucial that Donald Trump restrain and engage Kim.\n\nIn October, a senior North Korean official told NBC News the country is targeting mainland America with a nuclear weapons program it will not halt.\n\n“Offense is the best form of defense,” Lee Yung Pil said.\n\nHe promised more nuclear tests, accused the U.S. of wanting to remove North Korea’s leadership and argued that American policies, including sanctions, have backfired.\n\nNorth Korea's Arms Race\n\nTurning North Korea into a nuclear power has defined Kim’s five years in power. Under him, the country has conducted three of its five nuclear tests.\n\nKim is also pursuing missile technology it would need to attack South Korea, as well as Japan and the 50,000 U.S. troops it hosts. Kim's regime also has designs on the key U.S. military outpost of Guam and the U.S. mainland itself. North Korea has even joined the space race and put satellites into orbit, possibly for the same reason.\n\nSo it is no surprise that, according to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration warned Trump’s transition team that the nuclear-armed country should be considered the incoming White House team’s top national security threat.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called Kim a \"maniac,” although it is unclear if that description was necessarily all negative. \"You've got to give him credit,\" he added.\n\nTrump also said he'd be willing to meet Kim over a hamburger — a suggestion that Pyongyang dismissed out of hand, presumably not because of Trump's choice of food.\n\nRelated: Here's How Trump Vowed to Deal With 'Bad Dudes' Like Kim\n\nThe Shortcomings Of Sanctions\n\nThe United Nations’ toughest economic sanctions ever did not stop North Korea from conducting its the most powerful nuclear test to date on Sept. 9 — what Pyongyang claims was a powerful hydrogen bomb.\n\nNorth Korea has dodged the worst effects thanks to its ally, sponsor and neighbor China. For its part, China argues it cannot deal with the North Korean nuclear issue alone and that a solution lies with the two main protagonists — Pyongyang and Washington — engaging directly.\n\nAs one U.S. official said recently, sanctions are designed to bring North Korea to its senses not to its knees. Whatever their intention, they don’t appear to be working. In Pyongyang, it is possible to have a morning cappuccino made with Starbucks coffee beans and an evening drink of Argentine wine followed by the finest Scotch whisky.\n\nTrump could pursue even more targeted sanctions, but past measures have clearly not stopped the North Korean nuclear program so what would be the point in that?\n\nIn fact, Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said recently that the goal of getting the North to give up its nuclear program is “probably a lost cause.”\n\n“They are not going to do that — that is their ticket to survival. They are under siege and they are very paranoid,” he said. “The best that we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap.”\n\nThe Confrontation Strategy\n\nThe new president could ditch the United States’ decades-long policy of “strategic patience” and instead confront Pyongyang.\n\nRelated: How China Could Pose the Biggest Challenge for Trump\n\nTo some degree, the U.S. is already doing that by holding increasingly large military exercises with ally South Korea that include rehearsals for regime change in Pyongyang. It flew B-1 nuclear bombers off North Korea in September as a show of force.\n\nTrump could ramp up this approach, but a direct, preemptive strike on North Korea is most probably not on the table — the risk is just too big. Pyongyang would immediately retaliate by blitzing South Korea’s capital Seoul, which is only 50 miles from its border.\n\nThe exact capabilities of Kim’s long-range missiles are not clear. But it is safe to say he would try to retaliate to a foreign attack. And no one doubts he has a nuclear capability, however weak.\n\nThe Accommodation Option\n\nThere is another, as yet untried approach that the new administration might consider.\n\nRather than trying to prevent or reverse North Korea’s nuclear program, the U.S. might quietly accept it and manage the consequences.\n\nAs it is, the North sees its nuclear program not as a bargaining chip but a vital part of its national security. It sees the world through the lens crafted by President George W. Bush, who in 2002 declared the country part of America’s “axis of evil” that encompassed Iraq and Iran.\n\nPyongyang undoubtedly watched carefully as Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was overthrown and hanged after a U.S. invasion. And the regime surely noted the invasion was justified by allegations Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction, charges that turned out to be false. Later, Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya — another American bugbear who had harbored and then abandoned ambitions of developing a nuclear arsenal — was toppled and murdered during a U.S.-backed uprising.\n\nKim’s nuclear weapons are his defense against going the same way as Saddam and Gadhafi.\n\nClapper notes that accepting North Korea’s inconvenient arsenal and trying to cap it may require “some sort of inducements.”\n\nSo Trump has difficult choices ahead, given that the decades-old policies of sanctions, threats, isolation, talks and concessions have had little impact.\n\nThe China Dilemma\n\nFailing again under Trump would send a signal of American weakness in a region where the balance of power is in question, with China challenging America’s right to play a preeminent role in Asian affairs.\n\nAnd here’s where the North Korea question joins an even bigger one for the new president: an increasingly assertive China.\n\nRelated: Trump Inherits an Increasingly Divided World\n\nTrump has often suggested China crack down on its smaller neighbor. But while Beijing has no love for the instability North Korea creates, it is also in its interests to have a buffer zone against U.S. forces in the south of the peninsula.\n\nThe last thing Beijing wants is a collapsed North Korea, which could result in American troops right on its border in a reunited Korea. So for China, the status quo may be the least-bad option.\n\nBut if the new president concludes that a nuclear-armed North is inevitable, it may be forced to propose new arms control and nuclear talks that include Israel, Pakistan, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and other states that may want the weapons. That is unlikely, although as a candidate Trump criticized the current international nuclear status quo that prevented allies like Japan from developing nuclear arsenals for their own protection.\n\n“At some point we have to say, you know what we’re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,” candidate Trump said when asked whether he would abandon longstanding U.S. policy of a non-nuclear Japan.\n\nSo how the Trump team will handle North Korea, the region and nuclear proliferation is not yet known — the president-elect has not addressed the issue specifically since Nov. 8.\n\nAlso in This Series",
  "latent_26175": "Mitchell Johnson: \"When I saw the young guys out there performing it really urged me and pushed me to get out there and play.\" © Getty Images\n\nAs he watched Ryan Harris, Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin shuffle out of the dressing room for the final time, Mitchell Johnson wondered whether he should join them. Seriously drained after a year in which he could not follow up World Cup success with retaining the Ashes, he pondered the possibility of retirement.\n\n'I don't think it's the best preparation' Mitchell Johnson has questioned Australia's preparation for the New Zealand Test series, with only a two-day red-ball camp in Sydney offering relevant practice before the squad assembles for the Gabba. The postponement of the Bangladesh tour means Australia's Test players are warming up in the Matador Cup 50-over tournament but are then subject to a round of day-night Sheffield Shield matches with the experimental pink ball before the first two Tests of summer are played in daylight with the red ball. Johnson's scepticism about the day-night concept is well known. While he hesitated to comment too freely on the Adelaide match at this point, he questioned the wisdom of switching from red to white to pink to red ball again ahead of what is shaping as New Zealand's best chance to unseat Australia at home since they last did so in 1985. \"I don't think it's ideal us playing a day-night Shield game coming into a three-Test series, two with a red ball and one with a pink ball,\" Johnson said. \"I don't think it's ideal, especially guys missing out on Bangladesh, they're probably needing to bowl with a red ball and we're playing this now, then going down to Tassie to play with a pink ball. \"I don't think it's the best preparation, but I guess that's why we have this camp as well to get a bit of a feel with the red ball again.\" Earlier in the year Johnson responded to questions about the pink ball by saying: \"One thing is I love the tradition of Test cricket, things like the Baggy Green and little things like wearing the woollen jumper. We had an option to change that but we wanted to keep that as a tradition. I think tradition in the game is very important.\"\n\nBut, in the six weeks since the Ashes have passed, Johnson has found himself feeling the old urge to train, to compete, and most importantly to bowl fast. He is now eager to do so once more, as the senior pro in what has now become a young and much changed team. Johnson has clear ideas on how and how much he should be used, and has set his sights upon matching the wickets tally of his mentor Dennis Lillee.\n\n\"It definitely has crossed my mind, especially with the guys retiring,\" Johnson said at Australia's training camp in Hurstville. \"A lot of those guys I played a lot of cricket with [have moved on] and it definitely makes you question yourself. I definitely have questioned myself in the six weeks I've been home, but I had that desire when I saw the young guys out there performing and it really urged me and pushed me to get out there and play. I actually went for a run and was pushing myself.\n\n\"Brett Lee changed it a little bit because he played for a while longer. Speaking to some other people like Dennis, he seems to think I can go for a few more years as well. It depends on the individual to be honest, I had that year out of the game really with my toe injury, I was a late starter to the game. So I think it's more mind than anything, my body's still holding up pretty well.\n\n\"I've had little niggles here and there but i'm able to get through them. It's more mind. I'm really looking forward to the summer, getting back on fair wickets with a bit of pace and bounce, good for batting and for bowling. I'd love to get a few wickets and get that tally back up again.\"\n\nAt the end of a two-year period in which he played 18 of a possible 19 Tests besides sundry ODIs and Twenty20 fixtures, Johnson's body was holding up reasonably. But his mind had begun to waver - even though he felt he had stored up enough mental energy for the Ashes campaign, he found himself getting drained midway through the series, not helped by the constant toll of English crowds and batsmen.\n\n\"I was definitely worn down physically but I think I can always manage physically though,\" Johnson said. \"It's more mentally that I felt myself really drained even through the England tour at times. Constantly getting hammered by the crowds does take its toll, but also the long year we've had with the World Cup. It was a huge build-up, to win that and then I went to IPL and played there. Was pretty flat throughout that, and then got to the West Indies and started to pick up a bit.\n\n\"The Ashes always takes it out of you anyway, it's such a huge occasion, and was definitely great to get back home after that. I personally think if I'd played that one-day series there was a chance of burnout or injury, that's how I felt within myself. That's why I missed that one-day series, getting fresh to be ready for a big summer and hopefully be in really good form and play really good cricket.\n\n\"I know New Zealand are going to be a tough opposition, then we've got a few Test matches after that against West Indies then over to New Zealand. So it's a really hectic time, but the little break I've had has definitely freshened me up and I'm ready to go.\"\n\nThere were other issues that had crept into Johnson's mind as well. The handling of Haddin's exit from the team rankled, and so did the haziness that often surrounded how Johnson was to be used in the bowling attack. Seldom was he able to simply charge in at top pace and intimidate as he had done against England two years ago, as much for the fact that there was no Harris or Peter Siddle keeping things tight at the other end as anything else.\n\nJohnson will be speaking with the coach Darren Lehmann and the new captain Steven Smith about this concept. Already it appears Lehmann understands the need for control as well as pace, stating that Australia will retain an allrounder throughout the Test summer while also picking their most balanced attack to keep the scoreboard tight.\n\n\"I spoke to Boof about it, it's something I thought about,\" Johnson said. \"I think it works best if I bowl short spells and I can bowl that high 140s or mid 140s, then I think that's the plan we should go with. I'm going to sit down and speak with Boof and Smithy about that and see what they think.\n\n\"But I've always got a plan B and I think I learned that a lot more over in England to have a plan B, just try to use the ball a bit more in certain conditions. You can't always blast teams out but when that time's right I'm definitely still putting my hand up for that role.\"\n\nThat sort of outspokenness can be expected more often as Johnson begins the final phase of his career. No longer one of many 30-somethings in the Test team, he is now an elder statesman, a leader and a keeper of tradition. There is much he can pass on to a young team before he is done.\n\nDaniel Brettig is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @danbrettig\n\n© ESPN Sports Media Ltd.",

Weekend At Corey’s is different because the dads will actually be together.\n\nThrowback break:\n\nSo what do you think? Are you excited to see the fellers gettin’ buckwild together? I know I am! Although I think I might have preferred a slightly different cast that included Jeremy Calvert and Cole DeBoer (he’s a dad-to-be now!) And if the show is a success, perhaps they could do another Weekend At Corey’s with the grandads, including Jeff Simms, Dr. Randy Houska, Michael Abraham, Ryan’s dad Larry Edwards, and Butch Baltierra! CAN YOU IMAGINE?!\n\nOooooo…MTV could also do a Weekend At Chelsea’s with the moms and/or the grandmas! Babs needs a vacation y’all! (I would also enjoy a Weekend At Farrah’s special, but something tells me that the guests would not enjoy that as much — especially having to use the porta potty.)\n\nOK, I’ll turn off my Teen Mom special imagination now…",
  "latent_26282": "It’s the stuff of nightmares. You’ve been having random, intense headaches for months, for no apparent reason. You finally turn to your doctor for answers. And their answer is...\n\nA parasite. And not just a single parasite. EIGHT tapeworm eggs lodged firmly in your brain, surviving off your blood supply and beginning to grow.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened to 31-year-old Yadira Rostro, a woman from Garland, Texas. After suffering with headaches and loss of vision, Rostro went to the hospital – only to be informed sacs of larvae from tapeworm eggs had begun to grow inside her brain.\n\nThe parasites were likely picked up on a holiday two years ago, where Rostro may have ingested food contaminated with fecal matter containing a tapeworm or an egg (a common way for tapeworms to transfer between hosts). Tapeworms normally pass through the body in a reasonably harmless manner, but occasionally the worm can travel to different parts of the body via the bloodstream and end up lodged somewhere you really don't want them.\n\nThe eggs have since been removed and Rostro is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nCheck out the following video courtesy of News 8 to see the sacs after removal.",

  "latent_26371": "This article is about the Channel Island called Herm. For other uses, see Herm (disambiguation)\n\nDesignations Ramsar Wetland Official name Herm, Jethou and The Humps Designated 19 October 2015 Reference no. 2277[1]\n\nHerm (Guernésiais: Haerme, ultimately from Old Norse arms “arm”, due to the shape of the island, or Old French eremite “hermit”) is one of the Channel Islands and part of the Parish of St Peter Port[2][3] in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It is located in the English Channel, north-west of France and south of England. It is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and under 0.5 miles (0.80 km) wide; orientated north-south, with several stretches of sand along its northern coast. The much larger island of Guernsey lies to the west and Jersey to the south-east, and the smaller island of Jethou is just off the south-west coast.\n\nHerm was first discovered in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.\n\nHerm's harbour is on its west coast. There are several buildings of note in the vicinity including the White House, St Tugual's Chapel, Fisherman's Cottage, \"The Mermaid\" pub and restaurant, and a small primary school with about eight children. During a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Cars are banned from the island, as are bicycles; quad bikes and tractors used for staff and luggage transport respectively are allowed.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe common in the north of the island. Standing stones can be seen on the grass, while the island of Sark lies in the background.\n\nPrehistory [ edit ]\n\nHerm was first found in the Mesolithic period (between 10,000 and 8,000 B.C), when hunters were in search of food.[4] In the Neolithic and Bronze ages, settlers arrived; the remains of chamber tombs have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau;[4] it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials.[5] After a three-year project by the University of Durham, supported by specialists from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the \"density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity\".[5]\n\nA prehistoric grave, known as Robert's Cross\n\nMiddle Ages [ edit ]\n\nThe first records of Herm's inhabitants in historic times are from the 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual's Chapel.[4] In 709, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Jethou.[6]\n\nAn important moment in Herm's political history was in 933, when the Channel Islands were annexed to the Duchy of Normandy,[4][7] they remained so until the division of Normandy in 1204, when they became a Crown Dependency.[8] In 1111 Brother Claude Panton was a hermit in \"Erm\"[9]:126 and in 1117 the then hermit, Brother Francis Franche Montague is recorded as living on \"Erm\".[9]:131 After the annexation, Herm gradually lost its monastic inhabitants, and between 1570 and 1737 the governors of Guernsey used it as a hunting ground; visiting to shoot, hunt, and fish.[4][7]\n\n19th century to the Second World War [ edit ]\n\nIn 1810, an inn was founded; and during the Industrial Revolution, roads, paths, a harbour, accommodation, a forge, blacksmiths, a brewery, a bakery and a prison were built to cater for the largest number of inhabitants since prehistoric times. Most were quarrymen working in new granite quarries.[4] Several quarries can still be seen at present, such as on the Common.[4] When the Prince[4] and Princess Blücher leased the island from the British government during the First World War, he introduced a colony of Red-necked wallabies to the island, around 60-70 in number. They increased up to the First World War, after which they decreased in numbers, and the remaining few were re-captured and put in enclosures.\n\nCompton Mackenzie, an English born Scottish novelist, acquired the tenancy. He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It has been suggested that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H. Lawrence's The Man who Loved Islands, about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it.[12][13]\n\nThe German occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by the Third Reich,[4] a few weeks after the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey, German soldiers landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, The Invasion of the Isle of Wight.[4] Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits. Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island for a few weeks, and mines were placed in an area. Occasionally German soldiers would travel to Herm to cut wood for fuel. [15]\n\nOperation Huckaback [ edit ]\n\nOperation Huckaback was a British Second World War military operation that was originally designed to be a raid on Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou, but instead became only a raid on Herm undertaken on the night of 27 February 1943, following an earlier attempt that had been aborted. Ten men of the Small Scale Raiding Force and No. 4 Commando under Captain Patrick Anthony Porteous VC landed 200 yards to the north-west of Selle Rocque on a shingle beach and made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the cliff in front of them. Porteous finally managed to climb up the bed of a stream and pulled the others up with a rope. They later reported that they had found no sign of any Islanders or Germans (who were supposed to be billeted near the harbour). They had failed to make contact with the few civilians on the island whose duties included looking after the sheep.\n\nSince 1945 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1949, the States of Guernsey bought Herm from the Crown because of the \"unspoilt island idyll that could be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike\".[18] One of the island's most influential tenants was Major Peter Wood, who looked after the island from 1949 to 1980 with his wife.[18][19] The island was run down when he arrived, with the manor hidden in undergrowth, the windows and roofs of the houses having been blown off by a sea mine drifting into the harbour shortly after their arrival,[20] but they created a school, and restored St Tugual's Chapel.[19] Major Wood's daughter Pennie Wood Heyworth and her husband Adrian succeeded them;[19] Major Wood died in 1998.[19] Their early efforts are recorded in Herm, Our Island Home, written by Major Wood's wife Jenny Wood.\n\nOn 17 May 2008, the BBC reported that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000.[23] Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers,[24] which led to fears from residents[24] that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner.[25] In September 2008 it was announced that Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease[26] for considerably less than the asking price.[27] The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.[26]\n\nIn 2013, negotiations for a 21-year extension to the lease broke down, with the tenant offering £440,000 and the owner requesting £6,000,000 plus improvements to infrastructure.[28]\n\nGeography and geology [ edit ]\n\nAn aerial shot showing Herm (centre), Jethou to the right, Sark in the right background and Guernsey in the foreground\n\nHerm is only 1½ miles long (north-south) and less than half a mile wide (east-west).[19] In the northern part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grande Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner.[29] To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour.[30] Half of the coastline of the northern part of the island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky.[31] Much of Herm's bedrock is granite.[32] In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point.[33]\n\nShell Beach, northeastern coast Caquorobert , east coast of Herm\n\nOff the northwestern coast of Herm is the islet of Le Plat Houmet, and beyond that Fondu, which like Herm belongs to Guernsey.[29] In Belvoir Bay on the eastern side of the island are the islets of Mouliere, situated off Frenchman's Point which is to the northeast of the manor village, and Caquorobert.[30] To the south of this off the southeastern coast is Puffin Bay, which contains the islet of Putrainez near the coast and the islet of Selle Rocque further out to the south.[30] The far southwestern point of the island is Point Sauzebourge, and Bishop's Cove is just to the north of this.[29] North of the cove and south along the beach from the harbour and White House are the Rosiere Steps, with a quarry and cottage of the same name in the vicinity. The Mouette and Percee reefs are offshore here. Hermetier, also known as Rat's Island, lies about 250 metres (820 ft) off the western coast between Fisherman's Beach and The Bear's Beach, to the north of the harbour, linked by a low causeway from the beach.\n\nThe isle of Jethou is around three-quarters of a mile to the southwest beyond Point Sauzebourge.[29][35] It is possible that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land that connected Jethou to Herm.[36] About 215 metres (705 ft) off the northern coast of Jethou is the islet of Crevichon, which measures about 212 metres (696 ft) by 168 metres (551 ft), with an area of less than three hectares. To the west, between Herm and Guernsey, lies the channel Little Roussel (Petit Ruau); between Herm and Sark, to the east, lies the Big Roussel (Grand Ruau).[31] Bréhon Tower, a Victorian-era fortification, is in the Little Roussel between Herm and Saint Peter Port.[37] The tower was created by Thomas Charles de Putron (1806–1869) using granite from Herm between 1854 and 1856.\n\nPolitics [ edit ]\n\nHerm is part of the St Peter Port parish of Guernsey but is not part of any canton. It belongs to the Electoral District of Saint Peter Port South.[39] It is rented out to various tenants.[40][41] and, unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Herm is administered entirely by the States of Guernsey.\n\nCars and bicycles are banned from Herm,[18] in order to keep \"peace and tranquility\".[19] Herm does allow quad bikes and tractors for staff and luggage transport respectively.[19]\n\nEconomy and services [ edit ]\n\nHerm Harbour in 1968 The inner harbour in 2004\n\nTourism is Herm's main source of income.[19] During a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island,[19] arriving by one of the Travel Trident catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company.[42] Money is also made from vegetable growing, livestock and the occasional issue of stamps.[43] The residents in Herm are workers on the island and their families.[44]\n\nThere are three volunteer Special Constables resident on the island, trained and supervised by the States of Guernsey Police Service.[45] On Bank Holidays they are augmented by a visiting full-time Constable from Guernsey.[46] Crime rates on the island are low.[45]\n\nThere are no medical facilities on Herm and no resident doctor.[19] A small team of first aiders and community first responders is maintained amongst the resident population,[47] and receives regular training from the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, a private company operating on a charitable basis under the umbrella of the Venerable Order of Saint John.[48] Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch 'Flying Christine III' operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.[47]\n\nA voluntary fire service operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic fire-fighting equipment[49] which they use while waiting for assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.[49]\n\nNotable landmarks [ edit ]\n\nThe nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel dates to the 11th century, but it is believed that there was a place of worship on Herm as far back as the 6th century, although it has not been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date.[50] The current building is Norman and appears to have been a monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour.[50] In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.[51]\n\nThe obelisk on The Common on Herm A picture of Antony Gormley's statue, XI (11) in his Another Time series\n\nOther buildings on the island include the White House hotel, \"The Mermaid\" pub and restaurant, and 20 self-catering cottages.[19] The most notable cottages are Fisherman's Cottage, north of the harbour, and Manor Cottage.[52] There is an obelisk on The Common, in the north of the island.[4] The White House has no clocks, televisions, or phones, which is described as \"part of its charm\", and has a customer return rate of 70% (i.e. each year, 70% of customers have been before).[24][53] Herm has no consecrated religious buildings or resident professional clergy,[54] but visiting clergy conducts non-denominational weekly services during the summer months, and monthly services, led by local lay people, are held during the winter.[54]\n\nSculptor Antony Gormley had a sculpture installed on Herm in 2010,[55] originally planned to be removed after one year, but it received such a positive reception that it was kept for two years, and removed in 2012.[56] The statue was number XI (11) of the Another Time series.[57]\n\nEducation and culture [ edit ]\n\nTravel Trident ferry approaching Herm\n\nA number of French/Norman placenames remain, from the period when the island was in the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Normandy.[4] The Herm Island map, published by the tenant of Herm, states that main place names, including the island name itself, have unclear origins, although there is an unofficial Anglicisation of names; for example, La Pointe du gentilhomme was changed to \"Alderney Point\".[31] The primary present language on Herm is English.\n\nHerm has one primary school, with around eight pupils; they are taught by a teacher who travels from Guernsey daily.[19] Children over eleven are schooled in Guernsey, usually as boarders.[19]\n\nHerm has won Britain in Bloom categories several times:[58] in 2002, 2008, and 2012, Herm won the Britain in Bloom Gold Award.\n\nThe island and its history has been depicted in a number of works of literature: the author, Compton Mackenzie, who was the island tenant 1920-23, represented it in Fairy Gold, albeit in a fictional representation.[4] Jenny Wood, the wife of tenant Major Peter Wood, published her memoirs in 1986.[60] The island's history is told in Hidden Treasures of Herm Island by Catherine Kalamis.[61] And 2018 saw the publication of Paul Sherman's Where Seagulls Dare - a collection of short stories set in the island.[62]\n\nThe northern part of the island was recognised in 2016 as an area of international environmental importance under the Ramsar Convention.[63]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCoordinates:",

For example, those supporting illegal aliens have insisted for years that they obey the tax laws, as demonstrated by the fact that they pay Social Security (payroll taxes) on income they have unlawfully earned.

  "latent_26612": "Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world\n\nA pastor who blamed gay people for a “moral 9/11” has preached to millions at Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony.\n\nPastor Franklin Graham was one of a number of hard-right religious figures to appear at the event, just minutes after President Trump was sworn into office.\n\nThe pastor, the son of evangelist Billy Graham and head of Christian charity Samaritan’s Purse, spoke for less than a minute, claiming that God was “blessing” Trump by raining on the event before reading Bible verse 1 Timothy 2.\n\nGraham is not always known for sticking so solidly to the scripture.\n\nThe pastor recently claimed there had been a “moral 9/11” in America due to “gays and lesbians” on school boards.\n\nHe claimed: “The country is imploding. We are seeing a moral implosion. Just like we saw the World Trade Center on 9/11 when the planes hit the tower, they imploded, they fell from within, and this is what’s happening to our country, we’re falling within.\n\n“So many school districts now are controlled by wicked, evil people, and the gays and lesbians… I keep bringing their name up, but they are at the forefront of this attack against Christianity in America.”\n\nLast year Graham declared gay people are ‘the enemy’, attacking churches that have become LGBT-inclusive.\n\nHe accused LGBT activists of “trying to cram down America’s throat the lie that homosexuality is okay”, alleging that anti-discrimination laws will mean that “your children, and your grandchildren will be at risk to sexual predators and perverts”.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with a Russian newspaper, Graham praised Vladimir Putin’s support for anti-gay laws – and claimed that homosexuals “take people’s children”.\n\nParroting disturbing rhetoric often used by anti-LGBT vigilantes in Russia, he said: “Homosexuals cannot have children, they can take other people’s children.”\n\nHe added: “I very much appreciate that President Putin is protecting Russian young people against homosexual propaganda. If only to give them the opportunity to grow up and make a decision for themselves.”\n\nHe was selected for Trump’s inauguration despite his slew of extremist comments.

  "latent_26632": "Here are three positional battles to monitor heading into the Chicago Bears’ preseason finale versus the Cleveland Browns:\n\n1. Running back: Undrafted rookie Michael Ford is making a strong push to grab one of the final spots on the 53-man roster after returning a kickoff 100 yards in the second preseason game against San Diego, then following up that performance with 58 rushing yards and a touchdown on nine carries last week in Oakland. If the Bears decide to keep just three tailbacks, it means either Ford or veteran Armando Allen has to go. Allen played well last season for the Bears, appearing in 15 games and recording seven special-teams tackles. But Allen has been working his way back from an injury the past couple weeks, which has opened the door for the less expensive rookie out of LSU to showcase himself in these preseason games. Both figure to receive ample playing time tonight at Soldier Field.\n\n2. Quarterback: The Bears’ offense is entirely in the hands of veteran quarterbacks Jordan Palmer and Trent Edwards after Bears head coach Marc Trestman announced last week that starter Jay Cutler and No. 2 Josh McCown would not see the field in the final preseason contest. If the Bears open the season with three quarterbacks, and that is still an if, the final spot could be determined by which of the two reserves has a better game against the Browns, plus what each accomplished on the practice field the past two weeks. The Bears got a brief look at just Palmer last week in the fourth quarter (1-for-1, five yards), but both quarterbacks will get an extended look tonight. Even if the Bears decide to go with just two quarterbacks to start the year, the team might still find themselves in need of another QB later in the season -- that’s why this is still an important game for Palmer and Edwards, regardless.\n\n3. Offensive line: If the Bears retain eight offensive linemen, as offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer hinted earlier in training camp, then two spots might still be available. That means Jonathan Scott, Eben Britton, J’Marcus Webb and Taylor Boggs are probably the guys still alive to make the team, although sometimes these calls are already made before the final preseason game. Scott has actually pulled off the rare feat of improving his position on the team despite missing the past several weeks with a knee injury that required a procedure to clean it out. That’s because Webb has continued to struggle ever since being demoted to second-team left tackle. Webb is a mystery. He has all the physical gifts, but his inconsistency coupled with his strange behavior and apparent lack of passion toward the game, makes him a strong candidate to get cut. If Scott’s knee is OK for Week 1, then it might make sense to just keep him and Britton, try and sneak Boggs on the practice squad, and send Webb on his merry way. But if Webb wants to make one final stand, he better make the most his opportunities tonight.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nAn April 16, 2016, file photo shows an \"All Gender\" bathroom sign at the San Diego International Airport. (Photo11: Jason Szenes, European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nWICHITA FALLS, Texas — A federal judge has affirmed that an injunction against the Obama administration in Texas v. United States can be applied nationwide, blocking the Departments of Justice and Education from enforcing guidance on bathroom access for transgender students across the country.\n\nWednesday's ruling in a Wichita Falls federal court also could affect several other lawsuits in which U.S. attorneys are involved, including United States v. North Carolina, the case that kicked off a national debate over transgender rights earlier this year.\n\nThe injunction also makes clear that the Obama administration may not withhold federal funds from districts that do not comply with its guidance on transgender access to \"intimate areas\" inside schools.\n\nTexas is joined in the litigation by 14 co-plaintiffs, including conservative states, school districts and individuals. The lawsuit was filed in May.\n\nHowever, the ruling gives U.S. attorneys the go-ahead to proceed with other lawsuits previously held in limbo by the court order.\n\nThe injunction, ordered by Judge Reed O'Connor in August, forbade the Obama administration from enforcing guidance it issued to school districts in May, but U.S. attorneys later argued the ruling's parameters were too vague. They asked for additional direction from the court before proceeding with almost 20 other related lawsuits.\n\nO'Connor now has specified that U.S. attorneys may go ahead with some of their cases regarding transgender rights, but only those that don't center on bathroom access. Thus, Wednesday's ruling represents a partial victory for both Texas and the Obama administration.\n\n\"The court's reaffirmation of a nationwide injunction should send a clear message to the president that Texas won't sit idly by as he continues to ignore the Constitution,\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a news release. \"The president cannot rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people and then threaten to take away funding from schools to force them to fall in line.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education could not be immediately reached.\n\nFollow Christopher Collins on Twitter: @ChrisCollinsTRN\n\nRelated:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2esFrbd",

  "latent_26764": "Last week we challenged Dave Arnold, Director of Technology at the French Culinary Institute, to do two things: make us a burger at his house (video over on Eater NY) and to show us his interpretation of the burger of the future.\n\nThe result is the Soup Dumpling Burger, which Arnold demoed for us on the fifth floor of the FCI. In the preparation, he fills a patty with a veal stock gelatin that liquifies when cooked (in this case the heat comes from an immersion circulator, a deep fryer, and a makeshift charcoal grill). He then tops it with bacon that has been \"glued\" together to render a perfect disk, as well as circular Comte cheese and pickles. Buttered rye bread seals, and melts, the deal.\n\nSee what happens when Arnold brings the wacky and Eater Moving Pictures brings the minimalism in the video below.\n\nDave Arnold's Burger Of The Future from Eater NY on Vimeo.\n\nMusic credit: \"Time Keeps\" by Awning.\n\nArnold's Recipe:\n\n1) Slice bacon in strips, layer with Activa RM (meat glue) and vacuum bag between parchment paper and allow to set for 4 hours in fridge.\n\n2) Reduce veal stock till thick and super beefy, then add ketchup (Heinz), salt and pepper to taste. While hot, stir in 2 percent by weight of calcium lactate gluconate. Pour the mix into a 3/16 to 1/4 inch sheet in a lined hotel pan and allow to set hard in the fridge (the natural gelatin from the stock makes it set).\n\n3) Disperse 9 grams of sodium alginate (type DMB from FMC biopolymer) and 5 grams sodium citrate in a liter of water in a vita prep and turn on high to hydrate.\n\n4) Deaerate the alginate in a chamber vacuum machine. Keep alginate bath cold.\n\n5) Cut the ketchup gel into rings and drop into alginate bath and leave for 40 seconds. The calcium in the gel interacts with the alginate to form a fairly tough (usually bad but useful here because of the rough treatment it with withstand) heat-proof coating on the gel. Remove gel from bath and store on a silpat in fridge.\n\n6) Cut boneless beef short ribs and chuck steak into strips removing gristle, silverskin, etc and place into freezer to firm up (your meat grinder should already be in the freezer). I use 30-40 percent short rib.\n\n7) After the meat has gotten stiff (don't freeze it), grind it.\n\n8) For each burger form two thin patties and some ropes of meat. Try not to overhandle the meat.\n\n9) Form the ropes into a wall around one of the patties and slip a ketchup gel into the center. Place the second patty on top and seal all the edges.\n\n10) Liberally season both sides of the burger with pepper and salt and briefly deep-fry the burger to set the outside of the meat.\n\n11) Place the burger in a ziploc bag with melted butter and carefully get rid of the air using the underwater bagging method.\n\n12) Cook the burger at 55 or 55.5 c in an immersion circulator for a couple of hours.\n\n13) Using an usuba, cut a pickle into a sheet and then cut a circle from the sheet.\n\n14) Slice a thin sheet of Comte cheese and cut a circle from the sheet.\n\n15) Cut two circles from rye bread.\n\n16) Remove bacon sheet from bag and cook between two silpats weighted with a sheet pan in the oven.\n\n17)When done cut a circle from the bacon sheet.\n\n18) Light hardwood charcoal on the stove.\n\n19) Pull the burger from the bag and let cool a couple minutes.\n\n20) Grill the burger over super hot coals fir crust and taste.\n\n21) Heat a pan with butter and toast the bread bacon and cheese (like a grilled cheese).

Here are some highlights:\n\nQuestion: Do you think Kela will ever rejoin the team?\n\nEvan Grant: Yes. And I hope he does. What Kela did, at least in perception, was unacceptable. He reportedly did not put honest effort into an intrasquad game when all the other bullpen pitchers were throwing. That's just wrong. But, on its own, I don't think that is an offense worthy of trading the guy just to be rid of him. He's too talented and, I think, a guy who wants to be the best he can be. Sometimes he's got an unusual way of showing that. Sometimes it rubs veterans the wrong way. But few veterans can identify with the kind of life Kela has had. Just as Kela can probably not identify much with the backgrounds of Adrian Beltre, Beltre can't identify with Kela's background. And same goes for so much of this international roster. At the end of the day, though, a lack of effort is a serious lack of professionalism and that must be stated clearly to Kela. He must accept that and apologize. And then the Rangers must go to work trying to understand him better, too. And what offends, motivates, annoys him. I think things can be solved with a good conversation that involves give and take and all sides acknowledging that sometimes things go wrong and that everybody must accept culpability.\n\nQuestion: Who are the top prospects that I should watch out for at the RoughRiders game tonight?\n\nEvan Grant: RHP Connor Sadzeck and C Jose Trevino are the first guys that come to my mind.

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nHeat-Spurs Preview\n\nBy BRIAN MAHONEY\n\nPosted Jun 04 2014 6:39PM SAN ANTONIO (AP) LeBron James and Dwyane Wade can point to statistics showing just how close the 2013 NBA Finals were. Tim Duncan doesn't need them. He can't forget the way his San Antonio Spurs lost, especially since every replay brings another painful reminder. The Spurs were on the verge of celebrating a fifth title in Game 6, and just two nights later were congratulating the Miami Heat on their second straight crown. The Spurs wanted a rematch, and so did basketball fans. It begins Thursday in San Antonio. \"I think it's great that these two franchises have this opportunity in back-to-back years to compete for a championship,\" Wade said Wednesday. \"Last year was an unbelievable series and ... it went down to the very end. We won the series by a total of five points, you know? That's how close it was. But it was a very even series. I think this year it could be another great series.\" From Tony Parker's circus shot that stole Game 1 for the Spurs, to Ray Allen's 3-pointer that saved Game 6 for the Heat, to James' jumper that put away Game 7, almost every contest provided a new highlight. It deserved an encore, just like when the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers seemed to pick up right where they left off in the 1980s. The NBA hasn't had a finals rematch since 1998, when Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls beat Utah for the second straight season. San Antonio is considered a slight favorite this time, perhaps a little deeper, healthier and better than it was last year, and owning the home-court advantage this time. The Spurs don't need to change much to change the result. They outscored the Heat 684-679 over seven games, and there were 47 ties and 42 lead changes, according to STATS. \"If you look at the numbers, the lead changes, the ties and the points in that series, it's almost even,\" James said. \"So we did our part, they did their part. \"Both teams put themselves in a position to win an NBA championship, and we just happened to make one or two more plays to win it.\" Duncan, a three-time NBA Finals MVP who had been 4 for 4 at this stage, wasn't on the floor when the Spurs couldn't come up with a rebound just before Allen's shot. He then missed a shot and follow attempt from right in front of the basket in the final minute of Game 7 with San Antonio trailing by two. Not even getting back to the finals again with the league's best record can make him forget. \"It lasts. I have a very good memory, especially for my misses and losses. You keep those, you learn from them and you hope to change them next time,\" Duncan said. \"That stuck with me and obviously it's always in the back of my mind, and every time I see anything to do with that, it pops right back in.\" James had similar regrets in his first finals with Miami in 2011, but it's been all smiles since. The Heat are the first team to play in four straight finals since Boston from 1984-87, and can become the first three-time champion since the Lakers more than a decade ago. But their focus is only on winning the next title, not reminiscing about the last couple. \"Last year is last year and we're excited about it, but this trophy this year belongs to nobody,\" James said. \"It's up for grabs.\" Both teams have reason to think they will win it. Wade is much healthier than last year, when he needed extensive treatment before Game 7, and the Heat have been able to get him extra rest by losing just three games in the first three rounds. The Spurs' Manu Ginobili is also in much better shape this year and Patty Mills has emerged as an effective point guard off the bench, giving San Antonio options if Parker is slowed by the sore left ankle that knocked him out of Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. It's the sixth finals for the Spurs since 1999 and Miami's fifth in nine years, but both face uncertain futures. Duncan, Parker, Ginobili and coach Gregg Popovich could be near the end of their run together. James, Wade and Bosh can all become free agents this summer. That's for July. For now, maybe the teams can duplicate last June. \"You hope it's going to be a great series for both teams' sake, for the fans that love our game,\" James said. \"You hope it can be one of the great finals appearances.\" Just like last year. --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The San Antonio Spurs handled the conditions, and the team, and it sure helped when a suffering LeBron James couldn't make it to the finish. Tim Duncan had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and the Spurs beat the Heat 110-95 on Thursday night in Game 1 at steamy AT&T Center. With an air conditioning failure making it feel like a sauna and causing James to battle cramps that knocked him out of the decisive stretch, the Spurs pulled away to win the opener of the first finals rematch since 1998. \"After I came out of the game, they kind of took off,\" James said. \"And it was frustrating sitting out and not be able to help our team.\" Manu Ginobili had 16 points and 11 assists, Tony Parker added 19 points and eight assists and the Spurs - 6 for 6 in NBA Finals Game 1s - shot 59 percent. \"Just very proud of my team,\" Parker said. \"We kept believing, kept pushing. We know it's not easy.\" They host Game 2 on Sunday - likely in cooler conditions. James finished with 25 points but played only 33 minutes, and Miami was outscored 36-17 in the fourth quarter. \"It sucks not being out there for your team, especially at this point in the season,\" James said. Dwyane Wade had 19 points and Chris Bosh added 18, but the Heat wilted in temperatures that soared to 90 degrees in the second half. \"It was tough on both teams,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"They were pretty dead. We tried to get guys in and out. ... It was really hot out there.\" James, who had cramping issues two years ago in the finals, had to ask for a break in the fourth quarter and was getting treatment during a 15-4 Spurs run that turned around the game. James came back in and made a basket that cut it to two points with about 4 minutes left, but couldn't even run back on defense, promptly putting his hand up and lingering at the baseline until help arrived to take him off for good. \"I think it felt like a punch in the gut when you see your leader limping like that back to the bench,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Danny Green followed with 3-pointer to trigger what became a 16-3 run to end the game. \"You could see the heat was getting to a lot of guys. If I played as many minutes as he did, I'd probably be cramping up, too,\" said Green, who scored 11 of his 13 points in the final quarter. The crowd chanted \"Beat the Heat! Beat the Heat!\" late in the game, which was just what the fans themselves were trying to do. The Spurs said an electrical failure for the power that runs the air conditioning system had occurred. They apologized for the inconvenience but also seemed to poke fun of it, playing songs with \"hot\" in the lyrics over the sound system. Fans were trying to cool themselves on the hot night, a reminder of what it was like in the old Boston Garden when the Celtics and Lakers got together. The Heat are the first team since those Celtics of 1984-87 to get to four straight finals. They are well-rested after a relatively easy roll through the Eastern Conference playoffs, a key to keeping Wade healthy entering the finals. James was the MVP of the series last year when the Heat rallied from five points down in the final half-minute of regulation to win Game 6 in overtime, then won a Game 7 that was close the whole way for their second straight championship. A rematch was widely anticipated and was close almost throughout. The Heat led 86-79 after Bosh's four-point play with 9:38 remaining in the game, but it was all San Antonio from there, and Wade said there were problems even beyond James' absence. \"Obviously, tonight we would've loved to have him in there to finish the game, but we've got to finish the game better,\" Wade said. The Spurs ended up extending their NBA-record streak to eight straight home playoff wins by 15 or more points. Their roster is filled with international players, such as Parker and Ginobili, who both said they were used to playing without air conditioning overseas. Bosh, scoreless in Game 7 last year, scored Miami's first five points in the Heat's 7-2 start. But Ginobili came off the bench firing, making consecutive 3-pointers for an 18-13 lead. Wade and James combined for six straight points before Ginobili made another 3, and Patty Mills added one to close the first-quarter scoring and give the Spurs a 26-20 advantage. The Spurs committed nine turnovers while managing only 20 points in the third quarter, and Miami led 78-74 heading to the fourth.

For someone who just wants to understand the merits of a particular translation or who is perhaps looking to buy a Bible, the geekish terminology that surrounds the subject can be a real stumbling block. So, in order to help those who have not been initiated into the secrets of translation terminology, I would like to present this definitive guide.\n\nMeaning Based : “a translation which prioritizes the meaning rather than the form of the original language.”\n\n: “a translation which prioritizes the meaning rather than the form of the original language.” Form Based : “a translation which prioritizes the form of the original language rather than the meaning.”\n\n: “a translation which prioritizes the form of the original language rather than the meaning.” Literal Translation “a form based translation”\n\n“a form based translation” Word for Word : “a form-based translation and I don’t know much about languages.”\n\n: “a form-based translation and I don’t know much about languages.” Free Translation : “I don’t like this meaning based translation.”\n\n: “I don’t like this meaning based translation.” Paraphrase : “I really don’t like this meaning based translation.”\n\n: “I really don’t like this meaning based translation.” Accurate : I like it.\n\n: I like it.

  "latent_27651": "Jeffrey Mark Goldberg (born September 22, 1965) is an American journalist and the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. During his nine years at The Atlantic prior to becoming editor, Goldberg became known for his coverage of foreign affairs. He has won many awards and written eleven cover stories for the magazine.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nGoldberg was born to a Jewish family[3] in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ellen and Daniel Goldberg,[4] whom he describes as \"very left-wing.\"[5] He grew up in suburban Malverne on Long Island, where he recalled being one of the few Jews in a largely Irish-American area. During his first trip to Israel as \"a powerless 13-year-old boy suffering at the hands of Irish pogromists, juvenile pogromists,\" he found the Jewish empowerment embodied by Israeli soldiers exciting, \"So, I became deeply enamored of Israel because of that.\"[5]\n\nHe attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was editor-in-chief of The Daily Pennsylvanian.[6] While at Penn he worked at the Hillel kitchen serving lunch to students. He left college to move to Israel, where he served in the Israeli Defense Forces as a prison guard during the First Intifada at Ktzi'ot Prison, a prison camp set up to hold arrested Palestinian participants in the uprising. There he met Rafiq Hijazi, a Palestine Liberation Organization leader, college math teacher and devout Muslim from a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, whom Goldberg describes as \"the only Palestinian I could find in Ketziot who understood the moral justification for Zionism\".[6]\n\nGoldberg lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Pamela (née Ress) Reeves, and their three children.[4][7]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nGoldberg returned to the United States and began his career at The Washington Post, where he was a police reporter. While in Israel, he worked as a columnist for The Jerusalem Post, and upon his return to the US served as the New York bureau chief of The Forward, a contributing editor at New York magazine, and a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine.[8][9][10] In October 2000, Goldberg joined The New Yorker.[8]\n\nIn 2007, he was hired by David G. Bradley to write for The Atlantic. Bradley had tried to convince Goldberg to come work for The Atlantic for nearly two years, and was finally successful after renting ponies for Goldberg's children.[11] In 2011, Goldberg joined Bloomberg View as a columnist,[12] and his editorials are also syndicated online, often appearing on such media sites as Newsday[13] and Newsmax.[14] Goldberg concluded writing for Bloomberg in 2014.[15]\n\nGoldberg was a journalist with The Atlantic before becoming editor-in-chief.[10] Goldberg wrote principally on foreign affairs, with a focus on the Middle East and Africa.[8]\n\nMichael Massing, an editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, called Goldberg \"the most influential journalist/blogger on matters related to Israel,\"[16] and David Rothkopf, the CEO and editor of the FP Group, called him \"one of the most incisive, respected foreign policy journalists around.\"[17] He has been described by critics as a neoconservative,[18] a liberal,[19] a Zionist[20] and a critic of Israel.[21] The New York Times reported that he \"shaped\" the magazine's endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, only the third endorsement in the magazine's 160-year history.[10]\n\nNotable articles [ edit ]\n\n\"The Great Terror\", The New Yorker, 2002 [ edit ]\n\nIn \"The Great Terror\", Goldberg investigates the nature of the Iraqi Army's chemical attack on the Kurds in Halabja in 1988 that resulted in the deaths of between 3,200 and 5,000 people and injured 7,000 to 10,000 more, most of them civilians.[22][23]\n\n\"The Great Terror\" won the Overseas Press Club's Joe & Laurie Dine Award for international human rights reporting. In a March 2002 CNN interview, former CIA director, James Woolsey said, \"I think Jeff Goldberg's piece is quite remarkable, and he and The New Yorker deserve a lot of credit for it.\"[24]\n\n\"In the Party of God\", The New Yorker, 2002 [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2002, Goldberg wrote a two-part examination of Hezbollah, \"In the Party of God.\"[25] Part I recounts his time in the village of Ras al-Ein, located in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, meeting with Hezbollah officials, including Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's former spiritual leader, and Hussayn al-Mussawi, founder of the now-defunct pro-Iranian Islamist militia Islamic Amal in 1982.[25] Part II examines Hezbollah's activities in South America, specifically in the area known as the Triple Frontier, a tri-border area along the junction of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil.\"[26]\n\nIn 2003, \"In the Party of God\" won the National Magazine Award for reporting.[27][28]\n\n\"The Hunted\", The New Yorker, 2010 [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2010, Goldberg published \"The Hunted\", a New Yorker article on Mark and Delia Owens, a conservationist couple based in Zambia, who resorted to vigilantism in an effort to stop elephant poachers in North Luangwa National Park.[29] Goldberg chronicles the Owens’ attempts to counter the poachers’ activity in Zambia in the 1970s/80s, which began with creating incentives such as bounty programs for the park’s scouts, but as the poaching continued, the Owenses methods turned more confrontational. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat praised \"The Hunted\", noting that “Goldberg builds an extensive, persuasive case that the Owenses' much-lauded environmental activism in the Zambian hinterland led to at least one murder, and maybe more.”[30]\n\n\"The Point of No Return\", The Atlantic, 2010 [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2010, Goldberg wrote the cover story for The Atlantic, which examined the potential consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.[31] Based on his interviews with high level Israeli and American government and military officials, including, Benjamin Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, Ephraim Sneh, Ben Rhodes, Rahm Emanuel, and Denis McDonough, Goldberg writes, \"I have come to believe that the administration knows it is a near-certainty that Israel will act against Iran soon if nothing or no one else stops the nuclear program; and Obama knows—as his aides, and others in the State and Defense departments made clear to me—that a nuclear-armed Iran is a serious threat to the interests of the United States, which include his dream of a world without nuclear weapons.\"[31]\n\nAfter reading the article, Fidel Castro invited Goldberg to Cuba to talk about the issue.[32] Goldberg published a series of articles on their interviews, including his views on anti-Semitism and Iran,[32] Soviet-style Communism,[33] and theories on President John F. Kennedy's assassination[34] When asked by Goldberg if the Soviet-style Communism was still worth exporting, Castro famously replied that \"the Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore.\"[33]\n\n\"The Modern King in the Arab Spring\", The Atlantic, 2013 [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2013, Goldberg published an article on the Jordanian King Abdullah and his government's approach to reform in the wake of the 2011 protests around the Arab world.[35]\n\nIn discussing a meeting between the King and the Jordanian tribes, Goldberg quotes the King as saying \"I’m sitting with the old dinosaurs today.”[35] This quote garnered a lot of controversy when published, and the King's Royal Court even issued a statement claiming the article contained many “fallacies” and that his words “were taken out of their correct context.”[36] However, in defending the accuracy of his quotes, Goldberg later tweeted, \"I just spoke to a top official of the Jordanian royal court. He said they are not contesting the accuracy of quotes in my Atlantic piece.\"[36]\n\n\"Is It Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\", The Atlantic, 2015 [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2015, Goldberg published \"Is It Time for the Jews to Leave Europe.\"[37] Goldberg's essay explores the state of the Jewish communities across Europe, especially in light of the resurgence of anti-Semitism and attacks against Jews in Europe.[38][39]\n\nHistorian Diana Pinto, who is of Italian Jewish descent, wrote a rejoinder to Goldberg's article in The New Republic, arguing that his article is excessively dire. She wrote: \"If a plaster cast may be permitted to speak, I would say that Goldberg and his colleagues aren’t describing my reality; the world I come from isn't already destroyed; and the story of the Jews in Europe isn’t yet ready to be relegated to museums or to antiquarian sites like Pompeii.\"[40]\n\nPresident Barack Obama [ edit ]\n\nPresident Obama Interviews (2008, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016) [ edit ]\n\nGoldberg has conducted five major interviews with President Barack Obama since 2008.[41][42][43][44][45] Goldberg's interviews have centered around President Obama's views on U.S.-Israel relations, Zionism, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and other issues concerning U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa.[41]\n\nPeter Baker, the White House correspondent for The New York Times, recommended Goldberg's interviews with President Obama, writing, \"For much of his time in office, President Obama has been having sort of a running conversation about the Middle East with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, one of the premier writers on the region based in Washington. In this latest interview, Mr. Obama defends his approach to the war against the Islamic State, warns Arab leaders not to pursue nuclear programs to match Iran and discusses his feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Along the way, Mr. Obama and Mr. Goldberg hash over the nature of the sometimes turbulent Israeli-American relationship.\"[46]\n\n\"The Obama Doctrine\", The Atlantic, 2016 [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2016, Goldberg published The Obama Doctrine, which was featured as the Atlantic's April 2016 cover story. This essay covers many foreign policy issues, including his views of the U.S. role in Asia, the Middle East, ISIS, Russia, and Europe, focusing on the nature of American leadership in these different regions and the relative power that the United States wields in developing and executing policies that reflect American interests abroad.[41]\n\nGoldberg's \"The Obama Doctrine\" was praised for its detailed accounting of the president's foreign policy views and sparked a debate about Obama's foreign policy legacy. Brian Katulis, a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, \"Jeffrey Goldberg’s analysis of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy (“The Obama Doctrine“) is required reading for those looking at the big picture on U.S. national security.\"[47]\n\nIn a response piece in The Atlantic, Martin Indyk praised the article, writing, \"Jeffrey Goldberg’s fascinating article taps into President Obama's thinking about foreign policy and reveals its wellsprings. In that sense, he does more to help the president define and explain 'the Obama Doctrine' than previous efforts by the White House itself, captured in those memorable lines 'don’t do stupid shit' and 'leading from behind', which do not do justice to a doctrine that is both complicated and far-reaching in its implications for American foreign policy.\"[48]\n\nOther interviews [ edit ]\n\nGoldberg has conducted interviews with President Barack Obama,[45] Hillary Clinton,[49] David Cameron,[50] John Kerry,[51] Benjamin Netanyahu,[52] Isaac Herzog,[53] Marco Rubio,[54] Chris Christie,[55] Ashton Carter,[56] Ben Rhodes,[57] Yair Lapid,[58] Michael Oren,[59] King Abdullah of Jordan,[35] Ta-Nehisi Coates,[60] David Gregory,[61] and Tom Cotton,[62] among others.\n\nPrisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide [ edit ]\n\nPrisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide (New York: Knopf, 2006), describes Goldberg's experiences in Israel working at the Ketziot military prison camp as well as his dialogue with Rafiq, a prisoner whom Goldberg would later befriend in Washington, DC.[63][64][65]\n\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times named it one of the best books of 2006.[66][67][68]\n\nThe Los Angeles Times critic wrote, \"Realization of the humanity of the ‘other’ is at the heart of New Yorker magazine correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg's sharply observed and beautifully written memoir.\"[69] The New York Times critic wrote, \"Mr. Goldberg, a talented and ambitious writer for the New Yorker...takes an engagingly personal approach to the issue in his story of a quest for mutual understanding with a Palestinian activist who had been his prisoner ... For the bittersweet complexity of that moment, offered in the context of all that has preceded it, this is a genuinely admirable book.”[70]\n\nThe Washington Post review of the book noted, \"Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg’s sensitive, forthright and perceptive account of his years as a soldier and journalist in Israel—and of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse between Israelis and Palestinians can be.”[71] CBS News critic wrote, \"There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals about the Middle East. An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To those of us who have followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.”[72]\n\nBoris Kachka, a contributing editor for New York magazine, interviewed Goldberg in October 2006 about Prisoners in addition to other issues pertaining to journalism and the Middle East.[73]\n\nViews on Iraq [ edit ]\n\nIn 2002, Goldberg's \"The Great Terror\" published in The New Yorker argued that the threat posed to America by Saddam Hussein was significant, discussing the possible connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda as well as the Iraqi nuclear program, averring that there was \"some debate among arms-control experts about exactly when Saddam will have nuclear capabilities. But there is no disagreement that Iraq, if unchecked, will have them soon ... There is little doubt what Saddam might do with an atomic bomb or with his stocks of biological and chemical weapons.\"[22]\n\nIn a late 2002 debate in Slate on the question \"Should the U.S. invade Iraq?\", Goldberg argued in favor of an invasion on a moral basis, writing, \"So: Saddam Hussein is uniquely evil, the only ruler in power today—and the first one since Hitler—to commit chemical genocide. Is that enough of a reason to remove him from power? I would say yes, if 'never again' is in fact actually to mean 'never again.'\"[74]\n\nGlenn Greenwald called Goldberg \"one of the leading media cheerleaders for the attack on Iraq\", claiming Goldberg had \"compiled a record of humiliating falsehood-dissemination in the run-up to the war that rivaled Judy Miller's both in terms of recklessness and destructive impact.\"[75] In 2008, in an article in Slate entitled \"How Did I Get Iraq Wrong?\", Goldberg explained the reasons behind his initial support of the Iraq War and wrote that he \"didn't realize how incompetent the Bush administration could be.\"[76]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nPrisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide.

  "latent_27666": "A Toronto council candidate who nearly defeated a longtime incumbent in 2010 will face trial this month on charges of voting illegally and providing “false or misleading information” to elections officials. Gus Cusimano, who lost by 89 votes to Councillor Maria Augimeri, cast a vote for himself in Ward 9 (York Centre) although his home was in Ward 23. To get himself added to the Ward 9 voter list, Cusimano filled out a form saying he was a tenant at 951 Wilson Ave. — his campaign office.\n\nGus Cusimano, left, received the backing of Mayor Rob Ford in the 2010 election, a hard-fought race in Ward 9 against incumbent Maria Augimeri, a Ford foe. ( www.guscusimano.com )\n\nResidents are allowed to run in a ward even if they don’t live there. But they can vote only in the ward where they live, according to the city and the province. Cusimano, an insurance businessman who was strongly backed by Mayor Rob Ford, was charged by the city government in the summer of 2012 with two alleged breaches of the Municipal Elections Act. He faces a fine of up to $25,000. The trial is scheduled for Oct. 28 at Old City Hall, said Lorne Honickman, his lawyer.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“Our position has been that Mr. Cusimano did nothing wrong and he will be vigorously defending the charges at his trial later this month,” Honickman said. In 2011, when the city began questioning Cusimano’s vote, Honickman said, “He was leasing property in the ward and I believe that entitled him to vote there.” Cusimano is one of only two Toronto residents charged with 2010 voting offences. The other is a Ward 9 man who says he intentionally voted twice for Cusimano to demonstrate flaws in the verification system. The provincial government’s 2010 election guide said: “In a municipality with wards, if a voter resides in one ward but has other properties in different wards in the same municipality, he or she may only vote in the ward where he or she resides.” Cusimano, who might run against Augimeri again in 2014, has been involved in three separate election-related legal battles since 2010. Ford helped raise money to cover his costs.\n\nAugimeri is a Ford opponent who has represented the area since 1985. She declined to comment. Cusimano appeared to win a major victory in 2011 when a judge ordered the Ward 9 results invalidated and a new vote called because of the failure of local election officials to sign 275 voter forms. But a three-judge Divisional Court panel overturned the decision later in the year — and said, in its own ruling, that there was “good reason” to believe Cusimano was not eligible to vote in Ward 9. A city committee unanimously voted against prosecuting Cusimano for alleged campaign finance improprieties revealed by a forensic audit. The audit found that the dates on seven contribution cheques had been altered; Cusimano's lawyer said the alterations were likely made by a fundraiser for the campaign, who denied the charge.",

  "latent_27759": "The Summer transfer window has been a very quiet one for Tottenham Hotspur thus far. For the most part, we’ve been sitting around and twiddling our thumbs chatting about anything and everything hoping that some bombshell happens and Spurs make a splash. That hasn’t happened, though we think that’s about to change.\n\nAs we’re all aware, Manchester City are in the market for not one but two fullbacks on the right side of their formation. They basically have nothing but a bag of potato chips going down the flank at this point in time. With Kyle Walker still a major target for City, the Manchester club were also pursuing former Barcelona fullback Dani Alves. That pursuit looks to have ended in failure:\n\nThis isn’t anything official, but for those of you that have been around Carty Free for awhile know that Kristof Terreur is one of the good journalists out there. He’s as locked into the Premier League as any reporter, though his specialty is focusing on Belgian players. If he tweets something out, you can pretty much take it to the bank.\n\nAlves has been pursued by a few clubs this summer, even getting linked to our beloved Spurs, but it looks as though the Brazilian International is headed for France.\n\nWhat this means for Tottenham is that City’s pursuit of Kyle Walker is going to go into overdrive at this point. He’s easily the best fullback out there that can be pried away, though Daniel Levy has not budged from the reported £50m price tag he set for the Citizens. Initially, City balked at the valuation but now that Alves is about to be officially off the market, they’ll stop messing around and probably offer that to Levy. Of course, we’re well aware of Daniel Levy’s ability to squeeze every last pound out of a club when he has the advantage, and this is the ideal situation for our Bald Ninja Jedi.\n\nNow, this is all speculation and we have no official reports of course, but this isn’t hard to figure out. Spurs have been linked to Porto’s Ricardo Pereira for a few weeks and knowing that the Portuguese club needs money, the dominoes have been in place for awhile. Alves’ officially signing with PSG is the first one to fall that will set things in motion unless something crazy happens.\n\nWe’re about a week away from Spurs heading to the United States for their International Champions Cup tour. At the end of that tour is a match with City in Nashville, Tennessee. It’s not crazy to think that Kyle will be a Citizen at that point in time, though only time will tell.",

As soon as I flipped it over, I saw it was from Typo. Typo is my FAVOURITE store at the moment, so I was already head over heels before I opened the card.\n\nThe dress is AMAZING and beautiful. I'd already been messaged previously to make sure the sizing was right and to make sure I liked some of the choices santa had picked out (very thoughtful btw). I wasn't sure which I was going to get, if any at all, because it was just an idea and he still wanted to surprise me. The dress fits perfectly. I can't thank you enough. You hit the nail on the head with the types of fashion I liked (I forgot I added a link to my pintrest board). I think you're extremely brave to get clothes, I mean, it's hard enough buying clothes for people you know, let alone a complete internet stranger! And possibly beer on the way as well! Gahhhh. :) That's exciting. I'm glad I have a fellow person who also picks beer based on the label! People think I'm weird for doing it :P\n\nUPDATE: The beer has arrived and WOW, I'm absolutely stoked! I'm so keen to get it into the fridge so I can try all the different varieties! (is it socially acceptable to drink on a Monday?) Santa, you have made my Christmas extra special this year. I think I've been spoilt! Thank you ! :)",
  "latent_28166": "ZoneMinder is a glorious application for operating your security cameras, but it can be a bit of a beast to set it up. It is Web-based, so you need a LAMP stack, and some knowledge of running a Web server. Then you need supported cameras, and some twiddling in Zoneminder's multitude of options to get them working the way you want. In this how-to we'll focus on setting up and operating a single Foscam FI8905W outdoor wireless IP camera on the local network, and configuring ZoneMinder to record motion-activated events.\n\nWireless IP Camera\n\nWireless IP cameras need only power hookups, and you can even get battery-powered models. Do your homework before you purchase anything to make sure it's supported by Zoneminder. An IP camera should be the easiest to operate from any operating system, because it's just another node on your LAN. But of course in our weirdo commercial tech world there are always unnecessary obstacles to interoperability, and some IP cameras require Mac or Windows. (Requiring Windows, and especially ActiveX, for anything security-related is mind-boggling.) The Zoneminder wiki lists supported cameras, and the user reviews on shopping sites like Newegg and Amazon are great resources. These instructions for the Foscam should be useful for other IP cameras as well.\n\nFoscam surveillance cameras are generally pretty good and affordable, and Foscam's customer support is good. The Foscam FI8905W is a basic, inexpensive outdoor wired and wireless IP camera with infrared for night surveillance. It has no pan, tilt, or zoom, and for $90 that's fine with me. (ZoneMinder supports pan, tilt, and zoom cameras.) The camera has its own embedded Web server which contains a basic administration panel, and a simple live stream. Unfortunately, I have only a dreary gray day to show you (figure 2).\n\nThe Foscam comes with decent surveillance software that is similar to ZoneMinder, but of course it does not run on Linux, but only Mac and Windows.\n\nConfiguring the Camera\n\nThe Foscam has no default IP address, but rather is set up to snag an address via DHCP. If you have no DHCP server you'll need to find a Windows or Mac machine to set it up, because it has special setup software for those.\n\nTo set it up on Linux, connect it to your wired Ethernet and plug in the power cord. Give it a minute to boot up and get an IP address, and then use nmap to find its address:\n\n$ nmap -sP 192.168.1.* Nmap scan report for ipcam_00E6E22E40074E_1.alrac.net (192.168.1.191)\n\nOf course, you must search using your own network address. The default port is 80, so open a Web browser to the camera's hostname or IP address. The default login is admin with no password. Now you can look at the pretty spypics streaming from your camera, and configure it. Give it a different login with a strong password, and a different port than 80. Any unused port over 8100 is good. Set the correct time and date, configure your wireless network authentication, and give it a static IP address so you don't have to hunt it down again. Give it a friendly name, like Driveway, so you know what it's watching. The Foscam has some basic alerting and recording to an FTP server built in. If you forget your login, you can reset it to factory defaults by holding the reset button for 30 seconds.\n\nIf all you want is a live stream direct from the camera, with rudimentary alerting and recording, then you don't need ZoneMinder. But we want ZoneMinder, so let's keep going.\n\nInstalling ZoneMinder, the Hard Part\n\nZoneMinder runs on a LAMP stack, so the beastliest part is installation and configuring your Web server. The ZoneMinder Wiki has installation instructions for various Linux versions. Pay special attention to configuring ZoneMinder to work with Apache. By default Apache disables CGI, which ZoneMinder needs. This is what I did on Kubuntu 13.10:\n\n$ sudo tasksel install lamp-server $ sudo apt-get install zoneminder ffmpeg $ sudo ln -s /etc/zm/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/zoneminder.conf $ sudo adduser www-data video $ sudo a2enmod cgi\n\nChange short_open_tag = Off in /etc/php5/php.ini to short_open_tag = On , and in /etc/init.d/zoneminder add sleep 15 on the line above zmfix -a , like this:\n\nstart() { echo -n \"Starting $prog: \" sleep 15 zmfix -a $command start\n\nNow restart Apache:\n\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\nThen open http://localhost/zm in a Web browser, and you should see the ZoneMinder console (figure 3).\n\nLet's back up a bit and review the installation commands. The first one installs a LAMP stack with one command: Apache, PHP, Perl, and MySQL. The second one installs ZoneMinder, and for insurance ffmpeg, which is required but not always installed. The third command adds your ZoneMinder site to Apache. The fourth command makes the www-data user a member of the video group. The fifth command enables Apache's CGI module, so that ZoneMinder's CGI scripts will work.\n\nTake a look at your ZoneMinder console to verify that everything is working. It should say Running at the top, and if it doesn't click on the Log link to see what's going on. Click Running/Stopped to bring up a stop/start/restart dialog.\n\nAdd Camera to ZoneMinder\n\nOK then, after all that let's add our nice Foscam to ZoneMinder. Click the Add New Monitor button. There are just two tabs to configure: General and Source. On the General tab (figure 4) enter the same name that's in the camera's own admin panel, which for mine is Driveway.\n\nThe Source Type is Remote.\n\nThe function is Modect, for motion detect.\n\nCheck the Enabled checkbox.\n\nOn the Source tab (figure 5), the Remote Protocol is HTTP.\n\nRemote Method is Simple.\n\nRemote Host Name is either the camera's hostname or IP address, and you must pass your login to the camera, so it looks like username:password@hostname, or username:password@ip-address.\n\nRemote Host Port is whatever port you assigned to it.\n\nRemote Host Path is /videostream.cgi Capture Width and Capture Height must be the same as the camera's configuration.\n\nSave your changes, and then return to the main ZoneAlarm console. Click on the name of your new monitor, and you should see something like figure 6. I got tired of the dreary view outside, so you get to see a picture of my cat. Note the two events listed at the bottom: these are recordings triggered by movement, so you can click on any event name to see a replay.\n\nWell now, that is a whole lot of steps in a short article. If you run into problems getting the ZoneMinder console working check the ZoneMinder logs, and also your Web server logs. The ZoneMinder forums can be helpful, and also the wiki. In part 2 we'll add a USB Webcam, configure alerts, make videos, and tweak quality settings.",

He believes he stopped a man from beating a young woman to death.\"I mean he was kicking her hard too, right in the head, and I couldn't just stand there and do nothing,\" said Paul DeLeon.An hour later, he got shot. The Good Samaritan lived to tell his tale, and he's sharing it with Action News.DeLeon is a homeless man who was armed with mace and a gun. He's credited with saving the teenager's life, but nearly lost his own. Fresno County sheriff's deputies are hoping a couple clues will help them arrest the man who hurt them both.Behind the yellow tape, a parking lot you can't even see from Clovis Ave. is the scene of two attacks, just minutes apart. The trouble started between a man and his ex-girlfriend out in the open, in front of a Tarpey Village liquor store. But as the 19-year-old woman moved to a more secretive spot in the back, her ex followed. Witnesses say he pulled her out of a car, then punched and kicked her so hard, he knocked her unconscious. But the assault didn't go undetected.\"A Good Samaritan, a homeless man who stays in the area, jumped in,\" said Fresno County sheriff's spokesman Tony Botti.\"I grabbed my mace and I maced him,\" said DeLeon, the Good Samaritan.DeLeon acts as a quasi-security guard for businesses in the area and he came to the woman's rescue. But his act of heroism apparently made him the suspect's next target.\"They drove off and he said something like 'I'm going to come back for you,' and he did,\" DeLeon said.After an ambulance picked up the young woman, her attacker came back, and this time he had a gun. He opened fire on DeLeon, hitting him in the arm. But DeLeon is a registered gun owner himself and he fired back, chasing the suspect away in a white Lexus.Fresno police spotted the car speeding down Highway 41 at more than 100 miles per hour and then found it abandoned near Downtown Fresno. The gunman may have gotten away for the time being, but because of DeLeon, he never got to finish what he started.\"He probably would've killed her,\" the hero said. \"I mean, I have no doubt in my mind he wouldn't have stopped. She was out of it and he was still kicking her.\"Deputies have a good idea who the man is, but they're not identifying him publicly yet. They also say DeLeon did a great job by intervening, but it's usually better to call 911 to get help.null",
  "latent_28265": "This Friday America enters a perilous era when a man who trusts Vladimir Putin more than Americans in Congress, the military or our intelligence services takes the oath of office. Whether our republic endures Donald J. Trump’s clearly divided loyalties may well depend on how smartly Americans respond to our new president, with his insatiable lust for money, power, and public adoration.\n\nBased on my almost three decades of Trump watching, here is some of what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nFirst, a rapid fire set of actions designed to dazzle supporters and overwhelm opponents who cannot focus on every executive order and fast-track bill in Congress.\n\nIf Trump proceeds with his plan to build a wall just inside the U.S. border with Mexico, pay close attention to the authorizing language. Congress will likely be asked to exempt the project from environmental review and routine disclosures about the contracting and construction process. The bill may even allow expedited seizure of privately held land under our Constitution’s eminent domain clause.\n\nThe justification for this? National security, of course.\n\nSecond, expect Trump to also use national security to crack down on dissent. Protests must be peaceful or they will play in Trump’s authoritarian hands. Trump only needs a few riots to justify invoking Article I, Section 9 of our Constitution in which the second word is crucial:\n\n“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”\n\nSimilarly, if Trump wants to severely curtail demonstrations he may well circumvent the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits the use of the Army and other military personnel against Americans, but exempts the National Guard.\n\nHaving revealed (thanks to videotape) that an undercover LAPD officer provoked the May Day 1982 riot in Los Angeles, I know how vulnerable protesters are to agents provocateurs. To avoid giving excuses for official violence and locking up protesters without court hearings, those planning demonstrations must organize peace squads to surround anyone who takes any violent action, penning them in while asking police to arrest them.\n\nNext, expect Trump to curtail public access to government information, perhaps including removing reporters from the White House. Similarly, unwelcome Freedom of Information Act requests will be slow-walked and the already inadequate budget for processing such requests will likely be slashed in the name of reducing burdens on taxpayers.\n\nAlso, enforcement of civil rights and voting rights will wither. Existing litigation may also be allowed to fail by the simple expedient of missing filing deadlines or declaring the government is no longer interested in the issues.\n\nAid and comfort to racist laws that block people from voting will likely get little attention from Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, despite his claimed conversion to embracing equally the rights of all Americans.\n\nAlmost immediately, expect demands that civil servants who work on climate change, job safety, and pollution resign or be fired.\n\nMy plea to these civil servants: Make Trump fire you. Yes, it will be unpleasant to spend a year or two while your case is adjudicated. You may even be assigned to a windowless room with no work to do, but quitting just opens up your job to someone hostile to the work you care about. Besides, you’ll get paid while the process is underway and, if you get an administrative law judge with integrity, you may get your job back.\n\nExpect budgets and executive actions targeting specific workers and sections of agencies for termination, including possibly invoking the Holman Rule, an 1876 law that lets Congress reduce the wages of any federal employee to a buck a year. This would raise the interesting question of whether the constitutional prohibition to a “Bill of Attainder” applies only to criminal matters or includes civil wrongs, such as targeting civil servants because they did their duty.\n\nExpect Trump to pay no attention to red ink in the federal budget even though he ran for office railing against federal debt. By spending borrowed money Trump can temporarily juice the economy, creating jobs.\n\nAnd expect Trump’s behavior to become more erratic, as I have long warned, once the pressures of being president weigh on his immature, narcissistic personality. We saw one early sign of this Sunday when the London newspaper The Times published its interview with the president-elect.\n\nNotice how the answer below has nothing to do with the question, but is the kind of nonsense expected from a random blowhard on a bar stool:\n\nQuestion: Can you understand why eastern Europeans fear Putin and Russia?\n\nAnswer: Sure. Oh sure, I know that. I mean, I understand what’s going on, I said a long time ago—that NATO had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago. Number two—the countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to pay. I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete. It’s obsolete because it wasn’t taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right—and now—it was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, they have a whole division devoted now to terror, which is good.\n\nAnd the other thing is the countries aren’t paying their fair share so we’re supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, NATO is very important to me.\n\nThe answer goes to a core issue with Trump: his utter lack of empathy for anyone else. A man who made no apologies for putting the life of a sickly infant in jeopardy over money, as Trump did to his grandnephew William Trump in 2000, has no capacity to understand the fear of people in the former Soviet Union about a murderous autocrat taking away their freedoms. There is a lesson in that for Americans who take their freedoms for granted.\n\nAnyone who thinks that our Constitution will save us from Trump’s instincts does not understand that it is a piece of paper that can be ignored by a president determined to emulate Vladimir Putin’s autocratic style.\n\nBe wary. Be watchful. But most of all don't be dumb and play into Trump’s hands.",

Since then, work has wrapped on the Wilshire Grand—now LA's tallest tower. But other major projects, including South Park's two-tower 1212 Flower development and the Pershing Square-adjacent Park Fifth development, have begun to rise.\n\nOnly Seattle—in the midst of a historic development boom—boasts more cranes than Los Angeles, according to the new count.

  "latent_28492": "High blood pressure is linked to dementia A drug used to lower blood pressure could prevent or delay thousands of Alzheimer's cases, US research has suggested. People taking angiotensin receptor blockers were up to 40% less likely to develop dementia than those taking other blood pressure drugs. And patients already suffering from dementia were less likely to get worse. The number of people in the UK with dementia is expected to soar to 1.7 million over the next two decades. This study highlights that it is becoming increasingly important to investigate blood pressure lowering drugs as a potential treatment for dementia\n\nProfessor Clive Ballard\n\nAlzheimer's Society This could mean an enormous extra burden for families and the taxpayer, but the Boston University School of Medicine research, presented at a conference in Chicago, suggests there could be ways to prevent it. High blood pressure over long periods can lead to damaged blood vessels, and is known to increase the risk of not only strokes and heart disease, but dementia as well. Some types of dementia are directly related to the condition of the arteries supplying the brain, but blood pressure is also thought to play a role in Alzheimer's disease, which is linked to the appearance of protein deposits in brain tissue. However, the reasons for this are not clear. Symptom delay The research looked at records of approximately six million people treated for high blood pressure between 2001 and 2006. Those who took angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were less likely, over that period, to be diagnosed with dementia compared with those on other blood pressure medication such as ACE inhibitors. If they already had dementia in 2001, they were 45% less likely to go on to develop delirium, be admitted to a nursing home, or die prematurely. This evidence suggests that the drugs, which help prevent the constriction of blood vessels, could not only prevent, or at least delay, the arrival of dementia symptoms, but also slow down the progress of the disease. ARBs are normally prescribed only to patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Professor Clive Ballard, from the Alzheimer's Society, said that full clinical trials, following a smaller number of patients over a longer period, were now needed. \"High blood pressure doubles the risk of Alzheimer's disease and increases risk of stroke - this study highlights that it is becoming increasingly important to investigate blood pressure lowering drugs as a potential treatment for dementia. \"These findings will be important in stimulating further research into the relationship between anti-hypertension drugs and the development of dementia.\"\n\nE-mail this to a friend Printable version Bookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?",

  "latent_28599": "(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday struck down a 2011 North Carolina law requiring abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and explain it to a woman before having an abortion, arguing it violated the constitutional right to free speech of doctors.\n\nU.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles found that a state does not have “the power to compel a health care provider to speak, in his or her own voice, the state’s ideological message in favor of carrying a pregnancy to term.”\n\nThe law “compels a health care provider to act as the state’s courier and to disseminate the state’s message discouraging abortion, in the provider’s own voice, in the middle of a medical procedure, and under circumstances where it would seem the message is the provider’s and not the state’s,” she added in her 42-page ruling.\n\n“This is not allowed under the First Amendment,” Eagles ruled.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, but lawmakers in more conservative states in recent years have enacted laws that seek to place restrictions on the procedure, especially on late-term abortions.\n\nThe ultrasound requirement of the law had been blocked by Eagles a few months after it was passed due to concerns over what she described as the “non-medical message” doctors were required to deliver.\n\nThe law required that an ultrasound image be presented and the sound of the fetal heartbeat be offered at least four hours before an abortion, though a woman is free to look away and ignore an explanation and medical description of what is on the screen.\n\nThe decision was hailed as a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood Federation of America which filed a lawsuit challenging the Women’s Right to Know Act.\n\n“Today’s ruling protects the rights of women and their doctors from the ideological agenda of extremist lawmakers,” said Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina.\n\n“This law represented an egregious government intrusion into individuals’ private medical decisions, and we are very pleased that it will not go into effect,” she said.\n\nDefenders of the law said it provided crucial information for women making a major and irrevocable decision.\n\n“North Carolina’s ultrasound requirement is no different than requiring speech for airlines and cigarette manufacturers for safety reasons,” said Barbara Holt, president of North Carolina Right to Life. “The required information must be given even if the person hearing, seeing or reading the information finds the information upsetting, unnecessary or repetitive.”\n\nA Republican state legislator who advocated the law, House Majority Leader Paul Stam, was not immediately available to comment after normal business hours.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue, a Democrat and the state’s first female governor, vetoed the measure in 2011 but the state Senate overrode the veto.\n\nIn her veto message, Perdue called the legislation a “dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors.”\n\nWhen the law went into effect in October 2011, North Carolina joined 25 other states that require pre-abortion counseling that goes beyond basic medical “informed consent,” according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization.\n\nIt also became the tenth state to include the additional requirement of an ultrasound, which has drawn legal challenges in several states.\n\nNorth Carolina has some of the country’s toughest requirements for clinics performing abortions, including a requirement doctors be present when abortions are performed.\n\nIt also bans publicly funded health insurance programs from paying for most abortions, and authorizes state health officials to design rules for increased safety standards for abortion clinics.\n\nIn North Carolina, 17 percent of pregnancies end in induced abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe case is Gretchen S.

  "latent_28956": "Image caption Nationalist Tomislav Nikolic's win has been described as a \"political earthquake\" for Serbia\n\nNationalist Tomislav Nikolic has been elected president of Serbia, with liberal incumbent Boris Tadic admitting defeat soon after polls closed.\n\nMr Nikolic has 50.21% of the vote, against 46.77% for Mr Tadic, with 40% of votes counted.\n\nThe contest had been seen as a vote on EU membership and the newly-elected president promised that \"Serbia will not stray from its European path\".\n\nMr Tadic appealed to keep \"Serbia's strategic orientation towards the EU\".\n\n\"It would be a tragic mistake if Serbia changes its orientation. It is a matter of peace and economic development,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking of Tomislav Nikolic, he added: \"I congratulate him on the victory, it was a fair and well-earned victory and I wish him luck.\"\n\nAs he confirmed his commitment to Europe, Mr Nikolic claimed \"This is a turning point for Serbia... these elections were not about who will take Serbia to the EU, but who will solve the economic problems created by the Democratic Party (of Boris Tadic)\".\n\nAnalysis Tomislav Nikolic, a 60-year-old populist who rose to prominence as a radical nationalist, comes across as a smiling, grandfatherly figure, a man who enjoys making plum brandy and walking in the woods in the Serbian heartlands. Whatever else, this result will mean a change in style at the top of Serbian politics. His ability to take most of the former Radical Party voters to the Progressive Party he founded in 2008, despite a sharp turn towards the political centre, has been the cornerstone of his success.\n\nSerbia is plagued by unemployment of 24% and foreign debt of 24bn euros (£19.5bn; $31.5bn).\n\n'Electoral earthquake'\n\nIn the past Mr Nikolic served as a deputy prime minister under the former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who was put on trial for genocide at The Hague.\n\nHe was in government when Nato bombed Serbia in 1999 and once said he would rather see the country ally itself with Russia than join the EU but he has softened his rhetoric in recent years.\n\nHe has tried to rebrand himself, and his Progressive Party has vowed to invest in agriculture and industry and tax the rich to fund a rise in pensions.\n\nThe election result is something of a surprise as the incumbent had been expected to win.\n\nSpeaking on RTS state television in Serbia political analyst Slobodan Antonic explained \"this was an electoral earthquake, a totally unexpected result\".\n\nImage caption Boris Tadic had been in power since 2004\n\nThe BBC's central Europe correspondent, Nick Thorpe, says a low turnout of below 45% is thought to have damaged Mr Tadic's chances.\n\nThe outcome of the vote may affect both Serbia's EU prospects and the future of Kosovo, the breakaway Serbian province which declared independence in 2008.\n\nA bitter row erupted after the first round of the election on 6 May, when the nationalists accused Mr Tadic's supporters of rigging the ballot.\n\nElectoral officials found no evidence that 500,000 votes had been falsified, as Mr Nikolic alleged, while foreign monitors declared the vote to have been fair.\n\nAs president, Mr Tadic oversaw the EU candidacy negotiations and had argued that success for him and his Democratic Party was vital for development and stability in Serbia over the next decade.\n\nUnder his leadership, Serbia captured Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Gen Ratko Mladic, and handed them over to international prosecutors at The Hague.",
  "latent_29041": "A feared Chinese drill sergeant who flew into a rage, threatening fire and brimstone because cadets did not clean their bathrooms and dormitories to his satisfaction, got the shock of his entire military career when an eager-to-please cadet got down on all fours and licked the toilet to prove to the sergeant they had done the job thoroughly.\n\nSergeant Cai Peng, at the Sichuan Vocational and Technical College of Communications in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, ordered students undergoing military training to clean their dormitories and bathrooms.\n\nEach bathroom included a pit toilet with a porcelain seat.\n\nSergeant Peng warned the students to ensure that their dormitories and bathrooms were spotlessly clean. But when he returned to inspect, he was furious because he thought the cadets had done a shoddy job. He began shouting at them, threatening harsh punishments.\n\nBut one of the students, Ho Liao, summoned up courage and stepped forward to address the feared instructor, saying he was confident they had done the job thoroughly and that he could prove it if the instructor gave him the permission to proceed.\n\n“Excuse me sir, but I don’t agree and with your permission I would like to prove it.”\n\nSurprised that a lowly cadet would dare speak up while he was rebuking them over a job poorly done, the instructor permitted him to provide proof.\n\nHo promptly got down on all fours in front of the pit toilet and began licking the porcelain seat. The dutiful cadet likewise licked around the bathroom floor and finally the dormitory floor. After going through the bizarre canine-like motions he rose to his feet, snapped to attention and saluted smartly.\n\n“He told us he had wanted the floor good enough to eat off. We felt we delivered that, and I just wanted to prove the point.”\n\nSergeant Peng could only look on with open-mouthed amazement while Ho demonstrated conclusively that the students had cleaned the dormitories and toilet thoroughly.\n\nWithout any further comments or threats of punishment, he dismissed them.\n\nChinese high school students in their first year and college freshmen are required to undergo “military training” as part of the patriotic education program launched by the former Communist Party Chairman Deng Xiaoping. The training was made compulsory for all high school and college students in 2001.\n\nEnforcement of military training in schools is unpopular among students and their parents. It has been criticized due to the perception that the drills are unduly harsh. The Los Angeles Times reports that last year, a boy collapsed and died during strenuous drills and a girl committed suicide after being harshly treated by an instructor.\n\nThe training program has also been criticized on the ground that rather than training students for direct military combat roles, it involves mostly political indoctrination and orientation to instill a sense of patriotism and loyalty to the state.\n\nBut this is not surprising: The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is maintained and organized as the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party rather than as a professional fighting force. Thus, training tends to focus inordinately on political indoctrination and ideological orientation.\n\nSometimes discipline breaks down when students are unable to bear the rigor of the drills: A fight broke out between students and instructors at a school in Hunan province last year, in which several people were injured.\n\n[Image: Wikimedia Commons]",

  "latent_29588": "Trump’s ‘Pocahontas’ attack leaves fellow Republicans squirming (again) By Matea Gold, Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis June 10 at 10:19 PM It was a bad time for Sen. Cory Gardner to be caught in an elevator with a reporter. Donald Trump had just referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as ­“Pocahontas” — again — and the Republican freshman from Colorado was struggling to figure out how to respond.\n\n“I think people need to be treated with respect, and that’s what we’ve demanded from everyone,” he offered. But was it racist? Gardner clammed up. He politely referred further questions to his press secretary. So it went for Republicans on Capitol Hill on Friday, forced to contend with yet another provocative comment by their presumptive presidential nominee — clambering for safety as Trump launched another boundary-pushing attack. “Get used to it,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, a Trump critic. “This is your life for the next five months.” The furor over Trump’s assaults on the impartiality of a Latino judge had just begun to subside when he lobbed two tweets Friday morning responding to Warren, who had lambasted him as a “thin-skinned, racist bully” in a speech the previous evening. “Pocahontas is at it again!” Trump wrote in one. “Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth.” “No, seriously — Delete your account,” Warren tweeted back. …\n\nThe real estate developer has repeatedly invoked the ­17th-century Native American figure to refer to Warren, an allusion to controversy about her heritage. The senator has said she grew up amid family stories about her Cherokee lineage, but that account has not been proved. Trump began going after Warren’s claimed ancestry earlier this year, responding to the senator’s repeated slams of him as a “loser” and a bully. “Who’s that, the Indian?” he said at a March news conference when asked about Warren. “You mean the Indian?” … The “Pocahontas” line spurred chatter at former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney’s ideas summit Friday in Park City, Utah, where some attendees said they were aghast at Trump’s many race-based lines of attack. Stuart Stevens — the chief strategist on Romney’s 2012 presidential bid, who, like Romney, has vowed not to vote for Trump — said the candidate’s use of “Pocahontas” to attack Warren was both racist and inappropriate. … Romney told CNN on Friday that he was worried Trump’s language could lead to “trickle-down racism” in the country. When asked why he persists in calling Warren “Pocahontas” and what he makes of the alarm it has caused among some Republicans, Trump responded bluntly in a statement Friday: “Because she is a nasty person, a terrible U.S. Senator, and it drives her crazy.” “The Republicans should find it offensive that she scammed the system by faking her heritage, not that I am unafraid to point that out,” he continued in the statement, which was provided by his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. “Actually, Goofy Elizabeth, her nickname, is far worse.” … Stephanie Fryberg, an associate professor of psychology and American Indian studies at the University of Washington, said her studies have found that exposing Native American children to images of Pocahontas lowered their sense of collective self-worth. “Mr. Trump’s comments reinforce broad stereotypes of Native Americans as Indian chiefs, mascots and princesses, rather than contemporary people who are contributing to society,” she said, adding: “He’s not using the term in any way to be honorific. He using it to mock her.” Trump has repeatedly rejected the notion that he is playing to racial fears in his campaign. “I am the least-racist person that you’ve ever encountered,” he told The Washington Post on Thursday. Trump has been accused of peddling Native American stereotypes in the past. In 1993, he created an uproar at a House subcommittee hearing by testifying that “organized crime is rampant” in Indian casinos around the nation. At the time, the developer was fighting the expansion of gambling on tribal lands, a direct threat to his casino empire. Trump also questioned the legitimacy of the Mashantucket Pequots, who operate the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” he said. “And they don’t look like Indians to Indians.”\n\nThe Washington Post, which is kind of the company newsletter of Empire Inc., has been particularly berserk about Trump. For example:The term of art is actually “ Fauxcahontas ,” but Trump is amazingly allergic to cleverness in vocabulary. That sounded more interesting than the WaPo article, which wasn’t going to tell me what Trump was talking about because the 3 reporters were having such a bad case of the vapors.\n\nSo I Googled “Mashantucket Pequots leaders.”\n\nIt’s hard to find online large sized pictures of the leadership of the tribe.\n\nThe pictures tend to be pretty small on the tribe’s website.\n\nIn a newspaper I found:\n\nThomas brothers punished by Mashantuckets The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has banned Michael Thomas, left, and his brother Steven, each of whom has been convicted of stealing from the tribe. 79 13 Published March 17. 2014 1:00PM | Updated March 18. 2014 12:25AM By Brian Hallenbeck, Day staff writer Mashantucket — In voting last week to “banish” Michael and Steven Thomas, the former Mashantucket Pequot leaders convicted of corruption, the tribe’s elders council followed tribal by-laws that call for such punishment. But the practical effect of the votes remained unclear Monday to some tribal members, none of whom would speak on the record. Michael Thomas, the former tribal chairman, is currently serving an 18-month sentence in federal prison. His younger brother, Steven, a former tribal treasurer, will be allowed to continue living on the reservation and working at the tribe’s Foxwoods Resort Casino, according to a notice of the action taken against him. One tribal member called the terms of Steven Thomas’ banishment “ludicrous” and unlike any ever previously imposed by the elders council. A tribal spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSo the Mashantucket Pequots appear to be what’s known as a tri-racial isolate . Back in 2000 60 Minutes asked “ Are Pequots Reallu Pequots?\n\nThe two Indian casinos I’ve been to downplayed liquor consumption. The Barona resort was completely dry and the San Miguel had very small bars and few gamblers were drinking, even though I visited on May 5 (Cinco de Mayo). I thought that was a pretty sporting attitude by management, so I’m pretty positive toward Indian casinos. But I don’t like gambling, so I don’t know if other Indian casinos are like that.\n\nFrom the Utne Reader 17 years ago:\n\nPequot Tribe Members Hit the Genetic Jackpot: How native blood paid out for some African Americans by Leslie Goffe, from Emerge May-June 1999 If Vincent A. Sebastian Jr. didn’t tell you he was Native American, you wouldn’t know. He looks African American. In fact, for most of Sebastian’s 38 years, he was poor and black, but nowadays he’s Indian, too. He’s also rich, and one of the 600 or so members of the Mashantucket Pequot of Connecticut. Sebastian grew up aware of his Pequot (pronounced pee-kwat) ancestry, but never paid it much mind until word spread that the tribe wanted its people, scattered from New England to New Mexico, to come home. “I saw myself, back then, as just black, Afro-American,” laughs Sebastian. “Today I consider myself a black, Afro-American Indian.” Why the bizarre racial transformation? Cultural pride and ancestral roots are among the reasons, but some see a one-word answer: money. To be Pequot is to be part owner of a billion-dollar casino business that guarantees a job, free health care, education, and a housing subsidy—on or off the reservation. Before he was accepted for membership 11 years ago, Sebastian had been living in the Roger Williams Homes public housing complex in south Providence, Rhode Island, driving a tow truck, and doing odd jobs. Today, he directs the Pequot Office of Youth Services and has a stake in Foxwoods Resort Casino, the world’s largest, most successful casino complex. In fiscal 1998, Foxwoods grossed more than $660 million from slot machines alone (plus revenue from card games, roulette, pari-mutuel betting, several hotels, more than 20 restaurants, a shopping mall, and a 1,500-seat theater complex where Bill Cosby, B.B. King, and Celine Dion have appeared). Sebastian’s paternal great-grandfather’s tribe membership guaranteed his admission. In 1910 and 1930, the U.S. Census Bureau classified those with “mixed Indian blood” as “Indian.” By 1950, those once classified “Indian” were considered “other” or “Negro.” Today, in the Pequot case, the names of ancestors must appear on U.S. Census rolls for the Mashantucket reservation in 1900 or 1910. About 600 people apply for membership each year; for every person accepted, a hundred are turned away, according to the Pequot Enrollment Committee.\n\nShinnecock Indian Nation Disbands Tribal Gaming Authority Oct 1, 2014 10:20 AM By Michael Wright With the Shinnecock Indian Nation’s casino plans shelved and the specter of an FBI investigation and unsolved arson swirling, members of the tribe voted earlier this month to disband the tribe’s Gaming Authority. Support for disbanding the five-member Gaming Authority was broad but not unanimous. The vote was 110-41 for the dissolution of the authority, according to tallies shared with The Press by a tribal source. Tribal leaders have not responded to requests for information about the vote. The sentiment among tribe members about the Gaming Authority’s dealings over the last 10 years had been swung to doubt and suspicion, one tribe member said.\n\nAmerica has been getting more federally recognized Indian tribes over the decades. For example, in 2009 the Obama Administration recognized the Shinnecocks of the Hamptons on Long Island as an official tribe after a three decade legal struggle (because they look at least as black as they are Indian), entitling them to open one casino next to the posh terrain of the National Golf Links of America and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. But from 2014 I actually kind of like Elizabeth Warren, as I explained in VDARE back in 2003 . But she and Harvard Law School claiming that she brought Diversity to HLS was pretty embarrassing because law professors, especially ones from Oklahoma, are supposed to understand how Indian tribal membership works. It’s not a one-drop rule where your belief that one of your 32 great-great-great-grandparents was a Cherokee entitles you to Pokemon Points. Either you are on the Cherokee nation membership list or you’re not.\n\nAnd Warren is not.\n\n[Comment at Unz.com]",
  "latent_29714": "This is the second part in an eight-part series of articles, The Prudes’ Progress, about non-objectifying, woman-identified sexuality based on ideas of equality and whole-personhood, in the tradition of lesbian feminism. For the first article in the series, which includes a table of contents, please click here. The articles don’t have to be read in order and contain many backwards and forwards links so you can follow them in whatever way is most useful for you, although forward links won’t work until the relevant article is available.\n\nIntroducing Feminist Desire\n\nI’d like to make a case for cultivating, in ourselves, in our relationships and in our communities, something I’m going to call feminist desire. I define feminist desire as non-hierarchical desire: a desire which flows over a joyful emotional and/or sexual connection, which draws its meaning from equality, not from power.\n\nA sexuality of feminist desire, then, is a sexuality which is open to joyful sexual connections which draw their meaning from equality. And a relationship based on feminist desire can only exist between two people who’ve cultivated that sexuality (so that we’re open to feminist desire) and who don’t hold significant power over each other (so that feminist desire can flourish). Rather than a doer/done-to model, it’s a be-ing/be-ing model. “Our turn, our turn” instead of “my turn, your turn”.\n\nI’m not the first person to talk about an alternative to instrumental sexuality. Sheila Jeffreys and Janice Raymond describe instrumental sexuality as “heterosexual desire”, Jeffreys writing that it is “eroticised power difference”. Like instrumental sexuality, this is about something socially constructed, not innate; Jeffreys continues, “Heterosexual desire originates in the power relationship betwen men and women, but it can also be experienced in same sex relationships”, and goes on to contrast it against homosexual desire:\n\nThe opposite of heterosexual desire is the eroticising of sameness, a sameness of power, equality, and mutuality. It is homosexual desire.\n\nSheila Jeffreys, Anticlimax: A feminist perspective on the sexual revolution (The Women’s Press, 1993), heterosexual desire p299, homosexual desire p301\n\nMary Daly talks about a quality she calls biophilia, the love of life, which in our case we can apply to the love of living people, not fetishised sex objects. I’d love to include a quote here but it’s difficult to pull one thread loose from Daly’s Weave of words; instead I’ll direct the interested reader to the section The Shrinking of Female Be-ing from Gyn/Ecology , specifically pages 233-236 (The Women’s Press, 1979), and if anyone has a better reference, please let me know.\n\nAudre Lorde uses the term “the erotic”, which she compares to “the pornographic”; I think (I don’t want to state absolutely, as I don’t want to be the white woman who authoritatively ‘interprets’ the work of a Black woman) her terms map onto my use of “feminist desire” and “instrumental sexuality” when she writes that:\n\nThe erotic has often been misnamed by men and used against women. It has been made into the confused, the trivial, the psychotic, the plasticized sensation. For this reason, we have often turned away from the exploration and consideration of the erotic as a source of power and information, confusing it with its opposite, the pornographic. But pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling. Pornography emphasizes sensation without feeling. The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire. For having experienced the fullness of this depth of feeling and recognizing its power, in honor and self-respect we can require no less of ourselves.\n\nAudre Lorde, Sister Outsider, Uses of the Erotic (Quality Paperback Book Club collected edition, 1993), p54\n\n(Note: I hope that Lorde’s using “psychotic” here in the sense that its use by men as a misnaming of the erotic is meant to be a disablist slur, rather than using it in a disablist way herself to refer to something “bad” or “deranged”. If not, I’m sorry for including a quote which validates disablism, and I’ll edit it on request.)\n\nAnd Andrea Dworkin uses the term “androgynous fucking”:\n\nBy redefining human sexuality, or by defining it correctly, we can transform human relationship and the institutions which seek to control that relationship. Sex as the power dynamic between men and women, its primary form sadomasochism, is what we know now. Sex as community between humans, our shared humanity, is the world we must build… Specifically, androgynous [meaning: “a model which does not use polar role definitions, where the definitions are not, implicitly or explicitly, male = good, female = bad, man = human, woman = other”] fucking requires the destruction of all conventional role-playing, of genital sexuality as the primary focus and value, of couple formations, and of the personality structures dominant-active (“male”) and submissive-passive (“female”).\n\nAndrea Dworkin, Woman Hating (Plume, 1974), p183-185, androgyny definition p153\n\n(That said, I share Mary Daly’s discomfort with the word “androgynous”, agreeing with her note in the preface to Gyn/Ecology that it sounds something like “John Travolta and Farrah Fawcett-Majors scotch-taped together”. This is a cultural reference to two American film stars popular in the 1970s, who – in a meaning probably unintended on Daly’s part – are both white, but this might be telling about which racially gendered roles, when combined, are thought to constitute “completion”. And more recently “androgynous” has been overused to refer to slightly masculine-coded presentation among people assigned female at birth, making it another kind of problematic.)\n\nAnd so feminist desire, which is what I think Lorde calls the erotic, is also biophilic (Daly) because it isn’t a sexuality in which a person (subject) relates to their inert, objectified image of another person but one in which two living people relate to each other and take joy in their living qualities. It’s a homosexual desire (Raymond, Jeffreys) because it’s a joy in equality, not in (power) difference, and it’s androgynous (Dworkin) in that it doesn’t draw its energy from a distance between opposite definitions.\n\nI think we’re all talking about something similar, and the different routes by which other women have reached it and the different ways we describe and emphasise its many faces are confirmation and comfort to me that we’ve discovered something meaningful.\n\nThe Prudes’ Progress: Re-membering Feminist Desire\n\nHow can we cultivate in ourselves a sexuality of feminist desire and connect with others who are doing the same?\n\nI can only even begin to answer this question for women who love women. I don’t necessarily think it’s impossible for anyone else, but I find it difficult to imagine and I wouldn’t know where to start. Because patriarchy is a big deal (these five words are, for me, the essence of radical feminist thought), I don’t believe you can just exchange the words “women” and “men” within a feminist work, because that “big deal” puts women and men in such different positions.\n\nReaders… will probably be wondering whether homosexual desire can fit into an opposite-sex relationship. In a society which was not founded upon the subordination of women there would be no reason why it should not. But we do not live in such a society. We live in a society organised around heterosexual desire, around otherness and power difference. It is difficult to imagine what shape a woman’s desire for a man would take in the absence of eroticised power difference since it is precisely this which provides the excitement of heterosexuality today. Heterosexuality is the institution through which male-supremacist society is organised and as such it must cease to function. It is difficult to imagine at this point what shape any relationship between different sexes would take when such a relationship was a free choice, when it was not privileged in any way over same-sex relationships and when it played no part in organising women’s oppression and male power. In such a situation, when heterosexuality was no longer an institution, we cannot yet be sure what women would choose.\n\nSheila Jeffreys, Anticlimax: A feminist perspective on the sexual revolution (The Women’s Press, 1996), p316\n\nAt the same time, I acknowledge bell hooks’ warning that:\n\nIt is important for women, especially those who are heterosexual, to know that they can make a radical political commitment to feminist struggle even though they are sexually involved with men (many of us know from experience that political choice will undoubtedly alter the nature of individual relationships). All women need to know that they can be politically committed to feminism regardless of their sexual preference. They need to know that the goal of feminist movement is not to establish codes for a “politically correct” sexuality.\n\nbell hooks, Feminist Theory: from margin to center (South End Press, 1984), p152\n\nOf the many different works I could have attempted to create, I’ve attempted this one, which is about women loving women. Other articles about different forms of feminist desire will necessarily have different content and follow a different path. If you can imagine them I encourage you to write them. My feeling is that feminist desire is difficult, and gendered power imbalances make it a lot more difficult, because instrumental sexuality is designed to run on those imbalances. And so if feminist desire is possible between a woman and her male partner, it’ll probably be because of the ways in which he’s exceptional (after all, a feminist woman picked him), and exceptions are difficult to cover in a general piece like this.\n\nI’ve also just chosen to skip some major issues entirely. For example, I’ve chosen not to engage with the difficult issues of the masculine phallus, with eroticised degradation of women, with how society contextualises sexual relationships it sees as being between women and men and with the function of male privilege in sexual relationships. These issues require explicit treatment of a kind not given here, and are probably best addressed by a woman who has sexual relations with men.\n\nIf you’re not a woman who loves (or wants to love, or feels you could love) women, you’re welcome to keep reading and see if any of this is useful to you, but please understand that I’m not trying to speak directly to you. For any men, I recommend reading John Stoltenberg’s Refusing To Be A Man before continuing with this series, and even then remembering that you’re a guest on women’s land, and we’re not obliged to speak your language. For people who identify with other/no genders, note that I’ve used the word “woman” to refer to people in the political situations of women in a patriarchy. How much the points I make using that word apply to you will be based on your political situation. There’s an article to write which centres the situations of trans* people, rather than the overlapping category of “women”, but this isn’t it. Nonetheless you’ll find some trans* perspectives here.\n\nSimilarly, I’m writing primarily about possibilities of feminist desire between women who don’t hold other forms of significant power over each other such as white privilege. With all these issues, even with male privilege, I don’t think it’s impossible to get past some situations of unequal power, with awareness and hard work. But every difference of power makes it more difficult and it’s difficult enough already. For a work of this size, it wasn’t possible to include more. The only other power difference I’m personally qualified to write about is the transsexual/cissexual dynamic, and at the moment I don’t feel comfortable putting that down to words.\n\nI don’t think that the existence of power differences means that feminist desire is an unhelpful goal, although it may not be every woman’s first goal or even a reachable goal for all women. I think that, where being stuck at the bottom of a well of power makes feminist desire unreachable, this is one of the injustices that should be laid at the feet of that power. In order to speak about it as an injustice we have to be able name it and point exactly at what we’re being prevented from doing. In the meantime, I can offer this article about possibilities (and impossibilities) of consensuality over power relations.\n\nNonetheless issues of structural oppression do feature heavily. As I describe the Prudes’ Progress I also describe some barriers to progress. Many of them are built upon of structural inequality and can’t necessarily be overcome by individuals. Our wish to move closer to feminist desire should be constantly making us aware of the need for collective struggle against structural oppression – the two can’t and shouldn’t be separated.\n\nBefore starting this series proper I want to say a few words about the title. Obviously I’ve re-used the word ‘Prude’ from The Ethical Prude , but my idea of the Prude has moved on a little since writing that article, as I’ll describe later.\n\n‘Prude’ might not be a word which everywoman can easily identify with. An attack against women who say “no”, it can trigger implanted associations and fears. But turning away from instrumental sexuality is a massive act of no-saying, and sadly, we should probably get used to the word. Alone, that can be difficult. But fortunately, this Progress is for Prudes, plural, who are looking to travel. This is about bringing our politics and our desire into alignment so they can both empower each other, and doing that collectively. That said, if “Prude” doesn’t work for you, you’re still very welcome here.\n\nThe subtitle, “Re-membering Feminist Desire” suggests a process which reverses the dismemberment of objectification and fetishes, a putting-back-together of our bodies. Feminist desire, itself, is a process of re-membering. But this is also an attempt to recollect (re-collect) feminist politics of the last 40-odd years for a more integrated approach to the erotic, and so I’ve structured it extensively around quotes from a variety of feminist writers, with links to their work in the bibliography at the end.\n\nAt first I wanted to call this an article about feminist desire. I threw that idea out as soon as it became clear that there was more to say about getting there than about what ‘there’ actually looked like. Then I tried the idea of a “journey”, but journey suggests a beginning, a middle and an end. What I want to describe is a kind of ‘progress’, in the sense of movement in a positive direction.\n\nProgress also sounds refreshingly non-linear. If you ask someone, “How are you getting on with your project?” and they answer, “Oh, well, making progress…” then you know not to ask exactly where they are. I suspect that very few women will take the exact path I’ve taken and precisely follow the steps laid out here. The image in my head while writing this series was of a set of stories told about a progress through difficult ground which mention landmarks, wrong turns and shortcuts. This account is re-membered from those stories.\n\nI’ve separated the series itself into eight Progressions, each of which aims to move us away from instrumental sexuality and toward feminist desire. But the Progress itself is circlewise. That is, while I’ve attempted to frame it so that each Progression flows into and enables the next, in reality they aren’t completely distinct and it may be useful to stay for a long time within one Progression, then read back, and only then jump to the next-but-one. Each time you feel you’re not moving forward I encourage you to try other kinds of movement and circle around to other Progressions. I’ve added hyperlinks throughout which link forward and back to encourage this kind of navigation.\n\nMary Daly, who uses the word Spinning, defines the process better when she describes it as:\n\n“Journeying centerward… Self-centering movement in all directions. It erases implanted pseudodichotomies between the Self and ‘other’ reality, while it unmasks the unreality of both ‘self’ and ‘world’ as these are portrayed, betrayed, in the language of the fathers’ foreground… [it] is not navel-gazing. It is be-ing in the world. The foreground fathers offer dual decoys labeled ‘thought’ and ‘action,’ which distract from the reality both of deep knowing and of external action. There is no authentic separation possible.”\n\nMary Daly, Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism (The Women’s Press, 1979), p6\n\nWhere it’s felt appropriate, I’ve used, like Mary Daly, somewhat poetic language. This isn’t to be cryptic or elitist, but more because it’s felt like the only way to correctly express the ideas. Audre Lorde had this to say about poetry, action and ideas:\n\nAs they become known to and accepted by us, our feelings and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring of ideas. They become a safe-house for that difference so necessary to change and the conceptualization of any meaningful action. Right now, I could name at least ten ideas I would have found intolerable or incomprehensible and frightening, except as they came after dreams and poems. This is not idle fantasy, but a disciplined attention to the true meaning of “it feels right to me.” We can train ourselves to respect our feelings and to transpose them into a language so they can be shared. And where that language does not yet exist, it is our poetry which helps to fashion it. Poetry is not only dream and vision; it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.\n\nAudre Lorde, Sister Outsider, Poetry Is Not a Luxury (Quality Paperback Book Club collected edition, 1993), p37-38\n\nI’m very passionate about some of these subjects, and I’ll move in and out of tones like “we must do this!” and “this is one option”. But really, these Progressions aren’t the only route toward feminist desire, and feminist desire as described here isn’t the only ethical feminist alternative to instrumental sexuality. These Progressions might not even be the most effective way for some or even many women to journey toward feminist desire. Women who already know the shape of instrumental sexuality in their own lives may already know where to begin grappling with it, or may already be well-engaged in the process. I suggest those women use these Progressions as a resource, an inspiration or an expression of solidarity.\n\nBut for others, instrumental sexuality is the “invisible norm”, seemingly everywhere and nowhere, impossible to confront. Taken together, I think these Progressions create a substantial challenge to instrumental sexuality. I think they do enough to deconstruct and contradict it, and are validated from enough different standpoints, that most women who choose to follow them will have a significant collision with the institution of instrumental sexuality. For those women, I hope these Progressions can be a recipe or incantation which has a good chance of making visible some of the structure supporting instrumental sexuality in their own lives. Enough so that the rest of it can be pulled into a fight, a fight set up on women’s own ground in such a way that it may be possible to win.\n\nIn fact, the metaphor of a Progress might suggest setting out over green grass under blue skies; but some of us may be travelling underwater, through a medium where every movement is effort, we can barely see where we’re going, and every time we leave a safe bubble of air we’re afraid we might not find somewhere to breathe again. For some women progress may feel like this. For many women it may feel like this sometimes. Before we start talking about specific barriers to Progress we have to remember that in the State of Emergency some women are always at crisis-point.\n\nAny challenge to institutions which are deeply interwoven with our lives can be experienced as painful by women, and can also be used as a tool of oppression in itself. The same applies to any attempt to outline alternative possibilities; women are well-equipped to blame ourselves for not realising them, and those who pick up the ideas but not their spirit are very capable of using them to police other women for our behaviour and create new hierarchies based on who is and isn’t “right on”.\n\nSo this isn’t the industrial/colonial idea of “progress”, in which a State unfolds its power in a way that creates and reinforces the marginalisation of the people it claims are “benefiting”, grinding them up like a factory machine. The State here is the State of Domination and our Progress is gentle but purposeful in/exploration, looking for paths over/under/around which could lead us out of these “cities and created culture… sustained by a particularly urban technology”.\n\nSo here are some words from the author: If anybody is using this work to make you feel bad, you are automatically right and they are automatically wrong. Feel free to quote me at them. This includes if you are using this to make yourself feel bad, though in that case it might take some figuring out which one of you is right. This is a resource for women who already feel bad about instrumental sexuality and are looking for possibilities that might feel better.\n\nOf course, women’s feelings of “good” and “bad” aren’t magical and we can feel good about things that hurt us and bad about things that would be healthy. As individuals it can be difficult to find our way out of the maze in which bad is good is bad. A personal sense that something feels bad is an important feminist tool, but feminists have long had more tools than that, and possibly the most important is collective understanding of our situation, the subject of the first Progression, which follows the FAQ.\n\nFAQ\n\nFAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions, but here the ‘A’ could also stand for Anticipated. Because lesbian feminists (and others!) have been writing about non-hierarchical desire for so long, I’m already familiar with some responses to the idea of feminist desire. Perhaps the most common question is, “How do I do it?!”, from women excitedly catching their first glimpse of a golden pathway leading out of the State of Domination. I hear you, sisters; that’s what this whole series is about. But there are also likely to be some common questions, which I’ll try to answer briefly beforehand.\n\nWhat you’re talking about doesn’t sound like sex at all!\n\nI agree. If ‘sex’ is what’s normally thought of as sex in a patriarchy, and if ‘sexy’ is what’s normally considered sexual in a patriarchy, then this doesn’t sound like it, because it isn’t. Patriarchy has the power to control the definition of what’s considered ‘sex’ and we should expect it to have used that power.\n\nIt should be taken for granted that [sex] must be pleasurable to both parties, always: which means it must never be institutionalized by law or culture. And if it is a basic “drive” felt by both men and women, there is no need to institutionalize it to ensure its survival. What we “see” when we look inside may correspond very poorly with reality. We’re saturated with a particular story about what’s inside. Moreover, we’ve been saturated with this all our lives, and it has conditioned us and made us what we are. We feel that we need sex, but the issue is very confused. What is it we really need? Is it orgasms? Intercourse? Intimacy with another human being? Stroking? Companionship? Human kindness? And do we “need” it physically or psychologically?\n\nDana Densmore, Independence from the Sexual Revolution , published in Radical Feminism (Quadrangle, 1973)\n\nYou’re just trying to desexualise lesbianism!\n\nThis series talks a lot about woman-loving, and I’m trying to de-something-ise woman-loving for women, yes. And also re-something-ise it. Those somethings aren’t ‘sex’, though. I believe that something has been coded into sexual norms which shouldn’t be there, and some possibilities have been excluded which should be available. If they were available, I believe many women would choose them.\n\nWhat is there, and shouldn’t be, is the idea that in order to be by definition properly “sexual”, women who love women have to learn or continue to eroticise power differences, so that those who don’t can feel like heretics, as Sheila Jeffreys notes in The Lesbian Heresy :\n\nOnce lesbian feminists were able to take pride in their status as heretics in relation to the values of the heteropatriarchy. Now lesbian feminism is a heresy to many lesbians who seem to wish to assimilate themselves seamlessly into the values of the heteropatriarchy.\n\nSheila Jeffreys, The Lesbian Heresy: A feminist perspective on the lesbian sexual revolution (Spinifex Press, 1993), p150\n\nEven those who don’t have a problem with eroticising power differences (though I’m not one of them) must agree that this shouldn’t be compulsory for anybody.\n\nThe possibility that’s missing is the chance to develop a sexuality of feminist desire, to name and voice that sexuality, to reach out to others who are developing it and who want to relate in that way, and to build community bonds on the grounds of feminist desire. Those who try to do this are even called anti-lesbian in what Mary Daly would describe as a classic reversal: the description of something as the opposite of what it really is in order to maintain a harmful status quo and place those working to change it onto the defensive. Feminist desire is deeply pro-women-who-love-women. As Sheila Jeffreys writes regarding the lesbian aspect of feminist desire’s herstory:\n\nWe must remember that homosexual desire [defined by Jeffreys as desire between women not based on eroticised power difference] will not be recognised as ‘sex’. We do not even possess suitable words to describe it. The course of eroticising equality and mutuality has received no prizes from male supremacy or its agents but it is time we shared our wisdom and experience, learned from feminists and lesbians in our history and became proud of what distinguishes lesbian experience from male-supremacist culture.\n\nSheila Jeffreys, Anticlimax: A feminist perspective on the sexual revolution (The Women’s Press, 1993), p315\n\nWhat about bisexual women?\n\nI want this series to be for all women who love women. Where possible I’ve aimed to use inclusive language but many of the authors I quote use language like “lesbian”, “Lesbian” and “heterosexual (woman)” in an ambiguous way or in a way which clearly erases women of other sexualities. It’s been difficult to quote in a way which entirely solves this problem but where possible I’ve clarified the author’s meaning and/or added “[sic]” where their use of “lesbian” creates an error in their text.\n\nWhen writing in my own words I try to use phrases like, “women who love women”, “women who exclusively love women”, “women who love men”, “women who exclusively love men”, “bisexual women” and “women who choose to exclusively relate to women” to communicate more precise meanings, but I’m aware that even these phrases aren’t perfect (for example, the phrase “women who exclusively love women” does an inadequate job of describing women who consider themselves lesbian but occasionally romantically or sexually relate to men).\n\nThe word “heterosexuality” is also used by some quoted authors, most notably Sheila Jeffreys and Janice Raymond, to describe an institution (something well-established which organises/influences), not a sexuality. Whether or not bisexual women’s attraction to men is also organised through the same institution (in which case “heterosexuality” may be a misleading name for it), and/or whether bisexuality is an organising institution of its own is a question I trust bisexual radical feminist theorists to answer.\n\nBisexual theorists such as Shiri Eisner have clearly shown that, as well as facing similar issues to other women, women occupying the position of “bisexual” face some unique pressures compared with women occupying other sexual positions. As far as the similar issues go, I hope and expect that the discussion here of the instutition of heterosexuality is also relevant for bisexual women, and I’ve also tackled some bisexual-specific issues where relevant via the words of bisexual woman writers.\n\nYou don’t get to tell me what to do or what my sexuality should be!\n\nSince I wrote The Ethical Prude , the most common question I’ve been asked – and I’ve also asked it myself – is, if sexual norms are so broken, where do we go instead? This is one attempt to answer that question. If you’re not asking the question, I’m not speaking directly to you, although you’re very welcome to listen and make up your own mind.\n\nThis process shouldn’t and can’t be forced. There are too many people telling women what we should do. And as a sexuality that’s against all forms of forcing, feminist desire can’t be built with the master’s tools of coercion. This is raw material for women who are already searching, with as much structure as they’d like to take on. Each woman reading this will need to personally authenticate every step rather than taking it on my or anyone else’s authority. This process can only be Self-motivated.\n\nFeminist desire sounds just like vanilla. It’s BDSMers who are oppressed, not vanillas!\n\nFor those who haven’t encountered it, “vanilla” is a term used in BDSM communities meaning “non-BDSM-practitioners”, or sometimes, “those without an innately BDSM sexuality”, depending on whether BDSM is considered a practice or a sexuality.\n\nI know that people who openly and unapologetically describe themselves as BDSMers do face some negative consequences for it, because I’ve seen it happen. Personally, I think this is because they’re speaking honestly about one of the Great Lies by admitting that almost everybody is eroticising dominance in their sex lives. This is meant to go unspoken and there are social punishments for voicing it. Society manages the eroticisation of dominance by condemning it in public and condoning it in private, like with many aspects of oppression. It’s done by “those bad people over there”. By standing up, BDSMers become “those bad people”.\n\nBut feminist desire isn’t vanilla, the implicit complement to BDSM. If BDSM is aware of the trend to eroticise dominance in society, then it’s leaning in to that trend (in the case of the not-small-but-still-a-minority of people who consider themselves both BDSMers and feminists, that can even be with feminist intent), where “vanilla” defines the trend and feminist desire is leaning hard away. As Sandy Covahey wrote in “Off Our Backs” (Aug-Sept. 1993), “I have occasionally joked with close friends that if there is an opposite to a sado-masochist, then I may be it. That statement may seem dualistic and simplistic, but there is a certain amount of truth to it.”\n\nI think that people who read the full series will see that feminist desire is not accepted by the main(male)stream and is something different to the way that BDSMers theorise “vanilla”.\n\nYou’re just in bed with the right wing\n\nThis is an old misogynist argument against radical feminists. It’s had enough airtime elsewhere, so I recommend reading one of the many responses out there, such as Catharine MacKinnon’s introductory essay to In Harm’s Way , “The Roar on the Other Side of Silence” (from p10 and onwards). MacKinnon focuses on how this argument has been used against anti-pornography feminists, which is where it seems to have originated, but I think her response is broadly applicable.\n\nThat’s it for the second part of this series. The third part will begin with the first three Progressions of the Prudes’ Progress.",

  "latent_29964": "For other places with the same name, see Newark (disambiguation)\n\nCity in New Jersey, United States\n\nThe Krueger-Scott Mansion , owned by African-American beauty entrepreneur Louise Scott, Newark's first female millionaire\n\nNewark (,[24] locally )[25] is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Jersey and the seat of Essex County.[26] As one of the nation's major air, shipping, and rail hubs, the city had a population of 285,154 in 2017,[13] making it the nation's 70th-most populous municipality,[14] after being ranked 63rd in the nation in 2000.[15]\n\nSettled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark is one of the oldest cities in the United States. Its location at the mouth of the Passaic River (where it flows into Newark Bay) has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Today, Port Newark–Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast. In addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.[27][28][29]\n\nSeveral leading companies have their headquarters in Newark, including Prudential, PSEG, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Audible.com, IDT Corporation, and Manischewitz. A number of important higher education institutions are also in the city, including the Newark campus of Rutgers University (which includes law and medical schools and the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies); the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and Seton Hall University's law school. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey sits in the city as well. Local cultural venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark Symphony Hall, the Prudential Center and the Newark Museum.\n\nNewark is divided into five political wards (the East, West, South, North and Central wards) and contains neighborhoods ranging in character from bustling urban districts to quiet suburban enclaves. Newark's Branch Brook Park is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000.[30][31][32][33] The park borders the Forest Hill section, Belleville, and the Roseville section. It even is home to the Ballantine Gates located at Ballantine Parkway & Lake St.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\n1910-era map of ethnic enclaves in Newark, New Jersey\n\nNewark was settled in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony. It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas.[34] On October 31, 1693, it was organized as a New Jersey township based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a Royal charter on April 27, 1713. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798 by the New Jersey Legislature's Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark's Vailsburg.[35]\n\nThe name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent, England, because of the influence of the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire.[36][37][38] But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named \"New Ark\" for \"New Ark of the Covenant[39] and some of the colonists saw it as \"New-Work\", the settlers' new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name \"New Ark\" are found in preserved letters written by historical figures such as David Ogden in his claim for compensation, and James McHenry, as late as 1787.[40]\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, British troops made several raids into the town.[41] The city saw tremendous industrial and population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots.\n\nThe city has experienced revitalization since the 1990s.[42] In 2018 the city passed legislation to protect residents from displacement brought about by gentrification.[43]\n\nGeography and climate [ edit ]\n\nGeography [ edit ]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 26.107 square miles (67.617 km2), including 24.187 square miles (62.644 km2) of land and 1.920 square miles (4.973 km2) of water (7.35% was water).[1][2] It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida.[44] The city's altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately 230 feet (70 m) above sea level in the western section of the city.[45] Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River, with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark's high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.[46]\n\nUntil the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was able to reclaim 68 acres (28 ha) of the marshland for the further expansion of Newark Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.[29]\n\nNewark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey's Gateway Region, which is said to have received its name from Newark's nickname as the \"Gateway City\".[47]\n\nNeighborhoods [ edit ]\n\n1910-era map of ethnic enclaves in Newark, New Jersey\n\nNewark is New Jersey's largest and second-most racially diverse city (after neighboring Jersey City). It is divided into five political wards,[48] which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.[49]\n\nState law requires that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk.[50] Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.[51][52][53]\n\nNewark's Central Ward, formerly known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's history including the original squares Lincoln Park, Military Park and Washington Park. The Ward contains the University Heights, The Coast/Lincoln Park, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the subject of the 1968 novel Howard Street by Nathan Heard, is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other white Catholic and Christian groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by Blacks. The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the nation's largest health sciences university, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. It is also home to three other universities – New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University – Newark, and Essex County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library.[54]\n\nHome in Forest Hill\n\nThe North Ward is surrounded by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section.[55] Forest Hill contains the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered on state and national historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes. A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse.[55]\n\nThe West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg, Ivy Hill, West Side, Fairmount and Lower Roseville. It is home to the historic Fairmount Cemetery. The West Ward, once a predominantly Irish-American, Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed primarily of Latinos, African Americans, and Caribbean Americans.[56] The West Ward has struggled in recent years with elevated rates of crime, particularly violent crime.[57]\n\nThe South Ward comprises the Weequahic, Clinton Hill, Dayton, and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home to residents of predominantly Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics. The South Ward is represented by Council Member John Sharpe James. The city's second-largest hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, can be found in the South Ward, as can 17 public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, one police precinct, a mini precinct, and three fire houses.[58]\n\nThe East Ward consists of much of Newark's Downtown commercial district, as well as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark's industry was in the 19th century. Today, due to the enterprise of its immigrant population, the Ironbound (also known as \"Down Neck\" and \"The Neck\")[59] is a destination for shopping, dining, and nightlife.[60] A historically immigrant-dominated section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed \"Little Portugal\" and \"Little Brazil\" due to its heavily Portuguese and Brazilian population, Newark being home to one of the largest Portuguese speaking communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become home to various Latin Americans, African Americans, and commuters to Manhattan. Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and six elementary schools. The ward is largely composed of densely packed housing, primarily large apartment buildings and rowhouses.[49][61][62]\n\nClimate [ edit ]\n\nNewark lies in the transition between a humid subtropical and humid continental climate (Köppen Cfa/Dfa), with cold, damp winters and hot, humid summers. The January daily mean is 31.6 °F (−0.2 °C),[63] and although temperatures below 10 °F (−12 °C) are to be expected in most years,[64] sub-0 °F (−18 °C) readings are rare; conversely, some days may warm up to 50 °F (10 °C). The average seasonal snowfall is 29.5 inches (75 cm), though variations in weather patterns may bring sparse snowfall in some years and several major nor'easters in others, with the heaviest 24-hour fall of 25.9 inches (66 cm) occurring on December 26, 1947.[63] Spring and autumn in the area are generally unstable yet mild. The July daily mean is 77.4 °F (25.2 °C), and highs exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 27 days per year,[63] not factoring in the oft-higher heat index.\n\nThe city receives precipitation ranging from 2.9 to 4.8 inches (74 to 122 mm) per month, usually falling on 8 to 12 days per month. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −14 °F (−26 °C) on February 9, 1934 to 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 2011.[63]\n\nClimate data for Newark, New Jersey (Newark Liberty Int'l) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 74\n\n(23) 80\n\n(27) 89\n\n(32) 97\n\n(36) 99\n\n(37) 102\n\n(39) 108\n\n(42) 105\n\n(41) 105\n\n(41) 93\n\n(34) 85\n\n(29) 76\n\n(24) 108\n\n(42) Mean maximum °F (°C) 60.2\n\n(15.7) 62.2\n\n(16.8) 73.3\n\n(22.9) 84.1\n\n(28.9) 90.8\n\n(32.7) 95.7\n\n(35.4) 98.1\n\n(36.7) 95.7\n\n(35.4) 90.5\n\n(32.5) 81.0\n\n(27.2) 72.6\n\n(22.6) 62.9\n\n(17.2) 99.6\n\n(37.6) Average high °F (°C) 38.8\n\n(3.8) 42.3\n\n(5.7) 50.7\n\n(10.4) 62.0\n\n(16.7) 72.1\n\n(22.3) 81.5\n\n(27.5) 86.0\n\n(30.0) 84.0\n\n(28.9) 76.7\n\n(24.8) 65.3\n\n(18.5) 54.6\n\n(12.6) 43.5\n\n(6.4) 63.1\n\n(17.3) Daily mean °F (°C) 31.6\n\n(−0.2) 34.6\n\n(1.4) 42.1\n\n(5.6) 52.8\n\n(11.6) 62.7\n\n(17.1) 72.4\n\n(22.4) 77.4\n\n(25.2) 75.8\n\n(24.3) 68.2\n\n(20.1) 56.6\n\n(13.7) 46.8\n\n(8.2) 36.5\n\n(2.5) 54.8\n\n(12.7) Average low °F (°C) 24.5\n\n(−4.2) 26.9\n\n(−2.8) 33.6\n\n(0.9) 43.7\n\n(6.5) 53.3\n\n(11.8) 63.3\n\n(17.4) 68.7\n\n(20.4) 67.5\n\n(19.7) 59.7\n\n(15.4) 48.0\n\n(8.9) 39.0\n\n(3.9) 29.6\n\n(−1.3) 46.5\n\n(8.1) Mean minimum °F (°C) 7.8\n\n(−13.4) 11.8\n\n(−11.2) 17.9\n\n(−7.8) 31.8\n\n(−0.1) 42.4\n\n(5.8) 52.4\n\n(11.3) 60.5\n\n(15.8) 57.8\n\n(14.3) 47.2\n\n(8.4) 36.0\n\n(2.2) 25.9\n\n(−3.4) 14.6\n\n(−9.7) 5.6\n\n(−14.7) Record low °F (°C) −8\n\n(−22) −14\n\n(−26) 6\n\n(−14) 16\n\n(−9) 33\n\n(1) 41\n\n(5) 51\n\n(11) 45\n\n(7) 35\n\n(2) 25\n\n(−4) 12\n\n(−11) −8\n\n(−22) −14\n\n(−26) Average precipitation inches (mm) 3.53\n\n(90) 2.88\n\n(73) 4.18\n\n(106) 4.20\n\n(107) 4.09\n\n(104) 4.02\n\n(102) 4.76\n\n(121) 3.70\n\n(94) 3.82\n\n(97) 3.60\n\n(91) 3.65\n\n(93) 3.80\n\n(97) 46.24\n\n(1,174) Average snowfall inches (cm) 8.9\n\n(23) 9.5\n\n(24) 4.4\n\n(11) .9\n\n(2.3) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) .4\n\n(1.0) 5.4\n\n(14) 29.5\n\n(75.3) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 10.4 9.8 11.0 11.5 11.3 11.0 10.1 9.7 8.6 8.7 9.5 10.6 122.1 Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 5.0 3.7 2.4 .4 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 2.9 14.7 Source: NOAA (normals 1981–2010, extremes 1931–present)[63][65]\n\nDemographics [ edit ]\n\nThe city had a population of 277,140 as of the 2010 Census,[12] retaining its position as the largest city in the state and making it the nation's 67th-most populous municipality.[82] The increase in 2010 of 3,594 (+1.3%) from the 273,546 counted in the 2000 Census marked the second census in 70 years in which the city's population had grown from the previous enumeration.[9][10][11][83][84]\n\nAfter reaching a peak of 442,337 residents counted in the 1930 Census, the city's population saw a decline of nearly 40% as residents moved to surrounding suburbs. \"White flight\" from Newark to the suburbs started in the 1940s and accelerated in the 1960s, due in part to the construction of the Interstate Highway System. [85] The 1967 riots resulted in a significant population loss of the city's middle class, many of them Jewish, which continued from the 1970s through to the 1990s.[86] The city lost about 130,000 residents between 1960 and 1990.\n\nFrom the 1950s to 1967, white population shrank from 363,000 to 158,000; its black population grew from 70,000 to 220,000.[87] The percentage of Non-Hispanic whites[81] declined from 82.8% in 1950 to 11.6% by 2010.[88] The percentage of Latinos in Newark grew between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% to 33.8% while that of Blacks decreased from 58.2% to 52.4%.[89][90][91][92]\n\nPoverty remains a consistent problem in Newark, despite its revitalization in recent years. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished.[93]\n\nIn advance of the 2000 United States Census, city officials made a push to get residents to respond and participate in the enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation.[94] It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.[95]\n\n2010 Census [ edit ]\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 277,140 people, 94,542 households, and 61,641 families residing in the city. The population density was 11,458.3 per square mile (4,424.1/km2). There were 109,520 housing units at an average density of 4,528.1 per square mile (1,748.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 26.31% (72,914) White, 52.35% (145,085) Black or African American, 0.61% (1,697) Native American, 1.62% (4,485) Asian, 0.04% (118) Pacific Islander, 15.22% (42,181) from other races, and 3.85% (10,660) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.83% (93,746) of the population.[9]\n\nThere were 94,542 households out of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.0% were married couples living together, 28.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.8% were non-families. 27.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.36.[9]\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 25.6% under the age of 18, 11.9% from 18 to 24, 31.9% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females there were 97.9 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 96.3 males.[9]\n\nThe Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $35,659 (with a margin of error of +/− $1,009) and the median family income was $41,684 (+/− $1,116). Males had a median income of $34,350 (+/− $1,015) versus $32,865 (+/− $973) for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,367 (+/− $364). About 22.0% of families and 25.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.9% of those under age 18 and 22.4% of those age 65 or over.[96]\n\nPoverty rates, as of 2003\n\n2000 Census [ edit ]\n\nNewark was the 64th-most populous city as of the 2000 Census.[97]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States Census[21] there were 273,546 people, 91,382 households, and 61,956 families residing in the city. The population density was 11,495.0 per square mile (4,437.7/km²). There were 100,141 housing units at an average density of 4,208.1 per square mile (1,624.6//km²). The racial makeup of the city as of the 2000 Census was 53.46% (146,250) African American, 26.52% (72,537) White, 1.19% (3,263) Asian, 0.37% (1,005) Native American, 0.05% (135) Pacific Islander, 14.05% (38,430) from other races, and 4.36% (11,926) from two or more races. 29.47% (80,622) of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[77][78]\n\nAs of the 2000 Census, 49.2% of the city's 80,622 residents who identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino were from Puerto Rico, while 9.4% were from Ecuador and 7.8% from the Dominican Republic.[98] There is a significant Portuguese-speaking community concentrated in the Ironbound district. 2000 Census data showed that Newark had 15,801 residents of Portuguese ancestry (5.8% of the population), while an additional 5,805 (2.1% of the total) were of Brazilian ancestry.[99]\n\nThere were 91,382 households out of which 35.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.0% were married couples living together, 29.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.2% were non-families. 26.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.8 and the average family size was 3.40.[77][78]\n\nIn the city the age distribution of the population shows 27.9% under the age of 18, 12.1% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 18.7% from 45 to 64, and 9.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.2 males. For every 100 females of age 18 and over, there were 91.1 males.[77][78]\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $26,913, and the median income for a family was $30,781. Males had a median income of $29,748 versus $25,734 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,009. 28.4% of the population and 25.5% of families were below the poverty line. 36.6% of those under the age of 18 and 24.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. The city's unemployment rate was 8.5%.[77][78]\n\nEconomy [ edit ]\n\nDowntown Newark at night\n\nMore than 100,000 people commute to Newark each workday,[100] making it the state's largest employment center with many white-collar jobs in insurance, finance, import-export, health-care, and government.[101] As a major courthouse venue including federal, state, and county facilities, it is home to more than 1,000 law firms. The city is also a college town, with nearly 50,000 students attending the city's universities and medical and law schools.[102][103] Its airport, maritime port, rail facilities, and highway network make Newark the busiest transshipment hub on the East Coast in terms of volume.[104][105]\n\nThough Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing.[106] The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007.[107] The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.[108]\n\nNewark is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within 0.5 miles of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.[109][110] After the election of Cory Booker, millions of dollars of public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development, but persistent underemployment continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods.[111][112][113][114][115][116] Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished.[93]\n\nNewark is the third-largest insurance center in the United States, after New York City and Hartford.[117] Prudential Financial, Mutual Benefit Life, Fireman's Insurance, and American Insurance Company all originated in the city, while Prudential still has its home office in Newark.[118] Many other companies are headquartered in the city, including IDT Corporation, NJ Transit, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Manischewitz, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey.[119][120] and Audible.com.[121] In 2013 Panasonic moved its North American headquarters to a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2) office building.[122][123]\n\nPortions of Newark are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[124]\n\nPort Newark [ edit ]\n\nPort Newark is the part of Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo facility in the Port of New York and New Jersey. On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985.[125] Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.[126]\n\nParks and recreation [ edit ]\n\nColonial commons [ edit ]\n\nAmerica's war dead memorial in Military Park\n\nWashington Park\n\nMilitary Park in Downtown Newark, the town commons since 1869 and home to the Wars of America sculpture and the casual restaurant, Burg. [127] As of 2018, the park is privately operated. Managed by a nonprofit corporation, the Military Park Partnership, which is staffed by Dan Biederman and Biederman Redevelopment Ventures, credited with transforming Manhattan’s Bryant Park.

Lincoln Park in the Arts District, one of three original colonial-era commons in Newark. From the 1920s to the 1950s, Lincoln Park was at the southern end of Newark's jazz and nightlife strip known as \"The Coast.\"\n\nWashington Park, the northernmost of the three original colonial-era commons in Newark. Philip Roth's narrator in Goodbye, Columbus visits the park, saying \"Sitting there in the park, I felt a deep knowledge of Newark, an attachment so rooted that it could not help but branch out into affection.\"[128]\n\nPassaic River waterfront [ edit ]\n\nA chain of parkland along the Passaic River, especially along the downward \"curve\" in the river that gave the Ironbound neighborhood its nickname of \"Down Neck,\" offers waterfront recreation in the city. Kayaking and riverboat tours of the city are offered in the summer months.[129][130] From east to west along the downward \"neck\" of the Passaic, parkland includes:\n\nOther parks [ edit ]\n\nBranch Brook Park in the North Ward of Newark\n\nCherry blossoms in Branch Brook Park\n\nGolf and other recreational facilities [ edit ]\n\nIronbound Recreation Center.

Jesse Allen Skateboard Park.[162]\n\nArts and culture [ edit ]\n\nArchitecture and sculptures [ edit ]\n\nThere are several notable Beaux-Arts buildings, such as the Veterans' Administration building, the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library, and the Cass Gilbert-designed Essex County Courthouse. Notable Art Deco buildings include several 1930s era skyscrapers, such as the National Newark Building and Eleven 80, the restored Newark Penn Station, and Arts High School. Gothic architecture can be found at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart by Branch Brook Park, which is one of the largest gothic cathedrals in the United States. It is rumored to have as much stained glass as the Cathedral of Chartres. Newark also has two public sculpture works by Gutzon Borglum—Wars of America in Military Park and Seated Lincoln in front of the Essex County Courthouse. Moorish Revival buildings include Newark Symphony Hall and the Prince Street Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogue buildings in New Jersey.[163]\n\nPerforming arts [ edit ]\n\nThe New Jersey Performing Arts Center, near Military Park, opened in 1997, is the home of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and the New Jersey State Opera, The center's programs of national and international music, dance, and theater make it the nation's sixth-largest performing arts center, attracting over 400,000 visitors each year.[164]\n\nPrior to the opening of the performing arts center, Newark Symphony Hall was home to the New Jersey Symphony, the New Jersey State Opera, and the Garden State Ballet, which still maintains an academy there.[165] The 1925 neo-classic building, originally built by the Shriners, has three performance spaces, including the main concert named in honor of famous Newarker Sarah Vaughan, offering rhythm and blues, rap, hip-hop, and gospel music concerts, and is part of the modern-day Chitlin' Circuit.[166]\n\nThe Newark Boys Chorus, founded in 1966, performs regularly in the city. The African Globe Theater Works presents a new works seasonally. The biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival took place in Newark for the first time in 2010.[167]\n\nVenues at the universities in the city are also used to present professional and semi-professional theater, dance, and music. Since its opening, the Prudential Center in 2007 has presented Diana Ross, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, The Eagles, Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus, Spice Girls, Jonas Brothers, Metro Station, Metallica, Alicia Keys, Demi Lovato, David Archuleta, Taylor Swift and American Idol Live!, among others. Bon Jovi performed a series of ten concerts to mark the venue's opening.[168]\n\nIn the house music and garage house genres and scene, Newark is known as an innovator. Newark's Club Zanzibar, along with other gay and straight clubs in the 1970s and 80s, was famous as both a gay and straight nightlife destination. Famed DJ Tony Humphries helped \"spawn the sometimes raw but always soulful, gospel-infused subgenre\" of house music known as the Jersey Sound.[169][170] The club scene also gave rise to the ball culture scene in Newark hotels and nightclubs.[171]\n\nHouse music producer, DJ and writer Junior Sanchez started making house music in his teens growing up in the Ironbound district.\n\nBrick City club, a dance-oriented electronic music genre, is native to the city.\n\nMuseums, libraries, and galleries [ edit ]\n\nThree buildings of the Newark Museum\n\nThe Newark Museum is the largest in New Jersey. Highlights of its collection include American and Tibetan art. The museum also contains science galleries, a planetarium, a gallery for children's exhibits, a fire museum, a sculpture garden and an 18th-century schoolhouse. Also part of the museum is the historic John Ballantine House, a restored Victorian mansion which is a National Historic Landmark. The museum co-sponsors the Newark Black Film Festival, which has premiered numerous films since its founding in 1974.[172]\n\nThe city is also home to the New Jersey Historical Society, which has rotating exhibits on New Jersey and Newark.

The Panel system was the Bell System solution to the big city problem, where an exchange had to serve large numbers of subscribers on both manual as well as automatically switched central offices, without negatively impacting established user convenience and reliability. As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers' telephones had no dials and customers continued to make calls by asking an operator to ring their called party, at which point the operator keyed the telephone number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually.[201]\n\nMost Panel installations across the country were replaced by modern systems during the 1970s and the last Panel switch was decommissioned in the BIgelow central office in Newark in 1983.[202]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nNew Jersey's first television station, WATV Channel 13, signed-on May 15, 1948, from studios at the Mosque Theater known as the \"Television Center Newark.\" The studios were home to WNTA-13 beginning in 1958 and WNJU-47 until 1989.[203]\n\nWNET, a flagship station of the Public Broadcasting Service now on channel 13, and Spanish-language WFUT-TV, a UniMás owned-and-operated station, are licensed to Newark.

As of March 23, 2011, out of a 2010 Census population of 277,140 in Newark, there were 136,785 registered voters (66.3% of the 2010 population ages 18 and over of 206,253, vs. 77.7% in all of Essex County of the 589,051 ages 18 and up) of which 68,393 (50.0% vs. 45.9% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 3,548 (2.6% vs. 9.9% countywide) were registered as Republicans, 64,812 (47.4% vs. 44.1% countywide) were registered as Unaffiliated and there were 30 voters registered to other parties.[291]\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 95.0% of the vote (78,352 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 4.7% (3,852 votes), and other candidates with 0.4% (298 votes), among the 82,030 ballots cast by the city's 145,059 registered voters for a turnout of 56.5%.[292][293] In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 90.8% of the vote (77,112 ballots cast), ahead of Republican John McCain who received 7.0% of the vote (5,957 votes), with 84,901 of the city's 140,946 registered voters participating, for a turnout of 60.2% of registered voters.[294] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 85.9% of the vote (62,700 ballots), outpolling Republican George W.

Five of the previous seven mayors of Newark have been indicted on criminal charges, including the three mayors before Cory Booker: Hugh Addonizio, Kenneth Gibson and Sharpe James. As reported by Newsweek: \"... every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for crimes committed while in office\".[300]\n\nAddonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the political machine of the era. In December 1969, Addonizio and nine present or former officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a Federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted.[301] In July 1970, the former mayor, and four other defendants, were found guilty by a Federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion.[302] In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and fined $25,000 by Federal Judge George Herbert Barlow for his role in a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5 million in kickbacks, a crime that the judge said \"tore at the very heart of our civilized society and our form of representative government\".[303][304]\n\nHis successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.[305]\n\nSharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.[306]\n\nEducation [ edit ]\n\nColleges and universities [ edit ]\n\nNewark is the home of multiple institutions of higher education, including: a Berkeley College campus,[307] the main campus of Essex County College,[308] New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT),[309] the Newark Campus of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (formerly University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey),[310] Rutgers University–Newark,[311] Seton Hall University School of Law,[312] and Pillar College. Kean University is located in adjacent Union, New Jersey. Most of Newark's academic institutions are in the city's University Heights district. The colleges and universities have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 60,000 students and faculty.[313]\n\nPublic schools [ edit ]\n\nAs of the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, 16.0% of Newark residents ages 25 and over had never attended high school and 15.9% didn't graduate, while 68.1% had at least graduated from high school, including the 12.3% who had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. The total school enrollment in Newark city was 75,025 in the 2006–2010 ACS, with pre-primary school enrollment of 10,560, elementary or high school enrollment of 46,691 and college enrollment of 17,774.[96]\n\nThe Newark Public Schools, a state-operated school district, is the largest school system in New Jersey. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide,[314] which are now referred to as \"SDA Districts\" based on the requirement that the state cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[315][316] As of the 2014–15 school year, the district and its 76 schools had an enrollment of 34,861 students and 2,815.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.4:1.[317]\n\nScience Park High School, which was the 69th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2010 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", after being ranked 50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. Technology High School has a GreatSchools rating of 9/10 and was ranked 165th in New Jersey Monthly's 2010 rankings. Newark high schools ranked in the bottom 10% of the New Jersey Monthly 2010 list include Central (274th), East Side (293rd), Newark Vocational (304th), Weequahic (310th), Barringer (311th), Malcolm X Shabazz (314th) and West Side (319th).[318] Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg donated a challenge grant of $100 million to the district in 2010, choosing Newark because he stated he believed in Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie's abilities.[319]\n\nCharter schools in Newark include the Robert Treat Academy Charter School, a National Blue Ribbon School drawing students from all over Newark. It remains one of the top performing K-8 schools in New Jersey based on standardized test scores.[320] University Heights Charter School is another charter school, serving children in grades K-5, recognized as a 2011 Epic Silver Gain School.[321] Gray Charter School, like Robert Treat, also won a Blue Ribbon Award.[322] Also, Newark Collegiate Academy (NCA) opened in August 2007 and serves 420 students in grades 9–12. It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other charter schools in the area.[323]\n\nPrivate schools [ edit ]\n\nThe city hosts three high schools as part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark: the coeducational Christ The King Prep, founded in 2007, is part of the Cristo Rey Community; Saint Benedict's Preparatory School is an all-boys Roman Catholic high school founded in 1868 and conducted by the Benedictine monks of Newark Abbey, whose campus has grown to encompass both sides of MLK Jr. Blvd. near Market Street and includes a dormitory for boarding students; and Saint Vincent Academy which is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and operated continuously since 1869.[324]\n\nLink Community School is a non-denominational coeducational day school that serves approximately 128 students in seventh and eighth grades. The Newark Boys Chorus School was founded in the 1960s.[325] University Heights Charter School, which opened in 2006, taught 614 students in grades PK-8 in 2014–2015.[326]\n\nInfrastructure [ edit ]\n\nTransportation [ edit ]\n\nNewark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and the mid-Atlantic United States.[327]\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the New York metro area and the 15th-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic).[328] Newark Airport was the New York City area's first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on land reclaimed by the Port Authority.[29]\n\nPort Newark, on Newark Bay, is the fifteenth-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the East Coast of the United States. In 2003, the port moved over $100 billion in goods.[329]\n\nEarly modes of transport [ edit ]\n\nNewark Trolley line on Market Street near the present-day courthouse\n\nThe Morris Canal, stretching 102 miles (164 km) to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River, was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York metropolitan area. The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, its right of way was converted into the Newark City Subway, now known as the Newark Light Rail. Many of the subway stations still portray the canal in its original state, in the form of mosaic works.[330]\n\nAs the city became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse.[331] The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.[332]\n\nRoads and highways [ edit ]\n\nView north along the New Jersey Turnpike/Interstate 95 at the exit for Interstate 78, U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 9 in Newark\n\nAs of May 2010 , the city had a total of 368.21 miles (592.58 km) of roadways, of which 318.77 miles (513.01 km) were maintained by the municipality, 17.61 miles (28.34 km) by Essex County, 22.66 miles (36.47 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 9.17 miles (14.76 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[333]\n\nNewark Light Rail\n\nNewark is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 280, Interstate 78, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, and Route 21. Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, which was first constructed in 1938 and will be undergoing a $900 million renovation project.[334]\n\nLocal streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.[335]\n\nIn a city extensively served by mass transit, 44.2% of Newark residents did not have a car as of the 2000 Census, ranked second in the U.S. to New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile among cities with more than 250,000 people.[336] According to the 2016 American Community Survey, the number of households without an automobile has decreased to 39.2%. The same year, the average Newark household owned .89 cars compared to a national average of 1.8 cars per household.[337]\n\nPublic transportation [ edit ]\n\nNewark Penn Station\n\nNewark Penn Station, situated just east of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links 24/7 Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in the bed of the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.[338]\n\nNewark is served by NJ Transit bus routes 1, 5, 11, 13, 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 99, 107, and 108. Bus route 308 is an express bus route to Six Flags Great Adventure from Newark Penn Station while 319 is an express service to Atlantic City.[339]\n\nThe go bus 25 and go bus 28 are bus rapid transit lines through the city to Irvington, Bloomfield and Newark Liberty International Airport.[340][341]\n\nModal characteristics [ edit ]\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 53.7% of working city of Newark residents commuted by driving alone, 9.3% carpooled, 27.3% used public transportation, and 6.5% walked. About 5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 5.7% of working Newark residents worked at home.[342]\n\nHealthcare [ edit ]\n\nNewark is home to five hospitals. University Hospital, an independent institution that is a teaching hospital of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences,[343] has been the busiest Level I trauma center in the state.[344] Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is the largest hospital in the city and is a part of Barnabas Health, the state's largest system of hospital and health care facilities.[345] Beth Israel is also one of the oldest hospitals in the city, dating back to 1901. This 669-bed regional facility is also home to the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Catholic Health East operates Saint Michael's Medical Center. Columbus Hospital LTACH is a longterm acute care hospital designed to focus on patients with serious and complex medical conditions that require intense specialized treatment for an extended period of recovery time.[346] Hospitals which have been closed in recent years include the Saint James Hospital, Mount Carmel Guild Hospital and the United Hospitals Medical Center.[347][348][349]\n\nPublic safety [ edit ]\n\nEmergency Medical Services [ edit ]\n\nUniversity Hospital EMS (UH-EMS) operates the EMS system for the city. The department operates a fleet of six BLS units staffed with two EMTs 24/7, supplemented by four 12-hour \"power\" trucks (operated during peak demand time hours), five ALS units staffed with two paramedics (one of which is stationed at Newark International Airport and covers the airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth), and a critical care unit staffed by a paramedic and an RN. With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck in the country, known as University EMS Rescue 1. The EMS system is the busiest system per unit in the nation. On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20–25 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar, with one of the two NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one flight nurse and a flight medic around the clock. The EMS system in Newark handles upwards of 125,000 requests for service annually.[350]\n\nFire Department [ edit ]\n\nFormer Engine 8 firehouse in the Ironbound neighborhood\n\nThe city is protected by more than 700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Department (NFD). Founded in 1863, the NFD operates out of 16 firehouses throughout the city that are organized into 4 battalions (Battalions 1,3,4, and 5), under the command of a deputy chief/tour commander. There is also a Safety Battalion Chief, Battalion 2, and a Special Operations Battalion Chief, Battalion 6, on duty 24/7. The NFD operates 16 engine companies, 8 ladder companies, 1 rescue company, an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Collapse Rescue Unit (Rescue 2), a USAR Collapse Rescue Shoring Unit, 2 fire boats, a scuba diving unit, a mobile medical ambulance bus, an air cascade unit, a foam unit, a quick attack response vehicle (QRV 1), a mobile command unit, 3 HazMat units, and numerous special, support, and reserve units. The NFD responds to approximately 45,000 emergency calls annually. In 2006, the NFD responded to 2,681 fire and hazardous condition calls.[351] The department is a member of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which is composed of nine North Jersey fire departments.[352]\n\nLaw enforcement [ edit ]\n\nThe Newark Police Department is a city-operated law enforcement agency. As of January 2014, the force had 1,006 officers in its ranks.[353]\n\nThe Essex County Sheriff's Office, New Jersey Transit Police Department (headquartered in Penn Plaza East) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department are also within their jurisdiction in the city, as are the New Jersey State Police. In April 2014, it was announced that the State Police would play a more prominent role in patrolling the streets of the city under the \"TIDE-TAG\" program.[354] The Essex County College Police Department,[355] New Jersey Institute of Technology Police Department[356] and Rutgers University Police Department[357] patrol their respective college campuses in the city. Conrail and Amtrak Police patrol their respective rail yards and property.\n\nCrime [ edit ]\n\nIn 1996, Money magazine ranked Newark \"The Most Dangerous City in the Nation.\"[358] By 2007, the city recorded a total of 99 homicides for the year, representing a significant drop from the record of 161 murders set in 1981.[359][360][361][362] The number of murders in 2008 dropped to 65, a decline of 30% from the previous year and the lowest in the city since 2002 when there were also 65 murders.[363]\n\nIn 2010, Newark recorded 90 homicides.[364] March 2010 was the first calendar month since 1966 in which the city did not record a homicide.[365] Overall, there was a 6% increase in crime numbers over the previous year, including a rise in carjackings for the third straight year, with the 337 incidents raising concerns that the city was returning to its status as the \"car theft capital of the world\".[366] Along with the increase in crime, the Newark Police Department increased its recovery of illegally owned guns in 2011 to 696, up from 278 in 2010.[367] The Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded 94 homicides in 2011 and 95 in 2012.[368] In 2012 CNNMoney ranked Newark as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States, based on numbers by FBI Crime in the United States 2011 report.[369] The city had 10 murders in 10 days during the period ending September 6, 2013, a statistic largely attributed to the reduction of the police force.[370][371] In 2013 Newark recorded 111 homicides, the first year ending in triple digits in seven years[372] and the highest tally since 1990, accounting for 27% of all murders statewide.[373] In 2014, the total number of homicides in Newark was 93,[374] while Essex County as a whole had 117 murders.[375] The Star-Ledger reported that there were 105 homicides in the city in 2015.[376] The city had 72 homicides in 2017, a statistic described as a \"historic low\",[377] and a sharp drop from the 96 murders recorded in the city in 2016.[378]\n\nInternational relations [ edit ]\n\nThe Consulate-General of Ecuador in New Jersey is at 400 Market Street.[379] The Consulate-General of Portugal in Newark is at the main floor of the Newark Legal Center at One Riverfront Plaza.[380] The Consulate-General of Colombia is at 550 Broad Street.[381] The Vice Consulate of Italy was at 1 Gateway Center, until it was closed in 2014 for economic reasons.[382][383][384]\n\nPope John Paul II visited the city in 1995, at which time he elevated the city's cathedral to a basilica to become the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart.[385] In 2011, the Dalai Lama was guest of honor at the Newark Peace Education Summit.[386]\n\nTwin towns—sister cities [ edit ]\n\nNewark has 16 sister cities, as listed by Sister Cities International:[387]\n\nNotable people [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]",

  "latent_30071": "They have only themselves to blame. Protests were always likely at any official sendoff for the most socially destructive prime minister in modern British history. But by turning Margaret Thatcher's funeral into a state-funded Tory jamboree, puffed up with pomp and bombast, David Cameron and his acolytes have made them a certainty – and fuelled a political backlash into the bargain.\n\nAs the bishop of Grantham, Thatcher's home town, put it, spending £10m of public money to \"glorify\" her legacy in the month benefits are slashed and tax cuts handed to the rich is \"asking for trouble\". What's planned today isn't a national commemoration, but a military-backed party spectacle.\n\nIt's a state funeral in all but name, laid on for none of the last seven prime ministers. Nothing of the kind has been seen since the death of Winston Churchill, who really did unite the country for a time against the mortal threat from Nazi Germany. Thatcher did the opposite, of course, though every effort will be made today to milk her short but bloody colonial conflict in the south Atlantic for all its jingoistic worth.\n\nIt's hardly a surprise that 60% of the population oppose the public subsidy, or that Buckingham Palace is alarmed at the funeral's regal dimensions. Now the decision to silence Big Ben has tipped the whole saga into the realm of offensive absurdity.\n\nThere's been much talk about a need for dignity and respect. But the prospect of the leader of a class war government being treated like a respected head of state is itself an insult to the half of Britain that recoils from her memory and the millions of people whose communities were devastated by her policies.\n\nFrom the moment the former prime minister died there has been a determined drive by the Tories and their media allies to rewrite history and rehabilitate a deeply damaged brand. For a few days of fawning wall-to-wall coverage it seemed like that might be working, as happened in the US after Ronald Reagan's death in 2004.\n\nBut a week on, it's clear the revisionists have overplayed their hand. Anger and revulsion keep bursting into the open. Simply raising her record reminds people of the price paid for unrelenting deregulation, privatisation and tax handouts to the rich; why she was so unpopular across Britain when she was in power; and the striking similarity with what's being done by today's Tory-led coalition.\n\nSo there's been no polling bounce for Cameron, even as he claimed that Thatcher \"saved our country\". And while people recognise her strength, polls show clear opposition to many of her flagship policies, including privatisation (only a quarter think it's delivered a better service). Most don't believe she \"put the 'Great' back into Great Britain\" at all, her economic policies are seen to have done \"more harm than good\", and her legacy is regarded as one of division and inequality.\n\nWhich is what the facts show. Far from saving Britain, Thatcher's government delivered rampant inequality, social breakdown, disastrous financial deregulation, pulverising deindustrialisation and mass unemployment. A North Sea oil bonanza was frittered away on tax cuts for the wealthy and a swollen benefits bill as public services were run down, child poverty escalated and social mobility ground to a halt.\n\nBut for all that, her apologists insist, Thatcher did what was necessary to turn Britain's economy round. But she didn't. Growth during the 1980s, at 2.4%, was exactly the same as during the turbulent 1970s and lower again in the post-Thatcher 1990s, at 2.2% — while in the corporatist 1960s it averaged over 3%.\n\nAnd despite claims of a Thatcher \"productivity miracle\", productivity growth was also higher in the 60s (and it's gone into reverse under Cameron). What her government did do was redistribute growth from the poor to the rich, driving up profits and slashing employees' share of national income through her assault on trade unions. That's why it felt like a boom in better-off Britain, as the top rate of tax was more than halved, while real incomes fell for the poorest 40% in her first decade in power.\n\nYou only have to rehearse what Thatcher's government unleashed a generation ago to recognise the continuity with what's been happening ever since: first under John Major, then under New Labour, and now under Cameron: privatisation, liberalisation, low taxes for the wealthy and rising inequality. Thatcher was Britain's first woman prime minister, but her policies hit women hardest, just as Cameron's are doing today, while Tony Blair says he saw his job as \"to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them\".\n\nBut Thatcherism was only an early variant (following her friend General Pinochet, the Chilean dictator) of what became the neoliberal capitalism adopted or imposed across the world for the next generation. And it's that model which imploded in the crash of 2008. As even the free-market Economist conceded last week, while demanding \"more Thatcherism, not less\", her reforms could be said to have \"sowed the seeds\" of the current crisis.\n\nLike other true believers, the magazine's editors fret that the pendulum is now swinging away from the neoliberal model. So does Blair, who remains locked in the politics of the boom years and whose comfort zone remains attacking his own party. So he's launched a coded assault on Labour's leader, Ed Miliband, for supposedly thinking a crisis caused by under-regulated markets will lead to a shift to the left.\n\nThere's certainly no automatic basis for such a shift. As history shows, the right can also take advantage of economic breakdowns – and often has. But more than 20 years after Thatcher was forced out of office, the evidence is that most British people remain stubbornly resistant to her individualistic small-state philosophy, believing for example that it's the government's job to redistribute income across the spectrum and guarantee a decent minimum income for all.\n\nAnd crucially, the economic model that underpinned the policies of Thatcher and her successors is broken. As the Labour frontbencher Jon Trickett argued this week, we need a \"rupture\" with the \"existing economic settlement\" – the Thatcher settlement. That's the challenge of the politics of our time, not only in Britain. As we remember blighted lives and communities today, it's time not just to bury Thatcher, but Thatcherism itself.\n\nTwitter: @SeumasMilne\n\n• The article was amended on 17 April.

  "latent_30294": "LONDON—Lleyton Hewitt couldn’t have come up with a more appropriate shot to close out his quarterfinal win over Juan Martin del Potro today. Behind a skimming slice approach, the 32-year-old father of three moved in and knocked off what looked like the simplest of volleys. The ball came high to his forehand, and he did little more than put his racquet up and block it down the line. Del Potro had expected Hewitt to go cross-court, and like so many players on this slippery surface before him, he had no chance to reverse course once he’d been wrong-footed. Hewitt’s shot may have been simple, but it was also the intelligent choice of a longtime grass-court lover and expert.\n\nI mention this shot not, primarily, to praise Rusty, though Friday was one of the finest of this four-time Queen’s champ’s periodic returns to glory. Instead, I mention his winning volley in order to praise the surface that Hewitt loves so much, and the subtle style of tennis that it can inspire, and require. Today’s performances by Hewitt and his fellow surprise semifinalist here, Marin Cilic, were enough to make me mourn the lost civilization of grass all over again.\n\nHewitt’s last winner could be described as a “control shot,” which is something we don’t see much of in tennis these days. At least we didn’t see many of them through the clay season that occupied us all spring. On dirt there are offensive, defensive, and touch shots; for the most part, all of them are hit with as much spin and racquet-head speed as possible. So this week it has come as a surprise to see the men at Queen’s mixing in balls that aren’t hit with maximum spin or speed or power. Grass gives you less time, and less predictability, than other surfaces; while its quality has improved over the years, you still never know when a ball will flat line, jump straight at you, or die in the weeds. If clay is exhausting from a stamina perspective, grass is draining from a watching-the-ball perspective. Especially on a windy day like today, you have to work a little harder to make contact in the right spot.\n\nYesterday on a swirling Court 2, Alexandr Dolgopolov, who has one of the most elaborate forehands of anyone, cried out in frustration that he had no idea where the ball was going to go next—his contact point could be anywhere on any given shot. In these cases a simple block, with nothing fancy on it, no extra spin or pace or grand ambitions, is often the smartest play. With the right placement, the grass can do the rest. These shots mostly go unnoticed on TV, but I’ve enjoyed seeing them up close at Queen’s. Even Dolgo adjusted and had success with simple slices and blocks down the middle of the court—until he imploded all over again because of an overrule.\n\nToday it was Cilic and Hewitt who let the court help them the most. Cilic’s quarterfinal with Tomas Berdych was textbook modern grass tennis. It was played from the baseline, but with preemptive aggression. These two tall-ballers—each is 6’5” and not known for his speed—took the earliest openings possible. Depth was rewarded and anything short was punished. Serves didn’t need to clip the line to earn a free point; a nice, biting slice out wide in the deuce court was typically good enough. Cilic’s ground strokes, which often hang dully at mid-court, sped through instead. His finest moment, like Hewitt’s, came at the net. Late in the second set, Cilic held serve by approaching down the line and blocking a backhand volley down the line. It didn’t have much pace, and it didn’t cross the service line. Yet Berdych, despite some fine flailing and scrambling, couldn’t catch up to it. There was a pleasure in watching Cilic do exactly what was necessary and nothing more, a pleasure at least equivalent to watching another player win a point with a 100-M.P.H. forehand. Used properly, grass rewards restraint.\n\nIn this, as in other ways, it feels like a lost way of tennis life. There was a time when the modern game appeared to have passed grass by, but things have come full circle in the last decade. The sport is now at its most varied and dynamic when its played on a quick, slippery, easily torn lawn, a boutique surface used for just one month each season.\n\nIt’s a lost civilization that deserves to be revived and expanded, but if anything, my trip to Queen’s has made that harder for me to imagine. When Wimbledon announced last year that it was moving back a week starting in 2015, it had seemed possible that a Masters event on grass could be squeezed in after the French Open. Unfortunately, one of the few ready made locations for it would be Queen’s, but it’s difficult to see a venue this cramped, as charming as it is, handling an event that size.\n\nTennis, I’m afraid, will never get its Camden Yards, the retro stadium in Baltimore that gave baseball a visible and emotional link to its past, and whose sold-out crowds quickly inspired every city with a team to imitate it. Grass-court tennis doesn’t have to be a one-month nostalgia trip. The simple pleasure of a Lleyton Hewitt volley, and victory, proved it again today. Rust, and grass, never really get old.\n\n******\n\nSpeaking of lost civilizations, I saw and heard another from my press seats in the stadium today. A few yards away, as Hewitt and del Potro ran each other around through the late afternoon, lunch was in full swing in the Queen's Club's dining room. This being the first sunny day here in some time, the festivities naturally spilled outdoors and into the stands in front of me. Pitchers of cocktails appeared and were passed from row to row and member to member. A young lady took her shoes off and let her hair down. The laughter grew louder all around. A woman to my left, watching del Potro chase down a Hewitt lob, told her husband with a giggle that he “looked like a blind giraffe.” In these quarters, this is what’s known as getting rowdy.\n\nSoon, though, as 4:00 P.M. drew near, the laughter turned to a low hum of impatience. Hewitt and del Potro appeared to have worn out their welcome among a club member of two—after all, Andy Murray was supposed to be on now, right? As the second set drew to a close, another woman, to my right this time, said, “Oh, good, it’s almost time for tea.”\n\nHer husband looked at her and smiled. “Well, there is one more set to go.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“It’s two out of three sets.”\n\n“Not for me, it isn’t. It’s time for tea.” A few seconds after del Potro had won the second set, she was up and bustling her way toward the club’s café.\n\nFor much of this match, four well-dressed, middle-aged men sat in front of me, sipping cocktails and bantering in a way that sounded highly urbane to my American ears. I assumed they were Queen’s members, and began to imagine their lives, their expensive cars and ski trips and...I don’t know what I imagined they did exactly, but I knew it had to be tremendous, and enviable. Why couldn't I have a life like that?\n\nSo it was with a good deal of surprise that, midway the third set, I watched as an usher walked up to their row and informed them that they had to leave. A short argument ensued, before the usher said, firmly, “I’m asking you to leave. Can I see your tickets?”\n\n“We don’t have any,” one of the men blurted as they stood up to go. They had, from what I could tell, snuck in. It was the best thing I saw all day.\n\n*****\n\nCilic Photo: Anita Aguilar",
  "latent_30318": "Australians Adopt Energy Storage To Offset Declining Solar FITs\n\nOctober 4th, 2016 by Sponsored Content\n\nAustralians are no longer able to count on revenue generated from excess solar energy feeding into the grid, so they are turning to energy storage solutions to keep excess energy for themselves.\n\nFalling by the wayside, Australia’s household solar feed-in tariff (FIT) schemes have entered their first wave of drastic reductions as around 63,000 households in South Australia feel the first pinch. [Disclosure: This is a sponsored post from Australian Solar Quotes.]\n\nBy the end of 2016, over 275,000 solar homeowners in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales will see their solar feed-in tariffs dropping by as much as 90 percent.\n\nDeclining FITs are Promoting Demand for Energy Storage\n\nIn September, South Australia’s FIT fell from AU$0.16/kWh to a minimum required payment of AU$0.068/kWh. Also by the new year, 67,000 solar homes in Victoria will see tariffs and net metering programs falling from AU$0.25/kWh to AU$0.05/kWh.\n\nThe biggest drop will hit around 146,000 solar customers in New South Wales. On 1 January 2017, current FITs from AU$0.60 to AU$0.20/kWh in New South Wales will fall to between AU$0.055 and AU$0.072.\n\nAustralian Solar Quotes (ASQ) CEO Darryn Van Hout notes that the previously generous FITs enabled many solar consumers to learn the basics of solar energy and PV technology. Scrapping the tariffs, says Darryn, has further promoted demand for energy storage systems.\n\n“It’s definitely a trigger point for most consumers to look at this new technology,” says Van Hout. ASQ reports that it has seen “an increase in demand for quotes for storage batteries from buyers looking to save thousands of dollars on their bills, with the Australian market seeing around 300 homes come together to buy storage batteries at discounted rates.”\n\nVan Hout adds, “many of the customers approaching ASQ have been solar customers coming off the New South Wales solar bonus scheme.”\n\nAustralia’s Greens Push Energy Storage Incentives\n\nAlthough FIT policies are in broad decline, government support for energy storage systems are rapidly becoming popular around the globe.\n\nCalifornia is offering consumer rebates for energy storage installations, and the state’s three largest investor-owned utilities are complying with a new policy requiring 1.3GW of battery storage to be installed by 2020. New York also has a generous energy storage rebate scheme.\n\nIn Japan, two-thirds of the cost of an energy storage system may be covered, and Germany is providing low or fixed-rate financing for 30 percent of an initial investment in battery storage.\n\nIn Australia, the Adelaide City Council offers energy storage system rebates of AU$5,000 to homeowners, and an AU$25 million program was recently announced to support energy storage for 5,000 homes.\n\nTaking a new legislative lead in Australia, the Australian Greens Party has announced an initiative to introduce a 50 percent refundable tax credit to assist individuals with the cost of home solar energy storage systems. Available regardless of income, the credit will be capped at AU$5,000 in the 2016-17 financial, declining to AU$1,500 by 1 July 2020.\n\nThe Greens’ “Powering Up Battery Storage” policy will also offer a Low Income Solar Storage (LISS) grant administered by Australia’s Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Available to an annual maximum of 20,000 households with an adjusted taxable income below AU$80,000, the LISS grant is expected to cover half of the total cost of an energy system. However, the grant will be capped at AU$5,000 in the 2016-17 financial year, gradually declining to AU$1,000 by 1 July 2020.\n\nUp to 30,000 businesses also stand to benefit from the Greens’ policy, as depreciation terms for commercial battery system assets will be reduced from 15 years to 3 years.\n\nPaid for by “redirecting money from some fossil fuel tax breaks,” the Greens estimate that their incentive will support an estimated 1.2 million energy storage installations, with an average capacity of 10 kWh each.\n\n“Increased take up of battery storage,” states the Greens, “will help drive down pollution and support the Greens goal of shifting Australia to 90% renewables by 2030.”\n\nOptimising Solar Self-Sufficiency\n\nWhile homeowners are transitioning to energy storage systems, a few other immediate cost-savings measures are advised to help offset lost FIT revenue. These include switching to a smart meter and optimising the solar electricity produced by home solar installations. Australians are optimising their solar use by replacing gas-burning appliances with electric models, especially hot water heaters and space heaters.\n\nHowever, adding a battery to an existing solar system can significantly enhance solar self-sufficiency, says Van Hout. Self-sufficiency is a measure of how much solar a homeowner is using, as opposed to drawing power from the grid. Van Hout notes, “With the right battery size you can improve it from 20% to nearly 60 or 70% self-sufficiency.”\n\nBy reducing electricity drawn from the grid, battery storage gives energy consumers more independence, allowing them to use more of the energy they produce from their solar installations. Energy storage also helps significantly stabilize network variability by reducing electricity peaks and troughs. Storing power during off-peak times allows discharging during peaks, which in turn helps drive down electricity prices because ramp rates are better regulated.\n\nDeveloped by the Clean Energy Council, the Australian Energy Storage Roadmap offers help for homeowners learning about this exciting new technology.\n\nThe Clean Energy Council expects battery storage to create sweeping changes as it becomes a mainstream consumer technology. It envisions, “New and innovative business models similar to mobile phone plans will help to put storage technology in more households, in some cases without the need to fund the upfront purchase cost.”\n\nFIT Reductions in the Bigger Picture of the Renewable Energy Revolution\n\nTeaming up with solar panel installers and retailers throughout the country, Australian Solar Quotes offers in-depth, up-to-date research on renewable energy industry news, as well as a national solar directory filled with independent reviews, products, services, and locations of solar providers throughout Australia.\n\n“Our dedicated team,” states ASQ, “strives to make the process of buying a solar power system as smooth sailing as possible whilst offering assistance and advice every step of the way.”\n\nAs a company who is closely monitoring the transition to solar installations with energy storage solutions, ASQ is excited about the booming solar PV revolution in Australia.\n\nSeeing challenges ahead for Australian homeowners and businesses adopting energy storage strategies, ASQ CEO Darryn Van Hout is optimistic.\n\n“Despite consumer concern around FIT reductions, the bigger picture of the renewable energy revolution promises a lot for the Australian energy industry,” says Darryn. “As technology becomes increasingly efficient, the more renewables will begin to dominate the market.”\n\nThe post has been generously supported by Australian Solar Quotes.",

  "latent_30674": "Justice League ran from 2001 to 2004 and gave the world 52 glorious episodes. And you know what? They hold up! Seeing as John Stewart was a recent character of the month, we thought that was the perfect excuse to watch the animated show's two seasons all over again. After all, the show created countless John Stewart fans. The cosmic hero gets a whole lot of love in the series and he has some standout moments in episodes like \"War World,\" \"Legends,\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" but we're going to highlight what we consider to be the dude's must watch episodes. If your favorite one isn't below, go ahead and give it some love in the comments.\n\nSecret Origins: Part 2 (Season 1, Episode 2)\n\n\"Who's the rookie in the tiara?\"\n\nJohn Stewart makes an awesome first appearance in this animated world. I mean, it doesn't get much better than saving Batman and Martian Manhunter during your big debut, right? After that, he goes on to save Wonder Woman, Hawkgirl, and Flash. Not shabby, yeah? The team would be in major trouble if he wasn't there to shield them from danger. Sure, Flash later returns the favor and needs to save G.L., but hey, no one's perfect. It's not the most emotional and compelling debut around, but it sure is awesome and he steps up to organize the team.\n\nIn the Blackest Night (Season 1, Episodes 4 & 5)\n\n\"We solved our lawyer problem a long time ago.\"\n\nThese two sci-fi heavy episodes take us into all of the surreal things going on out in the universe and these events show us just how strong John's character really is. When faced with a serious criminal charge and the punishment is the death penalty, many people would do everything they could to avoid that fate. John, though? He legitimately believes he's done something wrong and will accept whatever punishment is sent his way. He doesn't beg to find another way out of it; he doesn't lie in an attempt to save himself. He stands tall and is willing to accept whatever happens. That takes courage.\n\nBefore we go into space court (totally not what it's called, but you get what I mean), the sci-fi heavy-story gives us some really strong scenes back on our little planet. John possesses great power -- power which can be used to save the planet -- but he doesn't let that get to his head. He uses what he has to stop a simple robbery and spends some time back where he grew up. (Seeing a kid admire him and want the same haircut is adorable.) Then, we get some craziness as Manhunters get into an explosive brawl with Johns' allies. It's a fun dose of character and action before leaping into the bigger picture that'll take place out in the cosmos. And, of course, it concludes with a massive action sequence, one which gives Stewart plenty of room to shine and he saves Flash not once, but twice! Plus, seeing Hawkgirl stand up for John and get into a brawl with his fellow Green Lanterns was a blast and a little nod to the close relationship those two will soon have. If you know where their story takes them, it's pretty heartwarming to see she's already fighting for him. I mean, odds are she'd do the same for any of her teammates, but this path leads somewhere far more moving.\n\nHearts and Minds (Season 2, Episodes 9 & 10)\n\n\"You sound like an old married couple.\"\n\nThe introduction of Despero generates a story that gives us yet another look at the Green Lantern Corps while also teasing the tension between Hawkgirl and Stewart. The introduction of Katma gives us a little more insight into Stewart's history and really pushes him as he's left unable to use his ring. The history between them is most definitely noticed by Hawkgirl, but instead of playing the blatantly obvious and cringeworthy jealousy card, Hawkgirl helps motivate John when he needs it the most. And, even though it's not intentional, she once again motivates him when she's in danger and only he has the power to save her. One thing is clear: they make each other stronger. As always, there's plenty of fun action in here, especially towards the end, and no one will ever forget the \"love tap\" Hawkgirl gave John after their talk. And who doesn't love a Flash and Kilowog team-up? Their investigation of Stewart's apartment is priceless.\n\nWild Cards (Season 2, Episodes 21 & 22)\n\n\"Is it just me or is there something going on between those two?\"\n\nThere's plenty of reasons to love these two episodes. From Mark Hamill's delightfully twisted Joker to all of the mayhem with the Royal Flush Gang, \"Wild Cards\" is a really, really entertaining storyline. If you've seen \"Epilogue,\" then odds are you'll find the focus on Ace to be especially powerful. But all of those reasons begin to fade away as the story reaches its final minutes. That's when things get gripping, emotional, and hugely rewarding. After all of the Han and Leia-ish banter between John and Hawkgirl, the two finally have a beautiful heart-to-heart conversation. It's only fitting the background is gorgeous as these two stop playing around and finally express how they really feel. All concerns that superheroes usually have about relationships are swiftly cast aside and their passion for each other takes over. After so much buildup, these two have their first kiss and it's a wonderful scene.\n\nComfort and Joy (Season 2, Episode 23)\n\n\"Feeling more festive?\"\n\nWith so many episodes featuring big threats and dire situations, having an episode that's forced purely on fun character dynamics and heartwarming moments is amazingly refreshing. The subplots with Flash and Martian Manhunter are touching and well-written, but this episode is the perfect way to focus on John and Hawkgirl's brand new relationship. They come from different worlds and have totally different interests, but that doesn't stop them from doing what they can to make the other happy. They try their hardest to embrace what the other person loves and the result is two funny, joyous and humanizing scenes. It's an episode that'll put a smile on your face. Honestly, who doesn't want to see a superhero snowball fight?\n\nStarcrossed (Season 2, Episodes 24-26)\n\n\"You can kiss my ax.\"\n\nThis 3-episode story arc is the perfect way to end Justice League. It's a huge adventure with high stakes and it gives each character a satisfying amount of the spotlight. But best of all? Hawkgirl and John Stewart's relationship is right in the middle of this epic finale. We won't spoil how it concludes (some people out there are still catching up!), but having Hawkgirl reveal she's a spy and in a relationship with another guy (Hro Talak) was a real jaw-dropper. The story pushes the connection Hawkgirl and John have built and it all ends with an incredibly captivating conversation. Emotional, full of twists, and packed with thrilling action, \"Starcrossed\" isn't just a must watch for John Stewart fans; it's a must watch for all DC fans.\n\nWhat's your favorite John Stewart episode of Justice League? If this article does well, we might highlight his best Justice League Unlimited episodes, too!",
  "latent_30847": "“Total Policing” and the criminalisation of dissent\n\n12 November 2011\n\nThe scale of the police operation mounted Wednesday against a relatively small and entirely peaceful protest against UK education cuts shows that the ruling elite is no longer prepared to tolerate any form of political and social opposition.\n\nIf one accepts the police estimate of the size of the protest, the deployment of 4,000 officers, many in full riot gear, represents a police officer to protester ratio of one-to-one. If a more accurate figure of 8,000 is accepted, then the ratio is still one-to-two.\n\nNew Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe described the protest as a test of his policy of “Total Policing.” This is what it looked like: London was placed on virtual lock-down, with all major roads along the march’s route blocked off by ranks of police, riot vans, mounted officers and ten-foot-high barricades.\n\nMarchers were met at the rail, underground and coach stations and handed an 11-page brochure, with the capitalised title “TOTAL POLICING” on the front and back. It warned that police would use section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 to search people and enforce the removal of masks.\n\nThe march was dragooned by ranks of police at the front, back and both sides along the three-mile route. Helicopters circled overhead, making extensive videos of those taking part.\n\nIn a further provocation, the march was stopped every ten metres, meaning that a three-mile route took three hours to walk. This periodic kettling enabled the police to go into the crowd at certain points, pushing and barging people in the hope of provoking a reaction.\n\nA statement issued on the day warned that the planned rally at the London Wall had to end in less than an hour and the area had to be completely cleared in two hours. An attempt to set up a tent camp in Trafalgar Square, in solidarity with the Occupy protest at St Paul’s Cathedral, was cleared in minutes as police dragged away those involved.\n\nThe effort by a group of electricians—striking against management threats to cut their wages by up to 35 percent—to join up with the student protest was similarly met with police violence. The electricians’ march was encircled so they were virtually imprisoned. When some tried to break away, riot police waded in with batons and knocked workers to the ground. Police were reportedly armed with stun grenades. Names and addresses were taken under the authority of Section 60 of the Public Order Act.\n\nBefore the march, the commander in charge, Simon Pountain, told a press conference that the use of water cannon was not planned, but plastic bullets had been authorised—the first time ever in England.\n\nOver 450 letters were sent out warning anyone arrested in connection with previous public order offences that a repeat offence would lead to arrest and trial “at the earliest opportunity.” Many of these letters were sent to people with no previous convictions, pointing to the existence of a police database of those whose sole “crime” was to have engaged in a previous protest.\n\nIn an article reprinted in the Police Oracle, the Guardian’s crime correspondent blithely described the pre-authorisation of baton rounds and the sending of threatening letters as nothing new. “What is new,” she said, was the decision by Pountain to make this public.\n\nAuthorisation for baton rounds was given during the summer rioting in Britain’s cities, she said, and “perhaps less well known… they were also authorised for use during the student demonstration against cuts a year ago.”\n\nThe police are also to be given additional powers, she noted, by Home Secretary Theresa May, whereby a “police superintendent will be able to clear the public out of a specific area during a demonstration—a power not available since the Riot Act was removed from the statute book in 1973.”\n\nLast October’s student protest saw over 150 arrests, both during and after the event. This summer’s riots—provoked by the police killing of an unarmed man—were followed by over 4,000 arrests and over 2,000 prosecutions, with long custodial sentences handed out for the most trivial offences.\n\nA similar picture is repeated internationally. Wherever workers and young people seek to protest the imposition of savage austerity cuts, they are met with brutal repression.\n\nIn Greece, for example, the October 20 general strike protest was attacked by 15,000 riot police and Syntagma Square was flooded with tear gas. In the United States, the Occupy Wall Street protests spread nationally after two weeks in large measure in response to the October 1 arrest of 700 protesters—almost one-third—of those demonstrating on the Brooklyn Bridge. Since then, various local police forces have mounted attacks using riot gear, tear gas and other weapons, bringing the national total of those arrested to over 3,000.\n\nThe resort to repressive measures is a measure of the extreme polarisation between the classes.\n\nIn Britain, the Riot Act now being cited was originally drafted in 1714, making rioting punishable by death. This was reduced to transportation for life in 1837.\n\nIts most famous usage was in the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, in Manchester, when a cavalry charge against 80,000 protesters demanding parliamentary reform and relief from crushing economic hardship killed 15 and injured 700.\n\nIn Glasgow, on Black Friday 1919, riot police and 10,000 troops were despatched against workers campaigning for shorter work hours. Black Friday took place in the aftermath of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, at a time when Britain’s elite feared a “Bolshevist uprising.” The fact that similar powers are being enacted today, first covertly and now amid official fanfare, should be a warning to the working class in Britain, Europe and internationally.\n\nToday, a fabulously wealthy oligarchy dictates all aspects of social life in pursuit of ever-greater personal enrichment. Under conditions of worsening economic crisis, this translates into demands for cuts and austerity for millions, for which there is no possibility of securing a democratic mandate.\n\nThis determines the moves by bourgeois governments around the world to enact measures characteristic of a police state and, in Greece, the threat of a military coup.\n\nThe response of workers and young people must be the building of a mass socialist movement and the adoption of a revolutionary perspective for a truly democratic and egalitarian society, based on the expropriation of the oligarchy and the organization of production to meet the social rights of all to education, health care, housing and a well-paid job.\n\nChris Marsden\n\nChris Marsden",
  "latent_30976": "In September 2016, candidate Donald Trump announced his intention to appoint Myron Ebell to lead his administration’s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. Ebell currently serves as the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the libertarian think tank the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He also chairs an initiative named the Cooler Heads Coalition, which, according to Ebell’s official bio:\n\n…comprises over two dozen non-profit groups in this country and abroad that question global warming alarmism and oppose energy rationing policies.\n\nEbell openly declares himself to be a climate change skeptic who disputes the severity of human activity on Earth’s climate. On this point, Ebell has been extremely consistent: He argues that anthropogenic global warming, if it happens at all, is a minor issue that has been usurped by liberals to expand the federal government. He has stated in many different venues that he intends to dismantle the scientific consensus around anthropogenic global warming, as discussed in this October 23 2012 interview with PBS Frontline’s John Hockenberry:\n\nEBELL: […] What we’re fighting is the expansion of government. And there are many pretexts for expanding government.\n\nHOCKENBERRY: Opposing government action on climate change to defend American freedom is a perfect fit.\n\nEBELL: We felt that if you concede the science is settled and that there’s a consensus, you cannot— the moral high ground has been ceded to the alarmists.\n\nHOCKENBERRY: So you had to go to work and break down this consensus.\n\nEBELL: Yes. And we did it because we believed that the consensus was phony. We believed that the so-called global warming consensus was not based on science, but was a political consensus, which included a number of scientists.\n\nEbell, as noted in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, is often contacted by journalists for sound bites representing the opposing view to scientific, peer reviewed studies despite the fact that Ebell is not actually a scientist: He holds an M.S degree in economics from the London School of Economics. His scientific view on global warming was well summarized in that 2007 article:\n\n“There has been a little bit of warming,” as he puts it, “but it’s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it’s caused by human beings or not, it’s nothing to worry about.”\n\nIn fact, Ebell might see it as something to look forward to, an idea he floated in a September 28 2011 CEI blog post:\n\nComplementing the weak scientific case for alarm, many people have realised that warmer climates are more pleasant and healthier. That’s why Americans move to Phoenix or Florida when they retire. If global warming theory turns out to be correct and winters become milder, then they may not be so eager to move from Michigan or New York.\n\nA September 2016 article in Scientific American suggests that his appointment heralds big, divisive changes to to the EPA:\n\nEbell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm. His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell’s role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama’s climate rules.\n\nThe great irony of his appointment to lead the EPA transition is that he is lukewarm on the existence of the EPA in the first place. In fact, he once described Newt Gingrich’s suggestion to abolish the EPA as “bold and visionary.”",

The window will be called the Window of Delicious Opportunity, or WODO, and Chef Brian will serve three choices from a list of regular rotating options:\n\nPotato and egg\n\nHouse-made chorizo and egg\n\nSpiced bacon and egg\n\nBean and queso\n\nBarbacoa\n\nRiggenbach and Corona discovered the lack of wee-hour grab-and-go dining options when they first started to visit Nashville in preparation for their restaurant concept, and they came up with the idea for a taco window during a trip to visit Mikey’s hometown of Corpus Christi. They plan for their tacos to be a take on a South Texas classic, wrapped in a flour tortilla made using a recipe from Mikey’s family.\n\nAfter The Mockingbird gets its bird legs under it, they plan to open the restaurant for all three meals, and breakfast taco options will be added to the window offering. All I can say is I wish this development had been around back in my club-hopping days, when I would party at 12th and Porter until they turned on the overhead shop lights to chase our asses out. Where were you boys back then?!",
  "latent_31826": "Josh Duggar, Mattthew McCarthy -- (CNN, Facebook)\n\nReality star Josh Duggar is unwillingly back in the headlines again after the man whose face he stole for his Ashley Madison profile filed a lawsuit against him for appropriating his image.\n\nSaying he has been the subject of harassment — being called ‘Duggar’s boy toy” since news broke that the Christian TV star used his picture to attract women — photographer Matthew McCarthy filed suit in California, reports TMZ.\n\nDuggar used McCarthy’s image on websites such as Ashley Madison, OKCupid and Twitter while looking for women.\n\nIn an interview with Gawker last year, McCarthy said he first became aware of the image theft when he was contacted by a former high school teacher who said she heard he was involved in a sex scandal.\n\n“A teacher of mine from high school messaged me on Facebook, who I haven’t even seen or talked to in year. And she was like, ‘Hi Matthew, I hope you’re doing well. I think you’re doing well—but I saw some article, and you’re in the news about some sex scandal…’ he explained. “I was just like, ‘No, no, no, no that’s—that’s not me.’ It was so weird—it’s just kind of crazy to have someone I haven’t spoken to in so long message me about it.”\n\nAccording to McCarthy, he comes from a close-knit Catholic family, and being associated with Duggar — who has admitted to molesting several of his sisters, having a porn addiction, and conducting multiple affairs while married — has been “mortifying.”\n\nMcCarthy is suing for wrongful use of his image and asking for damages.",
  "latent_31849": "Benjamin Sebena pleaded not guilty Thursday morning to the Christmas Eve murder of his wife, Wauwatosa Police Officer Jennifer Sebena.\n\nAt his arraignment before Judge David Borowski, Benjamin Sebena again appeared strapped in a wheelchair and wearing a security vest, as he has in every appearance since his arrest and charging. He did not speak; his attorney, Michael Steinle, entered the plea on his behalf.\n\nIn the very brief proceeding, Steinle made no mention at this stage of a possible defense of not guilty by reason of insanity or mental defect.\n\nThe not guilty plea means the case will go to trial, with further proceedings to set a trial date scheduled for March 1.\n\nThe charge against Benjamin Sebena, first-degree intentional homicide by use of a dangerous weapon, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison without possibility of parole.\n\nJennifer Sebena was found dead just outside Wauwatosa Fire Station No. 1 in the Village, shot five times in the head. She had been on the police force for two years, from the top of her class at the MATC Police Academy. She had gone on solo patrol in July and had been assigned to the night shift only about a month before her death.\n\nBenjamin Sebena quickly became a suspect and, after questioning, admitted in a statement to police that he had murdered his wife, the criminal complaint against him said.\n\nThe two guns presumed used to kill Jennifer were found hidden in the ceiling of the couple's basement in their Menomonee Falls home. One was her service weapon, the other a type that uses very rare ammunition. A shell casing of that type was found at the crime scene.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Sebena told police he stalked Jennifer for several days before the crime and waited hours on Christmas Eve to ambush her. His motive, he said, was jealousy.\n\nWauwatosa police officers assigned to the night shift in the Village squad area frequently use the fire station as an auxiliary police station, taking breaks and filing reports there.\n\nBenjamin Sebena, a wounded Marine veteran of the Iraq War, told investigators that when Jennifer came out of the fire station's north door, he stepped up behind her and fired two shots to the back of her head. The medical examiner's report shows that either one of those shots alone would have been instantly incapacitating and almost certainly fatal.\n\nNevertheless, Sebena grabbed his wife's service weapon and shot her three more times in the face. Sebena told police he fired those shots because he did not want his wife to suffer.\n\nThe last contact police dispatchers had with Officer Jen Sebena was at 3:29 a.m. They attempted to contact her again at about 4:30, and when she failed to respond, a search located her body just minutes later.\n\nA car matching Benjamin Sebena's black 2012 Toyota Prius, including its black wheel rims, was seen on DOT and private business video about 3:45 a.m., traveling toward Menomonee Falls.\n\nSebena called the Wauwatosa Police Department at 6:35 a.m. to ask if Jennifer was all right, saying he had heard there had been an incident involving an officer. He was told Jennifer had been in an accident and that he should come to the station as soon as possible. Sebena did not ask what had happened to his wife.\n\nAt the station, when told Jennifer had been killed, a detective sergeant said, Sebena did not ask how she had died.\n\nSebena was questioned at length on Christmas Eve and taken into custody Christmas Day.\n\nOfficer Jennifer Sebena was buried with full honors after a memorial service attended by hundreds of law enforcement officers from across Wisconsin and even from other states.\n\nShe was the first officer to be killed in the line of duty in the 96-year history of the Wauwatosa Police Department.",
  "latent_31894": "Information obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request by the Conquistador Group in Arizona has found that as Secretary Salazar stands before the Statue of Liberty in his white cowboy hat and speaks of the great American experience, he is also presiding over the formal plans to kill 33,000 wild horses and provide stress counseling for the BLM workers who carry out his orders. A quite different American experience.\n\nOver 19 million acres of BLM Wild Horse Territories have been \"zeroed out\" of all wild horses, with several more million acres and hundreds of more horses targeted. The BLM has repeatedly claimed that the wild horses are responsible for the destruction of public lands through overgrazing, yet the impact of the less than 30,000 remaining wild horses on public lands are minimal compared to the approximately 400,000 head of cattle (a conservative estimate, based on the 600 million Animal Unit Months quoted by BLM Wild Horse & Burro Bureau Chief, Don Glen), that are on these same public lands, In addition, the BLM continues to ignore and invert the science behind horse vs cattle grazing and continues to claim horses have a more negative impact on grass conditions, even though cattle, unlike horses, do not have front teeth and actually pull out the grasses by the roots and have a much more adverse effect on range conditions. The ranching industry has long sought to obfuscate the science and the BLM has often been led by those sympathetic if not indeed part of that industry, much like Secretary Salazar, who hails from a ranching family in Colorado and who as a Senator voted to allow downed and diseased animals into the American families’ food supply.\n\nA Viable and Humane Alternative\n\nThe humane slaughter of wild horses, a long-necked flight animal, is a difficult if not impossible task for the BLM’s employees, let alone for slaughterhouses designed and equipped for the slaughter of passive domestic bovines. Unbeknownst to most civilized Americans, the 2004 GAO Report on the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958 indicates slaughterhouses have a difficult enough time humanely slaughtering cows, with pneumatic bolt guns often ineffective in rendering them unconscious, leaving bovines conscious as they are suspended by a single hind leg for their terrifying journey down through the slaughter disassembly line.\n\nA viable and humane alternative to the wholesale slaughter of the wild horses has existed for 20 years. Dartable Porcine Zona Pellucida (PZP) birth control was developed 20 years ago by Dr. Jay Kirkpatrick. The application of PZP to mares would control the birth rate within wild horse herds, with 90% efficacy per the BLM, whereas round-ups and removals actually result in doubling the birth rate through compensatory reproduction,\n\nBLM claims that darting of wild horses is difficult seem preposterous, given the fact that lure trapping and darting have been in use by humans since they inhabited caves. The BLM has acknowledged PZP as a viable alternative through it’s inclusion as an option (mostly unused) in multiple Environmental Assessments, through their statement on the successful application of the 12 month form of PZP on the Assateague wild horses (among others) and through their current BLM policy, as of 7/1/09, on the trial use of the 22 month form of PZP on all wild horse that may be released from a gather.\n\nWith a well thought out management plan in place, utilizing the many available suitable options, the wild horses can be returned to the Wild Horse Territories, as originally intended by the 1971 Free Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act, and save the American taxpayers the more than 39 million dollar per year cost of round-ups and holding pens fees.\n\nAn Obama Administation Legacy?\n\nHorses have fought under our soldiers in wars from the Revolutionary War, for which we celebrate our Independence Day, through World War I. Horses have been instrumental in the settlement of the West, in both the settlement of the Spanish in the Southwest and in the western expansion of the American frontier, as they have pulled the wagons west, plowed our fields wherever we have settled, and yes even drove our cattle. Even as the horse helped western expansion, Native Americans adopted the horse and regarded them as one of their spiritual animals.\n\nWill the mass killing of 33,000 wild horses, a living symbol that embodies the free spirit of the American West, be one of the great legacies of Obama Administration?",
  "latent_32016": "Steve Green was 4 years old when he first encountered the Bible. He remembers sitting in a waiting room at a hospital, looking through a Bible picture book. He grew up in a deeply religious, evangelical family, and so his interest in the Bible only grew from there. His father, David Green, came from a family of preachers, and built his business, the craft giant Hobby Lobby, around that faith. Steve Green credits their $3 billion-plus success story to God, and the good book.\n\nIn 2009, after Steve Green had become Hobby Lobby president, and a few years before Hobby Lobby would win a high-profile Supreme Court case that said family-owned companies didn’t have to pay for contraception, Green began to acquire biblical artifacts. When he started, he explained in a later interview, he was just looking to buy an object or two. But then, he said, “we kept having opportunities being presented, and we just kept buying.” Within a few years, the Greens had amassed some 40,000 biblical artifacts and texts.\n\nBy 2013, in an acceptance speech for the faith-based Templeton Prize, Green was boasting that those artifacts made up the “largest collection in private hands.” In the same speech, he bemoaned that too few Americans today were exposed to the Bible. The nation was “in danger,” he said, “because of its ignorance of what God has taught.”\n\n“If we don’t know it, our future is going to be very scary,” he said. But Green also promised to do his part to change that, by sharing his massive collection of artifacts with the the world.\n\n“Have we ever in history been where we are today? …. There is a need to put the Bible back in a global conversation.” – Cary Summers, president of Museum of the Bible\n\nEarlier this month, federal prosecutors announced that thousands of the Green family’s artifacts, imported by Hobby Lobby, may have been illegally smuggled out of modern-day Iraq. Federal prosecutors said an expert on cultural property law warned Green two months before the purchase that the antiquities may have been looted, but Hobby Lobby moved forward anyway, in a deal the Justice Department now says was “fraught with red flags.” The Greens are paying for it. In a settlement, they agreed to forfeit some 5,500 artifacts, pay a $3 million fine, and adopt stringent internal policies and training for all purchases going forward.\n\nGreen said in a statement that he was “pleased the matter has been resolved.”\n\nBut a number of antiquities experts, papyrologists and biblical scholars and professors say they do not see the matter as over, largely because the Greens are the funders and visionaries behind the $509 million Museum of the Bible. When it opens this November in Washington, D.C., just off the National Mall, it will display thousands of biblical texts and artifacts.\n\nA museum spokeswoman said none of the smuggled artifacts were destined for the museum. But the Museum of the Bible collection is curated from the Greens’ collection and includes items similar to those that were smuggled, including cuneiform tablets.\n\nThis is not the first time the Greens have been scrutinized over the provenance of their artifacts. In 2014, a sharp-eyed papyrologist raised an alarm about another problematic piece in the Green collection — a papyrus fragment that had previously appeared on eBay — after seeing it in a traveling exhibition organized by the Museum of the Bible. (The museum maintains that the item has a clean provenance, stemming back to a U.S.-based university, but it was unable to find photographs of the fragment in university records, and some have since argued it may have violated Egypt’s cultural heritage laws.)\n\nThe question of artifacts aside, the coming Museum of the Bible has been plagued by other controversies, including concerns over its supposed evangelical bent and scholarship, its location, presentation and influence, and a Bible curriculum that pushes the Bible as a literal historical text.\n\nPBS NewsHour recently visited the soon-to-open museum to take a look inside and speak to museum leadership — as well as its critics.\n\nAside from Steve Green, perhaps the most important person behind the Museum of the Bible is Cary Summers, who, like Green, is a successful evangelical businessman, though his experience lies more in the realm of tourist attractions than arts and crafts. Summers was previously CEO and president of Herschend Family Entertainment, which calls itself the country’s largest family-owned theme park operator. Among the attractions he’s helped launch: the Creation Museum in Kentucky, a much-protested museum that subscribes to a literal interpretation of the Bible to explain the world’s origins.\n\nWhen we meet at the Museum of the Bible, which is still under construction, and where Summers holds the title of president, he wears a hard hat and proudly takes me around the museum’s eight levels. One focuses on the impact of the Bible, another its history, and a third on the many stories that have been told around it. The museum is enormous; spanning 430,000 square feet, it will be one of the largest museums in D.C. When it opens, it will showcase about a thousand biblical items at a time, rotating through artifacts from the Green collection as well as the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Vatican and other collections.\n\n“It’s the most controversial topic in the world. It’s the biggest-selling book; most banned, destroyed, influential book … We will irritate everybody.” – Cary Summers, president of Museum of the Bible\n\n“I’m in the industry 40 years, and it bowls me over,” Summers said as we walked from floor to floor, between the sound of hammers and men wheeling in dollies. “But God gave us the inspiration. We just followed his lead.”\n\nIn addition to its exhibitions, the museum will also include three library spaces, an art gallery, a 475-foot theater and a TV studio, from which they will launch four television series. It will host a restaurant called “Manna” from celebrity chef Todd Gray, and a cafe called “Milk and Honey” that will be open even when the museum is not. An eight-room hotel inside the museum will have high security; guests may include visitors from the Vatican. “They’re friends of ours,” Summers said, noting that the museum has also purchased air rights for the roof.\n\nThe museum was designed to be grand from start to finish. Soon after visitors enter through 40-foot bronze doors that depict text from Genesis 1, they will come upon the longest woven tapestry in the United States, which the museum commissioned to show the Bible through time. On an upper artifacts floor, they can peruse fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls, 1st editions of the King James Bible, and a letter written by Martin Luther shortly before his excommunication.\n\nWhen I visit, artisans are busy working in the center of the museum on a life-size replica of the Garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem, where Jesus is said to have slept the night before his crucifixion. Summers said no two trees in the garden will look alike, the stones hand-painted to look as they did in the first century, and that a replica of a Nazareth synagogue where Jesus is believed to have read from the scriptures will also be exact. (Summers told me he had just returned from his 109th trip to Israel, where he helped build the open-air Nazareth Village museum and also has a cottage.)\n\nAlready hanging in that section was an elaborate Trompe-l’œil painting of the tree on Mount Arbel, an area where Jesus was believed to do most of his ministry. “Whatever happened there changed the world forever,” Summers said as he gazed at the painting.\n\nSummers’ theme park background is also clear throughout the museum. Among the planned showpieces are a virtual reality exhibit where visitors can transport into a fresco of the Last Supper; a flying theater ride where visitors can “fly” over Washington and see where biblical texts are held; and a changing electronic mural inside the museum’s theater. (It will open with the musical “Amazing Grace,” which will run most evenings.)\n\nSummers said the museum has four patents pending on their electronics, including for personal tablets that will take museum-goers on personal tours, guided by the voices of Catholic Cardinal Seán O’Malley and evangelical pastor Rick Warren, who has said he does not believe in evolution.\n\nWhen I ask Summers about his consulting gig at the Creation Museum, he at first sought to minimize his involvement, saying he only volunteered his time. But he acknowledged that he helped the museum develop its controversial “Ark Encounter,” which includes a life-size Noah’s ark complete with dinosaurs, and also tried to sell the state of Kentucky on the museum’s merits when secularists tried to shut it down.\n\n“I personally do” support the message of the Creation Museum, he told me. “I believe in creation. God created the world. I disagree on the topic of evolution.”\n\nBut Summers said these and other hot-button topics won’t be addressed at the Museum of the Bible. What will be addressed, he said, is how the Bible can and has served as a moral (even if not literal) guide for how to live. Some of this will be addressed on a lower “impact” floor of the museum, which will show the Bible’s influence on fashion, the government, the prison system, healthcare, music and more. (Think U2 frontman Bono’s “Psalms” album and the Bible’s impact on the founding fathers.)\n\nAs we leave the museum, Summers tells me the timing of the museum’s opening is apt, given the instability in the world right now.\n\n“Horrific actions are being taken against people,” he said. “And the Bible is the oldest book that provides a moral compass. [It’s] 3,000 years old. And it continues to offer insight into what life is about. It’s, ‘Wow: Have we ever in history been where we are today?’ I think there is a need to put the Bible back in a global conversation.”\n\nAccording to a 2014 Pew religious landscape study, about a third of Americans say they read from the Bible about once a week, while nearly half say they seldom or never read it.\n\nBefore I go, Summers leaves me with a paraphrased quote from the Book of Esther, which he said sums up how he feels about being involved in the Museum of the Bible.\n\n“We are,” he said, “called for in such a time as this.”\n\nWhen the Museum of the Bible filed a 501(c)(3) to become a new nonprofit in 2011, it described its mission as “to bring to life the living Word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the Bible.”\n\nThis mission seemed to reflect the personal beliefs of Green, who, in that same 2013 awards speech, described the Bible as a “reliable historical document” that was “true.”\n\nOver time, though, that evangelical message softened. In 2012, a new filing said the museum was being founded to “invite all people to engage with the Bible” through “museum exhibits and scholarly pursuits.”\n\nToday, museum leaders, including Steve Green, say the goal is not to proselytize. Summers reiterated this point when we met, insisting the museum would present the perspectives of different faith traditions (including other Christian faiths and Judaism, though not Islam), and that they would not try to translate or interpret the Bible for visitors.\n\nInstead, he said, he worried they’d get criticized for not proselytizing enough. “Some are disappointed we are not taking a more vigorous approach, being here in Washington,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, 2.3 billion people identified as Christian, making them the world’s largest religious group, according to Pew Research. In the U.S., 70 percent of Americans consider themselves Christian, and roughly a quarter of those people are evangelical.\n\nWhile evangelicals may want more proselytizing, lay Baptists and Catholics have expressed concerns the museum will favor Evangelical Protestant perspectives.\n\n“[The museum] is driven specifically by an evangelical worldview that sees the Bible as inspired by God.” – R. Marie Griffith, director of the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics.\n\nSimilar concerns have been voiced by religion scholars and historians, including R. Marie Griffith, who directs the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nGriffith first got a peek into the museum when one of her doctoral students visited one of the Museum of the Bible traveling exhibits, which, since 2011, have gone to Oklahoma City, Israel, Cuba, the Vatican, and many other places. These previews of the museum have since reached half a million people. If that exhibit is any guide, Griffith said, she’s troubled by the evangelical bent she’s seen.\n\n“It’s really driven specifically by an evangelical worldview that sees the Bible as inspired by God,” she said. “And then there’s also a very strong nationalist message, where it wants to suggest that the Bible kind of foretells the creation of the United States. There are incredibly strong claims about the Bible’s relationship to the nation.”\n\nGriffith, among other scholars, has called for a more diverse board of influencers to balance out the Greens’ evangelical worldview, including “scholars who have wrestled with how these texts were produced over time,” she said.\n\nMuch of the board of the Museum of the Bible is evangelical, including Green, Summers, and the evangelical pastor Warren, as well as Robert Cooley, a former president of an evangelical seminary, and Mark DeMoss, who is now running the museum’s PR, and who is the former chief of staff to Jerry Falwell Sr.\n\nBut it also includes secular heads of major corporations, and Green argues that the museum’s scholarship team, which comes from universities and seminaries around the globe, is more diverse; in an email, he wrote that it’s one-third Jewish, one-third Protestant, and one-third Catholic, and includes experts in papyri and cuneiform; Aramaic, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian and Ethiopic texts; Coptic, medieval, Middle-Eastern, early Jewish and early American artifacts.\n\nIn 2015, the museum also hired David Trobisch, a respected liberal academic and New Testament scholar, to oversee the museum’s texts and artifacts — a hire many saw as a bid to alleviate outside concerns from scholars. By phone, Trobisch told me he was skeptical about working for the museum at first. “I’m a well-educated scholar. I would have a hard time working with any church or faith community who are not truthful about what the Bible really is,” he said, meaning a community that pushed a literal interpretation of the Bible.\n\nBut he said he felt better once he saw that the collection also planned to represent other faiths, including the Jewish tradition, through gestures such as by displaying fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Hebrew manuscripts once used by the Jewish community in China. To him, it seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with artifacts he couldn’t anywhere else.\n\nTrobisch also told me he wasn’t initially aware of provenance problems among some of the artifacts. Even once those were flagged, starting with the same 2014 traveling exhibition that sounded alarms for papyrologist Roberta Mazza, he assumed there were just a problematic few pieces among the 40,000 items in the collection.\n\nTrobisch did not respond to requests for comment after news emerged last week about the thousands of supposedly looted artifacts.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement about the Hobby Lobby artifacts early this month set the academic and cultural community abuzz. The scale, in their eyes, was enormous, the story salacious: 5,500 artifacts, allegedly looted from Iraqi archaeological sites, bought by Hobby Lobby from multiple antiquities dealers with money wired to a number of bank accounts and then smuggled into the U.S. with misleading shipping labels.\n\nHistorical sites have become increasingly vulnerable due to conflict and terrorism, and ever since the UNESCO 1970 Convention — an international treaty made at another time thefts from archeological sites were on the rise — museums and artifact collectors have been expected to to do far more to establish the provenance of items, to prevent illicit trafficking of cultural property.\n\nHobby Lobby, however, insisted their misstep was a matter of naive acquisition; a statement from the company said they “did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process.”\n\nBut antiquities experts, including Deborah Lehr, founder of the Antiquities Coalition, which works to stop cultural racketeering, firmly pushed back on that idea. Lehr told PBS NewsHour that Hobby Lobby was “a sophisticated importer” and that they “know very well that you have to designate the country of origin and the appropriate tariff line when bringing these into the country. This was not done.”\n\nInstead of being declared as antiquities, the artifacts were declared as clay tiles and samples.\n\nAdditionally, the items were declared as coming from Turkey, instead of Iraq, which would have required additional permits, she said.\n\nWhether it was deliberate or a case of naiveté, the Green family did acquire thousands of artifacts in a remarkably quick period of time, which left others besides Lehr suspicious.\n\nMazza, the papyrologist who recognized the worrisome fragment in a traveling exhibition as one that had been on eBay, said she was not surprised by the news of the settlement because of how quickly the Greens had acquired their artifacts.\n\n“It is impossible to amass a collection like that in such a short time in the context of a legal market which is very and rightly restricted,” she wrote in an email.\n\nEither way, Hobby Lobby has now said that they will now try to remedy their actions by setting up policies on how to buy new artifacts, hiring outside customs brokers, and submitting reports to the government on its purchases.\n\nAs for the Museum of the Bible, a spokeswoman said no looted items were destined for the museum, and also that it adheres to the current museum industry guidelines, which have strict rules about acquisitions.\n\nBut Joel Baden and Candida Moss, two theology professors who have long been following Hobby Lobby’s biblical ventures, and who are coming out with a book about the company this October, say promises by the Greens (and punishment by prosecutors) about future acquisitions miss the point.\n\n“There are 40,000 artifacts [Hobby Lobby acquired], and very little understanding of where they came from.” – Candida Moss, professor of the New Testament at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n“In the future they have agreed they will have oversight in their purchasing. But the issue isn’t the future. It is the past,” said Moss, who is a professor of the New Testament at the University of Notre Dame. “There are 40,000 artifacts [they acquired], and very little understanding of where they came from. They’re not in the market for more artifacts. What we need is vetting: good faith transparent efforts to locate the histories of those artifacts,” she said — meaning those that were not included in the investigation.\n\nSo far, the museum has only released highlights of the artifacts they will host, which is standard for new institutions. But they have not provided provenance information about those items, which seems to buck tradition. (See the MET Museum’s listings here.)\n\nThe museum is not yet open, however, and Michael Holmes, a professor of early Christian writings and head of scholarship for the museum, said they were still working on getting provenance information together for upcoming publications.\n\nHolmes acknowledged there were items with incomplete provenance in the museum collection and said he was wrestling with how to handle them.\n\nMazza, the papyrologist, said the museum needed to declare the provenance of all its antiquities, and also replace their key staff members with more serious scholars.\n\n“Museums and cultural institutions are serious enterprises,” Mazza, the papyrologist, wrote in an email, “while the Greens and their team seem a group of (dangerous) amateurs.”\n\nThe Greens’ desire to elevate their faith in modern culture goes beyond a brick-and-mortar museum in Washington. In the past, this has included the Supreme Court case on contraception, Christian bookstores, and sponsored trips to Israel. It’s included the museum’s traveling exhibitions, which appeared in cities around the world. And it’s included the launch of a bible-based curriculum, which Green wrote in an email to NewsHour was designed to teach high schoolers around the world the “history, narrative and impact of the most influential text ever written.” The curriculum will also be on display at the Museum of the Bible.\n\nOne version of that curriculum is already available online for private and homeschooled students in the U.S.; another version developed by the museum and Israeli educators, which does not include Christian New Testament passages, is being used by 100,000 children in Israel. Green also tried to get the curriculum into public schools in Oklahoma City, not far from Hobby Lobby corporate headquarters, but that plan was shelved after heavy opposition from legal groups and religious scholars.\n\nIn an independent review of the public school curriculum in 2015, biblical scholar Mark Chancey, a professor of religious studies at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wrote that the course had “a long way to go before being appropriate for a public school classroom” because of the combination of a “religious purpose, pervading sectarian bias, and frequent factual errors.”\n\nAmong his critiques were that the curriculum favored the Protestant (read: evangelical) form of the bible, and also promoted the belief that the bible was “literally, historically accurate and ‘reliable,’” as Green had expressed in his 2013 speech accepting the Templeton Prize.\n\n(Christians in the United States are very divided about how to interpret the Bible, according to Pew; about a third say it should be taken literally, a third say it’s the word of God but that not everything should be taken literally, and another third say it’s not the word of God at all.)\n\nA desire to spread the Bible’s teachings in public schools seems to come from Green’s own childhood : “Unfortunately, I did not have a Bible curriculum available in the public school I attended,” Green wrote to me, and said he was grateful to have gotten exposure to it at church.\n\nNow, that curriculum, with some tweaks, will be available to the public on one level of the Museum of the Bible. Instead of focusing on the Bible’s impact on culture, it will delve into the history and narratives around the Bible, in an “engaging and scholarly way,” a museum spokeswoman said.\n\nAsked if he was nervous to have the museum opening in light of the scrutiny over the curriculum, artifacts, scholarship, and more, Summers laughed. “It’s the most controversial topic in the world,” he said. “It’s the biggest-selling book; most banned, destroyed, influential book … We will irritate everybody.”",
  "latent_32021": "(I just installed my own blog so I decided to try it out by writing a bit about interrupt checks :) )\n\nMost browsers allow the user to interrupt JS code that runs too long, for instance because it’s stuck in an infinite loop. This is especially important for Firefox as it uses a single process for chrome and content (though that’s about to change), so without this dialog a website could hang the browser forever and the user is forced to kill the browser and could lose work. Firefox will show the slow script dialog when a script runs for more than 10 seconds (power users can customize this).\n\nSpiderMonkey\n\nFirefox uses a separate (watchdog) thread to interrupt script execution. It triggers the “operation callback” (by calling JS_TriggerOperationCallback) every second. Whenever this happens, SpiderMonkey promises to call the operation callback as soon as possible. The browser’s operation callback then checks the execution limit, shows the dialog if necessary and returns true to continue execution or false to stop the script.\n\nHow this works internally is that JS_TriggerOperationCallback sets a flag on the JSRuntime, and the main thread is responsible for checking this flag every now and then and invoke the operation callback if it’s set. We check this flag for instance on JS function calls and loop headers. We have to do this both for scripts running in the interpreter and the JITs, of course. For example, consider this function:\n\nfunction f () { for ( var i = 0 ; i < 100000000 ; i ++ ) { } }\n\nUntil Firefox 26, IonMonkey would emit the following code for this loop:\n\nNote that the loop itself is only 4 instructions, but we need 2 more instructions for the interrupt check. These 2 instructions can measurably slow down tight loops like this one. Can we do better?\n\nOdinMonkey\n\nOdinMonkey is our ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for asm.js. When developing Odin, we (well, mostly Luke) tried to shave off as much overhead as possible, for instance we want to get rid of bounds checks and interrupt checks if possible to close the gap with native code. The result is that Odin does not emit loop interrupt checks at all! Instead, it makes clever use of signal handlers.\n\nWhen the watchdog thread wants to interrupt Odin execution on the main thread, it uses mprotect (Unix) or VirtualProtect (Windows) to clear the executable bit of the asm.js code that’s currently executing. This means any asm.js code running on the main thread will immediately segfault. However, before the kernel terminates the process, it gives us one last chance to interfere: because we installed our own signal handler, we can trap the segfault and, if the address is inside asm.js code, we can make the signal handler return to a little trampoline that calls the operation callback. Then we can either jump back to the faulting pc or stop execution by returning from asm.js code. (Note that handling segfaults is serious business: if the faulting address is not inside asm.js code, we have an unrelated, “real” crash and we must be careful not to interfere in any way, so that we don’t sweep real crashes under the rug.)\n\nThis works really well and is pretty cool: asm.js code has no runtime interrupt checks, just like native code, but we can still interrupt it and show our slow script dialog.\n\nIonMonkey\n\nA while later, Brian Hackett wanted to see if we could make IonMonkey (our optimizing JIT) as fast as OdinMonkey on asm.js code. This means he also had to eliminate interrupt checks for normal JS code running in Ion (we don’t bother doing this for our Baseline JIT as we’ll spend most time in Ion code anyway).\n\nThe first thought is to do exactly what Odin does: mprotect all Ion-code, trigger a segfault and return to some trampoline where we handle the interrupt. It’s not that simple though, because Ion-code can modify the GC heap. For instance, when we store a boxed Value, we emit two machine instructions on 32-bit platforms, to store the type tag and the payload. If we use signal handlers the same way Odin does, it’s possible we store the type tag but are interrupted before we can store the payload. Everything will be fine until the GC traces the heap and crashes horribly. Even worse, an attacker could use this to access arbitrary memory.\n\nThere’s another problem: when we call into C++ from Ion code, the register allocator tracks GC pointers stored in registers or on the stack, so that the garbage collector can mark them. If we call the operation callback at arbitrary points though, we don’t have this information. This is a problem because the operation callback is also used to trigger garbage collections, so it has to know where all GC pointers are.\n\nWhat Brian implemented instead is the following:\n\nThe watchdog thread will mprotect all Ion code (we had to use a separate allocator for Ion code so that we can do this efficiently). The main thread will segfault and call our signal handler. The signal handler unprotects all Ion-code again and patches all loop backedges (jump instructions) to jump to a slow, out-of-line path instead. We return from the signal handler and continue execution until we reach the next (patched) loop backedge and call the operation callback, show the slow script dialog, etc. All loop backedges are patched again to jump to the loop header.\n\nNote that this only applies to the loop interrupt check: there’s another interrupt check when we enter a script, but for JIT code we combine it with the stack overflow check: when we trigger the operation callback, the watchdog thread also sets the stack limit to a very high value so that the stack check always fails and we also end up in the VM where we can handle the operation callback and reset the stack limit :)\n\nConclusion\n\nFirefox 26 and newer uses signal handlers and segfaults for interrupting Ion code. This was a measurable speedup, especially for tight loops. For example, the empty for-loop I posted earlier runs 33% faster (43 ms to 29 ms). It helps more interesting loops as well, for instance Octane-crypto got ~8% faster.",
