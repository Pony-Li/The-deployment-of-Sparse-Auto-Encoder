  "latent_37": "With a reemerging China in great power politics, instability on the Korean Peninsula, ongoing territorial disputes with Russia, and the rise of non-state actors, Japan is recalibrating its national security calculus at a time of changing dynamics in the Asia Pacific. The reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution to allow for collective self-defense and the accompanying structural changes to the country’s institutional fabric gives rise to the notion that Japan’s military industrial complex is poised to come into its own. But how will Tokyo manage its transition to what the Abe administration has termed “proactive pacifism” amidst condemnation from neighboring countries, internal push-back from both rival and coalition political groups, and a citizenry largely conditioned in a culture of non-militarism?\n\nTo sell the image of a non-threatening Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) at home and abroad, important both in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy, Tokyo has and will continue to utilize a web of affective cultural and entertainment resources – the Creative Industrial Complex (CIC) – to influence perceptions of Japan’s military establishment. The alignment between the CIC and the JSDF is nuanced, storied, and important for understanding both how Japan sees its own defense identity and how the international community sees Japan’s military.\n\nThe Manga Military\n\nThe CIC has produced a stunning amount of film, anime, theater, literature, fashion, and other expressive media designed to generate affinity towards the nation’s growing hard power identity and burgeoning military industrial base. Manga, perhaps chief among them and a multi-billion dollar publishing marvel, is an artistic iconography developed in Japan during the 19th century and long used by Japan’s political and government establishments as a potent marketing and communicative tool. In particular, the commodification of manga cuteness, often typified by extenuated character traits such as proportionally large eyes and small bodies, taps the power of “moe,” what Patrick Galbraith, author of The Moe Manifesto, describes as an affective response to fictional characters or representations of them – it is a cognitive or emotional reaction elicited from iconographic images.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, state agencies, recognizing the strong commercial success of manga both at home and abroad, and the potential malleability of the moe that it engenders, collaborated with large corporations to produce manga that communicated political, business, literary, and educational information to the public. With this move towards cute, or kawaii, communication came a correlative change in how the Japanese citizenry digested their official information. This culminated in the production of a Manga History of Japan (Manga Nihon no rekishi) commissioned by the academic and literary publisher Chūō Kōronsha, a 48-volume work recognized by the Ministry of Education and Culture as an official educational resource for public schools.\n\nBy the mid 1980s, the use of manga as an official communicative medium had thoroughly permeated nearly all state-sponsored institutions save one – the Self-Defense Forces. Long shy of engaging with a highly critical citizenry and suffering from a poignantly negative internal and international public image, the JSDF had preferred to keep to itself, strategically slow in employing modern and non-traditional communication strategies. However, as economic hardship in the 1990’s reduced Japan’s relative power and influence, and a host of emergent foreign-born security threats reduced Japan’s absolute power and influence, it became clear to the JSDF and Ministry of Defense that answers to many important questions facing the nation would need to be answered with a more participatory defense establishment.\n\nThus, and as curtains closed on the Cold War theater, the JSDF and sister institutions sought to employ private sector creative industries to build avenues of information and knowledge flow to, from, and between the Japanese people and international community. With the launch of Prince Pickles, a cartoon and comic series that sought to describe the ideal “journey to peace,” and an initiative to publish official defense white papers in manga format for general consumption starring a character by the name of Ms. Future, the JSDF moved from a position of self-imposed isolation to one of active engagement. Strategically utilizing the then well-established and normalized popular culture of kawaii manga, the JSDF incorporated “cute” throughout its recruiting and public relations campaigns in what University of California professor Sabine Fruhstuck has described as a two track effort to pacify and negate its violent war-waging past and potential while also selling its role as a competent protector of Japan.\n\nThe popular AlphaPolis manga and anime series Gate perhaps best exemplifies the extent to which military-creative industry collaboration has become widespread since the turn of the century, as well as the changing manner in which Japan’s military interprets and represents itself. Produced, designed, and funded in coordination with the JSDF, the fantasy-based series glorifies Japan’s defense establishment with a doe-eyed cast of capable, identifiable, and non-threatening characters that protect Japan from alien invaders. As the plot unfolds, the youthful defenders of the nation’s sovereignty drive back the invading forces with the use of superior technology and, backed by the U.S. army, send a counter-invading task force outward to the place beyond the portal Gate on a quest for retribution. The story’s tracking with contemporary security-related issues and government agendas is unmistakable.\n\nCover art from the manga Gate, depicting Japan’s affable and attractive heroines\n\nThe utilization of moe by Japan’s manga military represents a poignant example of how postwar Japan negotiates the contentious process of normalizing its armed forces. It is precisely moe’s divergence from reality that allows it to serve as a familiar, affective lubricant in showcasing Japan’s JSDF and Ministry of Defense to a kawaii-primed public skeptical of its own armed forces and militaristic history. Moe induced by manga is the recognition of a fictional realism, whereby Japan is able to explore its hard power identity against a backdrop of cute fantasy, one in which the JSDF symbolically disarms itself by normalizing, domesticating, and emasculating the military. Indeed, the manga military has become virtually indistinguishable from many of the prominent “neighborly” government institutions, including the postal service, utilities, and railway, cast in their likeness from the same popular culture mold.\n\nThe Moe Ministry of Defense\n\nAlthough not much covered by mainstream media, Japan has embarked on a new approach to defense technology spearheaded by the recently established Acquisition Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA) at the Ministry of Defense. The ATLA is tasked with core management functions concerning defense cooperation, R&D, and promotion of Japan’s indigenous high-tech industrial base: The organization is a central node in Japan’s growing military industrial network. Late last year, the ATLA hosted the annual Defense Technology Symposium for the first time, and as Crystal Prior notes for The Diplomat, a notably interesting aspect of the event was the use of manga/moe in showcasing and advertising the agency. From the gender, saucer-eyes, impish grin, determined brow, horizon-focused gaze, and professional attire, to the use of certain colors, textual highlights, and subliminal images imbedded in the tapestry background, this advertisement and those like it are highly nuanced approaches to message communication.\n\nAn advertising poster for the ATLA’s 2015 Defense Technology Symposium\n\nWhile parsing images for meaning is a pursuit beholden to bias and subjectivity, a long history of findings in political and media studies have identified patterns in image recognition and propaganda methods upon which one may make certain conjectures. Here, the ATLA has followed in the footsteps of many JSDF showcasing techniques that utilize the manga medium. Female characters, for example, are often used in a bid to exploit prewar gender binaries of aggressive, kamikaze men and nurturing, supportive women. These kawaii heroines in advertising and images such at this remain motionless, neither in retreat nor in advance, symbolically indicating that they do not pose an immediate threat to the status quo. Eye contact and the primal challenge that it denotes is carefully avoided, with a gaze fixed on an unidentified point in the distance rather than directed at the viewer. Themes such as national pride, strength, or virtue are absent from the billing; the advertisement could easily be one for almost any product or service. Pink text with disco highlights reminds the audience that selling and buying weapons of mass destruction is only as unsavory as a night out in some of the more handbill-laden parts of Roppongi, the sordid nightclub district of Tokyo.\n\nThe American Macho Military-Entertainment Complex\n\nOne can find perhaps the most densely woven ties between the creative industries and government institutions in the United States, where Hollywood and the gaming industry work closely with the Pentagon in what Tim Lenoir and Henry Lowood of Stanford University have termed the U.S. military-entertainment complex (MEC). Similar to Japan, the MEC engages the public with fantasy-based iconography, although the form and function of the messages are vastly different. While Japan scripts a diminutive, temperate narrative of its self-defense force, the U.S. government embraces the hyper-macho, bazooka-blasting fare that defines the majority of military-related films and games. Washington is Tokyo’s closest and most important ally and has long pushed for Japan to take a more proactive, engaged roll in its own self-defense and regional affairs. As the Liberal Democratic Party and Abe administration continue to champion a recalibrated military mandate, recognizing the ties that bind the MEC to American identity offers an informative and juxtaposed comparison to Japan’s manga military.\n\nThe list of Hollywood movies produced with government support is hundreds of films long, and includes recent successful ventures Zero Dark Thirty and Lone Survivor. Perhaps the most endearing medium, however, has also been the most covert in connection: Films from the hugely popular animated and CGI-based franchises Iron Man, Transformers, and X-Men, which have been viewed, consumed, and internalized by a far-reaching domestic and international audience, have been developed and crafted in coordination with the Pentagon. In fact, the relationship is as old as the Oscars: the first Best Picture winner in 1929, Wings, a romantic action-war picture was produced in part by the U.S. government.\n\nHenry Cavill in Man of Steel, produced in partnership between Warner Brothers and the Army National Guard in 2013\n\nThe military-entertainment complex creates economic and political advantages to both the U.S. government and Hollywood. Studios use taxpayer-subsidized military locations, personnel, and equipment in exchange for allowing the military script and / or final cut approval. This partnership enables entertainment companies to significantly reduced production budgets as well as source military establishment knowledge, while the Pentagon is able to harness the affective power of cinema to advance government agendas, and convert movie theaters, televisions, and computers into virtual recruitment offices and bastions of national identity.\n\nSimilar to Hollywood, many of the most commercially successful and technologically innovative games, including the groundbreaking and massively popular first person shooter (FPS) games Doom, Quake, and Counterstrike have been shaped and fashioned in various ways through formal collaboration between the United States military and the entertainment industry. The game premises of Call of Duty, currently the leading FPS game, track with contemporary conflicts and security threats, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, pitting “good versus evil” gameplay under the watchful eye of the Pentagon.\n\nThe U.S. military establishment, similar to its counterparts in Japan, uses creative popular culture to shape domestic and international perceptions of its identity. As the U.S. continues to question its overall military posture, with increasingly vigilant domestic calls for a less interventionist foreign policy stance, one might expect to see a softer image put forward by the entertainment-military complex moving forward. If this sounds familiar to students of American history, perhaps it is because the Pentagon has used this tactic in the past at times of public discomfort with government foreign policy agendas, including during the Vietnam and Korean wars. Indeed, one of the most acclaimed action movies of the 20th century, the hit classic Top Gun, was produced in collaboration with the U.S. government, wrapping Ronald Reagan’s military adventurism in Libya and Grenada in a romantic cloak of brotherly love and national pride, complete with slick call signs and an infectious charismatic charm.\n\nOpportune Kawaii Camouflage\n\nJapan’s manga military engages in a potent form of political revisionism where it encourages the audience to rethink critical views of the military and government, and indeed the country’s history more broadly, by appealing to the familiar cultural and ideational ties of the creative industry. As Japan enters into its new era of “proactive pacifism,” Tokyo will continue to use the nation’s Creative Industrial Complex to (wo)man the helm of public perception both at home and abroad. Cute manga decals on fighter jets, missiles, and military establishment advertising campaigns will continue to mediate Japan’s changing middle-power consciousness. However, if the day comes when the JSDF and Ministry of Defense no longer must negotiate their identities with national and international perceptions, the disappearance of Japan’s kawaii-camouflaged manga military may well spell a turn to full normalization of the country’s foreign policy instruments and how Japanese society views its defense mandate in an anarchic world.\n\nMatthew Brummer is a lecturer at Tokyo International University, researcher at Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and Ph.D. candidate at The University of Tokyo.

  "latent_141": "Behind the U.S.-backed coup that ousted the democratically elected president of Ukraine are the economic interests of giant corporations from Cargill to Chevron which see the country as a potential “gold mine” of profits from agricultural and energy exploitation, reports JP Sottile.\n\nBy JP Sottile\n\nOn Jan. 12, a reported 50,000 “pro-Western” Ukrainians descended upon Kiev’s Independence Square to protest against the government of President Viktor Yanukovych. Stoked in part by an attack on opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko, the protest marked the beginning of the end of Yanukovych’s four year-long government.\n\nThat same day, the Financial Times reported a major deal for U.S. agribusiness titan Cargill.\n\nDespite the turmoil within Ukrainian politics after Yanukovych rejected a major trade deal with the European Union just seven weeks earlier, Cargill was confident enough about the future to fork over $200 million to buy a stake in Ukraine’s UkrLandFarming. According to Financial Times, UkrLandFarming is the world’s eighth-largest land cultivator and second biggest egg producer. And those aren’t the only eggs in Cargill’s increasingly-ample basket.\n\nOn Dec. 13, Cargill announced the purchase of a stake in a Black Sea port. Cargill’s port at Novorossiysk, to the east of Russia’s strategically significant and historically important Crimean naval base, gives them a major entry-point to Russian markets and adds them to the list of Big Ag companies investing in ports around the Black Sea, both in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nCargill has been in Ukraine for over two decades, investing in grain elevators and acquiring a major Ukrainian animal feed company in 2011. And, based on its investment in UkrLandFarming, Cargill was decidedly confident amidst the post-EU deal chaos. It’s a stark juxtaposition to the alarm bells ringing out from the U.S. media, bellicose politicians on Capitol Hill and perplexed policymakers in the White House.\n\nIt’s even starker when compared to the anxiety expressed by Morgan Williams, President and CEO of the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, which, according to its website, has been “Promoting U.S.-Ukraine business relations since 1995.” Williams was interviewed by the International Business Times on March 13 and, despite Cargill’s demonstrated willingness to spend, he said, “The instability has forced businesses to just go about their daily business and not make future plans for investment, expansion and hiring more employees.”\n\nIn fact, Williams, who does double-duty as Director of Government Affairs at the private equity firm SigmaBleyzer, claimed, “Business plans have been at a standstill.”\n\nApparently, he wasn’t aware of Cargill’s investment, which is odd given the fact that he could’ve simply called Van A. Yeutter, Vice President for Corporate Affairs at Cargill, and asked him about his company’s quite active business plan. There is little doubt Williams has the phone number because Mr. Yuetter serves on the Executive Committee of the selfsame U.S.-Ukraine Business Council. It’s quite a cozy investment club, too.\n\nAccording to his SigmaBleyzer profile, Williams “started his work regarding Ukraine in 1992” and has since advised American agribusinesses “investing in the former Soviet Union.” As an experienced fixer for Big Ag, he must be fairly friendly with the folks on the Executive Committee.\n\nBig Ag Luminaries\n\nAnd what a committee it is, it’s a veritable who’s who of Big Ag. Among the luminaries working tirelessly and no doubt selflessly for a better, freer Ukraine are:\n\n–Melissa Agustin, Director, International Government Affairs & Trade for Monsanto\n\n–Brigitte Dias Ferreira, Counsel, International Affairs for John Deere\n\n–Steven Nadherny, Director, Institutional Relations for agriculture equipment-maker CNH Industrial\n\n–Jeff Rowe, Regional Director for DuPont Pioneer\n\n–John F. Steele, Director, International Affairs for Eli Lilly & Company\n\nAnd, of course, Cargill’s Van A. Yeutter. But Cargill isn’t alone in their warm feelings toward Ukraine. As Reuters reported in May 2013, Monsanto, the largest seed company in the world, plans to build a $140 million “non-GM (genetically modified) corn seed plant in Ukraine.”\n\nAnd right after the decision on the EU trade deal, Jesus Madrazo, Monsanto’s Vice President for Corporate Engagement, reaffirmed his company’s “commitment to Ukraine” and “the importance of creating a favorable environment that encourages innovation and fosters the continued development of agriculture.”\n\nMonsanto’s strategy includes a little “hearts and minds” public relations, too. On the heels of Mr. Madrazo’s reaffirmation, Monsanto announced “a social development program titled “Grain Basket of the Future” to help rural villagers in the country improve their quality of life.” The initiative will dole out grants of up to $25,000 to develop programs providing “educational opportunities, community empowerment, or small business development.”\n\nThe well-crafted moniker “Grain Basket of the Future” is telling because, once upon a time, Ukraine was known as “the breadbasket” of the Soviet Union. The CIA ranks Soviet-era Ukraine second only to Mother Russia as the “most economically important component of the former Soviet Union.”\n\nIn many ways, the farmland of Ukraine was the backbone of the USSR. Its “fertile black soil” generated over a quarter of the USSR’s agriculture. It exported “substantial quantities” of food to other republics and its farms generated four times the output of “the next-ranking republic.”\n\nAlthough Ukraine’s agricultural output plummeted in the first decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the farming sector has been growing spectacularly in recent years. While Europe struggled to shake-off the Great Recession, Ukraine’s agriculture sector grew 13.7% in 2013.\n\nUkraine’s agriculture economy is hot. Russia’s is not. Hampered by the effects of climate change and 25 million hectares of uncultivated agricultural land, Russia lags behind its former breadbasket.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Eastern Studies, Ukraine’s agricultural exports rose from $4.3 billion in 2005 to $17.9 billion in 2012 and, harkening the heyday of the USSR, farming currently accounts for 25 percent of its total exports. Ukraine is also the world’s third-largest exporter of wheat and of corn. And corn is not just food. It is also ethanol.\n\nFeeding Europe\n\nBut people gotta eat, particularly in Europe. As Frank Holmes of U.S. Global Investors assessed in 2011, Ukraine is poised to become Europe’s butcher. Meat is difficult to ship, but Ukraine is perfectly located to satiate Europe’s hunger.\n\nJust two days after Cargill bought into UkrLandFarming, Global Meat News (yes, “Global Meat News” is a thing) reported a huge forecasted spike in “all kinds” of Ukrainian meat exports, with an increase of 8.1% overall and staggering 71.4% spike in pork exports. No wonder Eli Lilly is represented on the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council’s Executive Committee. Its Elanco Animal Health unit is a major manufacturer of feed supplements.\n\nAnd it is also notable that Monsanto’s planned seed plant is non-GMO, perhaps anticipating an emerging GMO-unfriendly European market and Europe’s growing appetite for organic foods. When it comes to Big Ag’s profitable future in Europe, the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nFor Russia and its hampered farming economy, it’s another in a long string of losses to U.S. encroachment, from NATO expansion into Eastern Europe to U.S. military presence to its south and onto a major shale gas development deal recently signed by Chevron in Ukraine.\n\nSo, why was Big Ag so bullish on Ukraine, even in the face of so much uncertainty and the predictable reaction by Russia?\n\nThe answer is that the seeds of Ukraine’s turn from Russia have been sown for the last two decades by the persistent Cold War alliance between corporations and foreign policy. It’s a version of the “Deep State” that is usually associated with the oil and defense industries, but also exists in America’s other heavily subsidized industry, agriculture.\n\nMorgan Williams is at the nexus of Big Ag’s alliance with U.S. foreign policy. To wit, SigmaBleyzer touts Mr. Williams’ work with “various agencies of the U.S. government, members of Congress, congressional committees, the Embassy of Ukraine to the U.S., international financial institutions, think tanks and other organizations on U.S.-Ukraine business, trade, investment and economic development issues.”\n\nAs President of the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, Williams has access to Council cohort, David Kramer, President of Freedom House. Officially a non-governmental organization, it has been linked with overt and covert “democracy” efforts in places where the door isn’t open to American interests, a.k.a. U.S. corporations.\n\nFreedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy and National Democratic Institute helped fund and support the Ukrainian “Orange Revolution” in 2004. Freedom House is funded directly by the U.S. Government, the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Department of State.\n\nDavid Kramer is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs and, according to his Freedom House bio page, formerly a “Senior Fellow at the Project for the New American Century.”\n\nNuland’s Role\n\nThat puts Kramer and, by one degree of separation, Big Ag fixer Morgan Williams in the company of PNAC co-founder Robert Kagan who, as coincidence would have it, is married to Victoria “F*ck the EU” Nuland, the current Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ms. Nuland spoke to the U.S.-Ukrainian Foundation last Dec. 13, extolling the virtues of the Euromaidan movement as the embodiment of “the principles and values that are the cornerstones for all free democracies.”\n\nNuland also told the group that the United States had invested more than $5 billion in support of Ukraine’s “European aspirations,” meaning pulling Ukraine away from Russia. She made her remarks on a dais featuring a backdrop emblazoned with a Chevron logo.\n\nAlso, her colleague and phone call buddy U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt helped Chevron cook up their 50-year shale gas deal right in Russia’s kitchen.\n\nAlthough Chevron sponsored that event, it is not listed as a supporter of the Foundation. But the Foundation does list the Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil and Raytheon as major sponsors. And, to close the circle of influence, the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council is also listed as a supporter.\n\nWhich brings the story back to Big Ag’s fixer, Morgan Williams.\n\nAlthough he was glum about the current state of investment in Ukraine, he’s gotta wear shades when he looks into the future. He told the International Business Times, “The potential here for agriculture/agribusiness is amazing production here could double. The world needs the food Ukraine could produce in the future. Ukraine’s agriculture could be a real gold mine.”\n\nOf course, his priority is to ensure that the bread of well-connected businesses gets lavishly buttered in Russia’s former breadbasket. And there is no better connected group of Ukraine-interested corporations than American agribusiness.\n\nGiven the extent of U.S. official involvement in Ukrainian politics, including the interesting fact that Ambassador Pyatt pledged U.S. assistance to the new government in investigating and rooting-out corruption, Cargill’s seemingly risky investment strategy probably wasn’t that risky, after all.\n\nJP Sottile is a freelance journalist, radio co-host, documentary filmmaker and former broadcast news producer in Washington, D.C.

  "latent_232": "“As long as you guys are going anyway, why don’t you compete?” Our dance teacher, Alex, tossed out this innocent-seeming question one July day in 2006. The three of us—Alex, my husband, Bob, and me—stood chatting in front of a window fan in the sweltering studio at the beginning of our regular lesson. We had just mentioned that we were thinking of flying out to Las Vegas to watch Alex and his wife, Maria, dance in a competition in December. At this point, Bob and I were still neophytes, with just over a year of lessons under our belts. Like most ballroom enthusiasts, we stood in complete awe of our teachers. Alex and Maria had already won an important championship in their division. Their star was on the rise. We couldn’t resist the prospect of seeing our teachers on the floor, just as they appeared in the large framed photos on our studio’s walls, Alex in his tail suit and Maria in one of her dazzling backless gowns, dripping in crystal rhinestones and decked with feathers.\n\nAlex waited for our response. I glanced over at Bob, gauging his reaction. My heart fluttered. I really wanted to do it, but I was afraid Bob would suggest we “think about it,” and the dream might die then and there. “Yes, let’s do it!” I blurted. Bob’s curiosity and imagination must have gotten the better of him, too, because he didn’t argue. And just like that, it was set. We were going to Vegas. We had no idea what we were getting into, but we embraced the adventure, told our friends we were going to compete, and vowed to practice, practice, practice!\n\n“I’ve always been a dancer—I just haven’t been able to dance.”\n\nWe added separate lessons to our regimen, so that Bob could practice routines with Maria, and I with Alex. Up to this point, we had taken lessons together and danced mainly with each other. Now, our teachers focused on us as individuals, creating simple routines and coaching us, about footwork, points of technique, and performance. Each of us was to dance in two different American styles, Rhythm and Smooth. In Smooth we would stick with the waltz, tango, and fox-trot, leaving the difficult Viennese waltz to the advanced students. In Rhythm, the sensual Latinate face of American style, we had routines in cha-cha, rumba, and swing.\n\n* * *\n\n“I’ve always been a dancer—I just haven’t been able to dance,” is how Tanya put it to me. A statuesque dancer in her sixties, Tanya is a natural athlete and is drawn to the discipline and physical movement of dancing. As a girl, she studied ballet, but when she showed promise as a tennis player, she faced pressure to channel that energy into her sport. She became a pro and traveled the world with her diplomat husband. When we sit down to talk, she is still in her tennis whites, fresh from the court.\n\nMany who are as new as she is to the glamorous-seeming competition circuit—she’s been taking private lessons just over two years now—wax positively starry-eyed about it, sighing over sparkly gowns, ultrafeminine shoes, and the Cinderella-like transformation of big hair and in-your-face makeup. Not Tanya. She is a competitor who doesn’t enjoy the actual competition. In fact, she says, she started competing only to get her teacher to take her seriously.\n\n“[Alex] has a lot of students, so to get his attention focused on me, on helping me actually improve, I knew I had to start competing.” But she has never relished the competition itself. Even as a young and winning competitor in the tennis world, Tanya remembers, “I hated competition—that’s why I quit tennis. Losing was horrible, and winning wasn’t fun. I was just relieved not to lose.”\n\nLike many pro-am dancers, Tanya struggles to reconcile the practical and financial reality. She is divorced and on a tight budget. She supports her dancing by teaching as many tennis lessons as possible. Ballroom is a newfound passion for her, but the cost of private lessons and competition is adding up fast, causing her a good deal of stress. She has felt pressure to pay for costly coaching and other extras that she would prefer to opt out of. Still, she says she can’t think about quitting, adding softly, “I just try not to think about it.”\n\nTanya is not alone. Many pro-am dancers feel sheepish about their expenditures. When competing, students pay travel expenses for their teacher, splitting it among those participating. There are entry fees for each “heat,” averaging around $60; half to the competition organizers and half remitted to the teacher for each heat danced. It adds up, not to mention costumes costing anywhere from several hundred (for a used dress on consignment) to several thousand dollars (for a custom dress). Men can have expensive tail suits made, specially tailored so the shoulders don’t ride up when they raise their frame—a miracle of dance engineering!\n\nSome fortunate dancers have lucrative professions, wealthy spouses, or family money. Linda, an experienced competitor, observed, “The wealthy widows and divorcées—they have it the best. They have the money and no one controlling how they spend it.” Linda is a retired professional woman who never married. She pays for her own dancing and estimates she spends between $12,000 and $15,000 yearly for everything associated with her dance hobby. This is about average. Many dancers avoid telling friends and family what they spend, particularly pro-am “ladies,” as they tend to be called. When viewed through the lens of the larger culture—one that approves when men pay for the company of women, but not the other way around—pro-am dancing could look like a glorified escort service. You pay him to dance with you? ladies imagine people saying. They worry they might be perceived to be, as one dancer put it, “pathetic.”\n\nWomen outnumber men in the dance world by about three to one, and their experiences of lessons, practice, and competition are slightly different. The onus is on the males, as leaders, to “drive,” that is, to navigate a crowded and chaotic dance floor. In listening to Bob over the years, I know that male dancers have a somewhat different experience of competition. In contrast with the uplifting experience that women often have, men are often let down because their skills are tested in ways that seem unfair. OK, they learned their routine and know it by heart, but now someone’s in the spot where their partner was supposed to do a spin or a kick and they must improvise. There’s not the spontaneity of social dancing, where you actually do make it up as you go along, and yet the choreography they practice so hard is often thwarted, or else inadequate to fill the enormous sides of a regulation 60-foot-by-36-foot competition floor.\n\nCouples are everywhere, moving fast and vying for the judges’ attention. You have no control over the music—please, you think, just let it have a discernible beat. You’re counting—“1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8” in your head, and your teacher is hissing in your ear to get your head back out of her space and keep your frame up. There isn’t the allure of getting to don flashy costumes or false eyelashes—you are wearing a suit or vest, much like what you would wear to any wedding. And yet you must get psyched up to perform, just like the women, without all those trappings. In this sense, the guys are cheated out of some of the transformative magic, at least the most obvious elements of it, that the women enjoy.\n\n* * *\n\nPerhaps more than anything else, I love that pro-am dancing is largely populated by over-50 dancers, what I sometimes think of (fondly, since I count myself among them) as “Ballroom’s B-list.” The age classifications according to which dancers are grouped to compete go: Youth (under 18), A (usually 18 to 35), followed by B, C, and D. Bs can be anywhere from 40 to 60, depending on the competition. Cs are the sexta- and septuagenarians. Although not the official stars of the show—those would be the young, hard-bodied professionals who dance late at night—over-50 dancers, like myself and Bob and our compatriots, are the bread and butter of the DanceSport industry.\n\nAmateur dancers value their dancing not just as a hobby, but as an indelible component of their identity.\n\nAuthor Robert Bulman describes the experience of attending a DanceSport competition from the perspective of a non-dancer—the carnivalesque atmosphere, ubiquitous visual indexes of gender and class, the twin American cults of the body and conspicuous consumption. Almost without exception, dancers of all levels frame their dancing as an “addiction.” As Bulman would no doubt agree, it’s easy to get sucked into this intoxicating world of art, sport, color, sound, and adrenaline. Amateur dancers value their dancing not just as a hobby, but as an indelible component of their identity. Their participation, and willingness to pay to participate, fuels a thriving social economy. Instructors, studios, competition organizers, costume designers, shoe vendors, and the hotels and restaurants that host the competitions, plus numerous other satellite industries, rely on the dollars spent by these “B” and “C” dancers—mostly women—for their livelihoods.\n\nIn Glamour Addiction: Inside the American Ballroom Dance Industry, Juliet McMains argues that pro-am competition is, in some ways, an equalizer. In our youth-obsessed culture, older women are devalued and made to feel inadequate on the daily. In the ballroom, they are center stage:\n\nWhere else in American society do women have the option of only competing against those in their own age category for recognition of their beauty and sexual desirability?\n\nIn competition, amateur dancers are sorted according to skill level—the most basic is bronze, then silver, and on up through gold. As a bronze-level dancer, all I cared about was getting to silver. Silver, silver, silver. I ate, slept, and dreamed silver. I evaluated myself according to what others around me were doing—who had advanced choreography, what styles and levels they danced. Once, when Alex danced with another student at the silver level while I was still “stuck” in bronze, I began pouting: Why, I wanted to know, wasn’t I dancing silver yet? I’ve worked so hard, blah blah blah. It smarts to remember that now. The pettiness seems out of line with my current point of view, but I can recognize it for what it was: a normal developmental phase. I cared, just about the wrong things.\n\nOver the years I’ve listened attentively (because that’s what anthropologists do best) as new students poured their hearts out about their own obsessive concerns, whether it was wanting to advance levels, worrying that the instructor favored someone else, fee structure changes, or last-minute lesson cancellations (this last one never fails to send dance students into a tizzy). These days, I have the sage perspective of the Old Sheep in Charlotte’s Web. Like her, I’ve “seen many a spring pig come and go.” The longer I dance, the less I fret about choreography, standings, placements, or levels. Now it’s more about working on the simple stuff, basic elements of movement—just for the joy of doing it.",
  "latent_425": "By most accounts, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is a devoted father, dedicated family man and committed church leader. But as his record sadly shows, Romney's family values often take a back seat to his presidential ambitions. Just last week, he cast aside his father George Romney, the man whose rags-to-riches success story Mitt uses as a proxy for his own, all in the name of keeping his mysterious tax returns secret. His wife Ann Romney, the woman who now heads his Women for Mitt Coalition and who her husband says \"reports to me regularly\" regarding what American women care about, has been hung out to dry over issues including Planned Parenthood, abortion and the family's personal finances. And as it turns out, Mitt's betrayals hardly end there.\n\nIn his interview with David Muir of ABC last week, Governor Romney trotted out a new defense of keeping his secret tax returns secret:\n\n\"From time to time I've been audited as happens I think to other citizens as well and the accounting firm which prepares my taxes has done a very thorough and complete job pay taxes as legally due. I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president. I'd think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires.\"\n\nPut another way, if you paid a penny more to Uncle Sam than you could've, you're not just a sucker; you should be disqualified from becoming President.\n\nJust like Mitt's dad, George Romney.\n\nMitt's idol didn't merely establish a precedent by releasing 12 years of tax returns during his failed 1968 presidential campaign. As Paul Krugman recently reminded voters, the auto magnate and Michigan governor not only paid a lot to the U.S. Treasury, but probably much more than he needed to.\n\nThose returns also reveal that he paid a lot of taxes -- 36 percent of his income in 1960, 37 percent over the whole period. This was in part because, as one report at the time put it, he \"seldom took advantage of loopholes to escape his tax obligations.\"\n\n(The contrasts between father and son hardly end there. As Rick Perlstein documented, George Romney didn't merely develop an innovative profit sharing plan for his employees at AMC and return bonuses if he thought them too high. He also believed that \"rugged individualism\" is \"nothing but a political banner to cover up greed.\")\n\nBut if Mitt Romney has turned his back on the legacy of his late father, he has similarly shown no compunction about tossing his wife Ann overboard when political circumstances dictated.\n\nCircumstances like those in 2002, when Romney was trying to run for Governor of Massachusetts. Its constitution requires gubernatorial candidates to have been Massachusetts residents for seven consecutive years. Unfortunately, Mitt had not just been running the Salt Lake City Olympics the past the past three years, but also paid discounted property taxes to Utah while claiming his $3.8 million Park City area mansion was his \"primary residence.\" As the Deseret News reported on April 11, 2000, \"Romney has declared his Deer Valley home his primary residence for tax purposes.\" And while Romney pointed the finger at his accountants at PriceWaterhouseCoopers for his failure to file as a Massachusetts resident in 1999 and 2000, he also blamed his wife, Ann Romney:\n\nRomney said he didn't see the property tax bills for his $3.8 million home in Park City Utah because the home was in his wife Ann's name and she paid the tax bills.\n\n(After paying amended taxes in Massachusetts and sending Utah a check for $54,000 for the discount he shouldn't have received, Romney survived a Democratic challenge before the state Ballot Law Commission. But with his week's revelations regarding his efforts to cut the property tax bill on his $12.4 million La Jolla, California beach front home, Mitt's status as a registered voter in Belmont, Massachusetts may once again be called into question.)\n\nBut that episode pales in comparison to Mitt's tortured history on reproductive rights for American women. For that, he used Ann Romney as a disposable human shield, which could be discarded as needed.\n\nWhile Romney now claims he wants to \"end\" Planned Parenthood, he didn't always feel that way. As ABC News revealed in 2007, Romney during his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy attended a Planned Parenthood event. During a time when he was trying to establish his pro-choice bona fides with liberal Massachusetts voters, Mitt's wife Ann wrote a check for $150 to the organization. When presidential candidate Romney said in 2007 that he had \"no recollection\" of the fundraiser, then president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. Nichols Gamble seemed surprised:\n\n\"I can understand that he might not remember the check -- it's surprising to me that he would not remember the event. His main motivation for being there was a political motivation.\"\n\nWhatever Mitt Romney's motivation in 1994, in 2007 his run for the GOP presidential nomination required a different answer. As Romney explained in May 2007, what his wife did - the same woman who with her entire family converted to her husband's Mormon faith - did not reflect on him. As the New York Times reported:\n\n\"Her positions are not terribly relevant for my campaign.\"\n\nAnn Romney went along with the new script. In a January 2008 interview in Florida, Mrs. Romney brushed off a question about the contribution, protesting \"that was 14 years ago and $100. Do you really think I'd remember?\"\n\nIf not, she doubtless remembered testifying to her husband's position 10 years ago that he was \"effectively pro-choice.\" As Romney's wife Ann explained during his 2002 race for governor, Massachusetts voters need not worry about moderate Mitt protecting the right to choose:\n\nANN ROMNEY: I think women also recognize that they want someone who is going to manage the state well. I think they may be more nervous about him on social issues. They shouldn't be, because he's going to be just fine. But the perception is that he won't be. That's an incorrect perception.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: So when asked will I preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, I make an unequivocal answer: yes.\n\nBut Ann Romney wasn't the only family member Mitt deployed and later discarded in order to make his case as a reliable pro-choice leader for Massachusetts voters. As Salon's Justin Elliott documented in \"The Abortion That Mitt Doesn't Talk About Anymore,\" it was his own family story which Romney claimed during his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy informed his--and his mother's--pro-choice position. When Kennedy labeled him \"Multiple Choice Mitt,\" during their debate, Romney responded with a tale of personal loss:\n\n\"On the idea of 'multiple-choice,' I have to respond. I have my own beliefs, and those beliefs are very dear to me. One of them is that I do not impose my beliefs on other people. Many, many years ago, I had a dear, close family relative that was very close to me who passed away from an illegal abortion. It is since that time that my mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that.\"\n\nBut waver he did. American voters who missed those Massachusetts campaigns wouldn't know of the existence of Ann Keenan, the sister of Romney's brother-in-law who died at the age of 21 in 1963 after a botched, illegal abortion. Of course, as this 2007 exchange with Tim Russert showed, Mitt Romney no longer wants you to know about her, either:\n\nRUSSERT: You talked about your family relative who died from an illegal abortion, and yet President Romney is saying is saying ban all abortion. And what would be the legal consequences to people who participated in that procedure?... So back to your relative.\n\nROMNEY: Mm-hmm.\n\nRomney went on to explain the consequences (loss of license and possible prison time for doctors, though not patients) of his new found anti-abortion views. But he never did get back to his relative.\n\nThat's because the tragic story of \"dear, close family relative\" Anne Keenan wouldn't have been very popular with conservative Republican primary voters. Like Mitt's father, mother and wife (and even their horse Rafalca), she became political road kill on Romney's road to the White House. And that public mistreatment of his loved ones says an awful lot about the character of the man. After all, if there's anything worse than being strapped to the roof of Mitt Romney's car, it's being thrown under the bus.\n\n(This piece also appears at Perrspectives.)",

  "latent_512": "Amherst Invitational 2016 Recap (Boys and Girls), Presented By NUTC\n\nThe Hurricanes dominate both gender divisions, ensuring the hometown trophy doesn't leave Amherst.\n\nThis post is brought to you by National Ultimate Training Camp. All opinions are those of the author. Thanks for supporting the brands that make Ultiworld possible!\n\nThis article was written by guest author Josh Seamon.\n\nStepping onto the fields at the 25th Amherst Invitational — the oldest high school tournament in the country, in the city where ultimate was born — is a powerful experience. Even though Tiina is no longer coaching at Amherst, the House that Booth Built is as strong as it’s ever been.\n\nAmherst A Cut Above\n\nAfter watching the two Amherst Varsity teams go 13-0 and outscore their opponents by a combined 196-42 on the weekend, I was reminded of a quote from a local Amherst paper from the late 90’s: “Amherst doesn’t rebuild. Amherst reloads.” With thoroughly loaded rosters, each Varsity Amherst team ran into just a single half of true resistance during the entire tournament.\n\nAfter cruising through Saturday’s pool play with two shutouts, the Amherst girls ended up having to grind out a tough first half in their semifinal against an athletic and determined squad from Lower Merion. As was the case all weekend, Amherst’s WJUC US National team member Josephine “Jo-Z” Coppinger ran the Hurricane’s show, with just about every other pass running through her nimble hands. Lower Merion held a stifling zone for most of the game, but ran up against Coppinger’s punishing field vision and brutally accurate throws. Amherst was also keyed by the consistent play of April Weintraub, Elende Connor, and Fernanda Brena. Lower Merion capitalized on several uncharacteristic Amherst drops — as well as the extremely athletic play of Bethany Eldridge — to keep the score close for the first half, but ended up falling 8-13.\n\nFor the Hurricane boys, their biggest test came from a pool play matchup with a resilient and flashy Northampton team coached by Callahan front-runner Jeff Babbitt. Primary handlers Amiel Hanley, Zach Dietz, and Zach Levitt buoyed the Blue Devils with quick disc movement, converting with high frequency Amherst’s few turns to stay within three at the half against the Amherst machine. But Amherst’s depth tipped the scales in the second half and the Hurricanes held Northampton to just a one more goal behind complete play from Luke Webb, Ryan Dinger, and Oliver Fay, along with shut-down deep defense from Noah Zobel.\n\nWith the sun fully out on Sunday afternoon and wind building for the first time all weekend, the Amherst teams mirrored each other in their final games, each going up 5-0 right out of the gate.\n\nThe girls endured some resistance from Lexington, who rebounded somewhat to bring the score to 4-9. Tess Johnson repeatedly broke Amherst with high-release backhands, Mira Anderberg opened up the middle of the field with key receptions, and Lenna Wolffe pushed the disc upfield in high wind trap situations. Lexington continued to rely on their zone in the second half, but Amherst repeatedly broke upwind with 30+ throw, patient possessions. The Hurricane’s wrapped up the finals 15-5 to take their hometown title.\n\nFollowing their hot finals start, the Amherst boys ended up closing out half 8-1 against Columbia, who managed to pull out a 10-7 semifinals win against Northampton. Columbia successfully converted a few short-field possessions, but had a challenging time moving the disc up the field against Amherst’s intelligent front-field zone and back-field person defense. Amherst kept up their powerful short game, earning the majority of the goals on boring possessions supported by a chorus of calls for “Dribble! Dribble! Dribble!” from coach Joe Costello. The Hurricanes never let up and closed out the game 15-4 on a short upline goal from stand-out all-star Luke Webb.\n\nNorthampton coach Lee Feldscher summed up Amherst’s weekend quite adeptly: “It’s just like Amherst is playing another game.”\n\nOther Observations\n\nCoach Chris Strahler is doing awesome things in Maine at Fryeburg. His girls team played well all weekend, putting up eight points against Amherst, the only goals allowed by the Hurricane’s during Saturday’s pool play, and finished fourth on the weekend.\n\nLincoln-Sudbury’s Aaron Epstein is a player to track; he has excellent playing maturity, field sense, and sharp fundamentals.\n\nIn honor of the 25th anniversary of the Amherst Invitational, VC and Joe Costello presented Tiina Booth with a very limited edition commemorative disc. Tiina’s auctioning off a small number of the discs to benefit AGE UP, GUM, the NUTC Scholarship Fund, UMass Men’s Ultimate, the US Women’s National Team, and Without Limits. The auctions are now online at ebay.\n\nJim Pistrang’s Amherst Middle School team is a joy to watch. Seeing his middle school girls put together clean disc movement and make great defensive stops against high school competition is impressive to see.",

  "latent_633": "Not the leader in the clubhouse: Gov. Pat McCrory plays a round in May. Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina’s gubernatorial race broke wide open this week as Democrat Roy Cooper galloped to a 9-point lead ahead of his rival, current Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. A Monmouth poll released on Wednesday suggests the race continues to break the Democrat’s way, with Cooper solidifying the lead he has been steadily building for months. Several factors contribute to Cooper’s ascendance: Independents have a slight preference for him over McCrory, while Cooper boasts higher favorability ratings than the incumbent governor. (More voters view McCrory unfavorably than favorably.) And Hillary Clinton is polling ahead of Donald Trump in the state, likely pulling Cooper along with her.\n\nThe biggest drag on McCrory appears to be HB2, the anti-LGBTQ law the governor signed in March and has vigorously defended since. According to the Monmouth poll, 55 percent of voters disapprove of HB2, while only 36 approve of the measure. Seventy percent of voters believe the law has harmed North Carolina’s reputation nationally, while just 9 percent say it has improved the state’s image. Among those who approve of HB2, 41 percent say it has been bad for North Carolina’s reputation; only 21 percent say it has been good for the state’s image nationwide.\n\nCooper has run on an anti-HB2 platform, sharply criticizing McCrory for signing and supporting a law that revokes municipal LGBTQ nondiscrimination ordinances and prevents trans people from using certain bathrooms. (In his role as attorney general, Cooper refused to defend the law against court challenges.) This strategy seems to be quite wise, given the statewide unease over HB2 and its effect on North Carolina’s image and economy.\n\nDespite his trouncing in the polls, McCrory has not learned any lessons about HB2’s toxicity. His latest approach is to depict himself as a martyr being crucified by political correctness. A recent McCrory ad implied that Cooper’s support of trans rights would make children vulnerable to sexual predators. McCrory, the ad declares, is “standing up for us under extreme pressure and doing what’s right.” In his heart, McCrory may sincerely believe that demoting LGBTQ people to second-class citizenship qualifies as “doing what’s right.” But the voters of North Carolina appear to disagree.",
  "latent_752": "This article has been updated with additional information. - Ed.\n\nIt's December now on the East Coast. Fun cars are going away. They're going into storage units, garages, under tents and heavy tarps, because winter is coming. California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada . . . you don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like to have Mother Nature test you like Toriel. And like that obscure video game reference I just made, the only way you can win is not to fight.\n\nDon't take your car out in winter in Pennsylvania. You will loose. Our air is never dry. The show is wet and heavy, not that Park City, Telluride fluffy-stuff that is oh-so whimsical. No, East Coast snow compacts into ice and goes right for your wheel well, where the metal is nice and weak.\n\nPennsylvania Department of Transportation, and most other Northeast transportation departments for that matter, pre-salt roads in anticipation for snow. Pre-salting the roads is exactly what it sounds like. Dump trucks, filled with the brownest salt available, scatter the aggregate sodium chloride out the back via a sideways spinning hamster wheel.\n\nSalt eats clear coat and causes corrosion. Even worse, when municipalities run out of road salt, they switch to a cheaper alternative: coal ash. Great, how much more carbon can you get? How about the black byproduct of 1,000 coal stoves and power plants?\n\nThe result of all this abuse from Mother Nature is that Pennsylvanians and other East Coasters are at the sword's-tip of fanatical car care. Oh sure, there's your California carnauba waxes and your pinkie-out water-less waxes. That nonsense is amateur-hour. The real technology is 3M clear wraps or, ceramic applications. That's why I went to Urban Werks' open house just south of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nI was able to sit down with Neil Maser, the owner of Urban Werks Garage and lean the modern way to keep your east coast car looking like a west coast car.\n\n\"Better than clear wraps is ceramic over-coating. The product also comes in variations which allows the undercarriage to be treated as well as your paint work, glass, and trim. It's a liquid that goes on in stages, in layers. I mean, you need work fast because once you start, you have eight hours before whatever you applied to a vehicle cures and hardens,\" said Maser.\n\nI'm guilty of over-waxing cars because I am terrified of that first unexpected snowfall. Ceramic coating is different, though. \"Ceramic coating replaces waxing. It goes on top of your clear-coat. It is a covalent bond to your paint as opposed to a physical bond like wax,\" said Maser. \"Once ceramic is bonded, it is five times stronger than your clear-coat alone.\"\n\nMaser showed me a bottle of \"Ceramic Pro,\" the product he uses. It was a small brown bottle about the size of a hotel shampoo bottle, \"This is good for, at the very least, one or two cars,\" said Maser.\n\n\"Just that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yea,\" more if you have a smaller car like your Honda Fit. \"It goes on in thin layers. One of the tests you can do with ceramic coatings, I saw a guy do this—the lighter test. He took the hard plastic end of a cigarette lighter and start pegging his car with it. He looked like he was leaving these huge gouges in the paint. And, with a rag, he just wiped them off, it blends itself back together so nicely.\"\n\n\"How you do you bond clear ceramic to a car's paint?\" I ask.\n\n\"First you have to get all of the existing wax off. A mild solvent will do that, you just spray the car down. Then you need to get the top layer of the paint as clean as you can, clay it down. Then, with microfiber applicators, apply the liquid ceramic over everything, wheels and trim. Then, after each coat, there's a forty-five minute wait time between coats. Again, between the base coat and the top coat, you have an eight-hour window before it all cures. It's a nightmare if you miss that window and you have to take a layer off for whatever reason. You have to move.\"\n\nI think for a moment and say: \"Say you did it to my Honda Fit. I use that thing all the time, in all weather. I drove it to Denver, down to Tampa around around Pennsylvania in the slush. How long can I expect ceramic to stay on?\"\n\n\"Two layers will last you five years with general maintenance, which means: wash your car regularly and inspect your coating yearly. The coating includes a base cost and a top coat, which are different,\" said Maser.\n\n\"Even with the mess? Will it yellow like a clear wrap might?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"What is the price point?\"\n\n\"It varies, based on how big your car is. I mean, A Ford-F250 is going to cost more to bake ceramic onto it than your Honda,\" said Maser.\n\nMaser gave me a tour of his shop, it is a 1960's service station that still has the glass pump attendant booth out near where the gas pumps would have been. It's storage now. Each bay is long and tall, enough to handle box trucks. \"We use heat lamps in here to facilitate ceramic curing,\" added Maser.\n\nI left the Urban Werks' open house thinking about 80's cars—vehicles that lie between adored classics and modern vehicles that are still new. They're out there, in yards or barns or half-finished in alleyways. The weather is pounding them and, often times, the builds are so budget that car-care or paint care isn't part of the budget. What will become of them? What became of all the Ford Mavericks?\n\nCeramic coating is a good thing for any investment and I should be happy because it is going to keep the collector car market good for another ten years, especially for those with means to do it. I thought about Porches.\n\nThe good news is, because of the rotten East Coast weather, body and paint protection is advancing by the means of necessity.",
  "latent_967": "Earlier today at a keynote presentation for their GPU Technology Conference (GTC) China 2017, NVIDIA’s CEO Jen-Hsun Huang disclosed a few updated details of the upcoming Xavier ARM SoC. Xavier, as you may or may not recall with NVIDIA current codename bingo, is the company's next-generation SoC.\n\nEssentially the successor to the Tegra family, Xavier is planned to serve several markets. Chief among these is of course automotive, where NVIDIA has seen increasing success as of late. However, similar to their talk at the primary GTC 2017, at GTC China NVIDIA is pitching Xavier as an “autonomous machine processor,” identifying markets beyond automotive such as drones and industrial robots, pushing a concept in line with NVIDIA’s Jetson endeavors. As a Volta-based successor to the Pascal-based Parker, Xavier does include Volta’s Tensor cores, something that we noted earlier this year, and is thus more suitable than previous Tegras for the deep learning requirements in autonomous machines.\n\nIn the keynote, Jen-Hsun additionally revealed updated sampling dates for the new SoC, stating that Xavier would begin in Q1 2018 for select early development partners and Q3/Q4 2018 for the second wave of partners. This timeline actually represents a delay from the originally announced Q4 2017 sampling schedule, and in turn suggests that volume shipments are likely to be in 2019 rather than 2018.\n\nMeanwhile on the software side of matters, Jen-Hsun also announced TensorRT 3, with a release candidate version immediately available as a free download for NVIDIA developer program members. Introduced under its current branding in 2016 and a critical part of NVIDIA's neural networking software stack, TensorRT is programmable AI inference software that takes computational graphs created by traditional frameworks (e.g. Caffe, TensorFlow) and then compiles and optimizes it for NVIDIA CUDA hardware. At the moment, this includes the Tesla P4, Jetson TX2, Drive PX 2, NVIDIA DLA, and Tesla V100. During the keynote, NVIDIA also formally disclosed that a number of large Chinese companies (Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, JD.com, and Hikvision) were now utilizing TensorRT.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\n[This article was originally written by Ahmed Metwally, Timeline Interactive CEO, for Interactive Age magazine in May 2010.]\n\nWhen I tell people that I work with Timeline Interactive, a gaming company in Egypt. people usually stare. The brave ones would comment politely that they did not know of a gaming industry in Egypt or the Middle East for that matter. What I tell them is that they are both right and wrong.\n\nThe challenges are quite real for those interested in developing games in the Middle East, a region with few hardcore garners, zero publishers, reluctant investors and no industry specific education program. However, we have certainly done it and we are seeing a strong trend that leads us to believe that we are part of a rising industry in the region.\n\nVery few investors and entrepreneurs in the Middle East are eager to rake the initiative and become part of such a new ecosystem. Nevertheless, as Gene William Mauch once said, “you can’t lead anyone else further than you have gone yourself.” And we are pleased to be on the forefront of this new regional market.\n\nIn a new market, as with all startups, getting funding is no easy task. However, we did It by taking advantage of our strong team’s history. Mostafa Hafez, our co-founder and technical director, originally co-founded Artificial Studios, a US-Egyptian video game development studio.\n\nMostafa brought in Mohamed Samir, our co-founder and technical lead, to help him build Reality, a gaming engine that Epic games acquired in zoos. After the acquisition, Artificial Studios Egypt split and became Timeline Interactive. The ream then caught the attention of the Technology Development Fund and EFG-Hermes. a leading investment firm, which invested in the comp any to help take it to the next stage.\n\nEarly on, we had to make a decision on whether to target the Middle East market specific ally or to target the global market as a whole. So, we had to ask the obvious question: how many garners are there in Egypt or the Middle East and what are they like? The exact numbers have never been officially measured, but research shows that there are just as many gainers in Egypt as anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe only difference, however, is that the majority of Egyptians and Middle Easterners tend to be casual garners with a focus on PC games, and an unyielding preference for multiplayer soccer games. Once they’ve played a good soccer match, they may shift to their second preference, strategy games.\n\nThe story is a bit different for consoles like PlayStation3 and Xbox36o. Even with three hundred million people and thousands of PS3s being sold every year, the Middle East is still considered a virgin market, albeit with huge potential. And in today’s global village, the Middle Eastern consumers, like any others, are always looking for well known AAA titles. Everyone wants to play the big blockbusters that everyone else is playing.\n\nSince our early strategy was to develop action games for consoles such as PS3 and Xbox36o, it was becoming obvious that building a game that solely targets the Middle East as a region would be a very risky endeavor. Therefore, we opted to target the global market as a whole.\n\nThis lead to the release of CellFactor: Psychokinetic Wars in June 2009, a downloadable multi-player First-Person Shooter (FPS), on the PS3 and Xbox360 to a worldwide audience. This experience has cemented our vision to develop games that would release worldwide.\n\nThis does not preclude us of course from looking for concepts that draw from our culture. We are quite confident that a video game which leverages some aspects of the Arabian culture while maintaining a worldwide appeal would have a stronger chance of success regionally and globally. The success of Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia series would certainly reinforce this.\n\nApart from the business challenges, we have also faced organizational ones. There are many talented resources in a country of 80 million people and tuition free universities that graduate 5,000 computer science and computer engineering students every year. Yet, hiring the right resources for Timeline has not been an easy task.\n\nOne of the first issues that we encounter is the lack ad professional experience. With this industry being almost non-existent in the Middle East, finding people with the required experience and skills to participate in the development of a video game title can be rather difficult.\n\nAt Timeline, we have built a six month mentorship program that walks new qualified resources through the different aspects of video game development and immerses them in the experience. Three months into the program, new Timeliners begin assisting their mentors with their deliverables. Six months in, they are fully productive and are tasked as full junior resources on projects.\n\nOnce the Egyptian talent is fostered, the outcome is a diversity of unique and impressive creativity and artistic talent. Working against the well established stereotype, our aim at Timeline is not to simply compete on cost, which tends to be the main competitive advantage of any overseas outfit. Instead, our goal is to continuously compete on creativity and innovation. Being very cost effective never hurts though! So we are constantly working on building the right diverse team that can grow to compete on a global scale.\n\nAnother challenge is our geographical location. It is difficult to meet in person on a regular basis with publishers. Therefore, we always make it a priority to focus on our communication and coordination with the publisher’s team to overcome that psychological barrier associated with working with remote teams.\n\nHowever, being located in Egypt does have 115 advantages. Egypt is centrally positioned when dealing with teams from around the world. For example, while working on CellFactor with Immersion and Ubisoft, we managed 12 teams working on the title around the world.\n\nBeing located in Egypt was optimal as we could easily communicate with Ubisoft’s testing teams in India & Europe early in the day and have our regular stat us meetings with the producers in San Francisco by the end of the day.\n\nIn our experience we find that development of video games in Egypt has been an interesting, yet challenging endeavor. With the numerous challenges we face along the way developing a video game title in Egypt success becomes quite an exemplary achievement.\n\nThe Middle East is still considered a virgin market.\n\nAs we continue to strive for more we look forward to introduce diversity into the video game arena. Due to Egypt’s unique geographic location and varying topology, various cultures exist today: in the North, you have a Mediterranean marine centered culture, In the South, an African Nubian one, in the dessert, an Arabian Nomadic one, while a farming one exists on the banks of the Nile. This offers us a very rich palette to draw from.\n\nApart from the abundance of mythological tales, historic events and modem stories from Nobel Prize winning authors that we can weave into future titles, we are leveraging unique art forms inspired by Pharaonic, ancient and modern Islamic into new art concepts.\n\nEgypt has always been known for its innovation in the movie and the music industries in the Middle East. At Timeline we plan to build on that, and remain the regional pioneers in the video game industry. We will always focus on using our local resources to penetrate the international market. We believe that the Middle East market will follow suit on its own.",

  "latent_1808": "The Trump method really works!\n\nAs the old saying goes, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice … Republicans officially have no shame?\n\nAfter Donald Trump bragged about serial sexual assault on tape, a number of high-profile Republicans declared that they could no longer support his presidential bid. Despite rumors that the Republican National Committee was exploring ways to drop Trump, chairman Reince Priebus settled for issuing a weak statement saying “no woman” should be discussed in such vulgar terms. Trump apologized, downplayed the tape as “locker-room talk,” and remained adamant that the 16-plus women who’d accused him of sexual assault were lying. Eventually most Republicans wound up rallying behind their candidate, even if it meant never looking their teenage daughter in the eye again.\n\nWhen several women accused Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct last month, some believed that this time might be different. Suddenly powerful men are facing serious repercussions for abuse allegations, and the Moore allegations involved children; one woman said he molested her when she was 14, and another said he assaulted her when she was 16. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Moore should quit the race, every other GOP senator backed away from Moore, and the RNC pulled out of its joint fundraising agreement with the candidate. The White House said Trump believed “if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”\n\nBut Moore ignored these calls and adopted Trump’s playbook. He suggested he was being targeted because he dared to challenge the GOP Establishment, and cast himself as the victim of a liberal-media conspiracy. As with Trump, the strategy worked. A recent poll found 71 percent of Alabama Republicans think the allegations are false. After failing to find any workable ploy to replace Moore or cancel the election, McConnell stopped condemning him on Sunday, saying, “I’m going to let the people of Alabama make the call.”\n\nThen on Monday, President Trump made his endorsement of Moore official with a tweet and a phone call to the candidate. Later in the day — even as one of Moore’s accusers produced physical evidence bolstering her claim that she dated Moore when he was 34 and she was 17 — the RNC resumed its support for Moore. There was no official announcement and the details of the arrangement are unclear, but the news was confirmed by the Washington Post and an RNC official told Breitbart, “We stand with the president.”\n\nMoore will get an additional $1.1 million boost from the pro-Trump group America First Action, according to the Post.\n\nSeveral Republicans remain unwilling to welcome a man accused of preying on underage girls into their midst. A spokesperson for Senator Mike Lee said he’s called for Moore to step down and “nothing has changed.” Former GOP presidential nominee (and potential 2018 Senate candidate) Mitt Romney reiterated his condemnation of Moore, and Senator Jeff Flake echoed his remarks:\n\nRoy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017\n\n.@MittRomney is right. A Roy Moore victory is no victory for the GOP and the nation. https://t.co/ZVSZTE4GFR — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017\n\nMoore used this as more fodder for his argument that he’s on Trump’s side, not that of the Establishment.\n\nEither @MittRomney has lost his courage or he doesn’t care about truth anymore. Sad day!\n\nAmerica’s reawakening was led by @realDonaldTrump, not you Mitt.#DefeatTheElite #DrainTheSwamp — Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) December 4, 2017\n\nMoore is still likely to face an immediate ethics probe if he’s elected to the Senate on December 12, but some senators are softening their position on him.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, the second-ranking GOP senator, said he’d like to see that ethics probe if Moore wins, but added, “None of us get to vote on who’s the senator from Alabama. Just Alabama voters do. So I think we have to respect their decision — whatever it is.”\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch agreed, and noted that he hasn’t been accused of molesting any girls recently. “Many of the things he allegedly did are decades ago. So it’s hard to — that’s a decision that has to be made by the people in that state,” said Hatch. “If they make that decision, who are we to question them?”",
  "latent_1952": "When it’s estimated that over half of Quebecers struggle with literacy issues and new media are dominated by English-language content, the need for strengthening the French language shouldn’t be debatable; how to achieve tangible results for francophones, however, is.\n\nCulture Minister Hélène David announced on Tuesday that modifications in Quebec language law would force companies whose trademarked English names are protected to add French elements to their facades in the form of a descriptor, slogan or advertisement that communicates some form of commercial message.\n\nThese are measures that are already adopted by the overwhelming majority of Quebec retailers, making the new regulations redundant at best. While it would be advisable for any Quebec business to communicate to its clients in French, it should not be the government’s role to dictate to entrepreneurs in the private sector how to go about doing that (the presence of the French language in the public sector has been, and should continue to be, protected by law).\n\nRestrictions on the most basic, widely accepted principles of free expression and commerce have been the norm in Quebec for about four decades. Language hawks remain unsatisfied. Rather than reflecting on their failures regarding, most crucially, literacy or alternative, proven methods of strengthening languages — namely education and promotion — the hawks would prefer the xenophobic status quo, or worse. Their views are irrational, warped by prejudice and tales of past abuses, real and imagined (like the mythical “grosses madames de chez Eaton”).\n\nThe new regulations, David said, are meant to demonstrate that “we’re indeed in Quebec and not in Maine or Massachusetts.” Setting aside the unnecessary slight against our Northeastern trading partners, presenting the English language as inherently offensive, only the most delusional language hawks believe that contemporary Quebec is not already linguistically unique in North America, and visibly so.\n\nThe Office québécois de la langue française, charged with policing language, would apply David’s regulations. According to recent data from the OQLF itself, French service is available at 97 per cent of businesses in downtown Montreal and at 93 per cent in the largely anglophone West Island. While linguistic fundamentalists wouldn’t be satisfied with a francization rate of 99.99 per cent, the silent majority of rational Quebecers are not expressing any desire to crack down on minority-owned businesses, not that blaming minorities for failures in francophone leadership is ever acceptable.\n\nDavid, who holds a PhD in psychology and was a vice-rector at Université de Montréal, is not the prototypical language hawk. She’s pigeonholed herself into that role on the language file, though, by basing proposed legislation on tired, unprovable tropes.\n\nSome will argue these vaguely intolerant regulations are necessary in order to appear “strong” on cultural issues. Premier Philippe Couillard has already proven that hawkish positions on language are unnecessary to win over modern Quebecers who, typically, embrace various forms of English language media without abandoning their language and culture.\n\n“For anybody to say that it’s not advantageous to someone to become bilingual, or for our kids to be bilingual, is nonsense,” Couillard said, during the 2014 election campaign, no less.\n\nJust as it makes no sense to oppose individual bilingualism, opposition to institutional bilingualism is also senseless. Any kind of anti-bilingualism conveys extreme ignorance and fear of minority cultures. The fear is irrational, and against emerging research that associates multilingualism with better brain health. While hawks perceive Quebec to be anglicizing and culturally “suicidal,” most Quebecers aren’t so paranoid and insecure.\n\nIt’s unfortunate, then, that the minister responsible for culture expresses some of the same insecurities as those on the most ethnocentric fringes of Quebec’s political class. This new Charter of Commercial Values of sorts is counterproductive and insulting to the collective intelligence of Quebecers who clamour for more educational resources, not more Parti Québécois-style scapegoating.\n\nDan Delmar is a public relations consultant at Provocateur Communications and host of The Exchange, Mondays and Wednesdays 8-10 p.m. on CJAD 800 Montreal.\n\ntwitter.com/DanDelmar",
  "latent_2058": "Last week, Marshall Project reporters Eli Hager and Alysia Santo published a detailed, disturbing investigation into a little-known system of private transportation companies used to move prisoners long distances between states and localities, primarily in the South and Midwest. They revealed an almost entirely unregulated industry profiting from the extradition of oftentimes low-level offenders in frequently brutal conditions — overseen by underpaid, undertrained and overworked guards. At least four deaths have occurred on private extradition vans run by the largest such company, Prisoner Transportation Services, since 2012. One was Steven Galack, who suffered from delusions and was allegedly beaten to death by other prisoners on a guard’s orders. Another man, who suffered from diabetes, had both legs amputated after three days in a van. The Marshall Project, a non-profit criminal justice news outlet, published the story in collaboration with the New York Times.\n\nHager and Santo spoke to Salon about the investigation. Below is an edited version of the interview:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThis was a remarkable and utterly heartbreaking investigation. It’s also a piece of the American criminal justice system that is, at first blush, pretty obscure. How did you find out about this network of privately run prisoner transport companies?\n\nSanto:It all started with a tip from a lawyer that was representing the family of Steven Galack. He had told the Atlanta Journal Constitution about his case, and we have partnered with that newspaper in the past for other projects, so they passed the tip on to us. We saw the brutality in the case and wondered: What else happens on these vans? How many others might have been hurt or killed while being moved across the country by these companies? And when we started to look into it we realized quickly that there was so much that needed to be exposed about this industry.\n\nThat's really interesting. I've always thought of The Marshall Project as ensuring a steady supply of criminal justice journalism that other outlets can't afford or don't have the sense to pay for on their own. But in this case, your history of collaboration actually led to the seemingly unthinkable: one publication handing over a tip to another publication better able to handle it?\n\nHager: The seemingly unthinkable, collaboration between competitors. That also happened with our big story last year, An Unbelievable Story of Rape. Both The Marshall Project and ProPublica were working on the same story, realized it halfway through, and decided to team up.\n\n(Eli Hager; photo by Ivar Vong)\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat were the basic building blocks of this story? What kind of documents and sources did you have to track down to establish what was happening in these vans? I take it the point of entry was interviewing Galack's attorney? Where did you go from there?\n\nHager: It definitely started with Galack's attorney in Georgia, Larry Domenico. He handed over just about everything he had (there was a lot of stuff he couldn't give us because it was sealed), including logs of all the stops that were made by the van that Galack was on; videotaped depositions of other prisoners on Galack's van; a 2011 PTS operations manual that told us a lot about internal policies; and even the invoice that PTS sent to Butler County, Ohio, billing Butler County over $1,000 for Galack's transport even though Galack was dead! So we built out Galack's case before we did anything else...then we essentially compiled a list of all the for-profit extradition companies we could find. We ran all of those companies through Pacer and Westlaw, and then Nexis, creating a massive database of lawsuits, crashes and escapes that each company had been involved in.\n\nThat was a chilling detail. The company charged for every mile up to the point where he was died, or found dead.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHager: Exactly. They did not successfully bring him to his destination, but they sent a bill anyway\n\nSanto: From there, we went on to survey each state's corrections department, as well as asking major cities whether they hire prison transport companies, to get a sense of scope. We also requested invoices from smaller localities where we had established they used prison transport companies, so that we could identify people on these vans, how far they were coming from, and how much the company was charging. And we filed requests with the federal Department of Transportation about each of the companies we could identify.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n(Alysia Santo; photo by Cassandra Santo)\n\nSo when you say you compiled a list of extradition companies, you did so by doing the drudgery: contacting each corrections department one at a time? So much investigative reporting is not something out of \"All the President's Men.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHager: No, we compiled a list first. We used the DOT's company listings as well as the most thorough Google search we could muster. Together, that gave us about 25 company names. Then we contacted all 50 DOC's to ask them point-blank, do you use these companies? And meanwhile, as Alysia mentioned, we were filing records requests with the DOT, essentially asking them to give us every audit and enforcement action they'd ever done on all of these companies.\n\nBut yes, it was a lot of drudge work at first. It got more personal when we started talking to victims and later to ex-employees of the companies.\n\nIt was remarkable how many of the people who suffered horrible abuse in these vans were wanted on the most minor charges imaginable—one person picked up because of charges, later dropped, that she had used someone else’s Bed, Bath & Beyond gift card and another who returned a rental car late. Another violated probation on a theft conviction. Were these the stories you anticipated?\n\nSanto: We didn't really have expectations about what people were being extradited for, but we did find it surprising how low level the charges were. We were also shocked to discover that those being transported to face minor charges were crammed into vans with people convicted of murder or child molestation. And then for days, these people were all forced to remain in very close quarters together, with no way to sleep or stretch. All the while, two guards are expected to maintain a close eye on everyone in the van, while barely getting any rest themselves. The idea that both the companies and the governments that hire them considered this a way to move people without endangering the public or the passengers was quite hard to believe.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne thing that stuck out in the story was not so much that the guards were horrible people—though the guard that directed the prisoners to assault a delusional prisoner is an exception—but that the business model had them working in an impossible situation. It seems like this issue is one where the sorry state of the economy for poor and working people is a factor on both the prisoner and guard side.\n\nHager: Yes, I agree. We talked to dozens and dozens of guards for this story, and they were almost all aware of the impossible situation they were put in. Essentially, these companies hire a lot of ex-military guys (we were often told that this was because veterans know how to take orders) and give them a training that lasts only a few days and consists of teaching them how to put on handcuffs, how to spray pepper spray, and a review of how to fill out paperwork. Then the companies pay them just a little more than minimum wage, no overtime, to drive 24 hours a day for 3, 4, 5, 8 days in a row, with a bunch of unruly prisoners in the back. So, needless to say, they were in a hard position, and a lot of the problems—crashes caused by guards getting no sleep, escapes allowed by guards with little training; and even some of the abuses—are more the product of the business model than the individual human beings\n\nWas it hard to get former guards to speak to you? Or did the fact that they felt less like targets of your investigation, and more like victims themselves, make them more willing to open up?\n\nSanto: When you report on criminal justice, one of the biggest reporting challenges is getting corrections officers, prosecutors, and others on the law enforcement side to speak candidly with you. But this was the opposite. We found that many people who had worked for these transportation companies were eager to talk about their experiences. So yes, like you said, I think the fact that they experienced inhumane treatment as well made them more willing to open up. A lot of guards we spoke with felt that they had been placed into a situation where the company they worked for didn't care about them. Not only didn't care about them, but actively put them into situations that were dangerous for them and the prisoners they were entrusted with. And they resented that.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat about the company executives? How did you get them on the phone? They seem like the more standard investigation \"target\" and they likely knew that. Though the naiveté of some people doing bad things can be really striking...\n\nHager: We tried to know everything we could possibly know about these companies before calling them up. When I first called PTS, I spoke at great length with Robert Downs, their chief operating officer. Within a week after that call, we never heard from PTS again, despite visiting their office in Nashville in person. Some of the smaller companies, though, were a little more willing to talk with us. Alysia had conversations with officials at a few of those companies. They were more like mom-and-pop shops, and despite the inherent problems with the business model, they saw themselves as just trying their best to run a small business.\n\nLocal news articles played a role in your investigation. I think that’s true in a lot of big picture national reporting. What did you learn about the current news ecosystem and the role of local journalists?\n\nSanto: Local news stories were an important source of information for us, particularly when it came to our research about escapes and crashes. And that really emphasizes just how important local media is to reporters working on national stories. As local reporting loses resources and in many cases closes down, it's a real loss for everyone, not just the community served by that news source. The negligence of these companies was leading to similar bad outcomes across the United States, and there would have been no way to connect those dots without that local reporting.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne thing that you didn’t get into much in the story, and it was a long story so I’m sure there was a lot you had to leave out, is why and when jurisdictions started to turn to private companies. Did you have a sense of what the history is here? And why do you think the use of private prisoner transport is so concentrated in the South and Midwest?\n\nSanto:Private prison transportation has been around since at least the '80s (although it was a different mix of companies doing the work at that time), and the rise of this business model coincided with the explosion of America's incarcerated population. And it's attractive to cash-strapped municipalities because traditional extraditions, in which local deputies are sent out of state for one person, are very expensive. It's my impression that the concentration of these prison transports in the South and Midwest is due, at least in part, to the geography of the population those areas. People are more spread out, while in the northeast, for example, the population is more concentrated and therefore if a suspect is a few states away, the trip isn't as long.\n\nA lot of people are finishing reading this story and want to know: what can they do to help put an end to this? On one level, it seems like the federal government can do something. It’s interstate commerce of a grisly sort, after all.\n\nWith Steven Galack, who was apparently beaten to death by other prisoners on the order of a guard after he became delusional and disruptive, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation looked into it and didn’t do anything. They told you that the investigation was as “thorough as the circumstances warranted.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSanto: Because these transports cross state lines, different government agencies disagree about who should take the case. And while the Department of Justice is tasked with enforcing Jeanna's Act, the only federal law regulating prison transportation, the law has been used to enforce a penalty against a prison transport company just once. So, that's a place where improvement could start, but I should add that Jeanna's Act has more to do with preventing escapes than protecting prisoners’ rights.\n\nI'm a big believer that journalism can make change, and so one thing that can be done is for reporters to localize these stories, and educate people in their communities about how prison transports are done and where their tax money is going to for this service.\n\nInteresting. Is the Marshall Project actively reaching out to local reporters to collaborate on drilling in deeper to tell the local story?\n\nSanto: We created a reporting guide so that other journalists can do a similar investigation in their state or locality.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHager: MuckRock also did this the day after our story came out.\n\nSanto: And we are asking that if reporters do their own stories, to send them to us, and we will compile them into one place.\n\nHager: One of the fascinating — and sad — things about some of the incidents we investigated is that they happened on a van that was in motion — crossing jurisdictional boundaries every hour. So which jurisdiction should investigate if something goes wrong on a moving van? In Steven Galack's case, he was allegedly beaten (according to two of his fellow prisoners and an autopsy report/photos that show bruises all over his body, a broken rib, a chipped tooth, and cuts on his face) somewhere between Athens and Dalton, Georgia. But his body was not discovered by the guards, they say, until the van was 70 miles down the road, in Tennessee. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation arrived on the scene to investigate at around 7:00 p.m. By around 3:00 a.m. that same night, they placed a call to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to say that if a crime happened, it happened in Georgia. And then they let the van, and all its passengers, continue on its route the very next day. Georgia never followed up, in part because the autopsy eventually came back as \"undetermined.\" The point is that this is an industry that likely needs federal oversight, because it operates across state lines. But the federal law that is supposed to generally regulate the industry has only been enforced one time in 16 years.",
  "latent_2082": "My artwork and other practices with hides, bones and other animal remains have always been intensely spiritual. I didn’t like seeing them displayed as mere trophies or status symbols, and so set out to remake them as sacred creations and beloved personal artifacts, guides in costumed shapeshifting and curiosities for consideration. I wanted them to be revered, not merely possessed.\n\nThere are a lot of factors outside of my control in this. I can’t control who buys a particular item (other than turning away the occasional rude customer) or what they do with something I made once they have it. I’ve just had to learn to let go and let gods in that regard. But I can do my best to seek out my target audience and present my work in a way that will appeal to them, and keep working my intent into everything I create. And I add a bit of a ritual to it, too, whether you want to believe it changes things on a distinctly spiritual level, or simply helps me stay focused on my task.\n\nI realized recently that while I reference the ritual I do quite a bit, I haven’t actually written about it much. So I figured now would be as good a time as any to share it with you in detail. You’re welcome to try it out for yourself, modify it as needed, but please do give credit when sharing.\n\nThere are three parts of the ritual: the meditation, the purification, and the offering.\n\nThe meditation is the part that takes the longest. I’ll sit with each piece that I’ve created, and meditate with the spirits of the animals whose remains are incorporated into the art. I have a conversation with them, and ask each of them to show me what they’d like me to know about their lives and deaths. Sometimes I get a vivid, play-by-play of their last moments; other times I get highlights of their lives, especially when they were young (even other animals like to reminisce about childhood). I’ve often gotten some of this information already; as I create the art I’m having an ongoing conversation with them about what I’m creating and what they’d like me to include, and it’s a good opportunity to chat with them about other things as well.\n\nThe purification involves a physical smudging of the completed artwork. I used to use sagebrush, but these days I tend more toward cedar or sweetgrass as I like the aroma better. I generally only use a tiny bit at one time; rather than burning an entire sage smudge stick, I’d just pull out one lone leaf and light it. Part of this is to keep from aggravating my asthma, but it’s also so I’m using fewer resources. One leaf purifies as well as thirty in my experience, even if it takes just a touch longer to smudge the entire piece. It’s really an issue of quality over quantity. Other forms of purification can work, too, though I recommend against water-based ones since water can hurt certain hides and other remains. I also say a prayer over each piece at this time, asking that they will go to someone who will love them and cherish them for who and what they are, and thanking them for letting me work with them in the first place.\n\nThe offering is the part that’s changed the most over the years. When I first got started, I would offer small drilled stones and shells to the totems of the animals whose remains I used. When I had enough to fill a small leather pouch dedicated to that totem, I would make the stones into a necklace, and then give it to someone who worked with that totem. Over time I became less enamored of this. What was I going to offer to the totems of the stones I made as offerings to the animals? After all, they’re a part of nature, too, not just objects to be given and taken. So I instead diverted the money I would have spent on the stones and shells toward donations to nonprofit groups, and increased my volunteer time to compensate as well.\n\nNo purification ritual goes exactly the same way as another. Sometimes the meditation is brief, other times it’s looooong. Occasionally I get a spirit making a special request for an offering or other gesture. That’s why I don’t have this all written out in one big “First say this, then do this” format. It’s more a set of guidelines than holy writ. The point is to remind myself that I am working with skin spirits and sacred remains, and that what I do is meant to honor.\n\nNote: If you enjoyed this post, please consider bringing home a copy of my book Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Uses of Animal Parts, which details my years of spiritual work with hides, bones and other animal remains, along with step by step instructions on how to make assorted ritual tools with them.\n\nShare this: Share\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nPocket\n\nTumblr\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nTwitter\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
  "latent_2103": "Saturday, March 23 will be a day to go down in history as featuring one of the biggest sporting events of all time.\n\nI’m not talking about the Super Bowl, the World Series, or even March Madness. It will not be host to hundreds of thousands of viewers on national television, nor will it be held in a gigantic stadium with cheerleaders and a halftime show. There will be no championship banners handed out, no golden rings given to the winner, and none of these faces will show up on ESPN’s Sportscenter that night.\n\nWhat it will do, however, is give a group of children and their families a chance to escape the everyday life of hospital visits, chemotherapy treatments, needles and IV’s galore, and the hectic life of a child with a life-threatening illness.\n\nRelentless 2013 is a powerlifting meet that started back in 2011 when a group of people came together in efforts to make life easier for their pastor. He had been diagnosed with cancer for the second time in three years, this time in his liver. Their pastor had decided to tattoo the word “Relentless” on his forearm as a reference to Daniel 3:18 and how he would not bow to this disease.\n\nScott Nutter and his wife Rachel Nutter, Minnesota representatives for the APF/AAPF and also part owners of Southside Athletic in Burnsville, MN, came together with fellow friend and part-owner Mike Hamilton (among a few others) to create what is now one of the most anticipated events of the year in the world of powerlifting.\n\nAs an attempt to raise funds to help their pastor pay for all of his stacking medical bills, the Nutters began reaching out to gym owners, professional lifters, equipment and supplement companies, and anyone in the industry who would listen. The Nutters are highly respected in the world of powerlifting, which was great for what they were trying to accomplish.\n\nMarch 19, 2011 finally came and Relentless was born. Some of the strongest men and women in the world came to the small city of Rosemount, Minnesota to compete in a sanctioned meet, but also as a benefit for Scott and Rachel’s pastor. Every entry fee, every admission ticket, every t-shirt sold, every hot dog sold, every item raffled in the silent auction and every other dollar raised went to this pastor.\n\nNot one single dime was taken in as profit. In the end, they were able to raise over $16,000 to give to this man and help make his and his family’s life easier.\n\nThis Saturday marks the third anniversary of Relentless. As they did last year, Relentless will be sponsoring HopeKids, an organization that helps children — and their families — who are suffering from life-threatening illnesses be able to enjoy their life and instill hope within them that they will make it through this difficult time.\n\nEach professional lifter is sponsoring a child individually, and their goal in the end is to top $100,000 raised for these kids and their families. So far, $80,000 has been donated. I have a feeling after the meet is over and all of the entry fees, admissions, and food and apparel sales are tallied, that they will reach their goal.\n\nThis is one of the most incredible sights you will ever see. In between the record-setting lifting, the most powerful individuals in the world will be spending time with young children who view them as superheroes. Some of the most well-known lifters in the sport take time to participate in a meet that makes them no money, and many of them have to travel great distances to get there.\n\nWhy do they do this? One word: hope.\n\nWith hope, anything is possible. With hope, these children can have faith in their tomorrows. And, boy am I thankful for the Nutters and Mr. Hamilton for starting this phenomenon two years ago. If it had not been for them, my father – Scott and Rachel’s pastor – may not had made it through his battle with liver cancer as well as he did.\n\nIf you would like to watch this Saturday, it begins at 9:00 am central time.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\n“Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” – Andre Gide\n\nThere is a global pogrom underway.\n\nThis is a terrible truth. And people tend to ignore terrible truths.\n\nSo it must be said again: There is a global pogrom underway.And there is another terrible truth: The global pogrom has been underway for more than a decade. It has taken lives. It has destroyed property. It has wounded, brutalized and terrified Jews and Jewish communities in many nations. And it is creating a silent exodus, a de facto expulsion, an ethnic cleansing in slow motion.This is a terrible truth that almost no one wants to acknowledge. But over the past month, it has become a truth that is impossible to ignore.Violence against Jews has been ongoing since the Palestinian terror war began in 2000. But the moment when the global pogrom became impossible to deny took place last month in France.On June 13, 2004, an ostensibly pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris quickly devolved into the pogrom that, perhaps, it was always meant to be. A mob of thugs descended upon the Synagogue de la Roquette, trapped the congregation inside, and tried to break in while brandishing deadly weapons.An eyewitness described how the crowd threw “stones and bricks at the building, ‘like it was an intifada.’” A Jewish leader made the horrifying statement, “We could have had something like Kristallnacht.”The attackers, he said, “Had rocks, glass, axes, knives... they were armed and I made sure that no one would leave the synagogue, in order to protect the lives of our people.”Due to the ineffectiveness of the French police, the synagogue and its congregation were only saved by the actions of Jewish self-defense groups.We have seen this before. There is only one word for mob attacks on Jews. Attempts to defile and destroy Jewish houses of worship.The desire to wound and kill defenseless human beings because they are Jews.And the indifference, incompetence, or collaboration of non-Jewish authorities: Pogrom.If what happened at the Synagogue de la Roquette is not a pogrom, then nothing is.It is far from over. Following the attack on la Roquette, the French authorities banned further anti-Israel demonstrations. The pogromists marched anyway. And, as is their wont, they went on a rampage. They stormed through the Jewish neighborhood of Sarcelles, destroying, looting, defacing and generally acting like what Mayor Francois Pupponi later called “a horde of savages.”At another illegal demonstration on July 26, protesters gave both the Nazi salute and its now-popular pogromist variation: the so-called “Quenelle,” popularized by a virulently racist comedian in order to skirt France’s laws against racial incitement.And the pogrom has gone global.In Antwerp, Haaretz reported, 500 people “protested” Israel’s war on Hamas by hailing a progromist who chanted “a call in Arabic that means ‘slaughter the Jews.’” Attendees “also called out ‘Jews, remember Khaybar, the army of Muhammad is returning,” referencing a seventh-century slaughter against Jews in Saudi Arabia.In Germany, protesters chanted, “Hamas Hamas Juden ins gas!” (“Hamas Hamas Jews to the gas!”). A 200-strong mob in Essen chimed in, “Scheiss Juden!” (“Jewish s**t”).In Berlin, “an angry mob” spewed rhetoric that would have enchanted the Fuhrer: “Jude, Jude feiges Schwein! Komm heraus und kämpf allein!” (“Jew, Jew, cowardly swine, come out and fight on your own!”).In nearby Austria, the pogrom invaded one of Europe’s last truly sacred places: the soccer field. During a friendly match between Lille and Maccabi Haifa, a group of thugs stormed the field and attacked the Israeli team.In London a series of protests have been fairly peaceful, but the rhetoric remained one of unrelenting incitement and defamation.As a result, the British Jewish community is now under siege. Death and bomb threats are flowing in by the dozen. Hate crimes are skyrocketing. A Muslim woman threw stones at a Jewish boy. A rabbi was the target of a gang attack. Chants of “Heil Hitler” are defiling Jewish neighborhoods.A global pogrom does not end at the borders of Europe. It has reached North America.In Boston, The Times of Israel reported that several pro-Israel students were “Surrounded by pro-Palestinian activists chanting ‘Jesus killers’ and ‘drop dead’” before being physically attacked. In Calgary, an entire family was assaulted by a mob of anti-Israel pogromists, sending several of them to the hospital. The attackers chanted “baby killers,” “kill Jews” and “Hitler should finish you off.” In New York, there were more chants of “baby killers” and the blood libel found itself resurrected.The pogrom has reached as far as Australia.Jews have been physically attacked, and the blood libel appeared again. A billboard was unfurled showing a caricature of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu with fangs dripping blood. Above were the words “can’t get enough.”In Turkey, the only Muslim country where a substantial Jewish population remains, the pogrom reached a fever pitch, with Prime Minister Recip Tayyep Erdogan and the Turkish media spewing anti-Semitic rhetoric. And there was mob violence, this time directed against the Israeli consulate and the ambassador’s residence. Pogromist graffiti read, “Die out murderer Jew!” This ongoing violence and murderous rhetoric has had an ominous result: Turkish Jews are leaving. The younger generation no longer feels it has a future in Turkey.Soon, this ancient community will likely no longer exist. Put simply, in Turkey, the global pogrom has become an act of expulsion and ethnic cleansing.And not only in Turkey. Seven decades after it handed most of its Jews over to extermination, France is now acquiescing in their expulsion. The Los Angeles Times reports, “In 2013, 3,288 French Jews left for Israel, a 72% increase from the year before, and the first time French émigrés outnumbered those from the United States.” In other words, French Jews believe that an Israel under Hamas rockets is safer than France.There is a global pogrom underway. I speak the terrible truth again because it must be spoken again.The global pogrom is driven by a simple motive: To brutalize, slaughter and expel a people against which it has ignited an inferno of racist hatred.The global pogrom operates with impunity.It has made life impossible for Jews in numerous countries.The global pogrom is now committing a crime against humanity: Expulsion and ethnic cleansing.And if it is not stopped, the global pogrom will spread.This is not just a Jewish issue. A global pogrom is a global issue. It forces us to ask if the world is capable of doing justice to one of its smallest minorities. And if it is not, we must speak the terrible truth that Haim Nahman Bialik spoke in the wake of another pogrom: “Let the throne be hurled down forever.”The author is a Tel Aviv-based writer and editor.

  "latent_2507": "Democratic victories in elections across the US this week showed the first concrete evidence of an emerging anti-Donald Trump coalition, analysts said.\n\n'Fever has broken,' says Hillary Clinton, after Democrat election wins Read more\n\nSweeping wins in Virginia and surprise gains in state legislative races – seen by many as a referendum on the president – have boosted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nBill Galston, a senior fellow in the Brookings Institution governance studies programme, said: “The thing I found most striking was the enormous increase in turnout, particularly on the Democratic side.\n\n“What that suggests is the energy and anger have shifted from the Republican side, where it has been located for a series of elections, to the Democratic side. Trump succeeded in mobilising his support before he succeeded in mobilising his detractors. He’s now reached phase two.”\n\nFor the first time, there is a tangible measure of an anti-Trump coalition.\n\n“It’s a negative coalition at this point,” Galston added. “Anger, fear, concern are bringing his adversaries together in the same way that antipathy to Barack Obama brought his adversaries together.\n\n“Republicans found they could get so far as the party of no. It all came out in the wash: they were the proverbial dog that caught the car and it’s been a rocky first year. The fight over what the Democratic party is for will be on hold until after the midterms.”\n\nIn some quarters, Tuesday’s results were called “the revenge of the suburbs”, as university-educated voters joined women and minorities in finding an outlet for their frustration against Trump, backing a new slate of female, African American and transgender Democrats.\n\nGalston said: “We know how minorities are going to vote. We know how whites with a lower education level are going to vote. The swing element in American politics is the mainly white college-educated. It’s a bit of a simplification to say the white middle-class suburbs are the new battleground, but that’s the heart of it.”\n\nYou had a massive turnout of the people Donald Trump has spent his presidency attacking Bill Galston, Brookings Institution\n\nDemocrats are now in a strong position for the midterms, Galston said. “It’s a foregone conclusion that Democrats will gain considerable ground in the House of Representatives. It’s not clear whether that will be enough to take control. If the elections were held tomorrow, the Democrats would take over the House – I’m quite confident of that.”\n\nThe elections were widely interpreted as a resounding verdict on the Trump presidency. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster at North Star Opinion Research, said: “It’s hard to interpret the result any other way.\n\n“The fact is it was not a lack of turnout among lethargic Republicans: Ed Gillespie got 17% more than the last Republican in the Virginia gubernatorial election. But you had a massive turnout of the people Donald Trump has spent his presidency attacking.\n\n“It’s a continuation of the very clear pattern of 2016. Republicans traded large, upscale, more diverse counties for smaller, low-scale, slow-growing, less diverse communities. This is not a foundation for long-term electoral success.”\n\nThere had been signs of momentum earlier this year in special elections in Georgia and elsewhere, as Democrats performed better than they typically would in Republican strongholds.\n\n“The wind is going to be blowing in the face of Republicans” in the midterms, Ayres said. “That’s not say they can’t hold the Senate and House with a good campaign and record.”\n\n‘Homogenising against Trump’\n\nThe women’s march in Washington dwarfed Trump’s inauguration crowd in January and there has been no shortage of anti-Trump satire from late-night TV hosts and wags on social media. But this week demonstrated that such sentiment could be channeled to the ballot box.\n\nDemocrats won the governors’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey, smashed a dominant Republican majority in the Virginia house of delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state senate. They have gained at least 30 seats since Trump won the White House a year ago, ending years of Republican momentum.\n\nJennifer Carroll Foy, an African American woman who won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, told MSNBC on Friday: “It really started with the election from last year. I just remember these feelings of fear and anxiety and helplessness and hopelessness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ralph Northam celebrates at his election night rally after winning the race for Virginia governor. Photograph: Aaron Bernstein/Reuters\n\n“I knew there needed to be a counterbalance, there needed to be a response to Trump and Trump-style politics, because he was just inserting so much misogyny and racism and bigotry. He ran on that platform and inserting that into our community. I knew we needed a response to that, someone who would be an advocate and say there are other options. There’s the Democratic option, which is the best option.”\n\nDan Cassino, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey, said: “The Democrats are homogenising against Trump. There were definitely Democrats who were not excited by Hillary Clinton, but we’re now seeing a Democratic party more united than the Republican party is. That’s a reversal of the last 30 years.\n\nDemocrats are angry and motivated; Republicans are fractured. If these trends keep up the midterms will be a wipeout Dan Cassino, Fairleigh Dickinson University\n\n“We also see a reversal of voting turnout. Democrats were always less likely to vote. This time Republicans stayed home. Democrats are angry and motivated; Republicans are fractured. If these trends keep up for the midterms, it will be a wipeout.”\n\nThe contrasting enthusiasm translates to candidates, Cassino added. “In New Jersey, candidate recruitment for Democrats is off the charts. On the other hand, a lot of Republicans are retiring. Democrats are coming out of the woodwork to run in 2018. Republicans are staying put and will wait for 2020 or 2022.”\n\nDemocrats still face a tall order. While Trump’s pariah status in the suburbs might swing the House, the vast majority of Senate seats at stake are in conservative rural states, where the president still commands a deep well of support.\n\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, struck a note of caution.\n\n“The reaction of Democrats with elation says more about Democrats than 2018,” he said. “I don’t think it was a wave election or a confirmation of doom for Republicans.\n\nTrump says Roy Moore should stand down if sex claims are true Read more\n\n“I think Democrats are so demoralised after 2016 that any kind of good news produces elation, but it feels quite strained and forced. There was a rush of over-interpreting. These are not bellwether areas. The headline would have been if Democrats did not do well.”\n\nJacobs added: “The expectation of this repudiation of Trump is overstated: we haven’t seen that. What’s going to happen in Ohio and in some the battleground states? Trump’s approval ratings are low but Democrats have their own disarray. Their most prominent figure, Bernie Sanders, is not even a Democrat. There is tremendous dissent and division. I don’t see grounds for breaking open the champagne in 2018.”\n\nShaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California, Riverside, said: “There have been these grass roots mobilizations all year. The question all along is whether these organisations can be translated into electoral victories. And the jury is still out a little on that.\n\n“The Democrats seem to think that harping on Trump’s personality will win them elections. I think most voters have a pretty good sense of Trump by now – they would like some policies that speak to their concerns.”",
  "latent_2537": "(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nMortgage rates moved higher this week following a sharp increase in long-term bond yields.\n\nAccording to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average climbed to 3.96 percent with an average 0.6 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 3.88 percent a week ago and 3.41 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed rate has remained below 4 percent for the past seven weeks.\n\n[No down payment?

It was 3.17 percent a week ago and 2.68 percent a year ago.\n\nThe movement of the 10-year Treasury bond tends to be one of the best indicators of where mortgage rates are headed. When yields rise, home loan rates tend to go up as well. In the past 10 days, the yield on the 10-year bond shot up 21 basis points to 2.35 percent on Tuesday before falling back to 2.33 percent on Wednesday. (A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.)\n\nBesides jitters over North Korea’s long-range-missile test, financial markets have been rattled by the Federal Reserve’s expected sell-off of its balance sheet. In minutes from the June meeting, which were released Tuesday, the central bank signaled that it will press ahead with unwinding its stimulus program and raising its benchmark rate.\n\n[The Federal Reserve remains divided over its long-term path]\n\nNonetheless, some observers say this latest rate surge may have already run out of steam. Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that two-thirds of the experts it surveyed predict rates will remain relatively stable in the coming week. Brett Sinnott, vice president of capital markets at CMG Financial, is one who expects rates to hold steady.\n\n“Fortunately for the housing market, political stories continue to dominate the news, which has allowed rates to remain fairly stable to start the summer,” Sinnott said. “It is still expected that the Fed will increase rates at least once more this year. So far, the moves have had little effect on mortgages.”\n\nMeanwhile, mortgage applications picked up slightly last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — increased 1.4 percent. The refinance index fell 0.4 percent, while the purchase index rose 3 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 44.9 percent of all applications.\n\n“Purchase applications increased last week and reached their highest level in two weeks as factors supporting housing in the U.S. remained healthy,” said Joel Kan, an MBA economist. “The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to its highest level since May 2017, following a jump in the U.S. 10-year Treasury, which was driven mainly by news that European economies have strengthened and the [European Central Bank] may be poised to tighten its accommodative policies. Refinance applications fell slightly in response and the refi index remained close to its 2017 year-to-date average.”",

Dignity.”\n\nAnthony Quintano/Civil Beat\n\nAgudelo was among the 63 percent of registered Hawaii voters who said they supported medical aid in dying in the latest Civil Beat poll.\n\nThe poll asked, “If the state Legislature were to bring up a revised ‘medical aid in dying’ bill again next year, would you support or oppose it, or would it not matter to you much either way?”\n\nOnly 22 percent told Civil Beat’s pollster they oppose they idea. Another 9 percent said they were unsure and 6 percent said it didn’t matter.\n\n“There used to be a stigma associated with it, but I think that’s largely gone,” said Matt Fitch, executive director of Merriman River Group, which conducted The Civil Beat Poll. “It’s supported across all four counties, both congressional districts, household income and education brackets.”\n\nConsistent Support\n\nCivil Beat’s poll, conducted Nov. 27-29, surveyed 843 registered voters statewide, 70 percent on landlines and 30 percent with cellphones. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3.4 percent.\n\nIt’s the second time in six months that Civil Beat has polled on the topic.\n\nThe results in a June poll were similar: 65 percent supported medical aid in dying while 18 percent opposed.\n\nA 2012 poll by Civil Beat found 56 percent of Hawaii voters were in favor of physician-assisted suicide, as it was called at the time.\n\nAll this week Civil Beat, is reporting on how registered Hawaii voters feel about controversial issues.\n\nOn Monday we reported that a strong majority of respondents want to hold a constitutional convention. Tuesday’s article showed similar enthusiasm for term limits and statewide citizen initiatives, while a plurality backed a switch to all-mail voting.\n\nComing Thursday is our poll on whether to legalize recreational marijuana use, and Friday on whether to allow a lottery.\n\nContentious, And Emotional\n\nFew issues are more contentious and emotional than medical aid in dying.\n\nWhile it easily passed the Hawaii State Senate earlier this year, it stalled in the House Health Committee without a vote.\n\nSome representatives said the legislation lacked detailed safeguards for the public and for physician training. There was heavy lobbying on both sides of the issue, and opponents prevailed.\n\nBecause it was deferred, Senate Bill 1129 could be revived in the 2018 legislative session, which begins next month.\n\nThe bill states:\n\nAn adult who is capable, is a resident of the State, and has been determined by the attending provider and consulting provider to be suffering from a terminal disease, and who has voluntarily expressed the adult’s wish to die, may make a written request for medication that the adult may self-administer for the purpose of ending the adult’s life in a humane and dignified manner in accordance with this chapter.\n\nSB 1129 was modeled on Oregon’s death with dignity statute, which has been in effect for 20 years. Similar laws are in effect in California, Colorado, Vermont and Washington state.\n\nThrilled, And Doubtful\n\nOne of the bill’s major supporters is Mary Steiner of the nonprofit Compassion & Choices Hawaii, and she welcomed the new polling data.\n\n“We are thrilled that the numbers continue to reflect Hawaii residents’ overwhelming support of medical aid in dying,” she said. “The statewide demand for access to medical aid in dying has only grown over the last two decades as people become more aware of their right to patient autonomy and to a full spectrum of end of life care.”\n\nSteiner said the Hawaii bill has “multiple safeguards” in place.\n\n“In 20 years of practice in Oregon, there has not been a single reported case of abuse, hospice awareness is on the rise, and terminally ill residents are comforted by the knowledge that this option is available to them should they need it,” she said. “In short, the law works as intended.”\n\nSteiner lamented that people “are still suffering in Hawaii. That’s why we remain hopeful that lawmakers this session will meaningfully consider a bill on its proven merits, and pass it.”\n\nCory Lum/Civil Beat\n\nBut Eva Andrade, president of a top adversary of the legislation — the nonprofit Hawaii Family Forum — is doubtful the bill will be resurrected.\n\nTold about the Civil Beat Poll, Andrade said, “My first thought is to say that supporting the legislation before actually reading the bill would cause great concern. I do believe that once people really understand assisted suicide, we believe they would say no to it.”\n\nIf the Legislature does take the matter up again, however, Andrade said, “We would do everything in our power to make sure that it does not move, because we believe strongly that if it becomes law there will be abuse, coercion and possible neglect or our elderly.”\n\nThe Civil Beat Poll Dec. 2017 — Death With Dignity:",

Oil prospectors are poring over courthouse records to see who holds mineral rights so they can negotiate deals.\n\nCompanies large and small are betting millions that the Niobrara holds gobs of recoverable oil like the similar - and booming - Bakken Shale field in western North Dakota. With oil money leading the way, North Dakota has coasted through the recession with 3.6 percent unemployment, lowest of any state, and a budget surplus of over $500 million.\n\nWealth like that could transform Cheyenne, a wind-swept state capital with too many vacant old buildings, and other parts of the exploration area with more jobs, more tax revenue and bustling support businesses.\n\nSurely everyone is excited, right?\n\nNot exactly, not with so many questions still to be answered.\n\n\"I've got mixed emotions about it, really. In the past, it's just been a farmer community,\" farmer Todd Martin said as he unloaded wheat from a truck to a bin in Carpenter, a town with dirt streets and maybe 100 people 25 miles southeast of Cheyenne. \"It's going to change some people's lives, if they hit.\"\n\nHardly anyone outside the industry talks about the oil rush for long without mentioning, apprehensively, the Gulf of Mexico catastrophe. Such a difficult-to-end spill would be hard to imagine happening here.\n\nThat doesn't mean an oil boom couldn't create a booming headache.\n\nEven minor spills would be a very up-close-and-personal problem for homeowners, particularly in the wide ring of fairly new homes on 5- to 40-acre lots surrounding Cheyenne.\n\n\"That Gulf deal makes you a little uneasy,\" said Paul Terry, a former Oregon logger who moved to his house on 10 acres north of Cheyenne a couple years ago. \"If I had them messing with my stuff, I'd want some ground rules. I'm not against it, but I'm not saying give them a free hand.\"\n\nHe said three companies have approached him in the last few months about possibly drilling beneath his property.\n\nAs in the Bakken, drilling in the Niobrara wouldn't be profitable without hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which some have blamed for groundwater contamination. It involves pumping a pressurized mix of water, sand and chemicals underground to crack open fissures and improve the flow of oil or gas.\n\nThe Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in June passed a range of tougher state rules for oil and gas drilling, including fracking.\n\nMartin said he researched fracking online and believes it's probably safe enough for his farm on the Colorado-Wyoming line.\n\n\"If they cut corners, then sure, it can contaminate the groundwater,\" he said. \"You hope they do it the way they're supposed to.\"\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that many people don't own the rights to minerals beneath their land. Whoever does has a right to put an oil well in your yard, with or without your permission, and doesn't have to share the profits - just the pollution.\n\nEven among those who own their minerals, not all are daydreaming much about getting rich.\n\n\"Beverly Hillbillies, rags to riches, we've got oil? Not necessarily,\" said Diane Bishop, who owns 70 acres near Cheyenne. She and her husband, Rick, who are moving here from Texas and plan to build a log home on their land later this year, own the mineral rights beneath half of their property.\n\n\"We'll be lucky to get enough money to pay the taxes on our property out there,\" Bishop said.\n\nCompanies intend to drill not only downward to the Niobrara but also horizontally, sometimes half a mile or more, after reaching the formation. That means one well could cross beneath several properties. Anyone who owned less than a substantial chunk of land - upward of a square mile - would have to divvy up royalties with at least one and possibly several neighbors.\n\nBig-time landowners, mainly cattle ranchers who own their minerals, would be in the best position to strike it rich.\n\nAll of this speculation began with Jake. The well in far northern Colorado was yielding 1,770 barrels of oil a day - eye-popping production for this region - after it was drilled and fracked for Houston-based EOG Resources last fall. Jake's production has tapered off significantly, as usually happens, but not before other companies took notice.\n\nAn old-fashioned land rush was on.\n\nSo far this year, more than 100 drilling permits have been granted in southeast Wyoming, far surpassing all previous activity in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyoming has reaped a record $101 million since May by auctioning off rights to drill on state land, the vast majority of it in the eastern part of the state. Nebraska and Colorado have set similar records.\n\nThe big question is how much oil is down there, and all eyes are on the next wells to be drilled. As soon as this fall, they could show whether a wide swath of the Niobrara covering hundreds of square miles is likely to be as productive as the Bakken, said Bruce Hinchey, president of Petroleum Association of Wyoming.\n\n\"If they come in pretty good, I think next year is going to be a barn-burner,\" he said.",
  "latent_2847": "When WikiLeaks dumped the most recent batch of emails, a number of people were stung in their connection to the Clinton campaign.\n\nAmong them was former CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now serving as interim chair for the Democratic National Committee — a post that was, ironically, vacated by Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was stung in a similar document dump just before the convention.\n\nBrazile was revealed to be Clinton’s mole at CNN, feeding information about attacks from the Sanders campaign during the primary. But another email suggested that Brazile may have even facilitated the Clinton campaign’s access to questions ahead of televised town hall meetings.\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper spoke to WMAL’s Larry O’Connor and Brian Wilson about his former colleague:\n\n“It’s a very, very troubling… look, I have tremendous regard for Donna Brazile. She’s a good person and a nice person and I like her a lot but whatever took place here… and I know I had nothing to do with it… and I know CNN, we were so closely guarding our documents… they weren’t emailed around. My understanding is the email to Donna came from either Roland Martin or someone around Roland Martin.”\n\nTapper also responded to the fact that questions were apparently leaked to the campaign. He confirmed that, at the town hall hosted by himself and Roland Martin, Hillary was asked a question that matched the one forwarded to her by Brazile almost word for word.:\n\nIt’s horrifying. Journalistically it’s horrifying and I’m sure it will have an impact on partnering with this organization in the future and I’m sure it will have and effect on… Donna Brazile is no longer with CNN because she’s with the DNC right now, but I’m sure it will have some impact on Donna Brazille. People at CNN take this very, very seriously and to have somebody who does not take it seriously and to have us partner with that person and then they do something completely unethical and share it with Donna Brazile who then shares it with the Clinton campaign… it’s horrifying and very, very upsetting and I can’t condemn it any more than… I condemn it in no uncertain terms, it’s awful.”\n\nPolitico reported on Wednesday that Roland Martin submitted his question for the town hall meeting to CNN producers on the day of the broadcast. His wording, punctuation, and even spacing were identical to the email that was sent to the Clinton campaign by Brazile the day before.\n\nAnd given the complex nature of the question, it’s not likely that it happened by accident:\n\n“19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?”\n\nDespite the obvious overlap, CNN insists that no one shared the questions prior to the event. Martin, who was representing TVOne, claims that not even his own producers knew what he was going to ask.\n\nYou can hear Tapper’s WMAL interview here:",

  "latent_3286": "INDIANAPOLIS -- One by one, the top tight ends in this year’s NFL draft rolled through Lucas Oil Stadium as part of Thursday’s interview session at the scouting combine.\n\nThere was Eric Ebron of North Carolina, Jace Amaro of Texas Tech, Austin Seferian-Jenkins of Washington, Troy Niklas of Notre Dame, C.J. Fiedorowicz of Iowa and on and on.\n\nMost, if not all, were asked which NFL tight end they admired, emulated or resembled.\n\nFor some, like Ebron, it was San Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis.\n\nCarolina likely would have to trade up in the first round of the NFL draft to have a shot at selecting Eric Ebron. Bob Donnan/USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor others, like Amaro and Fiedorowicz, it was the New England Patriots’ Rob Gronkowski.\n\nFor Seferian-Jenkins, it was the New Orleans Saints’ Jimmy Graham and the Denver Broncos’ Julius Thomas, who like him had a background in basketball.\n\nNot one of them, however, mentioned Jermichael Finley.\n\nYet if the Green Bay Packers don’t bring back their starting tight end, which is a likely course of action given his neck injury and his expiring contract, one of those players could become the next Finley.\n\nMost of the top tight end prospects said Thursday that they had either visited with the Packers or planned to talk with team representatives this week at the combine.\n\nSo too will Blake Baratz, the agent who represents Finley, but the Packers may have already decided that Finley’s neck fusion surgery was too much of a risk to bring him back. If that’s their plan, then there are plenty of viable options in this draft, which features playmaking tight ends of all sizes.\n\nIt starts with the 6-foot-4, 250-pound Ebron, who likely will be the first tight end taken in the draft and could be gone before the Packers pick at No. 21.\n\n“I’m very fast; I’m very different,” said Ebron, who along with the other tight ends will do their on-field testing this weekend. “I play the tight end role like no one else.”\n\nIn some ways, he plays it like Finley, whose physical presence is similar to Ebron’s.\n\nAmaro (6-5, 255) is as much receiver as he is tight end. Most of last season, when he caught 106 passes for 1,352 yards (the NCAA record for a tight end), he played standing up away from the line of scrimmage.\n\n“That’s why I’m so unique,” Amaro said. “It’s kind of a revolution into the game and how the tight ends are coming in across the board. I like to see myself as both a tight end and a receiver.”\n\nBut can he block?\n\nThat’s not an issue with Fiedorowicz (6-5½, 265), who was more of a blocking tight end in Iowa’s run-heavy offense.\n\n“A lot of tight ends in the NFL are either blocking tight ends or receiving tight ends,” Fiedorowicz said. “I like watching Rob Gronkowski. He can dominate both the line of scrimmage and down the field.”\n\nSeferian-Jenkins (6-5, 262) said he was asked to do both last season at Washington, where he played basketball as a freshman.\n\n“At the tight end position, you’ve got a lot of great players [in this draft],” he said. “But what I think I do is if you watched me play, I split out and played receiver. I’ve done fullback. I’ve played in line. I think I’ve showed I’m very capable of being a playmaker down the seam and run regular routes as a receiver, and I’ve shown the capability of being a blocker.”\n\nNiklas (6-6½ , 270) might be the biggest bruiser of this bunch. He began his college career as an outside linebacker.\n\n“I can block, and I enjoy blocking,” Niklas said. “I think it’s something I can use to my advantage.”\n\nFurther down the tight end pecking order is Jacob Pedersen of Wisconsin. He grew up just north of Green Bay in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. He’s a late-round prospect who would love the chance to be the Packers' next tight end.\n\n“Growing up 45 minutes away from Green Bay, obviously it’d be a childhood dream to play for your home team,” said Pedersen, one of six Badgers invited to the combine. “But I’m just hoping to get drafted by a team. Whoever takes me, they’re going to get my best effort.”",
  "latent_3315": "The Galaxy won their second consecutive MLS Cup after a second half turnaround.\n\nJuninho and Landon Donovan returned to Bruce Arena’s side, in place of Marcelo Sarvas and Edson Buddle respectively.\n\nDominic Kinnear chose a 4-4-2 system, with Calen Carr upfront alongside Will Bruin. Macoumba Kandji was only on the bench.\n\nThe goals broadly fitted the pattern of the game – the Dynamo played good football in the first half, but were unable to withstand the Galaxy’s pressure in the second half.\n\nFormations\n\nThe tactical battle in this match was relatively simple, for both were using 4-4-2 formations. There were differences in how they actually worked on the pitch – the Galaxy tended to play with more width, as Christian Wilhelmsson stayed wide (to little effect – he was probably the game’s weakest player), whereas the Dynamo brought Boniek Garcia inside to play as more of a shuttler than a winger, helping the Dynamo to dominate the centre of the pitch.\n\nAs the Dynamo had more players in central positions, there were simple forward passes on offer when the duo of Adam Moffat and Ricardo Clark had the ball, so they stayed in deep, central positions and protected the centre-backs, although this probably resulted in Beckham having too much time on the ball. The Galaxy didn’t really know how to cope with Garcia’s movement, although he carried the ball forward manfully rather than offering outright creativity.\n\nKey battlezone\n\nWith Garcia’s advanced and central positioning, it was notable how much Kofie Sarkodie overlapped in the first half, and although Mike Magee performed his defensive duties well positionally, he was often simply beaten in the tackle by Sarkodie, who went close to the opening goal after a storming forward run.\n\nThis area of the pitch turned out to be the key battlezone in the first half. Because Sarkodie was pushing forward, Robbie Keane was getting oceans of space when he moved out into the left-hand channel. The Galaxy should have opened the scoring from one of Keane’s runs into that zone – he was found by a typical Beckham pass from a deep, right-sided position, and the Irishman crossed for Donovan, who contrived to miss a simple chance. Sarkodie was nowhere to be seen, summing up how his aggressive positioning was Dynamo’s most promising outlet, and their biggest weakness.\n\nCarr movement\n\nThis was an unusual game – it’s not often that ‘working the channels’ is such a key feature of a modern football match. Just as Keane and Donovan were spinning into the channels at one end, the Dynamo’s forwards were doing the exact same thing at the other. Carr was the Dynamo’s best player at doing this, drifting both left and right and creating overloads with the wingers, or running onto more direct balls played in behind. Within the first minute his presence wide on the left helped create a shooting opportunity for Clark.\n\nCarr’s opening goal – running onto a through-ball in an inside-right position – was typical of his approach throughout the game, and the ball in behind from Moffat was the type of pass Beckham had been playing for the Galaxy.\n\nSecond half\n\nThe latter part of the first half had been played at a very slow tempo, but the Galaxy did well in the second half, picking up the pace and playing the majority of the game in the Dynamo half. There was nothing subtle about their approach – it was all about set-pieces and firing the ball into the box as frequently as possible. There were a couple of half-chances from dead ball situations, and Keane had a goal disallowed.\n\nOmar Gonzalez was clearly the main threat, and although Beckham was the most obvious candidate to whip the ball in, it was actually Juninho who provided a fine delivery for the equaliser – which, on the balance of play, the Galaxy fully deserved. As if to demonstrate how the Dynamo weren’t clearing set-pieces effectively in the first place, the goal came after the Galaxy simply kept the pressure on following an initial unsuccessful corner.\n\nMore set-pieces\n\nThe pattern continued – this was simply sheer pressure from the Galaxy, nothing more complex than getting the ball into the penalty box repeatedly. In an odd combination of the previous two incidents, Keane had a second goal disallowed following a Gonzalez knock-down, which had predictably come from a Beckham corner.\n\nNext, Dynamo conceded a penalty, converted by Donovan, after handball following a Beckham free-kick. The Dynamo lacked a commanding figure in the mould of Gonzalez to clear the ball, and the crosses kept coming.\n\nCarr absence\n\nThey also lacked Carr – who was forced to depart through injury shortly before the Galaxy’s equaliser, with Macoumbda Kandji replacing him.\n\nThat was crucial for two reasons – first, because he’d been helping to block Gonzalez’s runs at set-pieces during the first half (most notably when Magee had a good headed chance), and second because he was the most obvious out-ball for Dynamo – they’d previously been able to simply send the ball forward relatively aimlessly and Carr would spin in behind and attack in the channels.\n\nLate switches\n\nAfter Donovan’s penalty, things started to get tactical. Arena decided to bring on Buddle for Wilhelmsson, in order to put Donovan to the right right as a more reliable player in a defensive sense.\n\nMeanwhile, Kinnear started to change things. Giles Barnes replaced Moffat and played a more attack-minded role, but it was a surprise Kinnear waited until 75 minutes to reach for his 3-4-1-2 formation. Veteran Brian Ching came on for Sarkodie and played upfront, with Khandji going left, Davis moving inside and Corey Ashe tucking in to become a left-sided centre-back. The 3-4-1-2 often works well against a flat 4-4-2, and as the sheer momentum was with the Dynamo, it meant an extra player in central goalscoring positions, resulting in a couple of half-chances – Ching had a good effort from distance, and played a good target man role for the final 15 minutes.\n\nKeane breaks\n\nBut Keane became the most dangerous player on the pitch after the Dynamo went 3-4-1-2 – without Sarkodie on the pitch whatsoever, he got all kinds of space on the left, with Bobby Boswell moving across but failing to stop him. He went close after a dribble and a shot from the edge of the box, then missed a one-on-one after moving more central, then won the decisive penalty in stoppage time.\n\nHis pace and mobility on the break always provided an out-ball, and over the course of the game, the Galaxy created more goalscoring opportunities.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwo factors here – balls into the channels and set-pieces. Both sides were able to threaten with the first approach through Carr and Keane (and to a lesser extent, Donovan), but only the Galaxy were a threat from set-plays, with Beckham’s delivery and Gonzalez’s aerial abilities.\n\nCarr’s fine first half performance put the Dynamo on top, but his departure meant no threat in the channels, and therefore the Galaxy were dominant in the game’s two key areas.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Widgets\n\nRelated articles on Zonal Marking:",

After teaching in Florence and Mondovi, he moved to Belgium, where he was ordained a priest in 1570. He returned to Rome in 1576 and became a professor of theological controversies at the Roman College. Bellarmino was a theologian of great fame and prestige, and involved himself in the disputes which grew up around Galileo's discoveries. In 1611 he asked the professors of mathematics at the Roman College to express their opinions on the issues raised by the telescope, concerning the surface of the moon, the phases of Venus, the satellites of Jupiter, the shape of Saturn, and the composition of the Milky Way. The answer he received from Clavius (1538-1612) and his pupils was favorable to Galileo, but in spite of these apparent triumphs something at Rome was working against him. In that same year of 1611, on May 17, during a meeting of the Holy Office at which Bellarmino was present, a deliberation was made to examine whether at the trial of Cesare Cremonini (1550-1631), a philosopher at the University of Padua, mention had also been made of Galileo, who had been a friend and colleague of his. Several years prior to this Bellarmino had also participated in the last phase of the trial of Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), as he had in the affair of the interdiction of the Venetian Republic.\n\nSome years later, in 1615, Bellarmino took a prominent role in the procedure which led to the suspension of Copernicus' (1473-1543) D e revolutionibus (Nuremberg, 1543) and the warning issued to Galileo. The year before, in 1615, in a letter to Antonio Foscarini (1580-1616) author of a Lettera... sopra l' opinione de' Pittagorici e del Copernico della mobilità della terra e stabilità del sole e del nuovo pittagorico sistema del mondo [Letter concerning the opinion of the Pythagoreans and Copernicus about the motion of the earth and the fixity of the sun and about the new Pythagorean world system], Bellarmino had steadfastly maintained that Copernicanism could only be considered as a mere mathematical hypothesis. Also, any attempt to interpret holy scripture that ignored the commentaries of the Fathers smacked of practices of the reformed churches and violated the Council of Trent.\n\nBellarmino died in Rome in 1621. In 1930 Pope Pius XI (1857-1939) beatified Roberto Bellarmino as a saint and doctor of the Church.",

Foto: www.fodboldbilleder.dk DBU kan ikke stå inde for, at FC Barcelona eller andre internationale fodboldklubber ønsker at udvælge børn helt ned til seks år til deres fodboldakademi. Derfor besluttede en samlet DBU-bestyrelse på lørdagens bestyrelsesmøde at afvise den spanske klub FC Barcelonas ønske om et helårsakademi i Danmark.I februar offentliggjorde FC Barcelona, at de ønskede at etablere et fodboldakademi for børn i 6-16-års alderen, som udvælges ud fra fodboldfaglige kompetencer. Nu er projektet blevet vurderet af både DBU’s Breddeudvalg og Udvalget for Professionel Fodbold og senest på et møde i DBU’s bestyrelse – og alle steder er vurderingen, at planerne strider med de danske regler for beskyttelse af børn:”Vi kan ikke stå inde for, at børn ned til seksårs-alderen skal til auditions for at blive optaget og skal indgå i et udpræget elitært træningsmiljø. Børn udvikler sig enormt i den alder, og derfor kan et barn med gode boldegenskaber som seksårig være overhalet som syvårig, og hvad skal der så ske med ham, når han bliver vejet og fundet for let. Hvem samler det barn op?,” siger Bent Clausen, næstformand i DBU og formand for DBU’s breddeudvalg.DBU’s næstformand gør opmærksom på, at reglerne er baseret på DBU’s ’Holdninger & Handlinger’ og er etableret for at værne om børns trivsel, glæde og tryghed, som efter DBU og de danske fodboldklubbers vurdering er helt grundlæggende forudsætninger for børns udvikling:”Det er ikke godt for børnene at indgå i et benhårdt vind-eller-forsvind miljø, selvom de ligger i toppen af deres aldersgruppe. Det fokus, der er på, at de skal præstere, er både usundt og kan meget vel give bagslag og gøre, at de i stedet mister lysten til fodbold og dermed ryger helt ud af fodboldsystemet,” siger han.Men det er ikke kun børnene og deres velbefindende, der bliver sat under pres ved akademiets tilbliven. De danske talentklubber vil på sigt også kunne rammes. En blåstempling af Barcelonas akademi i Danmark vil danne præcedens for andre storklubbers virke i Danmark fremadrettet.”Vi skal værne om talentudviklingen i dansk fodbold, og hvis vi tillader et akademi fra FC Barcelona i dag er det måske andre storklubber i morgen. På sigt, om 10-15 år, kan talentudviklingen i Danmark så varetages af internationale storklubber uden danske interesser og på bekostning af de danske talentudviklingsklubber,” siger Bent Clausen.DBU’s bestyrelse har skrevet til FC Barcelonas fodboldakademi samt til Ballerup Kommune og klubberne, der har indledt samarbejdet om et nyt akademi i området. Derudover har DBU også skrevet til UEFA og orienteret om beslutningen om at afvise etableringen at det omtalte – og lignende - akademier i Danmark.",
  "latent_3665": "January 06, 2015 — Chris Foster\n\nDuring the month of September 2014 I experimented with a DIY version of soylent. I know that many people have started using the food substitute as a sole source of nutrition, but I wanted to focus on using soylent in a more casual manner. Specifically, as a student food on campus is often expensive and homemade lunches are often difficult to carry around, not nutritious, or require reheating. Soylent is none of those things, so for a student I was suspecting it might make an ideal lunch substitute.\n\nOver the 30 days I experimented with soylent, specifically a DIY version called Urban Ambrosia, I kept a daily journal of my experiences. Since finishing my 30 day trial at the end of September I’ve continued to use soylent for the rest of the semester. I’ve also added additional notes below detailing my thoughts after a full four months of regular usage.\n\nDay 0\n\nMost of the day consisted of tracking down the ingredients. Surprisingly, Bulk Barn had almost all of the ingredients I needed. The only things I didn’t have were canola oil, masa, honey, potassium chloride, and the Kirkland mens’ multivitamin. At Walmart, I was able to find the canola oil and honey. Superstore had both the masa I was looking for and potassium chloride. The potassium chloride was labeled as “salt free table salt”, and is not pure potassium chloride but I imagine it will not be a problem. Kirkland, being a Costco brand, was out of my reach since I don’t have a Costco card. However, I found a mens’ multivitamin that has exactly the same components at Superstore, so that worked out well. I also picked up a cooking scale at Winners. Overall, the cost was ~$100 for all these items.\n\nLater on in the day I started mixing the ingredients. I crushed the vitamin K+D pills and the mens’ multivitamin between two spoons and mixed it in with the rest of the dry ingredients. After tossing those in a bowl I mixed in the honey and canola oil, and gave it a quick mix in with a spoon. Eight cups of water is too much for me to mix in one six cup blender, but it fit nicely between two batches. I think, in total, I created about 2.3L of liquid.\n\nI tried it and quickly realized that I had made a mistake. It tasted like uncooked oatmeal or, possibly, something like cream of wheat. I’m pretty sure I accidentally bought unflavored whey protein isolate, instead of the vanilla ice cream flavouring. The flavor isn’t bad, but very, very bland. A friend compared the smell to baby food. I stored it in two tupperware containers and put it in the fridge. Taste is supposed to improve after eight hours in fridge, so I’ll have to see!\n\nDay 1\n\nIn the morning I pour it into a 24oz water bottle, which after doing the math should be around 600 calories. Since I have to be at school all day, I put it in a lunch bag surrounded by ice packs.\n\nWhile having coffee with a friend I had a snack as well, and I think that filled me up more than I wanted it to. A bagel with cream cheese is about 400 calories, so I decided to have the soylent as a late lunch on my way to work. I started drinking it around 2:30. It was still very cold when drinking it at first, and the taste was much better, but still not vanilla-like at all. I definitely bought the wrong whey protein, but I bought alot of it ($45 worth), so I don’t know if I want to throw it all out without using it.\n\nWhen I got to work (about 10 min drive) I had finished about half of the drink. As I was drinking the other half it started to warm up to room temperature and I found I had a difficult time drinking it without my gag reflex kicking in. The stuff looks similar to baby puke. This could be normal, from what I’m told it takes a couple days to adjust to the taste. It could also be that mine has a worse taste than normal due to the tasteless whey protein. I finish all but ~1/2oz of the liquid.\n\nI wasn’t feeling very hungry when I started (which was abnormal given the time of day), and when I finished I felt fairly “full” but not bloated. My stomach felt a little off for the rest of the day, however. I imagine it takes time to get used to drinking three cups of oatmeal-like water substance, so I was OK with that.\n\nNormally around 5:30 when I finish work I’m VERY hungry. Today I wasn’t, which was likely due to the late soylent lunch. I went for a swim (1.5km), which also normally leaves me pretty hungry and indeed I was. At about 8:00 I had a late dinner at Boston Pizza with some friends.\n\nDay 2\n\nStomach was definitely upset this morning, but not sure if that was from the soylent or the Boston Pizza. I had the regular breakfast and headed out to school.\n\nThis time I ate soylent at a more lunch-appropriate time (12:15), with no snacks between breakfast and lunch. Again, having some trouble finishing the entire 24oz. I stopped at the same amount as yesterday. I was actually fairly hungry today so when I was about half way through the bottle I discovered how noticeably filling it was. I’m starting to wonder if maybe 24oz is too much, or if I’m still adjusting to the taste. I started to feel a little queasy after finishing and that continued for a good while. I definitely felt full when I was done. Today I tried to drink it much more quickly before it warmed up, and was done ~75% of the bottle in 5 or so minutes. The last 15% still took a long while and like yesterday I ended up giving up any attempt to finish it completely.\n\nDay 3\n\nStomach still a little upset today, but less so.\n\nI had spilled a little bit out of the container the day before, so I didn’t have quite enough to fill a full 24oz bottle. Which is good though, because this confirms that the batch I had initially made was enough for three full bottles (provided I don’t spill it). I was about 3oz short, which I figured would not be the end of the world since I haven’t drank it all the last two times anyway.\n\nI had a late breakfast (~10:00am), and wasn’t feeling totally hungry when I started class at 11:30 so I figured it would be best to wait until I was on my way to work to drink the soylent. At 2:30 I drank through most of it, but in the last few ounces I started to feel queasy. I’ve been wondering and more if that’s a sign I’m trying to eat too much as I usually feel very full by that point. Anyway, I put the rest in the fridge at work and drank it when I finished work. It was much easier to finish off that way!\n\nI’ve decided I’m going to coin the term “Soylent burps”. I think this is a result of how much I shake the bottle to make sure that the masa doesn’t settle while drinking. It makes the liquid fairly foamy and I’d bet that is causing the burps. I will have to try “swishing” instead of the full-arm-swing shake I’ve been doing.\n\nOn my way to dinner I noticed I was feeling extremely weird. It took me a long time to think of how to describe it, but was really just a feeling of very strong anxiety. Today was Friday, which means I’m usually extremely burnt out and tired by the end of the day. I still felt burnt out mentally, but physically I felt very energetic. I’m wondering if this is contributing to the anxiety feeling, because I had read about that happening. It could possibly just be confirmation bias based on what I read, but I definitely felt off. I might have also been more hungry than I realized, because this feeling went away with dinner.\n\nDay 4\n\nSushi for lunch with friends today, no soylent.\n\nDay 5\n\nNo soylent, but I did make the second batch.\n\nI figured I could save alot of time in the mornings by pouring the mixed soylent directly into the bottles I use for lunch. That way I don’t need to keep awkwardly sized tupperware containers around. I think there are plenty of other places I could optimize this process, but I’m still in the “having fun making this” phase so I’m not too worried about it. Setup, measuring, mixing, cleaning, etc all together took around an hour I believe. Not bad for three days lunch. This time I tried adding some vanilla extract (4 cap fulls) in order to account for the fact that I used unflavoured vanilla whey protein. It wasn’t immediately noticeable in the taste, but maybe it’ll be stronger in the morning.\n\nDay 6\n\nBack on soylent!\n\nThe vanilla taste isn’t as strong as I hoped, but that’s OK. The “oatmeal” taste is far less powerful. I ate around noon and drank it very quickly. I was able to finish the whole bottle today though! I’m not sure if that’s a result of the less oatmeal-y taste or if that’s a result of “swishing” instead of shaking. I’m leaning toward thinking it’s a result of the swishing, and possibly just some result of me getting used to the taste.\n\nDay 7\n\nAte directly around noon today as well. I’ve noticed that I don’t really “crave” soylent like I’ve heard reports. In fact, when it starts coming around lunch time, the idea of soylent actually seems a little gross. However, immediately after I start drinking it that feeling disappears. I have been envisioning it far worse than it is right before I drink it, but once I get a mouthful down I realize that it’s not as bad as I apparently thought. It’s a hard phenomenon to describe.\n\nUnfortunately, I was pretty hungry today around 2-3. So by dinner time I was very hungry.\n\nDay 8\n\nAte around noon! Today and yesterday I finished the bottle, so that seems to be consistent with the swishing.\n\nI was hungry again today around 2-3 again, and by dinner time I was very hungry. I’ve been feeling pretty funny the last couple days, but I think a lot of that might be a result of my stress level increasing with school coming back. Stomach is still regularly upset. The long-term upset stomach is starting to be slightly concerning, maybe now that I’m able to get the entire bottle down I’ll try drinking it far slower. I drink the entire bottle in around 10 minutes. I was reading some people take up to an hour to finish.\n\nI made another batch today, and timed it this time. The entire process took 44:53. I’m excited to see how I can cut that down, though. I added alot more vanilla. A total of 8 caps, hopefully that will bring out a more prominent vanilla taste, but I didn’t test it before putting it in the fridge.\n\nDay 9\n\nYeah, way too much vanilla…\n\nIt doesn’t actually taste like vanilla, it tastes more like alcohol. I know pure vanilla extract has a very strong alcohol smell to it when it’s in the bottle, so I did some googling and it turns out that vanilla extract is actually 35% alcohol.\n\nBased on my off hand math, each 24oz bottle of soylent is equivalent to .5-1 shots of vodka.\n\nWhoops.\n\nDay 10\n\nI didn’t have any soylent today and instead opted for McDonald’s with some friends. Plus, given the latest alcoholic taste development, I wasn’t sure if I could stomach it.\n\nSoylent has the nice benefit of being able to simply go home and put it back in the fridge for tomorrow, I like that convenience a lot.\n\nDay 11\n\nNo soylent today.\n\nDay 12\n\nNo soylent today.\n\nDay 13\n\nBack at it!\n\nI’m trekking through the vodka soylent, realistically I’m guessing the alcohol content isn’t enough to affect me a lot. More of a “mid day pump up” I suppose. I did actually consider throwing this batch out, but I’ll consider this a learning experience. Anyways, it doesn’t taste very good at all. I had a difficult time getting it down.\n\nDay 14\n\nFinished off the last of ‘vodka soylent’ today. Good riddance. At no point have I actually felt impaired, so that is good at least. I’ve realized that maybe the vanilla extract isn’t working, so I went out and bought some vanilla ice cream flavored whey protein isolate. It cost about $29.37. I think the whey protein isolate is definitely one of the most expensive components here.\n\nI made some more soylent today using the new vanilla extract. I tried it and it tasted pretty bad, though. It had a vanilla flavour to it, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on what was wrong…\n\nDay 15\n\nSalty. Way too salty.\n\nI think I might have accidentally put WAY too much salt in. I even remember thinking “that looks like way too much salt” before I dumped the container into the mix. I must’ve misread the scale or reset it out incorrectly by accident. It does taste better than the tasteless stuff, and much better than the vodka soylent. The masa is no longer the dominating taste, which I like alot. You can definitely taste the vanilla but it’s pretty skewed by the salt-water taste it has. Drank the salt-soylent around 2:30.\n\nDay 16\n\nHad soylent around 2:30 again. Pretty hard to stomach through this stuff. It tastes good but the salt aftertaste is really harsh. I’m excited to retry though!\n\nDay 17\n\nFinished off the salt soylent. Bleh.\n\nDay 18\n\nNo soylent today.\n\nDay 19\n\nNo soylent today.\n\nMade some though, took around 45 minutes. Nothing particularly new, but I paid very close attention to measurements this time.\n\nDay 20\n\nOh wow, so much better! Without the overpowering salt, the vanilla taste is actually very good. This is definitely the first batch I would qualify as “good” tasting.\n\nVery happy to finally have something palatable!\n\nDay 21\n\nI went out for lunch with a friend today, so I left the soylent in the cooler. I didn’t make it home for diner though, so I had an interesting opportunity to try switching meals and using the soylent for dinner. My first observation is that I forgot the serious blood sugar crash that comes after eating lunch. With soylent I don’t get that groggy feeling, but definitely experienced it at lunch today. It was nice to realize I didn’t get groggy when I used it for dinner as well, when normally I get very groggy following dinner. So it seems fair to attribute the soylent to that. Drank soylent around 6:30.\n\nI really like this new vanilla recipe. I just want to say that again.\n\nDay 22\n\nI went out and bought more ingredients for soylent today, but unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make it tonight. A notable annoyance is the fact that this particular DIY recipe apparently must be made the night before, and requires a blender. The traditional soylent can be shaken in a bottle, and can be made on the spot. I wish this recipe had that convenience, but I’ll work with what I’ve got.\n\nI bought “blanced” almond flour today, instead of the natural almond flour I have been using. It has the outer shell of the almond removed and is bleached. I think I have the taste nailed down, but now I’m trying to focus on improving the consistency (it’s still fairly chunky) and the appearance (still looks somewhat like baby puke – but much less so now with the vanilla flavouring). I’m hoping this will improve!\n\nDrank soylent around 2:30.\n\nDay 23\n\nMade more soylent again today with the ingredients I bought yesterday. Unfortunately, a last minute school assignment stopped me from making it in the morning so I was without soylent for the day.\n\nOne interesting thing that I noticed is that I missed it! I’ve read lots of people talking about ‘craving’ soylent instead of actual food, but up until now this had not been something I had been experiencing. Quite the opposite, in fact. I would usually be dreading the idea of it, and craving a cheeseburger. After the vanilla alterations it actually is very good and I appear to be craving it, which is kinda neat. Had store-bought sushi for lunch today instead.\n\nI made it later on in the night, took about 43 minutes. The texture definitely appears less grainy at first glance with the new almond flour, but I didn’t try it.\n\nDay 24\n\nThe texture is far better with the blanced almond meal! It’s still fairly chunky, but doesn’t have any of those funny shell-colored pieces in it anymore. The texture looks much more homogeneous, which is excellent.\n\nDay 25\n\nNo soylent.\n\nDay 26\n\nNo soylent.\n\nDay 27\n\nSo the batch that I had today has officially been sitting in the fridge since around day 23, which makes me a little uneasy. I’ve been doing some reading since it’s not immediately clear to me when exactly soylent goes ‘bad’, and the general consensus seems to be that people don’t drink it after 3 days in the fridge. My case is a little different given that this is a DIY recipe, but the idea of having soylent this old is still a little unnerving.\n\nThe taste was definitely different today, but not drastically. I would say that the masa becomes a little bit more powerful, and the texture becomes a little more watery.\n\nWhen I get the soylent at lunch, the bottle has usually settled a fair amount. There has been a number of times I’ve seen red colored substance collect at the bottom of the soylent, in a very small amount. Upon mixing, it disappears as far as I can tell. That is actually what led me to start researching when soylent goes “bad”, because there isn’t actually anything obviously red that goes into the soylent. That said, the lecithin granules also change color extremely after being mixed in, so it’s possible other stuff does as well. However, the idea of some sort of mold growing in the soylent and then me drinking it is really hard to get past…\n\nAm I poisoning myself? Who knows.\n\nDay 28\n\nSo today I tried shaking the bottle again before I put it into my cooler pack for the day. The thought occurred to me that maybe the texture was more watery because it’s been sitting separated for the last 4 or 5 days. It could be similar to how the soylent requires a ‘cooling off’ period for the taste to improve after being blended. When I took it out at lunch, the texture was much more similar to the day-old stuff, but the masa was still a lot more dominant than I was expecting. That could be due to poor mixing instead of age though, it’s hard to justify that off one sample.\n\nI messed up, and totally forgot to make soylent tonight. Unfortunately tomorrow I’ll need to buy lunch, then make some more the following night. I’m out of honey as well, so I’ll need to go shopping too.\n\nDay 29\n\nNo soylent today since I don’t have any to drink.\n\nI made some though and have some good news to report. When crushing the mens’ multivitamin I accidentally spilled a little bit, and when pouring water into the blender I also spilled some of the water. I noticed a couple minutes later that the pill’s internals had turned bright red/orange. Just to verify I mixed in one of the men’s multivitamins with a cup of water, and sure enough in a few minutes the water was completely yellow and the pill bright red. So that solves the mystery red stuff in the soylent!\n\nI really noticed a crash today just before dinner time, I think due to the fact that I was without soylent today and have gotten pretty used to that extra energy boost during weekdays.\n\nDay 30\n\nHad some today! Stomach a little bit upset, but glad to have the energy back. I’ve noticed that it’s common for my stomach to be a little upset if it has been 1 or 2 days since I last had soylent. Nothing like it used to be, but just a little uneasy. I guess pretty similar to what it would feel like drinking 24oz of anything, it makes the stomach feel sloshy. It goes away relatively quickly though! This’ll be the last day of my 30-day experiment, and with the tasty version I have settled on I’m happy to announce I’ll be definitely continuing forward with it! There’s still some room for improvement, but what I have now is definitely pretty great.",

No U.S. in the World Cup? How to describe the shock?\n\nWe could ask some of the men who have given their lives to the game. Let’s find some of the top college coaches, to see how much they felt the pain.\n\nThe coach of the No. 1 ranked team in the nation was in his office Wednesday, preparing to play Kentucky in a few hours . . . .\n\nIndiana’s Todd Yeagley had been at home with his family Tuesday night, watching the U.S. national team go down to Trinidad and Tobago 2-1, thus doomed to miss the World Cup.\n\nBREAKING: United States misses first World Cup since 1986. — The Associated Press (@AP) October 11, 2017\n\n“I think anyone that cares about soccer and is as invested in it as we all are, it was really tough to watch,” he said. “Gut-wrenching was probably the best way to describe it. It was very quiet. I just kind of sat there in disbelief. I didn’t see the passion and the fight in the group that knew what was on the line. I know they knew that, but it just didn’t translate to us as the viewers, that they were playing for a lot.”\n\nSo what now for American soccer?\n\n“I don’t think there’s a silver bullet. The over-reaction of many I’m sure today is everyone will want to reinvent the wheel. That doesn’t need to happen. If we had won the game, probably everyone would be feeling pretty good, and saying not much needs to be fixed. I don’t think that would have been the right solution either. I think it’s definitely somewhere in the middle. It goes to every level, every process.”\n\nThe American downfall was to be part of his pregame conversation with his Hoosiers Wednesday night, because Yeagley understood his players might be unsettled, too.\n\n“I’ll reassure them that U.S. soccer is still going in a good way. There’s still so many positives. This is a setback, but often you get stronger from it.”\n\nDevastated. But we are forever grateful to our supporters. We will persevere. pic.twitter.com/9ATsjtE7o7 — U.S. Soccer (@ussoccer) October 11, 2017\n\nThe coach of the No. 2 ranked team in the nation gave his players Wednesday off. . . .\n\nBobby Muuss’ Wake Forest team had routed Longwood 8-0 the night before, and then rushed into the locker room to see the second half of the U.S. game. “I still can’t believe that it’s happened. I think I’m a little bit more numb.\n\n“It’s the sport that we love so much, it’s my livelihood, it’s my passion. World Cups in my opinion are meant to have the Americans in it. The reality of it still hasn’t hit. It’s disheartening. The steps that we’ve taken in fan base and media coverage and individual players is at an all-time high. To now go into the summer without a team in the World Cup, I don’t know if it stalls that, but it doesn’t help it.”\n\nHe has no clear answer to why it happened — “That’s a loaded question” — or what to do now. “I do think it’s time right now as a country we take a step back and see what’s working and what isn’t. I don’t think one could say that everything is not working. And obviously it would be really naïve to say what we’re doing is working. I can’t put my finger on it.”\n\nHe won’t soon forget Tuesday night, how even players’ parents came by to commiserate. “For anybody that loves the game and is truly passionate about the game, it’s just a shock. We won last night, and the staff’s sitting around feeling like we lost. And in some ways, we did.”\n\nThe winningest coach in NCAA men’s soccer history was riding the team bus Wednesday, on the way to a game at DePauw . . .\n\nOhio Wesleyan’s Jay Martin had been in front of the television the night before, too, when the only word worse than Trinidad for American soccer was Tobago.\n\n“It was excruciating to watch. If my team played like that I’d be beside myself in terms of effort and enthusiasm and all those other things.”\n\nThe defeat had been the talk of his team Wednesday morning when the players gathered for yoga, and it carried over to the bus.\n\nMORE: NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Committee will reveal top 10 teams Oct. 29\n\n“It’s almost like we’re going to a funeral,” Martin said. “These kids care very much about the national team and U.S. soccer. I’m a little bit worried about it, going to try to play a game right now. They’re very upset. They can’t understand why. And they don’t’ really know about the history of U.S. men’s soccer and the culture of our soccer system to really understand what happened.”\n\nSo what did happen? Martin has been coaching Ohio Wesleyan for 41 years and spent a lot of time with youth soccer, as well. He has ideas, and the frustration poured out, somewhere on a highway in the Midwest.\n\n“I could actually see this coming the last 12 or 15 years, maybe even more. The problem is our soccer culture. It’s awful. When it’s compared to other soccer-playing countries, we’re not even close. The problem is soccer has become a vehicle for many, many to people to make a lot of money. Some directors of these youth programs are making up to $200,000 so they really don’t care about the U.S. men’s national team, except to give it lip service. What they care about is making $200,000.\"\n\n\"Everybody’s too selfish to be honest with you.\"\n\nAnything else?\n\n“Most countries, the soccer federation is in charge of everything soccer. But our U.S. Soccer Federation is not in charge of everything soccer. They’re not in charge of MLS, they’re not in charge of the NCAA, they’re not in charge of the youth organizations, and all these organizations do their own things. We have the facilities, we have the athletes but we’re never going to compete internationally until we can sit down and iron out our differences and get on the same page, and I’m just not very confident that’s going to happen.\n\n“I’ve seen the metamorphosis of soccer in this country on a steady rise over the last 20 years. We were really on an upward swing, but I could see crack in the foundation over the last seven or eight years, so yes, at a very personal level it’s more than disappointing. We took a major step back.”\n\nJay Martin has won 693 games and nobody else is close, but Wednesday was a gray day. He’s a soccer guy. Probably all other soccer guys around the NCAA understood.",
  "latent_3796": "Early in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of the Replacements; however, they refined and mainstreamed their sound to become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the 1990s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their influences. That's no knock on the band, either -- the music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to a style that, one decade earlier, would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads \"Name\" and \"Iris,\" followed by a string of Top Ten singles.\n\nThe Goo Goo Dolls formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York. Guitarist/vocalist Johnny Rzeznik , bassist Robby Takac , and drummer George Tutuska initially banded together under the name the Sex Maggots -- their new moniker was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner. Originally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing original songs. Their early sound recalled the Replacements ' origins as a bratty punk band: melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo Dolls or First Release ). Released in 1989, the follow-up album, Jed , continued in a similar vein, and the band's college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up , a Replacements -ish power pop record.\n\nReleased in 1993, Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls ' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, \"We Are the Normal,\" was even co-written by Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms . That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo , when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad \"Name\" into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single and climbed into the Top Five later that year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, drummer Tutuska was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by Mike Malinin\n\nDissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the Goo Goo Dolls waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Bros. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute a new ballad, \"Iris,\" to the soundtrack of the 1998 Nicolas Cage Meg Ryan romance City of Angels . Appearing that April, the song became a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was). For a better indicator, \"Iris\" spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys.\n\nThe band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl , was released during the middle of \"Iris\"'s marathon airplay run and eventually sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls ' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including \"Slide,\" \"Dizzy,\" \"Broadway,\" and the Grammy-nominated \"Black Balloon.\" Although Dizzy Up the Girl quickly became the Goo Goo Dolls ' highest-selling album ever, none of its singles appeared on the band's 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce , which focused on earlier material and B-sides instead.\n\nThe Goo Goo Dolls' audience shrank a bit during the 2000s, although the band still managed to go gold with its seventh studio album, 2002's Gutterflower . A concert recording, Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 , appeared two years later and helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio effort, Let Love In , which didn't appear until 2006. It, too, went gold, as did three of its singles: \"Better Days,\" \"Stay with You,\" and a cover of Supertramp 's \"Give a Little Bit.\" A traditional greatest-hits album, Greatest Hits, Vol. 1: The Singles , was released in 2007, followed one year later by Vol. 2 , which followed Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce 's lead by compiling rarities, B-sides, cover songs, and live performances.\n\nRecording sessions for the band's ninth album began taking place in spring 2009 with producer Tim Palmer . Although a release date was scheduled for February 2010, the band headed back into the studio in January to make several last-minute changes to the album, with longtime producer Rob Cavallo -- who also worked on Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower -- lending his help. Something for the Rest of Us was ultimately released that summer. The album debuted at seven on the Billboard 200 but generated no hit singles. The Goo Goo Dolls supported the album into 2011 and in 2012, then turned their attention to recording a new album. The resulting Magnetic was released in June of 2013, preceded by the single \"Rebel Beat.\" Magnetic peaked at eight on the Billboard charts. Following its release, drummer Mike Malinin departed the band; Rzeznik and Takac chose not to replace him. The pair released Boxes , their first album as a duo, in May 2016; it was preceded by the single \"So Alive.\" The next year, they issued a five-song EP titled You Should Be Happy",

No less than Stanley Kubrick cited the film as a direct influence on his own dystopian classic A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. An unknown club dancer at the time, transgender actor Peter (from Kurosawa's RAN) gives an astonishing Edie Sedgwick/Warhol superstar-like performance as hot young thing Eddie, hostess at Bar Genet where she's ignited a violent love-triangle with reigning drag queen Leda (Osamu Ogasawara) for the attentions of club owner Gonda (played by Kurosawa regular Yoshio Tsuchiya, from SEVEN SAMURAI and YOJIMBO). One of Japan's leading experimental filmmakers, Matsumoto bends and distorts time here like Resnais in LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, freely mixing documentary interviews, Brechtian film-within-a-film asides, Oedipal premonitions of disaster, his own avant-garde shorts, and even on-screen cartoon balloons, into a dizzying whirl of image + sound. Featuring breathtaking black-and-white cinematography by Tatsuo Suzuki that rivals the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, FUNERAL PARADE offers a frank, openly erotic and unapologetic portrait of an underground community of drag queens. Whether laughing with drunken businessmen, eating ice cream with her girlfriends, or fighting in the streets with a local girl gang, Peter's ravishing Eddie is something to behold. \"She has bad manners, all she knows is coquetry,\" complains her rival Leda but in fact, Eddie's bad manners are simply being too gorgeous for this world. Her stunning presence, in bell-bottom pants, black leather jacket and Brian Jones hair-do, is a direct threat to the social order, both in the Bar Genet and in the streets of Tokyo. A key work of the Japanese New Wave and of queer cinema, FUNERAL PARADE has been restored in 4k from the original 35mm camera negative and sound elements for this 2017 re-release.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nNew 4K restoration from the original 35mm camera negative\n\n8 newly remastered avant-garde short films by Toshio Matsumoto\n\nAudio commentary by Chris D.\n\nU.S. Theatrical Trailer\n\nOriginal 1969 Japanese Theatrical Trailer\n\nNew essay by Hirofumi Sakamoto, Director of the Postwar Japan Moving Image Archive It's officially coming November 14thCredit to bruce holecheck",

As expected the weather conditions were very contrary (snow, sun, storm, rain). The exposed position at the Atlantic Ocean is responsible for the unpredictable weather in western Scotland.

  "latent_4196": "Rather than the centerpiece of prosecution, witness testimony should be viewed more like trace evidence, scientists say, with the same fragility and vulnerability to contamination.\n\nWhy is a witness’s account so often unreliable? Partly because the brain does not have a knack for retaining many specifics and is highly susceptible to suggestion. “Memory is weak in eyewitness situations because it’s overloaded,” said Barbara Tversky, a psychology professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College in New York. “An event happens so fast, and when the police question you, you probably weren’t concentrating on the details they’re asking about.”\n\nHundreds of studies have cataloged a long list of circumstances that can affect how memories are recorded and replayed, including the emotion at the time of the event, the social pressures that taint its reconstruction, even flourishes unknowingly added after the fact.\n\nWhile most of us tend to think memory works like a video recorder, it is actually more like a grainy slide show. Lost details, including imaginary ones, often are added later. One of the earliest and more famous experiments to demonstrate that memories are malleable was conducted by Elizabeth Loftus, a psychology professor at the University of California, Irvine, and an early pioneer of witness memory research.\n\nIn a 1974 study published in The Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, she asked participants to view films of fender-benders in which no car windows or headlights were broken. Later, the subjects who were asked how fast the cars were going when they “smashed” into each other — as opposed to “hit” — were more likely to report speeding and describe shattered glass they never actually saw.\n\nIn another experiment, conducted in Scotland, participants were four times as likely to report a memory of a nonexistent event — in this case, a nurse removing a skin sample from their little finger — if they had been asked to imagine it just one week before. Others in the experiment read a description, but were not asked to picture it happening.\n\nEven the process of police questioning and prepping for trial can crystallize a person’s own faulty reconstruction. In 2000, Dr. Tversky published a series of experiments conducted at Stanford University in the journal Cognitive Psychology. In one, volunteers read profiles of fictitious roommates with both charming and annoying habits; they were then asked to write either a letter of recommendation or letter making a case for a replacement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen later asked to repeat the original description, the volunteers’ recollections were skewed by the type of letter they had written. Their minds had shed qualities that didn’t match the first draft of their own recall and had embellished those that did.\n\n“When we don’t remember, we make inferences,” Dr. Tversky said.\n\nSometimes we miss details because we weren’t paying attention, but sometimes we are concentrating too hard on something else. Nothing is as obvious as it seems.\n\nFew experiments have demonstrated this more notably than one published in 1999 by researchers at Harvard. Participants watched a video of people dressed in either black or white passing a basketball. The subjects were told to count the number of passes made by players in white.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the test, a woman in a gorilla suit strolled through the players. She was unnoticed by about half the people who took the test, the researchers found. Distraction is not unique to the eyes. During a meeting of the Psychonomic Society this month, Polly Dalton and colleagues at the University of London presented the audio version of the gorilla test, a 69-second recording of two men and two women preparing for a party. Almost all of the study participants instructed to listen to the women did not hear a third man repeating “I’m a gorilla” for 19 seconds midway through the conversation.\n\nThe editing of the past occurs without a person’s realizing what has been forgotten. In court, witnesses are asked to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. They think they do. Whether in a story told in a courtroom or at a dinner table, the mind is sometimes prone to blur the distinction between reality and fantasy. Brain scans taken as people “recall” something they did not actually see have many similarities to the brain dwelling on an actual memory.\n\n“That’s one of the striking findings of the studies,” said Daniel Schacter, a psychology professor at Harvard. Whether an event is real or imagined, “many structures involved in the coding and retrieving are the same.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He and his colleagues believe that memory is designed not just to keep track of what has happened, but to offer a script for something that might.\n\nEvidence for this also comes from brain scans. Just as the “recall” of a bogus event lights up the brain’s memory centers, so does thinking about something that might occur.\n\nBecause the brain uses memories for mental dress rehearsal, we are not wired to retain every facet of an event, scientists say. We don’t have to. A general framework is all that’s necessary to keep from getting lost, or find food, or know what to do when a storm is coming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne 1979 study asked a small group of people to pick out a penny from a series of 15 similar drawings. Less than half chose correctly, because no one needs to know whether Lincoln faces left or right to pay the cashier. Yet witnesses often are asked to remember with similar levels of precision, often about scenes and faces spotted fleetingly.\n\nWhen selective attention combines with fear, “you have a very strong memory for a few details,” said Elizabeth Phelps, a psychology professor at New York University. “Emotion gives us confidence more than it gives us accuracy.”\n\nThe problem comes when witnesses bring that certainty to the entire memory. In crimes that involve a weapon, Dr. Loftus and other scientists have found that witnesses will fixate on the gun barrel or knife blade but will fail to notice other details as clearly. Yet because they so starkly remember particulars of the weapon and may have the accuracy of parts of their memory affirmed by police officers and prosecutors, witnesses carry an air of assurance into the courtroom.\n\n“Many people think if someone is confident, they must be right,” said Dr. Loftus.\n\nRather than discount witnesses, researchers are trying to use their findings to make trials fairer and testimony more reliable, particularly in the case of suspect lineups, a police staple at the heart of many wrong convictions. In September, Gary Wells, a psychology professor at Iowa State University, released a new report comparing whether the accuracy of lineups improves when the possible suspects are presented to witnesses in sequence, rather than all at once in the traditional lineup.\n\nIn studies involving actual cases, Dr. Wells’s team found that the likelihood of choosing a stand-in “filler” instead of the suspect fell to 12 percent, from 18 percent, when faces were presented sequentially. The downfall of side-by-side lineups, Dr. Wells said, is that “if the real perpetrator is not in there, there is still someone who looks more like him than the others.”\n\nLineups also may improve when some uncertainties are made clear to witnesses and jurors. Dr. Wells and others recommend changes like making sure a witness knows the perpetrator may not be in the group, and having lineups administered by someone who does not know which photograph is the suspect.\n\nDr. Wells also believes witnesses should give a statement at the time of the lineup documenting how confident they are in their choice — because once the trial comes around, the witnesses will believe they were always sure.\n\nIt may be that witnesses in police stations and courtrooms are being asked the wrong question to begin with — that telling witnesses to pick out a perpetrator, or state exactly what they saw or heard, implies they really can when science suggests that they may well be unable to do so.\n\n“My view is that people should be asked to pick out someone who looks similar to who you saw, or sounds similar to what you heard, and leave it to the jury to decide,” said Donald Thomson, a psychology professor at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPressing witnesses with questions that appear to have precise answers enhances the likelihood that the innocent will be prosecuted and the guilty will escape, Dr. Thomson said. “It forces people to pick someone and say, ‘This is the person,’ ” he said. “Two months down the track, they go into the witness box and say they are absolutely sure.”",

Rand Paul talks politics to a packed house during a rally with Republican Governor candidate Matt Bevin at Kentucky State University's Baptist Campus Ministry in Frankfort, Ky. October 3, 2015. (Photo: Todd Buchanan, Matt Herp, Special to the C-J)Buy Photo\n\nWhen state Rep. Mike Harmon upset Kentucky Auditor Adam Edelen in the Nov. 3 election, the Democrats lost more than just someone in a “watchdog” office who could keep an eye on the administration of incoming Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nThey lost the best hope for a U.S. Senate candidate to challenge Rand Paul and lead the ticket in a year that they desperately need some top-of-the-ticket pizzazz to inspire voters to come out for down-ticket candidates who can help them hold onto the state House of Representatives.\n\nEdelen, who until Election Day appeared to be gearing up to challenge Paul, said he hopes to one day resume his political career but he’s headed back into the private sector for now.\n\n“I’m waiting for bluer skies,” he said. “The environment is just not conducive to electing Democrats statewide. … It’s a very difficult environment for Democrats.”\n\nPatrick Hughes, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said he’s hopeful that the party will be able to come up with a top-tier candidate to challenge Paul, who Democrats believe is weakened by a presidential run that has faltered.\n\nBut Hughes admits that he’s not sure who that might be.\n\n“We have some strong candidates who might be able to take advantage of some excitement on the national level,” he said.\n\nTalk in the party has largely settled around actress Ashley Judd and state Veterans Affairs Commissioner Heather French Henry, and there are some in the party who are holding out hope that some wealthy business person who’s not been involved in politics before will step forward.\n\nLouisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who lost the Democratic primary to challenge Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2008, is also often mentioned as a possible challenger.\n\nHenry said she’s not even thinking about the race right now and that she wants to get to Dec. 8 when Bevin will be sworn in and her appointment ends. (It’s unlikely that Bevin would reappoint her to the post after he was critical in May of Gov. Steve Beshear’s appointment of her.)\n\n“The idea that we would have a veterans’ administration not run by a veteran, for starters, is a little bit odd to me,” he said six months ago. “There’s a big difference between the civilian sector and the military ranks. … We need somebody in charge of the veterans’ affairs and the things that affect us as veterans that has literally walked or rucked in our boots.”\n\nHenry said her plan is to head back to her foundation that helps veterans when her job as commissioner ends. Though she didn’t rule out a run completely, she said a federal office may not be the best fit for her now.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Breaking news alerts Please try again soon, or contact Customer Service at 1-800-866-2211.

Denny Butler, of Louisville, to join the GOP in recent weeks.\n\nThey have reduced the Democratic majority in the House to 53-47 and hope to flip control of the chamber for the first time in nearly 100 years during the November elections.\n\nHughes said the party’s biggest concern is to win two upcoming special elections that will be needed to replace state Reps. Ryan Quarles and Harmon, both Republicans who won races for agriculture commissioner and auditor.\n\nIf they can do that, they hope they can slow GOP momentum that has shifted the state from a Democratic to Republican stronghold over the last 25 years.\n\nHe argues that the state House and U.S. Senate races are not intertwined because they will be run on different issues. “As it relates to the U.S. Senate campaign, I think that’s independently important for the Democrats to field a candidate, and it has to be a competitive candidate,” he said.\n\nAnd while Hughes said it’s important to have a strong Democrat running for the Senate, it’s not nearly as important for down-ticket races as it was in 2014 when Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes tied up Sen. Mitch McConnell and forced him to spend his time focusing on his re-election rather than raising money for state House candidates.\n\n“She was able to draw the attention of Sen. McConnell and his machine away from the House,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s going to be possible this go-round because Sen. McConnell isn’t going to be occupied with that and we’d be naive to think he isn’t interested with what happens with the House races.”\n\nU.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Louisville, said he believes it’s important for Democrats to find a strong candidate but he’s not certain that will be the determining factor when it comes to control of the state House.\n\nFor one thing, he said that Hillary Clinton is likely to be the Democratic Presidential nominee and that former President Bill Clinton has assured him that Hillary Clinton would campaign in Kentucky.\n\n“I talked to the president and they are going to be active here,” Yarmuth said.\n\nEven if Clinton doesn’t spend heavily to win in Kentucky, large swaths of Kentucky will see her ads because she will compete in Indiana and Ohio and will be forced to buy air time on Louisville and Cincinnati television, Yarmuth said.\n\nWithout a strong candidate for U.S. Senate spending heavily in the state, “it makes it more difficult” for the Democrats to hold onto the state House. Bevin’s performance is really what’s most important, Yarmuth said.\n\n“If this administration works well, it will make it harder for us. If it’s a train wreck it makes it easier,” he said.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at 502-582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.

  "latent_4453": "Scientology 'putting lives at risk'\n\nUpdated\n\nAustralian of the Year Professor Patrick McGorry has thrown his weight behind calls for a Senate inquiry into the Church of Scientology, saying the church's teachings are putting Australians' lives at risk.\n\nProfessor McGorry, a world-renowned youth mental health expert, and two other respected Australian psychiatrists are supporting independent Senator Nick Xenophon's efforts to set up an investigation into the church's activities and its teachings on psychiatric care.\n\nProfessor McGorry says it is time to put the Church of Scientology under the federal parliamentary microscope.\n\n\"It's a bit like they're the deniers of the reality of mental illness, which is not only incredibly irresponsible and dangerous, but something that has to be challenged,\" he said.\n\nProfessor McGorry says he has been motivated by his long-time advocacy of early intervention for mental health problems.\n\nThe Church of Scientology has strong views about psychiatric medicine, and Professor McGorry says those teachings should be examined in a public forum such as a Senate inquiry.\n\n\"I'm concerned that any restriction or any discouragement of access to mental health care will cost lives and result in unnecessary disability for people,\" Professor McGorry said.\n\nProfessor Ian Hickie, the executive director of the Brain and Mind Institute in Sydney, also supports a Senate inquiry, as does Professor Louise Newman, the president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I've certainly come into contact with people with mental illness who have sought help or assistance from the Church of Scientology, and from many other organisations,\" Professor Newman said.\n\n\"In their contact with the Church of Scientology they've been discouraged from having appropriate treatment.\n\n\"Some have been encouraged to cease taking psychiatric medication even when those might be indicated, and there has certainly been no attempt to actually get people in any reasonable form of alternate therapy.\n\n\"This is not a trivial issue and I think for far too long, these sort of extremist views have hidden behind a group which describes itself as being an organised religion.\"\n\nProfessor McGorry says he and his two colleagues are just the tip of a very deep iceberg.\n\n\"The whole mental health field would support this call for an inquiry and it's overdue in fact, in my opinion,\" he said.\n\nProfessor McGorry met Senator Nick Xenophon yesterday.\n\nForced abortion claims\n\nIn Parliament last year Senator Xenophon raised serious allegations of abuse, blackmail and forced abortions within the church.\n\nThe church claimed he had abused parliamentary privilege, but the Senator has pushed for an inquiry.\n\nThe Greens support the push but as yet it does not have enough support from either the Government or Opposition Senators, who will be voting on it by the end of next week.\n\n\"I was heartened by the Prime Minister's statement last year that he was concerned about these allegations,\" Senator Xenophon said.\n\n\"The logical conclusion of the concerns expressed by the Prime Minister is for the Labor Party to support this inquiry.\n\n\"These are concerns that need to be dealt with in a transparent and robust manner.\n\n\"The way to do that is a Senate inquiry. The Church of Scientology can be represented at that inquiry, they can give their submissions, but it would be an open and transparent process.\n\n\"What has the Church of Scientology to fear by having an open and transparent inquiry?\"\n\nBut Labor is sticking to its position that the Senate is not the right place to investigate the allegations.\n\nAnd a spokesman for Opposition Senate Leader Nick Minchin says the Coalition is also unlikely to support it.\n\nThe ABC has been told that more than half of Coalition senators support the move, but there is resistance \"at the top\".\n\nA spokesman for Senator Xenophon says discussions are continuing to try and secure the support of the Coalition.\n\nSenator Xenophon would not say if he was obsessed with this issue.\n\n\"I've got an obligation to the victims of Scientology, who have come forward with very serious allegations, to see this through,\" he said.\n\n\"To do anything else would be abandoning those victims. To do anything else would be walking away from a very important issue.\n\n\"So I guess my message to my colleagues and to the community at large is that if it's an important issue in the public interest, I can be a completely stubborn bastard.\"\n\nBut a spokesman for the Church of Scientology, Cyrus Brooks, says pushing for an inquiry is the wrong way for the professors and Senator Xenophon to go.\n\n\"They're getting into the field of religion and they better stay in the field of mental health,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not the role of the Parliament and there are already frameworks in place for people who have made complaints.\n\n\"Many dissenters have said that and, I think, that's a true statement.\"\n\nTopics: mental-health, community-and-society, religion-and-beliefs, government-and-politics, health, australia\n\nFirst posted",
  "latent_4490": "For other people with the same name, see Daniel Wilson\n\nAmerican singer, songwriter and musician\n\nDaniel Dodd \"Dan\" Wilson (born May 20, 1961) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, producer, and visual artist. His songwriting resume includes \"Closing Time\", which he wrote for his band, Semisonic, \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" (co-written with the Dixie Chicks) and \"Someone like You\" (co-written with Adele). He earned a Grammy nomination for “Closing Time” (Best Rock Song) and won Grammys for Song of the Year (“Not Ready to Make Nice” in 2007) and Album of the Year (which he won in 2012 as one of the producers of Adele’s 21).\n\nIn addition to being the leader of Semisonic, Wilson has released several solo recordings, including the 2017 release Re-Covered. He was also a member of the Minneapolis psychedelic rock band Trip Shakespeare.[1]\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nWilson is originally from St. Louis Park, Minnesota. Wilson attended Harvard University, where he studied visual arts with a focus on printmaking[2] and from which he graduated B.A. summa cum laude in Visual and Environmental Studies in 1983,[3] while he resided in Dunster House. Wilson is an accomplished artist, and won the first Louis Sudler Prize for Outstanding Artistic Talent and Achievement in 1983.[4] While in college, he began collaborating with his brother, singer-songwriter Matt Wilson, who also attended Harvard College. The Wilson brothers played in two bands, Animal Dance and the Love Monsters. After college, Wilson pursued his interest in drawing and painting, first in San Francisco and then in Minneapolis.\n\nIn 1987, Wilson joined the Minneapolis psychedelic band, Trip Shakespeare, which Matt Wilson had founded with bassist John Munson and drummer Elaine Harris. The original three members had already released one record, and now as a quartet, with Wilson on guitar, piano, sharing lead vocal duties with Matt Wilson—with whom Wilson also co-wrote many of the songs—and Munson, the band released three more albums (Are You Shakespearienced?, 1988, Gark Records; Across the Universe, 1990, A&M Records; Lulu, 1991, A&M Records) and one EP (Volt, 1992, Twin Tone).\n\nSince Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson has continued to collaborate with his brother, including the release of two live albums (Minneapolis 2010 and Minneapolis 2013).\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nWith Semisonic [ edit ]\n\nWilson with Semisonic\n\nAfter Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson and Munson joined with drummer Jacob Slichter to form Pleasure, a trio that was later renamed Semisonic. Semisonic released one EP, three full-length albums, and one live album.\n\nThe band's first album, Great Divide, received critical acclaim. David Fricke wrote in a year-end Rolling Stone article on the notable albums of 1996, \"Great Divide is that rare '96 beast, a record of simple but sparkling modern pop, rattling with power-trio vitality.\" It was their 1998 release, Feeling Strangely Fine, however, that brought the band to widespread national and then international attention and success. Powered by Wilson's songs \"Closing Time\", which was a number-one hit on the Modern Rock charts for thirteen weeks in the spring and summer of 1998, the follow-up single \"Singing in My Sleep\", and \"Secret Smile\", a breakthrough hit for the band internationally, Feeling Strangely Fine attained platinum sales status in the U.S. and U.K. \"Closing Time\" received a 1999 Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song[5] and has become an enduring pop-culture reference point for the late 1990s. It was a focal point of the plot and soundtrack of the 2011 film Friends with Benefits.\n\nSemisonic's third album, All About Chemistry, was released in 2001, and featured Wilson's song \"Chemistry\", the album's first single, and also included \"One True Love\", a song Wilson co-wrote with Carole King.\n\nSemisonic stopped touring in August 2001 but continue to perform on occasion. Slichter's memoir, So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star, provides a detailed account of the band's adventures and misadventures in the music business.\n\nAs a solo artist [ edit ]\n\nFree Life [ edit ]\n\nWilson's solo debut, Free Life, was released in 2007 by American Recordings. Produced with Rick Rubin, Free Life was recorded in Minneapolis and Los Angeles and includes performances by Tracy Bonham, Sheryl Crow, Jason Lader, Gary Louris, Natalie Maines, Benmont Tench, and a number of Minneapolis-based musicians including multi-instrumentalist and frequent Semisonic sideman Ken Chastain, Eric Fawcett, John Hermanson, Joanna James, Mason Jennings, Steve Rhoem, Joe Savage, as well as Wilson's Semisonic bandmates Munson and Slichter.\n\nFree Life helped establish Wilson's reputation as a songwriter, with The A.V. Club writing, \"the star of the show here is Wilson's remarkable instinct for creating gorgeous songs, and his unabashed, obvious joy in doing so. For anyone worried that songcraft is an endangered species, Free Life should ease those fears.\"[6]\n\nLove Without Fear [ edit ]\n\nWilson's second solo album, Love Without Fear, was released on April 15, 2014 and includes performances by Sara Bareilles, Missy Higgins, Lissie, Natalie Maines, Blake Mills, Sara Watkins, and Sean Watkins. The first recording from Love Without Fear, \"Disappearing\" (with a cover of Neil Young's \"Out on the Weekend\" included as a b-side) was released on November 7, 2013 and was the debut release of the new singles label, Canvasclub.\n\nIn describing the album, Wilson said, \"The songs are about being left alone, not wanting to lose someone, about desperately wishing for connection and togetherness. The sound of the record lives at the intersection of Americana and Beatles- influenced rock and roll. A little bit of twang and a lot of cinematic emotion.\"[7] The album received largely favourable reviews emphasizing Wilson's reputation as a songwriter.[8][9][10][11] “Dan Wilson’s career is proof positive that smart, elegant songwriting has a place in music… [Love Without Fear] is a lovely amalgamation of chamber rock, gentle country, gooey '70s pop and snappy soul.\"[12]\n\nWilson's third solo studio album, Re-Covered, was released on August 4, 2017. The album is a collection of reinterpretations of songs Wilson wrote for other artists, both big hits and “songs that I always wished were big hits, but weren’t.” The album includes \"Someone Like You\" (written with Adele), \"Not Ready To Make Nice\" (written with Dixie Chicks), \"Home\" (written with Dierks Bentley and Brett Beavers), and \"When The Stars Come Out\" (written with Chris Stapleton).[13]\n\nWords and Music by Dan Wilson [ edit ]\n\nWilson’s discoveries as a solo artist and collaborator with other artists are the subject of “Words and Music by Dan Wilson”, solo concerts in which he performs some of his songs and describes the songs’ various inspirations or the insights that occasioned their composition. “Words and Music by Dan Wilson” has come to Hotel Cafe, Room 5 and Largo in Los Angeles, Joe's Pub and City Winery in New York, World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, Jammin' Java in DC, Rams Head in Annapolis, The Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis, the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul,[14] Schubas Tavern in Chicago, Berklee College of Music's Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston, and the Red Barn concert series in Northfield, MN. Wilson has also presented Words & Music workshops at the 2012 ASCAP expo, UCLA's Herb Alpert School of Music, and USC's Thornton School of Music.[15]\n\nWilson’s thoughts about songwriting and advice to young songwriters are also captured in his Vines series, Words & Music in Six Seconds. They were described as \"In his short videos, Wilson provides insightful quips about common songwriting insecurities, methodology, personal writing quirks, and various other tips for writing your best.\"[16]\n\nAs a songwriter and producer [ edit ]\n\nAs a songwriter and producer, Wilson has collaborated with a number of artists. Two of these collaborations have earned him Grammy Awards.\n\nA number of artists have described Wilson's ability to help put their feelings and ideas into song. Speaking of her experience of working with him, Pink said, in an online interview, \"He is brilliant, and he's a thoughtful songwriter. And he's a song crafter . . . like old-school. He crafts songs and he thinks about them. And I learned a lot from working with him.” In describing her co-writing with Wilson, Adele said, \"Dan had me on my hands and knees, crying my eyes out - there's just something about him that made me completely open up as a composer.\"[17]\n\nTaking the Long Way – The Dixie Chicks [ edit ]\n\nWilson co-wrote six of the songs on the Dixie Chicks multiple-Grammy-winning album Taking the Long Way, including the title song and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", which earned Wilson and the Dixie Chicks the 2007 Grammy for Song of the Year. In the 2006 film Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing, Wilson speaks on camera about his experience as a co-writer on this album, especially in regard to helping the Dixie Chicks make an artistic response to their rejection by radio and a large swath of their fans in the wake of the band's statements about President Bush and the Iraq War.\n\nOne of the songs he co-wrote for this album, \"Easy Silence\", appears on Free Life, with Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines singing harmonies.\n\n21 – Adele [ edit ]\n\nWilson co-wrote three of the songs on Adele's multiple-Grammy-winning 21, \"Don't You Remember\", “One and Only\", and, most notably, \"Someone Like You\", which became a number one hit in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand was a top ten hit around the globe. As a producer of this track, on which he also played piano, Wilson shared in the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn an interview with American Songwriter, Wilson recounted the writing and recording of \"Someone Like You\":\n\nThe recording on the album was intended as a demo. I was thinking, \"Oh, they're going to make a big version of this, strings and angelic choirs, like a big Chrissie Hynde power-ballad.\" But by the end of the first day, the demo was sounding lovely, and very affecting, but it was only half-written, there were no words on the second verse or the bridge as I remember.

  "latent_4585": "A Real New York Derby\n\nOn May 14, 2014, two goals in the last ten minutes from towering Haitian striker Yvener Guerrier pushed the Brooklyn Italians past the Jersey Express, and set up a US Open Cup match with the New York Cosmos. Guerrier’s brace, in a game between two semi-professional teams, on a field not far Kearny, New Jersey, the original mecca of American soccer, went entirely unnoticed at a time when the entire soccer world was immersed in the build up to the impending World Cup in Brazil. But for the Italians it provided an opportunity to make a point about the deep divisions present in local New York soccer culture.\n\nThe next morning, the Italians tweeted a black and white photo of the Brooklyn Bridge with the inscription, “A Real New York Derby,” accompanied by the words: “History cannot be made overnight. Two of New York's historic clubs will go head to head in the @usopencup #authentic”\n\nThe semi-professional Italians, playing in the fourth tier of the American soccer pyramid, made it clear that although the country’s first division Major League Soccer (MLS) would soon have two clubs representing New York City, they considered the newly reborn second division Cosmos as their historic rival, rather than MLS’s 20-year-old New Jersey based New York Red Bulls or the expansion franchise, New York City Football Club (NYCFC), which was set to begin play in March 2015. The organizers of the community based Italians presented its connection to Cosmos as genuine, while the competition between Red Bulls and NYCFC was envisioned as contrived. A debatable point, as for all the Italians’ claims of a historic rivalry, the first game between Red Bulls and NYCFC will be the first soccer game between intracity rivals at the top level in nearly 100 years.\n\nAmong dedicated followers of the game, for whom soccer is more of an identity marker than an entertainment choice, the re-emergence of the Cosmos and the creation of NYCFC has revealed fissures that are emblematic of growing divisions in the American soccer community at large. In the past, allegiance options in New York were limited to teams in semi-professional leagues or short lived professional leagues, and in the worst of times, no teams at all. Suddenly presented with a choice among three professional teams, the fans most immersed in the sport’s culture, perhaps for the first time in American sports, have chosen their loyalties based on distinct historical identities and structural philosophies associated with each side.\n\nCertainly some fans have picked a side based on location, colours, or players, but it also clear that there is now a line of demarcation between supporters who embrace the rising mainstream popularity of MLS, accepting the attendant corporatization of team identities and marginalization of fan power that has come along with it, and those who support teams, in part, because they seek to maintain a place in American sports for the alternative to commercialization that soccer has consistently offered. They value the ability of fans to serve as a counterbalance to the financial investors of a team. Those at the farthest extreme want to see teams governed as public trusts and the sport ruled as a democracy.\n\nFrom the purchase of MLS’s original New York franchise MetroStars by Red Bull GmbH in 2006 through the founding of the new Cosmos and NYCFC to the opening day of the 2015 MLS season, the New York metropolitan area has acted as a microcosm for this conflict amongst American soccer fans. At the forefront are the largest and most influential organized supporter groups for each team: Empire Supporters Club for the Red Bulls, The Borough Boys for Cosmos and The Third Rail for NYCFC. Through their histories, it is possible to trace the fundamental divisions in American soccer on a far deeper level than the teams on the field.\n\nAs with other supporters groups across the country, the New York groups seek to emulate supporter organizations and trusts in Europe and South America, but without the distinct ethnic, political, social and class affiliations that have given rise to the clubs, teams and supporters groups elsewhere. The sole bond between the supporters is the team itself. Therefore, while ultras in the rest of the world have often used their organizations to further social and political goals, in the United States, activism has been limited to the actions of the team ownership and the identity of specific teams. Conflicts amongst supporters groups and between fans and power structures outside the stadium are non-existent. This interdependent relationship between the supporter groups and the teams narrows the space for the fans to assert independent opposition to policies that are counter to their interests. This is in stark contrast to the significant political and social power that fans hold elsewhere.\n\nHowever, there is one sphere where American organized supporter groups have shown the potential to mimic the power that ultras hold in the rest of the world. That is within the domestic culture of the sport itself. Supporter groups have at times acted as a counterbalance to the corporate interests that have dictated the governance of the sport since the 1994 World Cup was awarded to the United States in 1988 and the birth of MLS in 1995. The formation of organized supporter groups subverts the traditional passive orientation of fans of other American sports, who exhibit their affiliation through acts of consumerism like buying tickets and merchandise. Even the most active fans of other sports limit their public criticism to booing at the stadium or making complaints to the media through sports talk radio. By contrast, people who join a supporters group make a conscious choice to take an active role in the team identity and establish a stadium atmosphere that is not coordinated by the public address system. Perhaps more relevantly the leadership of supporters groups seek to represent the interests of their members as an organized voice to team management, with the primary goal of the team’s succeeding, not necessarily on the field or as a profitable business, but as a cultural touchstone.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the objectives of league officials and franchise owners who seek to insure that their financial interests are taken into consideration as the league is developed. The owners structured the league as a centralized business, rather than a collective of independent clubs, which they call “single entity.” This structure limits the top division to 20 affiliated franchises, sets every team budget, and allocates all player contracts. It prevents competition amongst the league’s franchises for players and discourages the development of individual team identities in the favour of a league wide homogenization.\n\nWith the exponential rise in interest among corporations, broadcasters and the population at large in soccer, it remains a matter of debate as to how supporter groups can best exert themselves to insure that they are part of the key decisions made by soccer teams. Over the course of the past 20 years, MLS supporter groups have gone from outcasts to part of the league’s marketing strategy since the arrival of soccer specific stadiums in the mid-2000s. The relationship is so close that some organized supporters groups take the lead in selling tickets and arranging travel for away matches. Yet, tensions still exist, as the league still holds nearly all the power in making decisions on player movement, fan involvement and perhaps most importantly which communities, localities and teams gain access to the first division of American soccer, through the maintenance of a system of growth that depends on expansion by fee rather than promotion based on onfield success.\n\nThe primary question, then, facing supporters groups both within MLS and outside of it, is how closely to align their ideals and goals, with those of the league. While there is fluidity among the beliefs, tactics and actions of the Empire Supporters Club, The Third Rail and The Borough Boys, they represent three distinct philosophies on fan power and organization. Empire Supporters Club initially defined the culture of their chosen franchise as they fought for recognition by the league and the general acceptance of soccer in mainstream American culture. The club has now become an avenue for fans to voice their discontent. The Third Rail formed once the league was firmly established and in their brief history has couched their advocacy with a symbiotic relationship with NYCFC’s front office as the team attempts to establish a foothold in New York’s crowded sports marketplace. The Borough Boys’ genesis lies in the advocacy campaign to create a second professional level team in New York City, and has since morphed into a group that advocates for a democratization of the sport in the United States. In short, ESC is emblematic of incremental influence based on a historic connection; The Third Rail represents a consolidation of the MLS’s top down strategy and acceptance by fans of their marginalization in favour of a team that is well established within the cultural mainstream, while the Borough Boys are indicative of an alternate structure that favours grassroots power.\n\nEach set of fans has a viable argument as the city’s historic and authentic representatives. Supporting the team through 20 years of mediocrity in a small niche of the New York sports market, Red Bulls fans, led by the ESC, have suffered the longest. The Cosmos roots lie in the 1970s and the glamour sides of Pele, Giorgio Chinaglia, and Franz Beckenbauer that put soccer on the American map. Accordingly, the new Cosmos had name recognition and fans, as well as the Borough Boys, before they even had a team. Finally, NYCFC is the first team to play within the city limits since the original Cosmos left for Giants Stadium in 1977. The Third Rail began to take shape on the same day the team was announced able to forge an identity that was distinctly relevant to the city in its present day form.\n\nBut each team also faces serious questions about its genuine connection to the city and its soccer past. In 20 years, despite building a state-of-the-art soccer stadium, the Red Bulls still languish in the bottom half of MLS’s attendance standings, play their games in Harrison, New Jersey and have a history of front office and onfield decisions, including the incorporation of the Red Bull soft drink into their identity, that have distanced them from core supporters. The reborn Cosmos play their games at Long Island’s Hofstra University, far from public transportation and an hour’s drive outside the city. Although the new club has done everything possible to align themselves with the team of the 1970s and 1980s, the team itself went missing for 30 years and perhaps most importantly now plays in an updated version of the North American Soccer League (NASL), a league that lacks the cultural prominence and mainstream legitimacy of MLS. NYCFC too, lacks a stadium of their own. They play in a baseball arena that lacks the intimacy of a soccer specific stadium and have relegated their supporters clubs to the second deck, a safe distance from the pitch where they would be better able to influence the gameday atmosphere. Moreover, the team is unabashedly tied to its owners, England’s Manchester City and baseball’s New York Yankees, who have repeatedly made choices that favour the parent clubs over their new soccer franchise. These connections make it that much more difficult for fans to establish their own identity in the city’s crowded sporting scene.\n\nEach team’s historic inconsistencies make it is impossible to determine if the Italians are correct in asserting which team genuinely deserves the mantle of New York’s soccer past and thus able to participate in a “real New York derby”. However, in tracing the origins of supporter culture in New York, particularly since the purchase of the MetroStars by Red Bull GmbH, we gain insight into the very real conflicts that exist between the city’s fans beyond the play on the field.\n\nThe Origin of New York Soccer: A Family Affair Extending Well Into Sunday Afternoon\n\nNew York soccer culture begins well before the existence of any of the three teams currently vying for local supremacy. It started in the late 1800s when the game itself found its way onto American soil. From its inception, organized soccer in the New York metropolitan area was integrally connected with the immigrant communities and fans that attended the matches. The earliest teams were financed by industrial companies and made up of their labourers. Clubs like Clark O.N.T. in Kearny and Todd’s Shipyard in Brooklyn played on fields in the shadow of their sponsor companies, at the centre of neighbourhoods built to house the working men and their families.\n\nAccording to Tom McCabe, a professor of history at Rutgers University Newark, soccer fields, along with churches, were a focal point of community gatherings.\n\n“Every weekend there was a series of games at the local soccer mecca like Clark Field in East Newark,” said McCabe in an interview in June 2014. “The field was in the middle of the neighbourhood. Before the game, you would go to the local bar, lay down a bet on the game. Then go back to the bar at halftime, maybe lay down another bet. After the game you’d go back to the tavern where the players would join you. It was a family affair extending well into Sunday afternoon.”\n\nFans and players were peers, working alongside each other at the factories for six days, then gathering at the field on Sunday. Crowds as large as 4,000 watched games. The teams took on the ethnic identity of their immigrant fans with names like Kearny Scots, New York Hakoah Americans, and later on Newark Ukrainian Sitch and the aforementioned Brooklyn Italians. While over time, the teams themselves embraced diversity, the fans and their culture mirrored the activities of the working-class support in their home countries. The Kearny Scots had a band complete with a bag piper. There were derisive songs for the referee and the opponents, as well as a replication of the ethnic rivalries from Europe. Glasgow’s heated Old Firm rivalry, found its way to Kearny when the Protestant Scots played the Catholic Kearny Celtic.\n\nCosmos Country: The Re-emergence Of American Professional Soccer\n\nUntil the 1960s, soccer remained a largely immigrant (and thus invisible to mainstream American culture) and amateur game, with sporadic fits of professionalization. For the first half of the 20th century, most New York area teams maintained their ethnic identification as members of the various incarnations of the American Soccer League or other semipro and regional leagues. Fan based organizations outside of these enclaves were rare. After the 1966 World Cup, the USSF sought proposals to found a true national league with regional, rather than historically and ethnically based, teams. In the late 1960s, two competing leagues (the North American Soccer League and the United Soccer Association) each founded new New York franchises, the Generals and the Skyliners respectively, which sought a broader New York City soccer fanbase outside of the narrow immigrant base of the ethnic teams.\n\nAlthough both the Generals and Skyliners were gone by the end of the 1960s, the shift from European style organized support to the more generic fandom seen in other American sports continued unabated, manifesting itself most clearly in the rise of the New York Cosmos under the ownership of Time Warner media company in the 1970s. Time Warner’s dollars lured first Pele, then a cavalcade of European stars, and eventually thousands of fans to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Cosmos set American professional soccer attendance records including 77,691 on August 14, 1977 and 70 consecutive games with 30,000 or more fans from 197781. By 1977, they were averaging more fans than the Yankees and by the following year, they had more fans per game than both of the city’s baseball teams combined. Unlike any soccer team before or since, the Cosmos penetrated both the American sports mass media and the consciousness of soccer fans across the world.\n\nAlong with the unprecedented crowds, the Cosmos added familiar spectacles of American sports, including the cheerleading Cosmos Girls, amplified music, and a mascot: Time Warner’s own Bugs Bunny. There were kids’ fan clubs and a few generic organized chants, but fan culture centred not around sections or supporter clubs, but rather the tailgate before the game. Fans arrived hours before kick-off to grill and drink, setting up their own goals in the parking lot. The scene developed into a mass picnic scene known as “Cosmos Country.” At the start of the 1980s, interest waned as the league faltered financially and eventually folded. The disappearance of the Cosmos in 1985 along with the demise of latest incarnation of the American Soccer League in 1983, pushed soccer, its fans and their traditions once again to the margins of the city’s sports world. Diehards continued to follow youth and college soccer at home and the European leagues abroad on Spanish language channels, through programs like PBS’ “Soccer Made In Germany”, or at bars with satellite service that opened early on Saturday. By the early 1990s, the only source of regular soccer news was a weekly column by Michael Lewis in the Daily News. It took an event no smaller than the World Cup in 1994 to lure enough interest at the corporate level to consider a national professional league again. “There was a long mourning for sudden death,” said McCabe.\n\nKicking About On Ruined Pitches: Grassroots Soccer Returns To Prominence\n\nIn 1988, FIFA awarded the 1994 World Cup to the United States. The selection was unprecedented, in that for the first time soccer’s global spectacle would be held outside of its epicentres in Europe and South America. It came with the condition that the USSF establish a viable national professional league. While the federation solicited proposals and sought out investors for the new league, soccer became a decidedly grassroots experience for fans who continued to turnout for professional and semi-professional games in underfunded leagues like the Western Soccer Alliance, the American Professional Soccer League, and the A League, and for the annual knockout competition, the US Open Cup.\n\nIn the New York area, ethnic teams like Greek American Atlas Astoria and the Brooklyn Italians remained annual competitors in the Open Cup, while regionally based teams like New Jersey Eagles (198990) and the New York Centaurs (1995 only) tended to be short lived. Small venues with intensely interested fans saw a return of pre NASL atmosphere of intimacy between players and supporters. In their only season, the Centaurs played at Downing Stadium before crowds that rarely topped 300, but a number of them formed a supporters group known as the New York City Firm.\n\n“We would stand at midfield and the sole beer vendor would basically hang out with us and sell us cans of Budweiser on demand,” said Kevin McAllister, one of the members of the group. “The PA announcer was a local C list comedian named Stu. I forget his last name. The NYC Firm and Stu would often have protracted exchanges regarding his announcements and/or the commercials he would read at various points during the matches. The Centaurs played one match that summer against the Vancouver White Caps on the Saturday following a Lollapalooza concert. The field had been destroyed by the concert and the referee abandoned the match. After the match was cancelled, the supporters took the field and played an impromptu pick up match with the players. Funny stuff guys kitted out for a match and other guys holding cigarettes and cans of Budweiser kicking about on the ruined pitch.”\n\nThe death of the Centaurs was imminent, but the newly formed Major League Soccer (MLS) had announced that the New York area would be represented by two teams, one in New Jersey and the other on Long Island. In anticipation of the new teams, members of the New York City Firm and a group of regulars who watched English and Scottish league matches at the Kinsale Pub on the Upper East Side founded another supporters group. They called themselves the Empire Supporters Club, to reflect one of the rumoured names of the new franchises, Empire Soccer Club. They were part of a nationwide movement among soccer fans, in particular those affiliated with the US national team’s supporter club: Sam’s Army, that attempted establish a connection with the new teams. Much of the initial organizing took place online through chat rooms. Unlike the passive official fan clubs of other American sports these fans’ intentions were to build on their experiences in small venues and actively influence the culture of the new franchises. Despite this movement, each team would have their badges, colours and names created by the central league office.\n\nAn Appeal To The Fan As A Consumer: The Birth Of Major League Soccer\n\nThe 1994 World Cup saw Americans flock to American gridiron stadiums to watch international soccer. The Cup set FIFA attendance records that still stand 20 years later. Giants Stadium saw the return of sell-out crowds and boisterous pregame tailgates. “With the arrival of the World Cup in 1994, I think a lot of the people that went to Giants Stadium had experience with the Cosmos,” said McCabe. “The Italy Ireland game was huge.”\n\nDespite this success, MLS chose to delay the start of the league until 1996 as it lined up financing, stadiums, and players. By the time the league announced the official names of its franchises at a press event in October 1995, the initial 12 teams had been scaled back to 10, with one of the casualties being the Long Island team. Instead of the Empire Soccer Club, New York City’s team would be the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, named in part for their ownership group Metromedia. They would play at Giants Stadium and their home kit would be based on the black and red colour scheme of AC Milan because of the owner’s affinity for the giant Italian club.\n\nThe league eschewed any connection to NASL, particularly the Cosmos, and largely departed from traditional international naming conventions and colours, choosing instead to adopt the garish fashion popular in the mid-1990s, combined with offbeat nicknames like “Clash” (San Jose), “Fusion” (Miami) and “Wiz” (Kansas City) that bore little connection to their municipalities.\n\n“MLS sensed the opportunity to appeal to the fan as a consumer,” wrote American soccer historian David Wangerin in his book Soccer in a Football World. “In fact, ‘MLS Unveiled,’ as the event was christened, struck many as an outright capitulation to the creative excess of designers, with no one on the soccer side brave enough to channel their creative juices.” Despite these reservations, the Empire Supporters Club now had a team to get behind. They reached out to the MetroStars in late 1995 and received an enthusiastic response with the team agreeing to designate section 135 of Giants Stadium for supporters. With the section established, they found a home bar for away game watch parties and kept in touch with each other through an email newsletter.\n\n“We were organized by word of mouth and email notices,” said McAllister, who had gone on to become one of the initial organizers of ESC. “We were not incorporated and had few rules or bylaws during the early days. We described ourselves as an anarchist collective.”\n\nThe league made it clear that they wanted the New York/New Jersey franchise to be a success by allocating US national team star Tab Ramos and the league’s highest profile European import, Italian striker Roberto Donadoni to the MetroStars. Initial local fascination with the team outstripped even the league’s expectations. Interest in the opening game at Giants Stadium was so high that the team’s telephone sales system crashed and the franchise was forced to open up additional sections of the arena to fit in 46,826 people on April 20, 1996. “The parking lot before the first match was almost like the 1994 World Cup an excited, multinational party in the sunshine,” said Benjamin Poremski, one of the original ESC members. The team responded by capitulating in the final minutes of extra time, when MetroStars defender Nicola Caricola knocked the ball into his own net. Crowds continued to turn out throughout the first year, even as the team imploded on the field. Despite lacking a transit link to the city, the MetroStars averaged more fans per game (23,898) than baseball’s Mets (19,609) and around 4,000 less than the city banner franchise, the Yankees (28,136).\n\nDespite the popularity of the franchise, from the opening match onwards, ESC’s attempts to create a distinct fan culture were met with a mixture of indifference and hostility from the front office, the stadium personnel, and their fellow fans. While the team had listed 135 as a supporters section in its marketing materials, they made no accommodations for standing and singing.\n\n“The first couple of matches at Giants Stadium were a disaster,” said McAllister. “Section 135 was a mess some people standing and singing for the entire match and others struggling to make them sit down. [The] Metro [front office] had sold tickets in the section to people who did not bargain for this scene and the ESC and NYC Firm people felt that Metro had let them down. Security hassles were common and Section 135 was not at all what we had envisioned.”\n\nAfter a few matches, ESC convinced the front office to open one of the tarp covered unsold endline sections to the supporters club. They established themselves in section 101, but continued to have problems. Standing was allowed but flags and instruments remained banned. Security officials, accustomed to dealing with American football fans, who for the most part followed the cues of the stadium scoreboard as to when to stand and cheer, reacted swiftly and vigorously to anything like coordinated bouncing or smoke bombs that struck them as out of the ordinary.\n\n“They did not seem to like soccer culture and they did seem to enjoy harassing folks in Section 101 on a rather consistent basis,” said McAllister.\n\nThat’s So Metro: The Struggles Of New York/New Jersey Franchise\n\nAs the jubilation around the franchise’s arrival dissipated and the team struggled on the field, fewer and fewer fans were willing to support it. While attendance dropped 16% league wide in 1997, the MetroStars gate plummeted by 29%. Giants Stadium began to dwarf smaller and smaller crowds to the point in 1999 when some games were seen by less than 10,000 fans.\n\nFan support evaporated for a number of reasons. The team was not very good, posting the worst cumulative record for the league’s first seven years. The players continually failed to live up to expectations, head coaches rarely stayed more than a year, the stadium was difficult to get to and lacked atmosphere. The team’s position as a tenant of the National Football League’s New York Giants forced them into odd scheduling and game days on a turf field with gridiron lines. Tensions between supporters and security remained high with seven fan ejections, including four arrests, plus several broken seats and the macing of fan Nelson Martinez in his seat at a game against the Tampa Bay Mutiny early in the 1999 season.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the team never established a clear connection to either New York or New Jersey. As its initial name suggested, it tried to appeal to both and ended up with neither identity. The team’s cartoonish marketing, reflective of the league wide protocol, emphasized suburban soccer moms and children, rather than the young urban working class male base that comprised the core of soccer’s audience in Europe and South America. But MetroStars also insisted it was a New York franchise, despite never having played a game within the city limits, leaving proud New Jerseyites cold.\n\nMLS had hoped the MetroStars would be one of the its anchor franchises, but as the team struggled, the league had attendance and cultural issues of its own. The initial instinct to Americanize the game with sudden death shootouts, playoffs, amplified sound and music, and public address announcements during the game kept European immigrants and other knowledgeable fans away. For all the marketing energy spent on suburban families, the league lacked the financial resources to offer the amenities like preferred parking and diverse concession options that these wealthier fans had come to expect at National Football League and Major League Baseball games. In essence, rather than trying to appeal to people who liked soccer before 1994, MLS was trying to generate new fans for the game itself, who had more disposable income. This led to an emphasis on league wide marketing rather than distinct identities for each team and a concentrated appeal to people as consumers rather than fans. The supporters that did show up made an effort to collectively point out the flaws they saw in the league’s approach.\n\n“It really never occurred to me that the league wouldn't survive,” said ESC member Benjamin Poremski. “I figured soccer was such an easy sell, and the backers of MLS were so rich, that even they couldn't fuck it up. That's not to say that as supporters we didn't find ways to express how much we opposed the (commissioner) Doug Loganera special MLS rules aimed at attracting the short attention span generic sports fans I remember that when the shootout tiebreaker was at our end, we would chant \"fuck the shootout!\" hoping to make it unpalatable for TV audiences.”\n\nThe result of the smaller crowds was a more intimate connection between loyal supporters in ESC, the players and the coaching staff. Older fans, who had seen NASL collapse, were desperate for the league and the team to remain in existence. The supporters advocated for the team through grassroots efforts based in the do-it-yourself culture of underground music that had seen a resurgence in the early 1990s. They used online forums, organized the league’s first away day trips, and conducted community service actions to bring in more members. They filled the gap in media coverage with fanzines like the Stars and Beyond and A Kick in the Ass (AKITA). They worked with a disinterested front office to establish a membership program for tickets in section 101. The program evolved from a card scheme that let any member into the supporters section to one that allowed ESC to sell the section’s tickets at a discount from a special vending window at the stadium. The section came alive in stark contrast to the cavernous empty seats that surrounded them as they established songs and choreography to urge on the team. A bagpiper lent his unique sound to the proceedings.\n\n“I made a conscious decision that I would support this team as though I had grown up with it, that my children and their children would support it, and that I would always hold the team to the idea that if they wanted devoted support, they would act as though they had been around 100 years ago and would be around 100 years from now,” said Poremski. “I had been a casual soccer fan since I was a child during Pele mania, and got more into the sport as ESPN showed games leading up to Italia 90. I saw the atmosphere at matches when I took a trip to England when there was still standing at their stadiums, and wanted to have something like that here.” To be a diehard MLS fan in the late 1990s was to care significantly about a league that had its energy focused elsewhere. Fans developed a decidedly defensive posture. They devoted themselves to a mediocre version of a sport that was at best ignored, at worst despised by American culture. MetroStars fans, in particular, faced rooting for a mismanaged, poor quality team that barely registered in a metropolis with nine other professional franchises. In 1999, as attendance at Giants Stadium reached a new low of 14,706 per game. Part of being a MetroStars supporter was embracing this marginalization and futility, to the point where one of their most common chants, “That’s So Metro,” followed incidents of game play that negatively affected their team. The team’s most popular fan website, Metrofanatic, hosted a polling tournament to determine the worst player in franchise history. There was no poll for the best player.\n\n“Embracing that crappiness and supporting our team despite it gave us a real chip on our shoulders, I think,” said Poremski “And the DC [United] rivalry built it up further. Our first \"large\" away trip (in a rental coach) was to DC for their first home game in 1997. The team showed their trophies from 1996 off to the crowd, and I think DCU even gave away replica championship rings to the fans. We were in a corner at field level and were determined to disrupt their celebration with insulting songs. The DC crowd got out of control, shooting a bottle rocket into the MetroStars bench and hitting the equipment manager in the face, surrounding our section and forcing us out onto the field at the end. (We lost, to no one's surprise.) Stadium security escorted us to the stadium exit and left us to get to the bus on our own. Going through that gauntlet of hate definitely gave us a sense of our identity.”\n\nEqually Awkwardly Named And Blatantly Corporate: The Arrival Of Red Bull\n\nAs the supporter section struggled to gain a foothold, the team was sold again. In March 2006, the Austrian based soft drink manufacturer Red Bull GmbH added the team to its global portfolio of sports teams. As they had elsewhere, without input from the supporters, the company completely overhauled the team’s identity to match the advertising for their signature energy drink. The MetroStars became the Red Bulls, the badge became the company’s logo, the colours changed to the company’s shades of crimson and white, and the kits featured two large red bulls. In buying the club, Red Bull also promised to complete a soccer specific stadium in Harrison, New Jersey that had been pledged by the previous owners, but had stumbled through construction delays.\n\nThe change left supporters, who had slowly taken on and defined the not completely formed MetroStars identity, torn. Several of the original members of the ESC abandoned the team. But others maintained their loyalty. Supporter club organizer Jason Corliss explained on the website, The Inside Left, “I’d finally developed a connection to my (awkwardly named) local team and now that identity was being replaced by an (equally awkwardly named and blatantly corporate) new one. The franchise and supporters had been aching for a new stadium for years and Red Bull stepped up to not only purchase the team but also build a proper, soccer specific stadium of its own. So, back to reconciling hypocrisies. A local team owned by a corporation in Europe? Ummm, ok, as long as they build a stadium, right? Many purists and original supporters felt differently (and still do), and who could blame them? But, for me, a supporter of the New York franchise – thus far a laughing stock among the league’s fans for not only its onfield futility, but its revolving door front office and managerial seat? I saw, and still see, no choice but to be a clear-eyed pragmatist about it.”\n\nThe branding change did little to alter the fortunes of the franchise either on the field or in the stands. The team scraped along in the bottom half of the league standings and attendance continued to slip even as league wide attendance finally began to rise. Many of the Americanisms like the shootout had been abandoned, while the league embraced the intimacy of soccer specific stadiums and embraced supporter sections along with their style of active engagement with the team. This attempt to create a more authentic league culture, did not, however, greatly improve the league’s level of play nor did it temper any of the commercialism that had dominated the first decade.\n\n“This wasn’t the soccer I wanted to see,” wrote Michael Agovino, describing David Beckham’s first game at Giants Stadium in 2007, in his memoir The Soccer Diaries, which chronicles his relationship as an American and a New Yorker with the game for 30 years starting in the mid-1980s. “It may have been exciting for non-soccer fans, for the moms and dads, but for knowledgeable fans, and there were a lot of us, we didn’t need such superficiality.”\n\nESC persevered through the small crowds, an abysmal team and factions within their own group. In 2006, a group known as The Garden State Supporters (GSS) broke off from ESC and attempted to establish another section with more virulent songs. After two years of acrimony the ESC and GSS reconciled, just in time to see the team performance and attendance crater in 2009 with 12,491 fans per game watching their last place team finish with the worst record in franchise history. Next to section 101, a group of Philadelphians known as the Sons of Ben, who had been instrumental in convincing MLS to expand to their city in 2010, made trip after trip to Giants Stadium to sing, “We have as many cups as you, and we don’t have a team.” ESC had few allies, least of all the people who ran the team they supported.\n\n“When I was active with the ESC, I believe that the Metro (front office) were barely interested in the supporters club and paid very little attention to us,” said McAllister. “They were peripherally responsive to us, but I do not think that they realized how important supporter culture would become in MLS.”\n\nA Huge Competitive Advantage: MLS Markets Supporter Culture\n\nIn 2010, two years later than planned, the Red Bulls finally joined the ranks of MLS teams with a soccer specific stadium, Red Bull Arena. The new stadium included a large designated section for the supporters groups. ESC and the renamed Garden State Ultras were joined by the Viking Army behind the goal at the South end of the Stadium. The franchise called it The South Ward. Flags, songs, and standing were permitted and encouraged, but also carefully controlled.\n\n“At Red Bull Arena whenever there has been an issue the [front office] has brought it to the supporters groups to try to work it out,” said Mike Vallo, a member of ESC. “At Giants Stadium the yellow shirts [security] would just bum rush the section belligerently and make situations far worse than they were. For example, at RBA they set up an area in front of the section to light smoke bombs when the team scores, that way there is smoke but it’s not in the section itself.”\n\nAfter a decade of marginalizing organized supporters with a combination of ambivalence, hostility and minor accommodation, MLS began to recognize the value of their most ardent fans. Organized supporters took significant roles in the formation of new franchises in Toronto (2006) Seattle (2009), Philadelphia (2010), Portland (2011), Vancouver (2011) and Montreal (2012). In each case, supporters groups lobbied the league and local officials, assisted in forming the team’s name, badges, and colours, and sought out stadiums sites. As a result when the teams took the field for the first time, there was already a passionate fanbase behind them. Seattle set MLS records for attendance in each year of its existence and their fans obtained a unique mechanism, where they got to take a vote of confidence on the general manager each year.\n\nFor organized supporters of older MLS teams, such as the MetroStars, the relationship with the front office and the league was often more fraught. Part of the supporter clubs identity, culture and indeed power had come from their opposition to the league’s efforts to brand soccer games as professional class family events. The supporters groups had attempted to create an atmosphere that was novel in American sports, where the focus was on the game instead of the broader consumer experience. New stadiums provided a way to make peace, but at the cost of the supporters losing some of the culture and independence they had enjoyed when the league was less interested in making them part of the its financial strategy. Criticism of front offices and the league were carefully policed in the new supporter sections.\n\n“The arena atmosphere became a central theme of the marketing and the supporters groups were obviously a big part of that,” said Vallo. “On the whole it hasn't been a bad thing, we love bringing the atmosphere and if that can help get people interested in soccer, that's great. At the same time, the few times the team has tried to police our chants while at the same time using us for marketing has been a bit galling. That seems to be a league wide issue. MLS really wants the supporters groups loud and large, but they also want them to stay within these family friendly parameters that they set. There's a contradiction there. The organic nature of soccer supporters is what draws people to them, once you start using it as a marketing tool or try to make it an official fan club it loses its allure. I'm not saying we want to be hooligans or something, but part of the culture includes mocking and trying to intimidate the opposing team. Every chant isn't going be family friendly.”\n\nThe Red Bulls new stadium in Harrison provided some relief to the problems fans had faced at Giants Stadium. In addition to obtaining the larger supporters section, ESC and the other members of the South Ward adopted local bars in Harrison and nearby Newark as their home bases. They inserted themselves into the fabric of the industrial community that surrounds the stadium, as fans could now settle into the bar before the game and then walk over together just before kick-off. The stadium was also a 10 minute walk from a train station with direct access to Manhattan. The ride from the city was 30 minutes, although on weekends it often ran less frequently and could require a transfer. Inside the stadium, capacity was limited to 25,000 and a roof kept noise of the fans directed at the field. For the league, the atmosphere created by the fans became something they could leverage for new investment.\n\nThe team also stepped up efforts to engage with supporters. In 2014, for the first time, the team paid tribute to the MetroStars with a banner in the old team’s red and black colours and the phrase “As Long As We’re Still Breathing” from one of ESC’s songs. In the build up to the 2015 season, the team made the term “We Are Metro Soccer” part of their ad campaign. Commenting on the tribute, Marc de Grandpre, Red Bull GmbH’s local Head of Operations said, “Look at the South Ward, those folks have been around cheering us since '96, '97. It's a passion we have to get make sure we leverage. We need to communicate to them and ultimately engage with them. I know our team does great, meets with them regularly. We're going to integrate their experience in the stadium into our communication because I think that's a huge competitive advantage for us.”\n\nSeason attendance raised significantly in the first year of Red Bull Arena, to 18,000 a game even though the first sell-out for an MLS game did not occur until August. Despite all these improvements, the arrival of French striker and World Cup hero Thierry Henry, and the team’s first major trophy, the Supporters’ Shield in 2013, per game attendance did not pass 20,000 in any of the first five years after the stadium opened. The MetroStars’ 23,000 per game in the 1996, the first year of the franchise, remains the benchmark. Even with an state-of-the-art facility, improved access to the city, a better team and a growing interest in the game itself, a significant portion of soccer fans in the New York area still found something lacking with the Red Bulls.\n\nChris is @Intlby_Handsome and at www.hendersonc.com .

The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth. While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Eric S.

  "latent_4679": "Hockey-tough Cory Sarich is living proof that you can get run over by the wheel of a three-quarter ton truck and walk away. But the former Avalanche defenseman, will never bike again. He has kept his splintered cycling helmet for teaching purposes, but ordered officials to get rid of the the rest of his biking gear that was shredded like his skin.\n\nSarich, 36, is lucky to be alive after he collided with a Ford F-350 truck driven by an elderly man on July 22 near his lake house outside Invermere, British Columbia. He sustained five broken vertebra, massive road rash and a deep head wound after crashing into the truck driven by an 85-year-old man who turned left in front of Sarich. The right rear wheel of the truck ran over Sarich’s torso, with his stomach against the pavement, and one of his wrists was burned by the vehicle’s tailpipe. Shockingly, Sarich stood up after the accident before being rushed to Invermere Hospital, then airlifted to a hospital in Calgary. Two weeks ago he was treated for a staph infection in his elbow, but he is otherwise doing well, considering all he’s gone through.\n\n“Had I been on my back and the truck goes over my front with ribs and vital organs, maybe a different story,” Sarich said. “Your lumbar spine, and thoracic spine, is so strong. And the fact that it was his rear tire, they said — like if it’s the front side with an engine — could be a completely different story. Someone was looking out for me and I’m very thankful.”\n\nSarich, an unrestricted free agent who was told by the Avalanche in July before the accident that it was not interested in re-signing him, was biking as part of his training regime. He was confident he would be signed by another team in August. He was riding the Windermere Loop Road, a popular 40-minute training area. He saw the truck coming.\n\n“We’re going opposite directions and, no signal, he turns left,” Sarich said. “I’ve only got 15-20 meters (50-60 feet) and he’s right there in front of me, and taking up the whole road and going super slow and I’m breaking as hard as I can. Someone said I left about a 15-20 foot skid mark — I haven’t been back there to see — and I was going to impact the side of his truck, and I ended up going off to the side and over my handlebars, landing on the left side of my body.”\n\nBLOG: More quotes from Cory Sarich on his accident\n\nSarich hit the ground between the truck’s front and rear right-side tires, and was run over by the rear tire.\n\n“I came out from underneath it, stood up — when I was hitting the truck I was like, ‘I’m going to die right now’ so I was impressed that I was still alive,” he said. “I knew I had been crushed pretty good, and I was bleeding everywhere. All the ends of my fingers were ground off, I had road rash everywhere and bleeding profusely from my head. I wasn’t sure about the internal injuries I sustained.”\n\nSarich said a man and a woman in a Jeep who were following the truck came upon the accident and called 911. The man gave Sarich his undershirt to put over his bleeding head. Sarich then realized he had his cell phone in his pocket and tried calling his wife, to no avail. Sarich feared he had suffered major internal injuries.\n\n“I was really having trouble breathing, feeling woozy and feeling like I was going to go down. That was the most pain I have ever experienced.”\n\nHe said the elderly driver got out of the truck and did not appear to know he had run over him.\n\n“I have so much to be thankful for, it’s crazy. It’s amazing how an accident like this puts things in perspective,” Sarich said. “There have been tough moments too. I’ve gone through the whole range of emotions. But you come out of it on the other side of it, and you got three beautiful kids, beautiful wife. I’m fortunate to have a lake house, a beautiful home in Calgary and we live nearby family. There are so many things I have to be thankful for.”\n\nAbout the driver, Sarich said: “Part of me gets really, really mad because I might not play hockey again because of it. But I don’t have any hard feelings towards the guy. It was a mistake, and we all make them. I do hope that he gets checked out and makes sure he should have his driver’s license.”\n\nSarich said he has not undergone surgery for any of his injuries, but he realizes a knee and an elbow “need to be fixed.” His back injuries could come to that too, but the most obvious evidence of the accident — “a divot taken out the side of my head” — has not been diagnosed as brain trauma. “I have a bald spot about the size of a tennis ball on the side of my head,” Sarich said. “The scab is slowly getting smaller.”\n\nHe added: “I was obviously squished pretty good. Sleeping has been tough. I’m comfortable when I go to bed, but it doesn’t last, and I have to get up and sit up or walk around for a half-hour.”\n\nSarich, who helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Stanley Cup in 2004, had back surgery when he was with the Avs, playing in only 54 games. He missed the playoffs because of back problems, but was feeling 100 percent at the time of the accident.\n\n“I was whipping myself into shape when this happened,” Sarich said. “I don’t know how it’s going to work out (with hockey). Your priorities get put in a different order when something like this happens. I’m not going to completely close the door on hockey.”\n\nSarich is back at his lake house with his family, wife Reagan, daughters Jada, 9, and Emmy, 6, and son Charlie, 5. An avid boatsman, Sarich said he has resumed surfing behind his boat, albeit gently, but is mostly just driving the vessel. His children are set to begin school next week in Calgary, where he played for six seasons for the Flames ending in 2013. He was traded to Colorado, along with Alex Tanguay, for forward David Jones and defenseman Shane O’Brien last summer.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nSarich’s injuries\n\nInjuries suffered by former Avalanche defenseman Cory Sarich, who was run over by a pickup truck while cycling last month:\n\n• Five fractured vertebrae\n\n• Deep, tennis ball-size “divot” out of his head\n\n• Massive road rash, particularly the knees\n\n• Most fingers chiseled off at the ends\n\n• Shoulder and wrist burns and scrapes from truck tailpipe and road\n\n— Mike Chambers, The Denver Post",

  "latent_4801": "On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers presented the Trump administration’s proposal to undo a major Obama-era environmental regulation, the Clean Water Rule.\n\nThe rule defined the “Waters of the United States,” a.k.a. WOTUS. These are the rivers, streams, and lakes that fall under federal jurisdiction and forms the foundation of a massive piece of environmental regulation, the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe Obama rule, first published in 2015, was meant to clarify which streams and wetlands fall under federal clean water protections — a question that had been causing legal frustration for years.\n\nBut it triggered fierce blowback from farm and industry groups across the country. “Opponents condemn it as a massive power grab by Washington,” Politico reported, “saying it will give bureaucrats carte blanche to swoop in and penalize landowners every time a cow walks through a ditch.” Some of those criticisms were overblown (it doesn’t cover puddles, for instance), but the rule was widely cited by conservatives as a perfect example of EPA overreach under President Obama.\n\nLast year, President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA to begin the long process of repealing the Clean Water Rule and replacing it with ... something else.\n\nEarlier this year, the EPA suspended the Obama rule. And on Tuesday, the agency revealed its replacement, one it said will smooth over the problems that made the 2015 regulation so contentious.\n\n“For the first time, we are clearly defining the difference between federally protected waterways and state protected waterways,” said EPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler in a press release. “Our simpler and clearer definition would help landowners understand whether a project on their property will require a federal permit or not, without spending thousands of dollars on engineering and legal professionals.”\n\n.@EPAAWheeler and Army Asst Secretary for Civil Works RD James sign the proposed new definition of #WOTUS surrounded by @SecretaryZinke and Congressional leaders pic.twitter.com/W2P8V4w1RD — Molly Block (@mollyerinb) December 11, 2018\n\nHowever, environmental groups said the new definition would cut the number of waterways the federal government must regulate, leaving them vulnerable to pollution. It excludes, for example, waterways that flow only for parts of the year, like after rainstorms while snow melts.\n\n“This sickening gift to polluters will result in more dangerous toxic pollution dumped into waterways across a vast stretch of America,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “The Trump administration’s radical proposal would destroy millions of acres of wetlands, pushing imperiled species like steelhead trout closer to extinction.”\n\nEPA officials said they didn’t know just how many waterways would be excluded from federal jurisdiction under the new proposal. However, a document obtained by E&E News showed that the EPA and the Army Corps had estimated last year that 18 percent of streams and 51 percent of wetlands would not receive federal protections under the revisions.\n\nTuesday’s announcement is only the beginning of a long regulatory and legal process. The EPA is taking comments on the proposal for 60 days and will host a listening session in Kansas City, Kansas, in January. In the meantime, it’s worth understanding how WOTUS became so controversial and what it means for huge swaths of the country. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat the Waters of the US rule actually does\n\nTo understand this rule, we need to go back to 1972, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act. That law features dozens of regulations and permitting requirements for anyone discharging pollution into the “waters of the United States” in a way that could affect human health or aquatic life. These rules apply to factories, power plants, golf courses, new housing developments — and much, much more.\n\nFor example, under the law, a facility storing oil that could leak needs to prepare a spill prevention plan aimed at minimizing discharges. If the facility is far away from any “waters of the United States,” however, it doesn’t face these requirements.\n\nBut here’s the tricky part. The Clean Water Act doesn’t precisely define what “waters of the United States” means. That’s left to the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. And it’s a hard question. For instance, the law is clear that major navigable rivers and lakes and any connected waterways should be protected. That includes major rivers like the Mississippi River, the Colorado River, and the Ohio River. But what about waterways that are only loosely connected? What about the 60 percent of streams that are dry for part of the year but then connect when it rains? Any pollution dumped into those waters could affect key ecosystems. Should they be regulated?\n\nIn the 2000s, this uncertainty led to a pair of Supreme Court decisions that only ended up creating more bewilderment. In a split decision in Rapanos v. United States in 2006, Justice Anthony Kennedy argued that Clean Water Act protections applied to wetlands that “significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters.” But Justice Antonin Scalia argued that protections only applied to wetlands “with a continuous surface connection” to navigable water — a far smaller number of wetlands. And it wasn’t totally clear which opinion took precedence.\n\n\"The short answer is that the state of post-Rapanos wetlands jurisdiction is a mess,\" Richard Frank of the University of California Davis told Greenwire in 2011. In the ensuing years, whenever a dispute arose over whether a landowner — be it a housing developer, a golf course, a farm, or what have you — needed a Clean Water Act permit or not, courts had to resolve it on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSo under Obama, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers tried to bring clarity to the matter. They sifted through more than 1,200 scientific papers to figure out which types of bodies of water were important to aquatic ecosystems and therefore deserved protection, per Kennedy’s opinion.\n\nThe final Waters of the US rule, published in June 2015, outlined which bodies of water were automatically covered by the Clean Water Act — requiring permits for discharges or dredging or dirt fill — and which ones still needed to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. For instance:\n\nIn the past, tributaries of navigable rivers were evaluated on a case-by-case basis. But under the new rule, they’re automatically protected if they have a bed, a bank, and a high-water mark. This includes many streams that are dry for part of the year. Waterways without these features are still dealt with case by case.\n\nWetlands and ponds are now automatically covered if they’re within 100 feet or within the 100-year floodplain of a protected waterway. Otherwise, it’s case by case.\n\nCertain “isolated” waters that are not connected to navigable waters now get automatic protection if they have a “significant nexus” to protected waters — like the vernal pools of California.\n\nThe rule also explicitly exempted a number of bodies of water often found on farms, such as puddles, ditches, artificial ponds for livestock watering, and irrigation systems that would revert to dry land if irrigation were to stop. Here’s a graphic:\n\nFor its part, the EPA argued that this rule didn’t significantly expand the waters under its jurisdiction. Rather, it created more certainty for about 3 percent of the nation’s waterways — to avoid bringing cases to court every time there was a legal gray area. According to the EPA, the rule offered clearer protection to upstream bodies of water that contribute to drinking supplies for one-third of the population.\n\nBefore the rule came out, few who worked on it expected widespread blowback. “This rule will provide the clarity and certainty businesses and industry need about which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act,” Obama said when the final rule was announced. But things turned out very differently.\n\nWhy the Waters of the US rule became so controversial\n\nOpponents of the rule — particularly farming and ranching groups — clearly didn’t buy the EPA’s line that this was only a technical update. Nor were they comforted by the EPA’s exemptions for agriculture. Instead, they called it a power grab.\n\n“The agency is making it impossible for farmers and ranchers to look at their land and know what can be regulated,” argues the American Farm Bureau Federation on its site. “EPA has vastly expanded its authority beyond the limits approved by Congress and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.”\n\nSome Western farmers, for instance, fretted about the open, unlined canals they use to irrigate their lands during the growing season. These systems divert water from streams, serve as water sources for wildlife, and can connect to larger bodies of water elsewhere. As Reagan Waskom and David Cooper of Colorado State University explain, farmers and ranchers feared that these canals would fall under the rule’s definition of “tributary” and might have to be replaced by costly pressurized pipes. Or, alternatively, that fertilizer use near these waterways would be more strictly regulated.\n\nDefenders of the rule dismissed these scenarios. Jon Devine, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, pointed out that the Clean Water Act has always regulated agriculture lightly. “This rule doesn’t really change those exemptions,” he says. Indeed, one recent study found that the EPA’s jurisdiction over farms actually shrank under the new rule.\n\nThe EPA was also pretty explicit that it wouldn’t target farmers. “We will protect clean water without getting in the way of farming and ranching,” then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the National Farmers Union in 2015. But few farmers or ranchers believed her. Their argument was that the rule was vague enough that the EPA could crack down on them if it chose. It’s basically a question of trust. And at the moment, conservatives are not particularly inclined to trust the EPA.\n\nJoni Ernst, a Republican senator from Iowa, made that clear in former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s confirmation hearing in 2017. “My constituents tell me the EPA is out to get them rather than work with them and there is a huge lack of trust between many of my constituents and the EPA,” she said. “If we take a look specifically at the WOTUS rule, Iowans truly feel that the EPA ignored their comments and concerns, threw them under the rug and then just moved forward.”\n\nHowever the backlash started, it took on a life of its own. Trump began citing the water rule on the campaign trail as an example of EPA overreach, earning cheers from rural audiences. In signing his executive order in March, he called it a “destructive and horrible rule.”\n\nWhy it will be difficult — but not impossible — for the EPA to undo the Obama-era WOTUS rule completely\n\nPruitt delayed the Obama WOTUS rule’s implementation for two years, buying the EPA time to come up with an alternative.\n\nBut implementing a new definition for WOTUS requires proposing a new rule that’s supported by extensive scientific and legal arguments, opening up the proposal for public comments, responding to those comments, and then defending the final rule in court as a superior approach. This could take years.\n\nAnd much of the ambiguity around which waterways deserve Clean Water Act protection still holds even if you repeal the Obama rule. Which wetlands are covered? How do you deal with streams that flow part of the year? How do you interpret that mess of a Supreme Court decision in 2006?\n\nIn his executive order, Trump asked the EPA to consider Scalia’s opinion in Rapanos, which extended protection to wetlands only if they had a “continuous surface connection\" to navigable waterways and extended protection to streams only if they were “relatively permanent.” So it’s not surprising that acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s replacement rule would cover far fewer waterways — leaving out, for instance, many of the 60 percent of streams that don’t flow year-round.\n\nEnvironmental groups say that’s a problem. Devine argues that polluters could take advantage of a weaker rule with less certain protection for streams and waterways. As long as there’s ambiguity about where the Clean Water Act applies, it would be harder for citizen groups or the Department of Justice to bring a case against companies dumping chemicals or other pollutants into smaller bodies of water upstream.\n\n“Without this rule, enforcement has been unpredictable,” Devine says. “The EPA has mainly been focused on big rivers and lakes so that they wouldn’t have to litigate to the ends of the earth about whether the Clean Water Act applied to waters upstream. But if you can only regulate the biggest rivers and lakes — and the pollution problem is much farther upstream — then you’re not effectively protecting the receiving water or the watershed.”\n\nStill, it’s not clear that the EPA can scale back the water rule significantly. Federal courts have typically embraced Kennedy’s more expansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act rather than Scalia’s, and any rollback of Obama’s rule would still leave plenty of legal gray areas where the courts will need to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the Clean Water Act applies. “It’s going to be incredibly complex to figure this out,” says Richard Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University.\n\nFurther reading:",
  "latent_4931": "When Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act last month, the rationale for yet another monolithic regulatory bill was that the economic and housing bubble crisis was caused by too little regulation.\n\nIn fact, the evidence is becoming increasingly clear that over-regulation and Washington interference were the major culprits.\n\nAll bubbles burst, so the key question is not “Why did housing collapse beginning in 2007?”, but “Why did the bubble appear in the first place?”\n\nThe answer has many facets, but a common element is government support for home ownership.\n\nHistory of interference\n\nAs far back as 1913, Uncle Sam carved out a tax deduction for interest that has since become the politically sacrosanct but economically unsound tax break for home loans. Essentially, this is welfare for the wealthy, since it primarily benefits rich homeowners. Even worse, a comparison with other countries that don’t provide such a deduction shows that this tax break doesn’t necessarily help home ownership.\n\nGovernment increased its role in housing during the Great Depression with the creation of Fannie Mae, which was designed to create a liquid secondary mortgage market, thus freeing lenders to make more loans. Washington expanded this effort in the 1970s by creating Freddie Mac.\n\nPrior to the federal government getting into the business of financing houses, banks didn’t need a lot of regulations to keep them from lending to borrowers with poor credit history. Without the moral hazard of knowing that they could unload questionable mortgage loans on to taxpayer-supported entities, banks required at least a 20 percent down payment and a satisfactory credit history.\n\nBut over time, as the government passed regulations such as the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to encourage lending to marginal borrowers, banks were pressured into unloading their loans on the government, thereby letting the taxpayers assume the risk of nonpayment. As a result, banks didn’t have to worry about nonpayment, only about how many fees they could generate by originating the loans.\n\nThis trend accelerated during the Clinton years when Congress made the first $500,000 of capital gains on the sale of a home tax free, making real estate a very lucrative investment. And the Clinton administration pushed excessively high quotas on Fannie and Freddie to buy mortgages made to low-income borrowers.\n\nIn 2004, President Bush helped put the icing on the cake when he pushed for a new “Zero Down Payment” program for federally insured home loans. Soon thereafter, a whole new bracket of income-earners could afford homes.\n\nGiven the distorting nature of these incentives, what is remarkable is not that the mortgage market collapsed, but that the collapse was not even more severe. Nor was the purported rationale of these heavy-handed regulations – that it would encourage home ownership – ever vindicated.\n\nMany other developed countries have achieved far higher rates of home ownership without encouraging banks to make bad loans, allowing banks to unload loans on taxpayers, or rewarding their richest citizens with tax benefits and subsidies of up to a million dollars for buying the most extravagant homes.\n\nStack of disclosures\n\nEven before the Dodd-Frank law, all homeowners were familiar with the stack (often several inches high) of documents and “disclosures” that they reviewed and signed before completing a home purchase. While this paperwork no doubt satisfies government regulators, few if any homeowners were equipped to read them, much less understand them.\n\nIn fact, a single-sentence regulation would have been more effective in curbing both predatory lending and foolish borrowing – namely, a requirement that would-be homeowners must make a minimum 20 percent down payment. And marginal borrowers who couldn’t afford conventional loans and down payments should have been made to sign a one-page statement in bold, 16-point type before agreeing to an exotic loan:\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT MY MONTHLY PAYMENT COULD DOUBLE IN SIX MONTHS, AND THAT MY INTEREST RATE MAY TRIPLE BY NEXT YEAR. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, STATISTICALLY, GIVEN MY UNSATISFACTORY CREDIT HISTORY AND MINIMAL DOWN PAYMENT, MY CHANCES OF LOSING MY HOME TO FORECLOSURE WITHIN THREE YEARS EXCEEDS 90 PERCENT.\n\nSuch a warning would actually serve the public, but in the real world, the stacks of government rules may be harming more than helping.\n\nCost of regulations\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in 2009 federal regulatory agencies generated 3,503 “final rules,” each consisting of hundreds, often thousands, of pages of barely-intelligible rules.\n\nThe study further found that “annual regulatory compliance costs hit $1.18 trillion in 2009.” And more were the in the pipeline, with 59 different federal departments, agencies, and commissions in the process of promulgating more than 4,000 regulations, 184 of which are “economically significant rules, packing at least $100 million in economic impact.”\n\nThese byzantine rules have become so complicated that even the regulators can’t understand them, let alone enforce them. And lack of enforcement makes the public more susceptible to whiz kids at high-flying investment banks who create exotic investments such as credit default swaps, inverse floaters, and synthetic collateralized debt obligations. All of these exotic instruments have one feature in common: they create extreme leverage.\n\nYet the thousands of pages of additional regulations in the Dodd-Frank law don’t effectively address this underlying problem.\n\nAgain, a simple, one-page banking regulation would be far more effective:\n\nEVERY BANK OR INVESTMENT HOUSE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A RESERVE OF 20 PERCENT FOR EVERY DOLLAR LOANED OR INVESTED, AND NO INVESTMENT SHALL BE OFFERED WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT AN INVESTOR MAINTAIN A 50 PERCENT EQUITY.\n\nInstead of addressing extreme leverage simply and aggressively, the Dodd-Frank law will soon unload countless new rules on hapless regulators, banks, and consumers.\n\nUncle Sam is right to take action to prevent another housing bubble. To do that, it’s going to have to pop its own inflated sphere: the regulatory bubble.\n\nRobert M. Hardaway is professor of law at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law and the author of the forthcoming book, “The Great American Housing Bubble: The Road to Collapse.\"",
  "latent_4940": "Haruki Murakami has lost his magic.\n\nAfter two consecutive novels written in the third person (2009’s “1Q84” and 2013’s “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage”), Murakami has returned to first-person narration with his latest novel, “Kishidancho Goroshi” (“Killing Commendatore”), published in Japan and so far only in Japanese, on Feb. 24. In it, he is unable to capture the same energy of the wry, poignant protagonists that drove his books in the 1980s and ’90s.\n\nKilling Commendatore, by Haruki Murakami.\n\n1048 pages\n\nSHINCHOSHA PUBLISHING, Fiction.\n\nThe novel relates the story of an unnamed 36-year-old portrait artist living in Tokyo. When his wife, Yuzu, suddenly wants a divorce and admits she’s been seeing someone else, he clears his schedule and goes on a month-long road trip to Hokkaido and Tohoku before settling in a house on the top of a mountain in rural Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, where he plans to paint for himself for the first time in years rather than taking portrait work.\n\nThis novel, then, is a sort of bildungsroman, as the character attempts to rediscover his inspiration for painting and create his own unique artistic style.\n\nMurakami’s obsession with isolating his characters continues: The narrator spends much of his time in the house staring at canvases, cooking, reading books and listening to the extensive collection of classical music records that belongs to the house’s owner, a famous artist named Tomohiko Amada, who is the father of the narrator’s friend from college, Masahiko. “You should be careful,” Masahiko tells the narrator. “Don’t get possessed by my dad’s spirit. He’s a guy with a strong spirit.”\n\nThe world tilts in typically Murakami fashion when the narrator discovers one of Amada’s paintings titled “Killing Commendatore” squirreled away in the house’s attic. Amada is well known as a traditional Japanese artist, but the painting depicts a violent killing in what seems to be Japan’s Asuka Era (552-645). The narrator interprets the title as a reframing of a scene from Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” in Japan.\n\nHow the painting causes the world to change is unclear to the narrator, but he soon finds himself being commissioned for a portrait by Wataru Menshiki, a mysterious, wealthy IT baron with a lion-like mane of white hair who lives in a modern villa across the valley from the Amada residence. The narrator is then assaulted aurally by a ringing bell, which seems to be coming from underneath a pyramid of stones behind a makeshift shrine on the property.\n\nThe shrine brings Menshiki and the narrator closer together, as the artist involves the semi-retired entrepreneur in excavating the stones to reveal a 10-foot deep, well-like cavern. If you’ve read any Murakami, you know that he’s long been fascinated with wells, and this book is no different. Over the course of the novel, the narrator makes no less than a dozen trips back and forth from the house to the hole, sometimes just to confirm that things haven’t changed. Needless to say, this is gripping literature.\n\nThere are two other characters worth mentioning: The titular Commendatore is a 2-foot-tall figure wearing traditional Japanese garb who seems to have popped out of Amada’s painting. He provides various assistance here and there throughout the book, but the rules that govern his mysterious existence seem to bend as needed for the plot. Murakami fails again to build a credible in-world mythology for his magic realism.\n\nThere is also Marie Akigawa, a 13-year-old girl who becomes the subject of one of the narrator’s portraits in the second half of the novel. Like Fukaeri in “1Q84,” she’s a bit mysterious and seems to be wiser than her age at times. Yet she’s also obsessed with her flat chest and whether she’ll ever have breasts.\n\nExpanding the above plot summary would spoil one of the book’s meager pleasures, which is figuring out how the characters are connected. Among the questions that abound: Why has Menshiki set himself up alone in a fancy villa on the top of this mountain? And why is he rumored to have been in jail and to have forced out its previous tenants?\n\nThere is, of course, an “adventure” of sorts, as Murakami is wont to write. Someone disappears and the narrator goes off to help. But the stakes are never clearly presented, nor is it clear that the narrator actually does anything tangible to help.\n\nMurakami also tries to recapture the magic of “The Wind-up Bird Chronicle” by including lengthy portions of history connected to Amada’s time studying abroad in Europe in the days before the start of World War II. Sections on Anschluss, Kristallnacht and the Rape of Nanking are awkwardly dropped in at various points, often via large blocks of dialogue from Menshiki and Masahiko. “Wind-up Bird” succeeded because it dramatized wartime events, making them incredibly immediate. “Killing Commendatore,” on the other hand, can feel like a Wikipedia entry at times.\n\nThis book fails most in its narrative point of view. Murakami tells story in retrospect: We know from the opening pages that the protagonist is in Odawara for nine months, that he reconciles with his wife in the end and that he’s telling the story from a point in the future.\n\nThis is at odds with Murakami’s tendency to narrate almost with the artist’s stream of conscious. He starts strong with a striking prologue about a faceless man come to have his portrait painted, building suspense in the first few chapters — only to fill out the rest of the 1,048 pages with needless details and extraneous thoughts.\n\nClassics such as “The Great Gatsby,” “To Kill A Mockingbird,” and Murakami’s own “Norwegian Wood” work so well because the narrators judiciously select which events from their past to share with readers. In “Killing Commendatore,” we get everything.\n\nUltimately, the narrator doesn’t seem to have learned much from these nine strange months. He continues largely as he did before, painting portraits in an almost mechanical manner without much significance. “That’s the life I wanted,” the narrator says. “And that’s also what people wanted of me.”\n\nIronically, this could be read as a stand-in for Murakami’s writing itself. I, for one, wanted more, and I imagine other readers will as well.\n\n“Killing Commendatore” is currently being translated, but details of its English-language release are not yet available.",
  "latent_5161": "On the first half of today’s installment of The Diane Rehm Show, Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute got off a good line in the midst of a discussion concerning federal regulation of emission standards.\n\nConcerning the performance of the American car manufacturers in comparison to that of foreign automakers, and the moral hazard involved in the various bailouts, Taylor said, “Capitalism without the threat of bankruptcy is like Christianity without the threat of hell. It doesn’t work very well.”\n\nOther guests included Mary Nichols (Chairman of the California Air Resources Board), Phyllis Cuttino (director the Pew Environment Group’s U.S. Global Warming Campaign), and David Shepardson (Washington Bureau Chief for The Detroit News). The discussion focused in large part on the attempts by California to regulate emissions within its own borders more strictly than allowed by the federal EPA.\n\nArguments that California is “too large” of a state and has too big of an economy to enjoy certain rights doesn’t strike me as very convincing. That’s simply a consequentialist argument: that the nationwide effects of allowing California to do this will be bad, and therefore we shouldn’t recognize the state’s right to handle its own regulation. If it really is an issue of federalism and state’s rights, the issue shouldn’t in the first place be whether or not recognition of a right will presumably have a negative economic impact. There are a lot of assumptions wrapped up in that argument.\n\nNo state is an economic island unto itself. The mere fact that the national economy is largely integrated doesn’t by itself mean that states do not have the right to make decisions about how to regulate things within their own borders. Just what is the line between acceptable and unacceptable national economic impact? Adverse feelings to this particular action on the part of California isn’t sufficient to draw lines too hastily. How might this apply to other industries and commodities?\n\nIndeed, we can discuss whether CO2 emissions ought to be regulated at the federal level under the commerce clause, but I don’t think the size of a state should determine what rights it does or does not have. Maybe the consequentialist line of reasoning is inherently wrapped up in the commerce clause (I’m certainly no constitutional expert). But the clause has been stretched so much (e.g. it applies to a farmer consuming what he grows on his own farm) that a little pullback seems warranted, and without the creation of a(n) (inter)national carbon market (a remarkably bad idea) the clause doesn’t seem to me to be directly relevant to emissions.",

Rogers has won prestigious awards such as a MacArthur Fellowship and the Lemelson-MIT Prize.\n\nHe was about to leave for the West Coast for a job he declines to name when Northwestern made an offer that persuaded him to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe 48-year-old leads a group of about 40 researchers at U of I. Like Northwestern researchers Chad Mirkin and Tobin Marks, Rogers is one of several high-profile scientists who have large teams within universities and who are prolific winners of grants and creators of companies.\n\nRogers, a physicist and chemist by training, has been one of U of I's stars, helping build on the university's reputation for materials research and semiconductors. His work is at the intersection of engineering and medicine, which is one of the hottest areas of research and recently led U of I to create a new medical school on the Urbana campus.\n\nRogers said he was preparing to leave Illinois when he was approached by Northwestern donors Lou Simpson and Kimberly Querrey, who are funding a biomedical research facility being built in Streeterville.\n\nThey came up with $25 million to support the Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics as part of the Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology.

Some times you have some plays that don’t go your way.”\n\nRyan also was picked off by crafty Detroit free safety Glover Quin and tossed an ill-advised deep ball to Taylor Gabriel that was picked off by Buffalo safety Micah Hyde.\n\n“It’s about being resilient,” Ryan said. “It’s about being mentally tough and continuing to stay aggressive. Doing the things that we’ve done to be at our best.”\n\nRyan doesn’t plan to change his approach.\n\n“I think it will start to go our way,” Ryan said. “We just have to keep working at it.”\n\nRyan ranks in the top half of the top 32 quarterbacks in the NFL with a minimum of 75 passing attempts, according to the analytics website Football Outsiders.\n\nFootball Outsiders evaluates quarterbacks according to a defense-adjusted yards-above-replacement (DYAR) measure, and Ryan has a 211 rating, which ranks 13th in the league. They also rank the quarterbacks, according to the defense-adjusted value over average (DVOA), and Ryan has an 11.2 percentage rating, which also ranks 13th.\n\nRyan has completed 88 of 135 passes (65.2 percent) for 1,109 yards, five touchdowns and five interceptions. He has a quarterback rating of 87.6, which ranks 16th among quarterbacks with 75 completions are more.\n\nRyan has been sacked eight times for minus-59 yards.\n\nThrough four games, he’s 3-of-15 on passes that traveled 20 or more yards downfield, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n“I wasn’t real good at math growing up, but it’s definitely an area that we can do better for sure,” Ryan said. “When we get our opportunities down the field we’ve been close, we just haven’t hit them. We have to keep taking our shots when they are there.”\n\nOne theory on the deep passes is that the Falcons didn’t get them timed well because wide receiver Julio Jones and Gabriel missed most of the offseason with injuries. Now, Ryan believes more time together in practice will certainly help.\n\n“When you have explosive guys on the outside, teams that you’re playing against know that they are explosive as well,” Ryan said. “The way I look at it is, when we get the opportunity to throw the ball down the field, we have got to make the plays. …The ones that we have had, we’ve haven’t hit as many as we need to. That’s something that we can work on in practice and get better at.”\n\nThe Falcons have scored touchdowns on 57.14 percent of their trips inside the opponent’s 20-yard line, which ranks 11th in the league. Green Bay is tops at 78.95 percent.\n\n“One of the things that you can certainly control is procedural penalties down in that area,” Ryan said. “That’s all about focus and concentration. We can certainly improve in that area. If we just do that, I think we can be better. Not putting ourselves behind the chains.”\n\nRyan also believes the team’s execution could be better in red zone.\n\nThe Falcons are converting on 43.18 percent of their third downs, which ranks eighth in the league.\n\n“I think we can be better on third downs, myself included,” Ryan said. “I think when we have opportunities to keep drives going, specifically in that third-and-6 to 10 range, we can be better than we’ve been. I can be better than I’ve been up until this point.\n\n“That’s probably the No. 1 thing of all the things that we looked at that can help us win games right away.”",

Citing the Muslim Brotherhood, Jackson further pointed to a “strain of anti-Semitism” that has influenced the president.\n\n“Obama clearly has Muslim sensibilities. He sees the world and Israel from a Muslim perspective,” Jackson wrote. The post — which is archived here and here — went on to say:\n\nHis construct of “The Muslim World” is unique in modern diplomacy. It is said that only The Muslim Brotherhood and other radical elements of the religion use that concept. It is a call to unify Muslims around the world. It is rather odd to hear an American President use it. In doing so he reveals more about his thinking than he intends. The dramatic policy reversal of joining the unrelentingly ant-Semitic, anti-Israel and pro-Islamic UN Human Rights Council is in keeping with the President’s truest – albeit undeclared – sensibilities Those who are paying attention and thinking about these issues do not find it unreasonable to consider that President Obama is influenced by a strain of anti-Semitism picked up from the black community, his leftist friends and colleagues, his Muslim associations and his long period of mentorship under Jeremiah Wright. If this conclusion is accurate, Israel has some dark days ahead. For the first time in her history, she may find the President of the United States siding with her enemies.

Tax collectors say they focused on groups with words like \"tea party\" and \"patriot\" in applications for tax-exempt status, and the government watchdogs probed further to make sure they appropriately qualified.\n\nSometimes the IRS asked groups to provide a list of donors, Lois Lerner, who leads the IRS division managing tax-exempt groups, told the AP this morning at a law conference. Lerner said the practice was started by low-level workers in Cincinnati and wasn't approved by any top executives.\n\nConservative groups last fall tried to raise red flags about their relationship with the IRS, saying officials were asking an unusual amount of questions when they applied for tax-exempt status. Of course, tax-exempt groups can be politically active, but it can't be their main focus.\n\n\"The IRS would like to apologize for that,\" Lerner said today, referring to the targeting.\n\nApology accepted, presumably . Nope. Jenny Beth Martin, the leader of Tea Party Patriots, the movement's largest group, this afternoon immediately took the opportunity to register umbrage over the matter. She called for the resignation of everyone \"complicit in this activity,\" then requested a Congressional investigation and a presidential apology. \"The IRS has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,\" Martin said. \"This deliberate targeting and harassment of tea party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach. It is suspicious that the activity of these ‘low-level workers’ was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, the American Civil Liberties Union, also chimed in with a disapproving tone. \"Even the appearance of playing partisan politics with the tax code is about as constitutionally troubling as it gets,\" said Michael Macleod- Ball , chief of staff at the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office. \"With the recent push to grant federal agencies broad new powers to mandate donor disclosure for advocacy groups on both the left and the right, there must be clear checks in place to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\nSo much for increasing American love for the Tax Man.\n\nReach Abram Brown at abrown@forbes.com.",

She urged residents to contact police if such incidents are repeated.\n\n“We're urging the public to contact police, and provide as much detail as they can,” Dunn said.\n\nIf someone sees a rogue clown, try and provide as much detail as possible when calling, she added, including the license plate if they are driving and the clothes they are wearing.\n\nIncluding details about the clown makeup?\n\n“Yes,” Dunn replied.\n\nSome people on Sudbury.com's Facebook page Wednesday described seeing a group dressed as clowns trying to scare people. In response to a call out from Sudbury.com about clown sightings, people reported seeing clowns in the Long Lake area, Coniston and downtown Sudbury.\n\n“My 10-year-old son came home terrified around 8 p.m. last night,” one person from Coniston wrote. “Him and a friend saw a person dressed as a clown and they started chasing him.

It will remind you of John Steinbeck or Upton Sinclair's depiction of poverty and economic need, except this is really happening in this country right this minute.\n\nChildren living in cars with their parents after their parents have lost everything -- employment, their homes, their possessions -- everything. Rick Scott should be ashamed, since both of the families featured live in Florida. He should be ashamed not only because of the cuts and hacks to jobs and Florida's economy, but because at least one of these families was afraid to go and get help from the state government for fear of having their children taken away.\n\nPoverty is not neglect; it is not a failure of the parents. There is no justification for breaking up families because they've fallen on hard times. But we live in a time where there is nothing for them. Nothing.\n\nWhile conservatives paint these people as ne'er-do-wells who want to sponge off the government resources, the truth is something else again. I recently spoke to an acquaintance who has been unemployed for two years. He is in the construction business. When we spoke in October, he was putting his things in storage because he expected to be evicted after not being able to pay his rent. He couldn't pay his rent because his bank account had been garnished by the state for income taxes he didn't owe -- he didn't make enough to file a tax return (not realizing he was eligible for refunds if he had).\n\nThe bank had foreclosed on his house but didn't change the title on the loan, and the second trust deed holder was making payments to save their investment. They reported the interest paid on the loan to the state and the state assumed he had at least enough income to pay the house payments even though he had been foreclosed on in 2008. He filed his tax returns to correct the state issues, but not in time to get the lien lifted to pay his November rent. I haven't heard the end to this story, but it wouldn't surprise me a bit to hear that he's living in his car too.\n\nThese are people just like the neighbors down the street, or the people you run into at the grocery store. Yet here is what our conservative overlords want us to think of them.\n\nRand Paul: We shouldn't borrow from China for unemployment benefit extensions to pay people not to work.\n\nDavid Vitter: Gut the food stamp program. This sentiment has been echoed by Senator Sessions and many Republicans in the House.\n\nRepublican Presidential frontrunner Newt Gingrich: Deny single mothers any benefits at all. Make them work and if they can't find a job or can't work, well, too bad. Let them starve. From his white paper on how to dismantle the social safety net:\n\nNo automatic benefits would be handed out any longer for bearing a child out of wedlock. If the mother has a child without a husband, then the mother must go to work to support the child.\n\nEach one of these statements reflects the attitude of conservatives toward those who are suffering in our society. It's fairly simple: If you are impoverished, you are at the mercy of those who control the pursestrings. Newt, for example, advocates repeal of the capital gains tax, Dodd-Frank, the Affordable Care Act, and privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Nothing says compassion like handing the whole cake to the Wall Streeters so they can gamble it away yet again, right?\n\nThis 60 Minutes report highlights the depth of systemic failure in this country. There is no excuse for a country with the wealth this one has to tolerate seeing families live out of their cars as their final option. There is no excuse for flying the middle finger in the face of people who have fallen on hard times. There is no excuse for anyone to fear losing their children because they cannot find a job and are having difficulty providing. These people are human beings, deserving of dignity and opportunity, which they will not find in the austere hallways of corporate and conservative overlords.\n\nHere's a bonus link from PoliticusUSA: Collateral Damage: The GOP’s Obama Hate Pushes 100 Million Towards Poverty",

  "latent_6352": "A strange thing happened on Twitter in the middle of March. \"Why I Left Google,\" a year-old post by a former Google executive named James Whittaker, went viral, for the second time.\n\nA fairly scathing denunciation of how Google's corporate culture had changed for the worse, Whittaker's post got a reasonable amount of notice when it was first published. But this time around, the buzz was louder.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nExactly how the screed was born anew is anyone's guess. The precise mechanics of viral transmission are an enduring mystery. Maybe someone was randomly trolling the Web, stumbled across Whittaker's lament, didn't notice the date was March 13, 2012, instead of March 13, 2013, tweeted it, and hit a nerve. Or perhaps one of Google's competitors saw an opening, and struck a clever blow of Twitter meme warfare.\n\nThe point is that there was an opening, a raw nerve aching to be hit. That same week, Google had announced that it was killing off Google Reader, probably the most widely used newsreader on the Web, beloved by exactly the kind of power users you might expect to boast legions of Twitter followers. These power users were annoyed and distressed at the imminent disappearance of a service that they depended on. They wanted an explanation. It's possible that many of them, encountering Whittaker's post for the first time, found something substantive to chew on in his argument that Google had sacrificed its innovative \"don't be evil\" soul in the quest to maximize advertising revenue.\n\nThe Google I was passionate about was a technology company that empowered its employees to innovate. The Google I left was an advertising company with a single corporate-mandated focus.\n\nCue the Google backlash.\n\nOm Malik in GigaOm:\n\nI spent about seven years of my online life on that service. I sent feedback, used it to annotate information and they killed it like a butcher slaughters a chicken. No conversation — dead. The service that drives more traffic than Google+ was sacrificed because it didn’t meet some vague corporate goals; users — many of them life long — be damned.\n\nThomas Claburn in Information Week.\n\nTrust might be earned and it might be paid for. But whatever trust Google earned in its youth, it has squandered in its adolescence.\n\n* * *\n\nGoogle is so big, so entrenched in so many aspects of our online lives, and so relentlessly active that in any given week the company makes news on multiple fronts, good and bad. It can be difficult to parse signal from noise amid all the deluge of simultaneous hype and complaints. When I told Google I was writing a story about a possible backlash, I was immediately sent a list of a half-dozen positive stories about the company that had appeared in just the last few weeks.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut in the two weeks after the announcement of Google Reader, a handful of other developments gave Google grouches even more grist to grumble. The same week that Whittaker's post was retweeted around the world for a second time, Google banned the advertising blocking app AdBlock Plus from its Google Play app store. A few days later, SearchEngineLand's Danny Sullivan observed that Google Alerts, a popular service that generates daily email reports on any keywords that you choose to monitor, had been effectively broken for months. And just this week, Twitter erupted with scorn at the news that Google's legal department had objected to a Swedish effort to formalize the definition of the Swedish word for \"ungoogleable\" (ogooglebar) as \"that cannot be found on the Web with a search engine.\" (Google, in an effort to protect its trademark, wanted the definition to specify that the word meant \"cannot be found on the Web with Google and requested the inclusion of a disclaimer noting that \"Google\" is a registered trademark.)\n\nThere may be valid reasons for every single one of these developments. AdBlock Plus undoubtedly interferes with Google's future lifeblood of mobile advertising revenue. Google Alerts, like Google Reader, may not generate enough revenue to merit the kind of engineering resources that keeps it functional. And if I've heard it once in the context of ludicrous trademark infringement cases, I've heard it a million times: If you don't defend your trademarks, you endanger your legal right to keep them. (Though it still seems like a dumb, ham-handed move.)\n\nBut whatever the reasons, there's one thing that links them all together. They're just not cool. They betray a my-way-or-the-highway operating stance that is bound to raise hackles. It's no wonder the trade press and power user crowd that once applauded Google for breaking Microsoft's hegemony over the technology realm and for providing an \"open\" alternative to Apple's closed system is now increasingly suspicious and critical and ready to pounce. When Google debuted a new note-taking service called Google Keep one week ago, nearly every reviewer, from the New York Times on down, was careful to warn that, given the recent example of Google Reader's unceremonious dismissal, there was no guarantee that Google would keep Keep around.\n\nLet's return to Whittaker:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUnder [former CEO] Eric Schmidt ads were always in the background. Google was run like an innovation factory, empowering employees to be entrepreneurial through founders' awards, peer bonuses and 20 percent time. Our advertising revenue gave us the headroom to think, innovate and create ... It turns out that there was one place where the Google innovation machine faltered and that one place mattered a lot: competing with Facebook.... Larry Page himself assumed command to right this wrong. Social became state-owned, a corporate mandate called Google+. It was an ominous name invoking the feeling that Google alone wasn’t enough. Search had to be social. Android had to be social. YouTube, once joyous in their independence, had to be … well, you get the point. Even worse was that innovation had to be social. Ideas that failed to put Google+ at the center of the universe were a distraction. Suddenly, 20 percent meant half-assed. Google Labs was shut down. App Engine fees were raised. APIs that had been free for years were deprecated or provided for a fee. As the trappings of entrepreneurship were dismantled, derisive talk of the “old Google” and its feeble attempts at competing with Facebook surfaced to justify a “new Google” that promised “more wood behind fewer arrows.” The days of old Google hiring smart people and empowering them to invent the future was gone. The new Google knew beyond doubt what the future should look like. Employees had gotten it wrong and corporate intervention would set it right again.\n\nWhittaker now works at Microsoft. Reading between the lines, one wonders whether the corporate transition from Schmidt to Page led to some kind of power struggle that didn't work out for Whittaker, pushing him to leave some serious scorched earth behind as he left town. It's also interesting to speculate on whether the ascendance of Page is the explanation for the new, harder-nosed Google.\n\nIt's also important not to overreact to the momentary, viral-blog-post-buffeted moods of Twitter. As I was writing this piece, I saw a news release noting that the two most popular app downloads for Apple's mobile devices in 2013 were Google Maps and YouTube. To a certain extent, the people have spoken. As long as they keep speaking in favor of Google's tools, Google will be just fine.\n\nBut in a fickle information economy in which giants become dwarves overnight, balancing one's reputation for cool with one's bottom line is trickier than ever. A growing accumulation of incidents that rub users the wrong way creates a climate of dissatisfaction that amplifies our reactions to new abuses. A year ago, maybe we laughed off the \"ogooglebar\" kerfuffle, ignored Whittaker's post, and dreamed of wearing Google glasses. Now we poke mean fun at overzealous lawyers, see bean-counting corporate realignment behind every new product launch, and savage Google Glass wearers as irredeemable dorks. Perhaps most troublingly, the benefit of the doubt is gone.We're way beyond mocking \"don’t be evil.\" Now our default position toward Google increasingly resembles how we treated Microsoft in the '90s. Google is indispensable, certainly, but not necessarily to be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn his prescient 2011 book \"The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry),\" Siva Vaidhyanathan opened his preface by observing that \"it's no surprise that we hold the company in deific awe and respect.\" He then proceeded to spend the entire rest of the book explaining why it was dangerous to allow one company to play such an overwhelmingly dominant role in our informational lives. March 2013 has been the month that Siva's chickens came home to roost. Suddenly \"deific awe and respect\" seems in short supply. Ungoogleable, almost.",
  "latent_6416": "More than one in four people out of work in Greece and Spain as jobless rate rises to 11.6%, according to Eurostat data\n\nUnemployment in the eurozone has risen to a new record, with more than one in four out of work in Spain and Greece.\n\nThere are now 18.49 million people without jobs in the 17 countries sharing the euro, said the European statistics office Eurostat on Wednesday with an extra 146,000 joining the ranks of the unemployed last month.\n\nYouth unemployment – joblessness among under-25s – rose to 23.3%, up from 21% during the same month a year ago.\n\nThe prospect of high and rising unemployment, especially among younger workers, is expected to persuade the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in the new year from the current record low of 0.75% to support the flagging economy, which probably slumped back to recession in the third quarter, analysts said.\n\nBut in contrast to the hope of stimulus from the ECB, Brussels and most eurozone governments have put cuts in spending ahead of schemes to create jobs, despite predictions that the situation will worsen over the coming months.\n\nPortugal's right of centre administration on Wednesday pushed through its third attempt at a budget for 2013, which is expected to lead to a third year of contraction and rising unemployment. Likewise Greece's coalition government published €13.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises that will result in a sixth year of falling GDP and and increase in the jobless rate.\n\nEurostat said the jobless rate across the eurozone increased to 11.6% in September, the highest on record, from a revised 11.5% in August.\n\nThe lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.4%), Luxembourg (5.2%), Germany and the Netherlands (both 5.4%), which are near full employment. Spain (25.8%) and Greece (25.1% in July) had the highest unemployment in the eurozone, while France looks much like Italy (both at 10.8%), with a steady rise in joblessness. August data for Greece will be published next week, although the true picture is probably worse than the official figures show as a growing number of Greek workers remain nominally employed but have not been paid for some time.\n\nHoward Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the jobless data was \"dismal\", adding: \"Eurozone labour markets remain under serious pressure from ongoing weakened economic activity and low business confidence.\"\n\nYouth unemployment also hit a new high in Spain with 54.2% of under-25-year-olds out of work, up from 53.8%.\n\nAcross the whole 27 nation European Union, 25.751 million men and women were without jobs last month – an increase of 169,000 from August – while the unemployment rate stayed at 10.6%.\n\nBy comparison, the unemployment rate was 7.9% in the UK, 7.8% in the US and 4.2% in Japan in September.\n\nThere was some good news for the eurozone though – inflation eased to 2.5% in October, from 2.6%. Energy prices continued to rise, by 7.8%, but by less than the month before, when they climbed by 9.1% year-on-year. Food became dearer, however, with prices up 3.2% compared with 2.9% in September.\n\nAndrea Broughton, an economist at the Institute for Employment Studies said: \"Given the ongoing financial difficulties of the European Union and the likelihood of continuing job losses in the public sector as austerity measures begin to bite, overall unemployment levels and youth unemployment in particular are likely to carry on rising for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nShe said a north-south split, which has dramatically opened up since the banking crash, would get worse.\n\n\"The trend is not upwards in all countries – unemployment levels actually decreased in seven member states on a year-on-year basis, including in Lithuania and Latvia, where it may be that the worst effects of the crisis are over. In Germany, although the economy is slowing there are as yet no adverse effects on unemployment, which has fallen on a year-on-year basis.\"\n\nIn some countries the unemployment figures are depressed by a rise in emigration. Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have seen a strong rise in the number of people, mainly young, seeking work abroad.\n\nRoughly 370,000 people emigrated from Spain in 2011, 10 times more than before the banking crisis hit the country in 2008.\n\nAlthough about 86% of them were naturalised immigrants born abroad, there is also a growing number of native Spaniards saying \"ya basta\" (\"enough is enough\"). More than 50,000 left last year, up 80% since before the crisis hit.",

  "latent_6552": "Los Angeles transportation officials are alerting I-405 and regional freeway motorists of an unprecedented 80-hour northbound I-405 freeway lane closure operation in the Sepulveda Pass this Presidents’ Day weekend, February 14 to 18, 2014.\n\nThe Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), in conjunction with California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and a host of law enforcement and emergency response agencies throughout L.A. County are giving the public advance notice that if they do not have a critical need to travel northbound through West Los Angeles and the Sepulveda Pass during the Presidents’ Day three-day weekend, they should eliminate unnecessary auto trips, avoid the area and/or divert to other freeways to avoid major traffic delays.\n\nTraffic conditions on local streets and freeways within the region of Los Angeles County and beyond could become severe, with significant, hours-long delays if motorists do not cooperate with authorities and limit northbound freeway trips.\n\nMotorists who must travel during this weekend are advised to prepare their itineraries in advance, monitor real-time traffic conditions prior to beginning their trips and follow alternate routes that are provided. Motorists will be continually informed of the closure in advance by Caltrans-operated freeway message signs.\n\nThe I-405 contractor will be paving a major segment of the future northbound I-405 High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane in the Sepulveda Pass. The work is considered key to meeting the project’s scheduled completion date of 2014.\n\nWork over the Presidents’ Day weekend will eliminate the need for several consecutive 55-hour freeway closures from the project schedule. This closure operation will save significant time and minimize future closure impacts to the community and traveling public.\n\nThe closure operation consists of a partial day-time lane reduction and a full night-time directional freeway closure on the northbound I-405 between Getty Center Drive and Ventura Boulevard. The closure area is approximately 5.6 miles long, or nearly two-thirds of the entire I-405 project area.\n\nDuring daytime hours, two northbound lanes will remain open while the remaining three lanes will be closed. During night-time hours, all five northbound freeway lanes in this area will be closed.\n\nThe southbound I-405 will remain fully open during the day, but some southbound lanes may be closed during night-time only paving operations.\n\nWork is scheduled to begin Friday night, February 14 starting at 11 p.m. and will last until Tuesday, February 18 at 6 a.m.\n\nRamps within the project area will begin to close as early as 7 p.m. Traffic officers provided by LADOT will help guide motorists at each I-405 northbound on-ramp.\n\nFull northbound night-time freeway closure times are as follows:\n\nFriday night, February 14 – 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.\n\n– 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. Saturday night, February 15 – 2 a.m. to 7 a.m.\n\n– 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday night, February 16 – 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.\n\n– 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. Monday night, February 17 – 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.\n\nThe designated alternative route for night-time full closures will be for motorists to take the Wilshire northbound to westbound off-ramp to northbound Sepulveda Boulevard, returning to northbound I-405 at the Greenleaf northbound on-ramp.\n\nSepulveda Boulevard also will be fully open with two lanes in each direction during the paving operation. However, Sepulveda Boulevard will not have the capacity to accommodate all diverted northbound freeway traffic, and could become severely congested. Freeway motorists should instead divert to other freeway routes.\n\nI-10 connectors to the northbound I-405 also will be closed. Motorists detouring from the closed I-10 connectors should use freeway detour routes rather than local streets.\n\nThe connector detour routes will be as follows:\n\nFor eastbound I-10 to northbound I-405 – use northbound I-110, northbound US 101, to northbound I-405.\n\nFor westbound I-10 to northbound I-405 – use northbound I-5, westbound SR 134, northbound US 101, to northbound I-405.\n\nThe construction schedule is subject to change, and paving work is dependent on favorable weather conditions. In the event of inclement weather during the 80-hour closure, the project will commence continuous 55-hour weekend closures of the northbound freeway starting the following weekend, February 21 for up to four weekends to complete the originally intended work.\n\nThe I-405 Sepulveda Pass Improvements project has now concluded most major freeway widening work between the I-10 and U.S. 101. The contractor is now building the future northbound HOV lane that will connect West Los Angeles with the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe project will officially complete the last remaining gap in the entire I-405 lane network. Additional project benefits include improved freeway safety through standardized lane and shoulder widths, greater ramp capacities at key locations, new sound and retaining walls, widened overpasses, widened and seismically updated bridges.\n\nThe project is a joint effort between Metro and Caltrans, and is being constructed by Kiewit Infrastructure West Co.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Minnesota’s offense struggled mightily throwing the ball last season, but that may change in 2016.\n\nTracy Claeys will kick off his inaugural season as the official Head Coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers. It’s an opportunity for the Gophers to get off to a fast start against a power five conference in opponent Oregon State. (Pac-12)\n\nClaeys has already made a few changes to the coaching staff, bringing in Jay Johnson and Bart Miller.

Around 340 million rabbits are currently confined in barren battery cages on European farms - conditions that would be illegal for hens. Despite being the second most numerous farmed animal in Europe, there is currently no species-specific legislation to protect rabbits.After viewing shocking scenes from rabbit farms in Europe which were released by Animal Equality earlier this week, Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch said: \"Millions of rabbits are suffering and dying in battery cages on farms across the EU.

  "latent_6788": "0\n\nWith Star Wars: The Force Awakens, director J.J. Abrams kicked off a new trilogy of Star Wars films in more ways than one. He not only laid a foundation and introduced compelling new characters, but he also raised a number of mythological questions that went unanswered as the credits rolled. This was a great way to keep fans engaged with the material long after they’d left the theater, and while The Force Awakens has (mostly) satisfying character arcs all its own, the film also promises that there’s much more story to be told.\n\nOne of the film’s biggest questions raised involves the parentage of new protagonist Rey. Daisy Ridley’s character wasn’t just offhandedly referred to as an orphan—her abandonment as a child by her mysterious parents is a major part of who she is as a character, and the awakening of her Force Powers as the film progresses teases that her lineage may be closely tied to the Skywalker family.\n\nI posed the four most likely answers to the question of “Who are Rey’s parents?” in a previous editorial, but now it’s Star Wars: Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow’s turn to weigh in. Speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Trevorrow admitted he’s seen the theories, and promised fans will be pleased with the answer to Rey’s parentage:\n\n“I’ve seen all of the theories… What I do know is that we’re going to make sure that that answer is deeply and profoundly satisfying, because Rey is a character that is important in this universe, not just in the context of The Force Awakens but in the entire galaxy, and she deserves it. So we’ll make sure that that answer is something that feels like it was—it’s something that happened a long time ago [in a galaxy] far, far away, we’re just telling you what happened.”\n\nTrevorrow added that he’s done “a lot of scribbling and a lot of notes” thinking about the story that he wants to tell in Episode IX (he’s writing the script with frequent partner Derek Connolly), and based on those comments it sounds like the answer of Rey’s parentage is something that’s been on his mind as of late. Is it possible we won’t get a full answer until Episode IX? Is it being tasked to Trevorrow to reveal Rey’s parents, or will the question be addressed in Episode VIII? I was betting on Rian Johnson getting to tackle that issue, but there’s something about Trevorrow’s comments that makes me think the question may linger for a few more years. Perhaps we’ll get half an answer in Episode VIII and then the full story in IX.\n\nThe Jurassic World filmmaker added that in approaching the conclusion of this new trilogy, Episode IX has to function as multiple films at once:\n\n“By the time we get to Episode IX, I look at that movie as one movie, as three movies, as six movies, and as nine movies. It’s something that needs to honor a story that has been told over a period of 40 years… Star Wars is a belief system, it’s not just a story and it’s not just a movie, and it’s something I take very seriously.”\n\nIt’ll be curious to see how this Star Wars chapter wraps up and, maybe more interestingly, how Lucasfilm moves forward beyond Episode IX. Does that conclude the Skywalker saga? Does the franchise reboot and tell further Skywalker-connected stories? Do the adventures of Rey and Finn just continue in perpetuity? We have a ways to go until we find out, as Star Wars: Episode IX is currently slated for release sometime in 2019.",

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored.\n\nIn some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.\n\nPreviously, without specific legislation, some victims of revenge porn have sought legal workarounds to have images taken down - most commonly the use of copyright law.\n\nIf an intimate picture has been taken as a \"selfie\", the image's copyright belongs to the taker.\n\nIf passed into law, the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill will define revenge porn as \"photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed, where what is shown would not usually be seen in public\".",
  "latent_7104": "A Chamblee artist who backed Democrat Jon Ossoff in the heated 6th Congressional District race is trying to cool off the political climate off with some snowflakes and humor.\n\nThe artist, who asked that his real name not be published but uses the pseudonym Hamilton Burger, said after the June 20 runoff between Republican Karen Handel and Ossoff, he collected several hundred of their political signs that dotted yards and rights-of-way for months in the hotly contested race that garnered national attention.\n\nAnd he turned them into snowflakes. Yes, snowflakes, in a not-so-subtle dig at the derogatory word people on both sides of the political spectrum have hurled at each other.\n\n“I know this an insult from both sides, so it seemed appropriate,” he said. “Those who wish to be offended will be offended. I’ve heard all of it. Whatever you’re going to see, you’re going to see.”\n\nThe signs appeared the morning of June 28 at several Dunwoody intersections but were also found in Chamblee and other areas in the 6th Congressional District.\n\nCity code enforcement officers were made aware of the signs and are conducting sweeps to remove them from rights of way throughout the city, said city spokesperson Bob Mullen.\n\nMullen said the cleanup of the signs is not expected to incur additional costs on the city because clearing signs from the rights of way is part of the routine sign removal process the code enforcement team conducts for signs placed in the right of way.\n\nDunwoody Councilmember Terry Nall, a Handel supporter, said he believed the city cleanup “is an unfortunate use of public resources.”\n\n“This morning, I noticed a number of leftover 6th District campaign signs had been modified into whimsical ‘art’ and placed in public right of way,” Nall said in a June 28 statement. “All the signs seem to be slot-cut into shapes of snowflakes and stars. Both Ossoff and Handel signs were modified.\n\n“While I do not know if this was meant to be a political message, a decoration for the upcoming Independence Day holiday, or a prank typically seen on April Fool’s Day, I do know it will be a city expenditure to remove these from the public right of way,” he added. “For a city with a small, lean budget, this is an unfortunate use of public resources. Clearly, someone must have a lot of extra time to modify these signs and then place them around the city.”\n\nA native Atlantan who has lived in the 6th Congressional District since 1973, Burger said the idea of repurposing the political signs came after a discussion with a friend about what was really accomplished after the most expensive House race in history.\n\n“Back in the day there were those T-shirts that said, ‘My parents went to Florida and all I got was this crappy T-shirt,’” he said of the seed for his idea that led to the epiphany, “Well, my district had a $50 million election and all I got were these crappy signs.”\n\nDespite the money spent, the district remained red, he said: “We got a lot of signs and not much difference.”\n\nThe signs were also meant to bring some levity after such a passionate campaign.\n\n“I thought it would be a whimsical decoration,” he said of recycling the signs. “And I thought it would make a few people smile after a long, aggravating period.”\n\nAnd, he said, he knew people would see in them what they wanted to see. An Ossoff supporter, for example, told him he thought a Handel supporter made the signs to poke fun at Ossoff supporters.\n\nHe said of Nall’s reaction that Republicans tended to be less comfortable with artistic expression that is a “little bit rebellious.”\n\n“Again, people will see what they want to see in it,” he said. “He saw someone was taking his money., but the city spokesperson said there was no additional cost.”\n\n“Burger” said he drove around for about an hour late Wednesday with a friend and placed the signs at busy intersections where he hoped people would be able to slow and see the signs. He estimated he put out 300 of the snowflake signs.\n\nCreating the signs was simple, he said, by using a computerized cutting machine he has, estimating it took about seven hours.\n\nFinding the signs was not difficult. He plucked a few from the side of the road, knocked on a few doors and asked residents if he could take their signs and went Dumpster diving behind the Ossoff Chamblee office where he got “a pretty good stack.”\n\nHe also asked a local code enforcement officer for some signs, and got plenty that way, too. “I didn’t tell him what I was going to use them for,” he said.\n\nHe wished there were more Handel signs turned into snowflakes, but said Ossoff easily “out-yard-signed her by a long shot.”\n\nBesides being “whimsical decorations,” Burger said he hoped people would see them and also think about what $50 million could have been used for – filling pot holes and creating new parks, perhaps. He also said the money could have been used to buy voter machines that leave a paper trail.\n\n“This was an obscene amount of money … and I hope people will ponder that,” he said.\n\nAnd if someone wants a sign for their own yard? “I hope people will pick them up and take them and put them in their yard,” he said.\n\nOne person who has done just that is Nina Watts of Dunwoody, who included her own “Game of Thrones” sign that states, “Winter is coming.”\n\n“I want people to keep the election on their minds,” she said. “2018 is not far away.”\n\nHandel defeated Ossoff in the June 20 race for the Sixth Congressional District.",
  "latent_7161": "To help explain Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) noticeable absence in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi put together a humorous video that shows the God of Thunder in Australia, taking a break from his superhero duties and awkwardly living with a commoner named Darryl Jacobson, and it was unveiled at San Diego Comic Con and officially released online a month later.\n\nIt was so well-received, a Change.org petition (currently has 3,048 supporters) was started in the hopes of getting the mockumentary turned into a full-blown television series on Netflix. While that almost certainly won't happen, that doesn't mean we won't see Darryl again.\n\n“Thor briefly rented a room in a flat in Australia after the Ultron debacle,” Waititi explained to IGN. “Just to get some downtime – to get away from The Avengers, to get away from America. So he had a little downtime in Australian. And he met this guy Darryl and they shared a flat together. So that’s Darryl. “I think you probably could see him again,” he continued. “There may be other little pieces of that thing that everyone saw that may just be a small part of a bigger thing.”\n\nThe cast of Thor: Ragnarok features returning stars Chris Hemsworth (Rush) in the title role for the fifth time; Tom Hiddleston (Kong: Skull Island) as Thor’s adversarial, adopted brother, Loki; Idris Elba (The Dark Tower) as the Asgardian sentry, Heimdall; and Sir Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) again portraying Odin, Ruler of Asgard.

  "latent_7185": "As crypto-mining has gained popularity, the website owners are now using cryptocurrency mining scripts to use the CPU power of the visitors for earning profits. This has also inspired some developers to come up with methods to block cryptocurrency mining in the web browser via different methods.\n\nThe Pirate Bay, the world’s most popular torrent website, was recently spotted testing a Monero cryptocurrency miner on their websites. The website confessed that it could be using coin mining in future to keep the website running. This was followed by some other reports of similar nature.\n\nThis practice isn’t new, but the Pirate Bay was the first popular website that was seen using a cryptocurrency miner. This has also fueled the ethics debate as the website owners are found to be keeping the visitors in the dark.\n\nHowever, I was surprised to notice that many users who commented on the article and Facebook didn’t mind their favorite website using their CPU power to earn revenue. This could be due to the fact that torrent websites are home to tons of notorious advertising. Before going ahead and telling you how to block cryptocurrency mining in web browser, let me tell you how to find out if you’re already becoming a target of such mining activities —\n\nHow to find out if my PC is secretly mining cryptocurrency?\n\nApart from ransomware, bitcoin mining malware are rising in popularity at an exponential rate. In case the culprit is some website which is using your web browser to mine crypto coins, you can find that out easily.\n\nThe Pirate Bay users spotted the miner due to a huge spike in CPU usage when they visited the website. You can also use the same technique to see if a particular website is sweating your processor and earning money. In case most of the browser tabs are closed, and no applications are running, there are chances that you are becoming a target of such mining campaign. If you aren’t much tech-savvy, you can perform hit and trial with the suspected websites and see which one of them is spiking the CPU usage. The tech-savvy users can perform this task much efficiently with the help of resource monitoring tools.\n\nHow to block cryptocurrency mining in web browser?\n\nMost of the websites that are making TPB-like headlines are using a new service called Coin Hive for mining. There are few simple ways to block such activities:\n\n1. Use No Coin Chrome Extension\n\nInstalling Chrome extensions is the most straightforward method to stop coin mining in the web browser. No Coin is one such free solution. This open-source extension is a reliable and safe way to control how a website is interacting with your web browser.\n\nAs soon as you visit a website, No Coin will detect and show if any such activity is going on. You’ll see a red symbol as shown in the screenshot below. While this extension blocks any such activity, it also allows you to whitelist a website for a period of time.\n\n2. Use minerBlock Chrome extension\n\nJust like No Coin, minerBlock Chrome extension is another open-source tool that you can use to block cryptocurrency mining in the web browser. These extensions currently list a few popular miner domains to their list, and they are expected to add more once they get popularity.\n\nHere’s how minerBlock notification looked like when I visited Coin Hive’s website:\n\n3. Block coin mining domains in hosts file\n\nThis is the manual way of blocking particular domains that you don’t find harmful or irritating. Due to such blocking, your browser won’t be able to connect to these domains. We can edit the hosts file and redirect it to 0.0.0.0.\n\nIn Linux, you need to open the hosts file by running following command and add 0.0.0.0 to the end of the document:\n\nsudo nano /etc/hosts 1 sudo nano / etc / hosts\n\nIn Linux, run the following command:\n\nsudo nano /private/etc/hosts 1 sudo nano / private / etc / hosts\n\nFor Windows, navigate to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc and edit the hosts document to add 0.0.0.0 at the end.\n\nPlease note that this change blocks the mining scripts which are hosted by . In case you come across other mining script domains, you can add them further down the line.\n\n4. Block domains in Ad blocker\n\nAd blocking extensions like AdBlock can help you block cryptocurrency mining. Depending on your web browser, you can find relevant settings to block particular domains. For example, in Chrome, for AdBlock, navigate to the list of extension and find AdBlock. There, look for Customize > Block an ad by its URL. Then, add the following text in the text box:\n\n5. Use NoScripts in Firefox\n\nFor Firefox, you can use JavaScript-blocking extensions like NoScript. Before using it to block cryptocurrency mining in the web browser, please note that it’s pretty aggressive and it could break lots of websites as it disables all scripts running on pages. If you’re using Tor Browser, you would already be knowing about NoScripts and its use. You can use any one of these methods to get rid of the cryptocurrency mining in web browser.\n\nShould I really go ahead and stop cryptocurrency mining?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on the website which is using a crypto miner. If the website is notifying you as soon as you visit it and you’re comfortable with it, then it’s no harm. Another point that you must take into consideration is the mining load that your CPU would bear. A website should also let you know how much processing power does it intend to utilize.\n\nIn case you’re willing to support your favorite website via this alternative source of revenue and they are being honest about their practices, things are fine.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
  "latent_7296": "You know that feeling that takes over your brain when you see your ex across the mall, holding hands with the new guy? It’s a disturbing feeling, because you instantly begin comparing yourself to the new mate. Whether it be the weight, the look or the personality, it’s something that you can’t stop thinking about.\n\nThis terrible reaction can be felt on the ice, too.\n\nWith former St. Louis Blues goalie Ryan Miller in town last Thursday, the Blues brass was hoping for a big victory, especially after a forgettable 3-0 loss to the Anaheim Ducks the Sunday prior. It was more of the same effort, as the Canucks defeated the Blues 4-1, with rookie Jake Allen between the pipes.\n\n“We’re not playing the right way,” Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock said after the second home loss in three contests. “We’ve made a heck of a run here playing the right way; no odd-man rushes, no forced offense, don’t give the puck away and make hope-for plays offensively. We have had a shoot-first mentality that’s allowed us to be top-five in the League in scoring goals. But we don’t want to play the right way.”\n\nThe Blues had to picture that ex-girlfriend laughing in their faces, making snide comments to the new guy.\n\nThe Blues had to face a quick turnaround, as Brian Elliott received the start against the division-rival Chicago Blackhawks, who rolled into town getting points in six of their first seven games.\n\nThings seemed grim early. Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp converted on a five-on-three power play just 1:02 into the game. Lock the door, put the bed comforter over the window and blare mid-2000s rock for the rest of the night. The world has gotten the best of the Blues.\n\nJaden Schwartz changed the mood, though. He scored at 12:15 of the first period off of a fluttering shot to put the Blues on the board and tie the game. There’s a glimmer of light shining through between the comforter and the wall.\n\nRyan Reaves flashed open the window at 18:09 of the second period with his first of the season. Dmitrij Jaskin scored his second-career goal just 1:45 later to rip the door open and turn that emo rock into the best song you’ve ever heard. Although Blackhawks winger Kris Versteeg scored early in the third period, the Blues held on for a 3-2 win and lifted the spirits of Blues fans across the Gateway City.\n\nIn the victory, Elliott made 22 saves, including eight total saves against Jonathan Toews and Duncan Keith.\n\nThe Blues then traveled south to play the Dallas Stars. Facing a high-octane offense that included the likes of leading NHL scorer Tyler Seguin, Elliott had his work cut out for him.\n\nHe was up to the challenge, making 25 saves on 28 shots en route to winning his third game of the season. Thanks to Vladimir Tarasenko’s first career hat trick, the Blues left The Big D with a 4-3 overtime victory.\n\nElliott’s best save came with under 45 seconds remaining, when he cut across to stop a wrist shot from Seguin.\n\nThe bigger story came after the contest, when it was revealed that Blues forwards David Backes and T.J. Oshie would miss time with concussions. Forward Joakim Lindstrom was also suffering effects from a bacteria infection that hindered the Blues since their California road trip earlier in the month.\n\nWith the Ducks in town on Thursday, it was up to Allen to keep the streak going.\n\nHe did just that.\n\nThe New Brunswick native posted 24 saves and Alexander Steen and Ryan Reaves scored to thrust the Blues to their third straight victory. The 2-0 shutout win was Allen’s second of his career, but, more importantly, was the Blues’ first win against a southern California team since a 5-1 win against the Los Angeles Kings on Jan. 2 of this year.\n\n“I felt really good this week in practice,” Allen said. “I didn’t know when I was going to get another start. I just want to be ready every time I can. (Elliott) played great Tuesday in Dallas and it was my job (tonight) to give us a chance to win.”\n\nJust one week ago, coach Hitchcock was unhappy with his team’s play. On Thursday, he was raving about his roster – especially his goaltender.\n\n“Jake was really solid,” he said in his postgame presser. “The feeling for me on the bench was that they weren’t going to score.”\n\nAllen kept the Ducks scoreless with a big save on former Maurice Richard Trophy winner Corey Perry in the middle of the third period. Facing a five-on-three, Allen deflected a pass in front of the net with an outstretched stick. It bounced off Ducks winger Dany Heatley, before pinballing back to the slot with a waiting Perry ready to unload. Allen sprawled over and made a miraculous kick save.\n\nAllen wasn’t about to take full credit for the victory. He also wasn’t ready to make excuses if his team suffered a loss.\n\n“(We) lost those four key offensive additions and key parts to our team,” he said. “To be able to see guys from, my perspective, step up – like (Chris Porter), (Maxim Lapierre) and (Ryan Reaves) – and fill the other guys’ roles is pretty powerful to me and allows me to do my part.\n\n“Every team in the league is going to have losses all season long. Unfortunately, we have them right now.”\n\nThe Blues will have to face another ex on Dec. 6 when Jaroslav Halak arrives in town with his latest team, the New York Islanders.\n\nElliott and Allen will be up to the task. The Blues will be ready this time to counter by showing off the good-looking tandem in net.",
  "latent_7310": "Click here to view the complete list of archived articles\n\nThis article was originally published in the Summer 2011 issue of Methods & Tools\n\nEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Software Measurement\n\nSue Rule & P. Grant Rule, s.rule @ smsexemplar.com\n\nSoftware Measurement Services Ltd., www.smsexemplar.com\n\nWhat Does Functional Size Measurement Mean?\n\nWhen Grant Rule was working with early pioneers of agile methods back in the late 1980s, estimating was a big issue. No one, it seemed, knew how to determine accurately in advance how big a project was, how long it would take, or how much it would cost. This was particularly a problem for a software house delivering fixed price contracts. Focusing on rapid, iterative delivery to ensure the user gets the right software product is good; but at what price?\n\nWhile advocates of Lean-Agile rightly emphasise the importance of delivering the right thing, it is essential that professional software managers also keep reliable accounts of software process performance for estimating costs, auditing performance, and improving productivity. Effectiveness is delivering optimum value for the minimum cost.\n\nThe solution to Grant’s estimating issue, and many associated software project control issues, was the IFPUG function point measurement method developed by Alan Albrecht in 1979. Yet for various reasons, functional size measurement has failed to become widely adopted as a software project management tool. Perhaps it seems arcane - difficult - part of that top-heavy bureaucracy development teams want to be rid of. But as a result, estimating remains a widespread problem for Agile and non-Agile developers alike. Process performance remains hugely variable and unpredictable, with measurement often still the most neglected area of process improvement. By stripping away much of the dysfunctional and redundant process control that can accumulate around the software process, the current interest in Agile is bringing many of these issues to the surface. But many IT professionals seem stuck in a rut, ploughing new land with a newly Agile team but using the same blunt plough and running into the same obstacles.\n\nCIOs, bid teams, development teams, vendor managers and legal advisors seeking better ways of contracting - particularly for Lean-Agile software development - are still faced with the dilemmas Albrecht was seeking to tackle. How do you know your development teams - in-house or outsourced - are delivering best value for money? How does a supplier manage the risk of a fixed price contract? How does he demonstrate competitive productivity levels and on-going improvement? How will Agile benefit my organisation? How does the business manage the risk if we can’t detail the requirements up-front? How do you measure the benefits of outsourcing IT? Which technology should we choose? Will a change of technology affect the value delivered? What are the relative merits of buying it, building it or outsourcing it?\n\nAlan Albrecht’s answer to addressing these issues was to measure software size in terms of the output delivered to the user - its functionality - rather than simply in terms of the time and effort put into the development. Deriving a software size from the user’s requirements which can then be mapped to the time, resources and budget needed to realise those requirements gives you the necessary objectivity to tackle the scope, project and performance control issues. It also takes you at least part way to measuring the business value and benefit delivered by software. At least you know how much it will cost and how long it will take to deliver the specified functionality; the software should do what it \"says on the tin\" and it should be delivered on schedule, within budget. If the customer has bought beans instead of tomatoes, or needed a three course meal and not a tin of beans at all, there is something amiss elsewhere in the process.\n\nFunctional size measurement means the ability to make objective performance comparisons across teams, across market sectors, and between different suppliers. It means reliable productivity and pricing benchmarks. It means accurate baselines and measures of improvement. It means early and accurate estimations of software project cost and duration. That was why Grant Rule first adopted the technique back in the 1980s - and remains a knowledgeable advocate of it today.\n\nEstimating\n\nThe predictability of software projects remains a major issue for many business managers. Agile can exacerbate this if delivered software products or software product components have to be routinely re-factored. Customers considering outsourced Agile development will rightly require some assurance of value for money, and suppliers need a reliable oversight of costs to ensure prices remain competitive. The ‘Story Point’ measures used by many Agile teams to estimate and manage projects are little more than a new take on our old friend, the measure of input. Estimates using Story Points rely on team knowledge and capability, based on individual experience. The process of arriving at them is even known as Planning Poker, an indication of the level of personal skill and informed guesswork required. Story Points cannot be compared between one team and another (let alone one market sector or one supplier and another). Their use either as an effective and reliable estimating tool or as objective and comparable measures of productivity is therefore very limited.\n\nIn 2010, Grant Rule published a short paper on using the most modern of the functional size methods - COSMIC - to derive accurate estimates from User Stories (used by Agile teams to capture requirements.) As measurement specialists, SMS recommend the use of COSMIC as the quickest, most reliable, and most easily learned method of introducing robust software estimating practice for developers using Agile or more traditional development practices.\n\nSize Matters - Accurate Early Estimating\n\nProject failure rates have been shown to relate strongly to the size of project undertaken, with the largest projects accounting for the highest failure rate. Rule’s Relative Size Scale was a table developed by Grant Rule to provide a quick and easy early range estimate of project size and cost in terms of clothing sizes - Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large. The scale uses benchmark data to provide a valuable and reliable early-stage feasability check.\n\nCOCOMO II Profiling - Accounting for Non-Functional Requirements\n\nThe Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is an algorithmic software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm. The model uses a basic regression formula, with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current project characteristics. COCOMO enables more refined estimates to be derived from simple unadjusted function points by taking into account differences in non-functional project attributes (Cost Drivers). Detailed COCOMO can also account for the influence of individual project phases.\n\nCOCOMO II was brought out in 2000, to adapt the original model for use estimating software projects in modern development conditions such as incremental development and rational unified process. COCOMO II is continually evolving to adapt to changing software methods.\n\nWhat are Function Points?\n\nFunction Points measure the end users requirements in terms of data movements. This means that an early functional size estimate can be derived before any code has been written. They are then also used to measure the actual cost of developing the requirements, which can be compared directly to the estimate and used to calibrate a scale for a particular development environment. If development productivity figures are known, the cost of developing new software can therefore be estimated early enough to make direct comparisons to the cost of buying a software package, or simply using a non-technical solution. Function Point measures are independent of technology so can compare different suppliers, technologies and different teams to give an objective basis for a cost benefit decision.\n\nBecause they encompass both cost (development effort consumed) and benefit (requirements fulfilled), Function Points unlock the door to measuring productivity; velocity; quality; and value in software development.\n\nThe capacity to measure the amount of output produced for input provided gives an objective productivity figure.\n\ngives an objective figure. Measured against time - E.g. FP delivered per elapsed month - function points provide objective and comparable measures of velocity .\n\n- function points provide objective and comparable measures of . The number of defects detected over total size of delivery - i.e. no of defects delivered over no of FP delivered - gives a measure of quality .\n\n- gives a measure of . By comparing costs, effort and time expended per function point delivered, we can also demonstrate the huge waste generated by ineffective software processes compared to the standards of measurable efficiency shown by effective, Right-shifted organisations. Although a long way from being a comprehensive measure of value delivered to the customer, this offers a measure of the component of value for which the software developer is solely responsible. Ensuring the functionality delivered is aligned to business need is the joint responsibility of the business user and the development team and outside the scope of functional size measurement.\n\nA Comparison of Functional Size Methods\n\nThe most widely used function point methods are IFPUG, NESMA, Mk II and COSMIC. Of these, IFPUG is based on the original method designed by Alan Albrecht. COSMIC is the newest method, developed by an international team of metrics experts to support modern software.\n\nWhere organisations have already made some investment in IFPUG capability, it may make sense to use this more widely known method. It is actively managed and maintained by the International Function Point User Group, with the latest version 4.3 released in January 2010. The Certified Function Point Specialist qualification is a recognised standard for IFPUG counting competency. There is considerable IFPUG benchmarking data available, although it is questionable how valuable some of the older data is in terms of benchmarking modern software performance.\n\nWhile the older functional size measures - typically, IFPUG - can be used for Agile projects, there are significant problems. IFPUG counting is not the easiest process to learn or apply, and even with trained practitioners, time can be wasted debating fuzzy areas. Interpretation of the IFPUG counting rules for complex modern software environments can be tricky, sometimes resulting in differences of opinion between supplier and customer.\n\nCOSMIC offers all the advantages of functional size measurement, without some of the shortcomings of earlier methodologies which were not designed with 21st century software in mind. It will prove easier to introduce, easier for both business users and software developers to understand and apply, and a more effective communication mechanism for negotiating the delivery of value. It is an established standard with recognised training qualifications. There is a growing repository of benchmark data available.\n\nSee the table below for a more detailed comparison.\n\nTypes of measurement scale and permissible operations using them\n\nThe type of scale depends on the nature of the relationship between values on the scale. Four types of scale are commonly defined:\n\nNominal – arbitrary labels, classification data, no ordering – the measurement values are categorical but it makes no sense to state that one category is ‘greater than’ another. For example: Yes/No; Black/White/Yellow/Red; male/female, animal/vegetable/mineral; the classification of defects by their type.\n\nOrdinal – ordered but differences between values are not important – the measurement values are rankings. For example: restaurant ‘star’ ratings; political parties on left to right of the spectrum are given labels Red, Orange, Blue; Likert scales that rank ‘user satisfaction’ on a scale of 1..5; the assignment of a severity level to defects.\n\nInterval – ordered, constant scale, but no natural zero – the measurement values have equal distances corresponding to equal quantities of the attribute. For example: dates, temperature on Celsius or Fahrenheit scales – differences make sense, but ratios do not (e.g., 30°-20° = 20°-10°, but 20° is not twice as hot as 10°! Other examples: cyclomatic complexity has the minimum value of one, but each additional path increments the count by one.\n\nRatio – ordered, constant scale, natural zero – the measurement values have equal distances corresponding to equal quantities of the attribute where the value of zero corresponds to none of the attribute. For example: height; weight; age; length; temperature on Kelvin scale (e.g. absolute zero = 0°K, and 200°K is twice as hot as 100°K); the size of a software source listing in terms of Non-Commentary Source Statements (or Source Lines Of Code).\n\nThe method of measurement usually affects the type of scale that can be used reliably with a given attribute. For example, subjective methods of measurement usually only support ordinal or nominal scales.\n\nOnly certain operations can be performed on certain scales of measurement. The following list summarizes which operations are legitimate for each scale. Note that you can always apply operations from a 'lesser scale' to any particular data, e.g. you may apply nominal, ordinal, or interval operations to an interval scaled datum.\n\nNominal Scale. You are only allowed to examine if a nominal scale datum is equal to some particular value or to count the number of occurrences of each value. For example, gender is a nominal scale variable. You can examine if the gender of a person is F (female) or to count the number of Ms (males) in a sample. Valid statistics: mode, chi square.\n\nOrdinal Scale. You are also allowed to examine if an ordinal scale datum is less than or greater than another value. Hence, you can 'rank' ordinal data, but you cannot 'quantify' differences between two ordinal values. For example, political party is an ordinal datum with the Liberal Democratic Party to the left of the Conservative Party, but you can't quantify the difference. Another example are preference scores, e.g. ratings of eating establishments where 10=good, 1=poor, but the difference between an establishment with a 10 ranking and an 8 ranking can't be quantified. Valid statistics: mode, chi square, median, percentile.\n\nInterval Scale. You are also allowed to quantify the difference between two interval scale values but there is no natural zero. For example, temperature scales are interval data with 25C warmer than 20C and a 5C difference has some physical meaning. Note that 0C is arbitrary, so that it does not make sense to say that 20C is twice as hot as 10C. Valid statistics: mode, chi square, median, percentile, mean, standard deviation, correlation, regression, analysis of variance.\n\nRatio Scale. You are also allowed to take ratios among ratio scaled variables. Physical measurements of height, weight, and length are typically ratio variables. It is now meaningful to say that 10 metres is twice as long as 5 metres. This ratio holds true regardless of which scale the object is being measured in (e.g. metres or yards). This is because there is a natural zero. Valid statistics: mode, chi square, median, percentile, mean, standard deviation, correlation, regression, analysis of variance, geometric mean, harmonic mean, coefficient of variation, logarithms.\n\nA comparison of the most common Function Size Measurement (FSM) Methods\n\nGeneral Information IFPUG FPA r4.3 NESMA FPA v2.0 Mark II FPA r1.3.1 COSMIC FSM r3.0.1 Origin Created by Allan Albrecht at IBM in 1978\n\nLatest release (January 2010) of the original method Believed to have been created by NESMA (aka NEFPUG) in mid-1980s\n\nDerived from IFPUG Created by Charles Symons at Nolan Norton in 1984 (put into public domain 1991) Updated method for use with DBMS, structured methods, CASE tools, etc Created by international consortium of industry subject matter experts and academics from 19 countries in 1997 Updated method for use with OOA/D, layered architectures, Web2.0, lean/agile, etc Counting Practices Manual Available to IFPUG members Available for sale Available - public domain Available - public domain Counting Practices Manual - languages available English & some other language versions available to members Dutch-language version\n\nEnglish-language version English-language version 9 language versions:\n\nArabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish Used by Public & private sector organisations, large & small, both customers & vendors, around the world\n\nMostly MIS users Stable user base – international Public & private sector organisations, large & small, both customers & vendors, primarily in The Netherlands Mostly MIS users Declining user base – mostly The Netherlands Originally HM Government’s preferred method for sizing & estimating software.

Tune in every morning from 4am to 8am.\n\nFrom toys to snack cakes, Sanrio's ever-famous cat can be seen peddling everything. Including beer.\n\nNow, the Internet and history has shown that Hello Kitty has graced the face of beer bottles before: At one point there was even a Hello Kitty licensed beer which was produced by Becks. However, this time, her feline visage is now gracing the fronts of cans and instead of a global audience, this version of Kitty beer is in China.\n\nLicensed by the Shanghai KT trading company and brewed by Taiwanese beer maker Long Chuan, the Hello Kitty beer isn't your average beer—they're fruit-flavored wonders.\n\nSo far, there's only been two flavors spotted in Beijing: Hello Kitty Lemon Lime flavor and Hello Kitty Peach flavor. According to Long Chuan's website, and my local 7-11 clerk, there are more than 6 flavors of the beer, including passion fruit and banana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the beers come at 2.3% alcohol by volume, which isn't much if you take it at face value. However, these beers are dangerous. They're so ridiculously smooth and tasty that one can barely tell they're drinking beer. It's almost like drinking fruit juice, even if the cans do say \"beer\" (啤酒 or pi jiu).\n\nThese aren't the same as say Belgium Ales made with fruit. They're nothing like a Duvel or a Blue Moon (yes, I know Blue Moon is American). These beers are closest to Chimay but with stronger fruit flavorings. The fruit isn't a note or a sense in these beverages but instead the overpowering star of it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lemon lime flavor tasted like a light limeade of sorts, almost losing the lemon flavoring. It was smooth and sweet, like a lime soda. It didn't taste like beer. The lime flavor was the strongest flavor in this brew.\n\nThe peach one also tasted more like fruit juice than beer. It was good, but sickly sweet. Again, you can barely tell it's beer. The only downside to the peach was that because it was so sweet, there was this weird almost soapy after-taste at the end of each sip. The peachy-soapy flavor does linger on until something washes it away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took me three beers to get buzzed. Three.\n\nNow keep in mind, I'm a big dude. Nowhere near as big as our resident big man Mr. Mike Fahey, but I'm a healthy 5'11 and 196 pounds.\n\nThese beers, apart from the Hello Kitty marketing, also had something that Mainland Chinese are crazy for: Taiwan. On the cans the fact that the beers are \"Taiwan fruit flavored\" is prominently displayed, which kind of makes sense since fruit flavored beers are huge in Taiwan. Taiwan's own Taiwan Beer is currently doing very well in China with its pineapple-flavored beer—a brew that I quite enjoyed, myself.

  "latent_7559": "Courtesy Discover\n\nEvita Wallenda is perched on a concrete highway divider, finger-drumming on a hole that's been covered for some reason by duct tape. \"I'm reeeeeally bored right now,\" she sighs theatrically as only a 12-year-old can. About 120 feet directly over her head, her father is steadily walking his way across 1,576 feet of high wire stretched out above the Milwaukee Mile speedway, the evening's main attraction at the Wisconsin State Fair. Her two older brothers, Yanni, 17, and Amadaos, 14, are among the 22 crew members, all relatives or longtime friends, scurrying and checking the support ropes for tension as Wallenda progresses. This is billed as the longest walk of Nik Wallenda's career, 30 or so feet longer than when he crossed the Grand Canyon in 2013; he needs to push the envelope but he also needs to pace himself to support a life of subsequent record setting. But it's nothing Evita Wallenda hasn't seen before, every day, her entire life.\n\nWatching a man walk slowly in a straight line does not seem like usual speedway fare, but from directly below the wire, each step is heart-stopping. Wallenda's feet, sheathed in special leather slippers handmade by his mother, Delilah, curl around the steel cable just so, but the margin for error is acutely, viscerally measurable. The grandstands are not full, maybe a couple hundred people, but the wire is visible from much of the sprawling fairgrounds, a slowly moving dot that is as much a part of the landscape as the Ferris wheel and villages of cheese curd stands. From that distance, what he does is so abstract — there's no mystery as to what can go wrong, of course, but from this vantage point directly below, it's so much clearer just how easily that could happen.\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News Nik Wallenda and his daughter, Evita, at the Wisconsin State Fair on Aug. 10, 2015.\n\nThe cable is three-quarters of an inch in diameter and lined with 118 support ropes, 59 on either side. Each rope is held tight by a volunteer; a local radio station promised 120 contest winners to hold the guy wires, but fell a few dozen short. A few were too drunk to perform their duties as human ballasts — it's the end of a long, hot August day at the fair — so the difference is made up with state fair employees, spare crew members, and a lurking journalist. This isn't a new problem or one that hadn't been anticipated — for a walk a few years ago, so many volunteers were too drunk to hold the ropes that Wallenda had to more or less go unsupported. When Wallenda walked over the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls live on television, a much thicker cable was used because there was no way to stabilize with ropes and humans. Wallenda feels every vibration, every variation in tension; the less of either, the better.\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News Nik Wallenda prepping volunteers before the Wisconsin State Fair walk.\n\nAt 6 p.m., about an hour before the walk was scheduled to begin, Wallenda stood in the loading area behind the fair's main stage clutching a megaphone, flanked by two of the riggers, and demonstrated how everyone needed to stand inside the rope's loop, placed just below the butt, and lean back so the line is as taut as possible. Oh, and, crucially, no mid-walk selfies by the rope holders, which was a big problem the time a high school football team served as holders — he notices every slight shifting of weight up there, please just be still, at least until Wallenda is several ropes past. \"It's not that important a job,\" Wallenda announced through the bullhorn cheerily, \"but if you screw it up, I'll die.\"\n\nSteve Kandell/BuzzFeed News\n\nWallenda's guest of honor at the walk is Coulter, an 8-year-old fan from Houston with brain cancer, who is here with his mom and grandfather. They were part of the pre-walk prayer circle with his family and crew, and Wallenda introduces him from atop the wire, a brave kid going through a rough time. Wallenda and Coulter are both wearing a black wicking T-shirt with an NW/Nik Wallenda logo on the front and \"Never Give Up, Coulter!\" on the back, along with Isaiah 53:5 (\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed\"). #NeverGiveUp is Wallenda's motto and how he signs off on his social media dispatches — big-top attraction as motivational guru.\n\nHe speaks over the PA the entire duration of the walk, interviewed by the emcee who is standing on the grandstand stage, rattling off lines he says practically every time he is near a live microphone: that he's a seventh-generation performer, that his great-grandfather Karl Wallenda used to say, \"Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting.\" He's so dialed in the words may be coming out unconsciously. He later plugs his soon-to-air episode of Say Yes to the Dress featuring him and his wife, Erendira, renewing their vows; they never had money to throw themselves a real wedding 15 years ago, he explains casually. He has to pause and kneel on the wire several times, his monitor and headset mic keep slipping off his ear — of all the things that could kill him right now, indulging in light banter has shot to the top of the list. Three-quarters of the way across, crew members scramble to stabilize a spot in the wire that isn't taut enough. Then Wallenda reaches the end of the line and is lowered down on a lift, where his family and Coulter's family greet him, another record on his CV.\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News\n\nThe best circus performers were always as good at branding as they were at swinging from trapezes and standing down lions — they just didn't call it that. Wallenda is more than happy to call it that; his dozens of cousins and uncles and stepcousins, he thinks they'll never get it, they don't want it bad enough, they would rather tear him down than build themselves up. Self-promotion is no less an integral survival skill than keeping one's balance on a wobbly steel wire no wider than a nickel, and no less susceptible to volatile environmental vagaries. He is known for crossing Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon while unabashedly praising Jesus during live, widely viewed primetime TV specials, but he is not known as well as he would like. For all the cinematic audacity of the event walks he's plotting for the future — between the world's tallest twin towers in Kuala Lumpur, over rain forests in Brazil, atop skyscrapers in Times Square — openly coveting household-name ubiquity for performing potentially suicidal acts in front of the largest audiences possible at a time when spectacle is cheap and readily accessible in your pocket, all while maintaining an image as a pious, God-fearing family man is, in fact, Nik Wallenda's most daunting challenge. He knows he's not going to fall off a high wire.\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News\n\n\"I’ve had people come up to me and touch me to see if I’m real,\" Wallenda, 36, says over lunch at a Longhorn Steakhouse near his home in Sarasota, Florida, one afternoon in June. \"People are fascinated by the fact that I could die at any point. They don’t necessarily want me to die, although there’s probably a certain percentage that do, and that’s OK. It doesn’t offend me whatsoever; that’s the reality of what I do. I know that’s gross and scary, but it’s the truth.\" Next to him is his intern, John, 18, a recent graduate of Sarasota's vaunted Sailor Circus, a training school for performers that is part of the town's heritage as the longtime American capital for all things circus-related. (When Wallenda drops in during a summer camp session, he is besieged by young autograph seekers.) John is apprenticing to learn the trade, both on the high wire and off.\n\nWallenda's hair is blonde thinning and swept back and to the side, his boyish face freckled and tattooed a reddish bronze from a life spent under the Florida sun learning how to not fall off of things. He wears, as he almost always wears, a tight T-shirt with a long crucifix necklace over it. He sips an iced tea and gingerly flexes his swollen hand, injured in a home-repair mishap as his new house was being remodeled. Amadaos recently broke his right hand trying to punch through drywall, only to find a stud. \"Accidents come in threes,\" Wallenda sighs. After a couple hundred years as cultural sideshow, funambulism is having an unlikely moment thanks to The Walk, Robert Zemeckis's vertigo-inducing dramatization of Philippe Petit's 1974 renegade tightrope walk between the newly erected Twin Towers, previously chronicled in the Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire. If Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of Petit is the face of this art form as expressionistic, authority-flouting public spectacle, then Wallenda is its pragmatic flip side — careful, law-abiding, part of a long-tail business plan. Nik Wallenda was born Nikolas Troffer, a fluke of societal patronymic bias. But he is a Wallenda by blood and by trade, the standard-bearer of the most hallowed bloodline in circus performer history, the most visible branch on a family tree that looks like kudzu and contains enough shifting alliances and betrayals and clan rivalries to exhaust George R.R. Martin. Wallenda estimates there are as many as 14 of his relatives currently performing around the world. He doesn't speak to many of them. \"When I broke my first record by myself in 2008, for a lot of the headlines, I think it was the New York Times, it was 'King of the High Wire,'\" he says. \"So my managers read this and said, 'We’re going with this, that’s a great title. My family hates that: How dare you call yourself King of the High Wire? It’s a marketing tool! You can put it on the record: I’m definitely not the best wire walker in the world. But as far as business goes? I’m up there with the best for sure.\"\n\nJoe Holloway Jr. / AP Karl Wallenda before his 1970 walk over Georgia's Tallulah Gorge.\n\nKarl Wallenda was the German-born patriarch of The Flying Wallendas, a name coined in the ’40s that he loathed — and not just because it led people to mistake the family for trapeze artists, but because wire walkers don't fly unless they're falling. (The name, in fact, was first used after an accident in Ohio.) Nik Wallenda was born in 1979, the year after Karl Wallenda fell to his death during a walk in San Juan, Puerto Rico. To say that his great-grandfather informs every aspect of his life is underestimating the degree to which family is the dominant force in circus performing, as well as the degree to which Karl Wallenda has defined, and still defines, that tradition. Much of the division among factions is complicated and deep-seated, and most certainly about money, but it comes down to who is most worthy of Karl's legacy, and his valuable surname (which itself has been the subject of numerous legal battles). \"There’s these groups with no leader, so now there’s competition, everyone feels threatened, there's this fight for who’s the patriarch,\" Wallenda says. \"It’s the same lineage, same generations, the same great-grandfather, there’s always been this battle. I say this all the time, but I don’t give a shit who the patriarch is; as long as I’m in the news and making a living, you guys can be the patriarch if you want.\"\n\nCourtesy Nik Wallenda Delilah and Nik Wallenda in 1980.\n\nDelilah Wallenda, 62, is the daughter of Jenny, who was the daughter of Karl and Martha, a ballerina he met when she was 15, married, then soon left. She married Terry Troffer, 60, in 1975. Troffer, who along with his brother Mike oversees the rigging on his son's walks, did not hail from a circus family. He joined the Sailor Circus and became an engineer; you can't be a good wire walker without being a good physicist. Delilah and Troffer performed as the Delilah Wallenda Duo for years. In 1980, Delilah says, they were performing 48 weeks a year, but that started fading around 1986, and what was once a nice living became increasingly untenable. \"The people who ran the circuses started gearing them to children,\" she tells me one afternoon in her backyard, where she occasionally trains aerialists when not managing a local country club. Her 1993 memoir was titled The Last of the Wallendas. (\"She wasn’t happy about the title, but I get it,\" Wallenda says. \"My family sees that as demeaning; I see that as an incredible marketing tool.\")\n\nTom Rhein/Courtesy Nik Wallenda Nik Wallenda and his sister, Lijana.\n\nDespite the diminishing returns, Nik Wallenda and his sister, Lijana, spent their entire lives on the road with their parents performing; he was walking the wire by 2. He had intended to go off to college but in 1998 joined his Uncle Tino as part of a seven-person pyramid, the Wallenda family's signature stunt, in Detroit — where two members of the Wallenda family died and one other was paralyzed performing the same act in 1962 — and never looked back. He says that he and Erendira, eighth generation in another traveling circus family, may have first been in a show together when she was 2 months old (\"It was love at first sight,\" he quips); their families always saw each other, they were part of the same circuits, stayed at the same campgrounds. They married in 2000; 2008 was the first time in her life Erendira wasn't on the road full time. \"I wanted to give my kids a choice to go to school and do the things I wasn't able to,\" says Erendira, 34, who is slated to hang by her toes from a hoop dangling from a helicopter above the Charlotte Motor Speedway in October. \"I miss everything — performing, traveling — but of course it was easier before you had kids in the back screaming and punching each other every second.\"\n\nAP Photo/Richard Sheinwald The Flying Wallendas performing their seven-person pyramid in Detroit in 1998.\n\nIn 2006, Wallenda and his sister, Lijana, did a walk together in Detroit to promote McDonald's new coffee that almost ended badly when Lijana had some trouble on the wire. They made $18,000 for the walk, but more importantly, Wallenda remembers it as an epiphany of sorts, that he could make real money practicing this archaic art, and not from local carnivals or languishing circuses. Soon after, Wallenda says, he got a call from David Blaine, who wanted to meet him — so much of what Wallenda has come to learn about turning traditional entertainment into contemporary, commercial primetime events stems from this, and led to him signing noncircus representation.\n\nJeff Kowalsky/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, after Wallenda had set a few Guinness World Records and made a few Today show appearances, Discovery signed him to do a reality series called Danger by Design, each episode tracing the family members as they planned and performed a stunt in a different locale. The executive who developed the show left the network, and the series was shelved. June 15, 2012, was the night that changed Nik Wallenda's life, or at least his career. About 13 million people tuned into ABC on a Friday night to watch a man that most of them had never heard of before preparing to walk a thin steel wire across Niagara Falls, as Karl Wallenda always talked about wanting to do. They didn't know about the two-year ordeal to make this event happen — how, after the National Parks of Canada unanimously voted against allowing Wallenda to do the walk, he lobbied and lobbied until they unanimously changed their minds. And they didn't know that the safety harness he was made to wear at the last moment was at the intractable insistence of the network. Wallenda was embarrassed and considered canceling; he understood that the appeal of this event lay in potentially watching a man plunge to his death on television, and the harness was negating that risk. Certainly many of them didn't know what to make of Wallenda's frequent and emphatic prayers to Jesus throughout the windy, rainy half-hour walk, in between communicating with his father on the ground and fielding questions from ABC host Josh Elliott. This was not swaggering Evel Knievel in his Stars and Stripes jumpsuit launching himself over Snake River Canyon or Johnny Knoxville strapping himself to an exploding rocket. Nik Wallenda was devout, defiantly square, in the face of extreme danger — dad as daredevil. But they did now know his name. Many viewers, unfamiliar with Wallenda or his background, were instantly taken aback by the vocal, vigorous praying; Wallenda insists that he didn't know his mic was on the whole time and wouldn't have done, and won't do, anything differently. (Numerous comments and tweets noted that taking a drink every time Wallenda mentioned Jesus would prove lethal.) He does admit his managers tried, at one point, to get him to downplay his devoutness for fear of turning off a general audience. \"I didn’t say, 'Jesus' 50 times on that wire because someone told me to or because I was preaching,\" he says. \"That’s where I find my center and my confidence; that’s what keeps me calm and I was stressed out doing that walk. Howard Stern said, 'I’d be praying to Jesus too.' People made light of it but didn’t really make fun of it. I was just at the airport the other day and at whatever time, they had all their carpets out, all the taxi drivers, bowing towards the sun. Or the moon. I’m not sure how they do it. People respect that — that’s who they are and what they do. You don't have to listen. I think people are fascinated to see that's what I do to get through those situations.\" And this, too, is apparently a family tradition. \"I was doing a BBC interview and they played this clip of my great-grandfather talking to God while he was walking the wire. I never knew that, no one ever told me.\" Publicly anyway, he resists tying his faith to politics, itself no small feat at this particular moment. \"I get questions about our president on live national TV,\" he says. \"That’s a rough question to answer but I’m quick, I’ll make it sound good, I’ll work my way out of it.\" By the time he walked across the Grand Canyon in 2013, he wasn't famous exactly, but he was hardly an unknown entity — Discovery says there were 1.3 million tweets about the walk during their broadcast. \"For Niagara Falls, I was the guy who walked across Niagara Falls,\" he says. \"Nik Wallenda walked across the Grand Canyon.\" Danger by Design was retitled Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara in 2012; Discovery aired one episode and canceled the series, airing the remaining episodes just once, in the lead-up to the Grand Canyon walk. \"I think it was a pretty good series,\" he says. \"You know, you always look back and say it could have been produced a little differently.\" The thrill of the circus, or at least of the daredevil, is predicated on the notion that something terrible could happen right before your eyes; without that present threat, there's no real reason to buy a ticket. This is also why Wallenda believes his event specials have been successful in ways that his reality fare has not. \"As an advertiser, you’re not worrying about TiVoing and your numbers are way higher because people are only going to watch this live,\" he says. \"So for a network to sell a Nik Wallenda live special is a lot easier than selling a Nik Wallenda series. I don’t TiVo Nik Wallenda falling — I want to watch it live.\"\n\nJohn Moore / Getty Images Nik Wallenda walking over Niagara Falls in 2012.\n\nWallenda's new home in East Sarasota is about 15 miles and symbolically a world away from the enclave of homes and trailers where his relatives live. \"I have a gate for a reason,\" he says, smiling but not necessarily joking. The house sits on around 15 acres of land and is currently in the throes of a renovation; a separate 20,000-square-foot facility to house equipment as well as a production studio will be built eventually, and the high wire will soon be moved here from his parents' backyard. The family is living here during the construction, even if it means occasionally having to climb through a window and suffering the occasional drywall-related injury. Erendira practices aerial exercises on a hoop called a lyra, tied to the massive live oak tree. (Everyone in the Wallenda orbit seems to be doing something exhausting with their bodies at all times; while waiting for a table outside an Outback Steakhouse in Milwaukee the night before the state fair walk, Blake, the gloriously mutton-chopped 27-year-old son of Delilah's half-sister Tammy, bides time by doing handstands on the heads of two friends standing by the front door.)\n\nSteve Kandell/BuzzFeed News\n\nFor someone who grew up in an RV traveling from show to show, who's married to a woman whose family lived the same way, the notion of not just owning a home without wheels but having the time to stick around and work on it is a luxury that eludes most people who do what he does for a living. He gets to pick the kids up from school every day. It's a point of pride for him. \"I think that’s a brand in itself,\" he says. \"That blows people away, like, That’s the guy who does that? He’s still with his wife and spends time with his kids? People expect the daredevil with tattoos who’s in the bar late at night with a different woman every other night, always chasing something. I would love to grow my brand even bigger than that, to a Ryan Seacrest level where, you know, I’m trying to get into other things.\" One show in development is a Mike Rowe–like reality series in which Wallenda would do a different dangerous job every week. He also wants to produce and host a kid-friendly game show à la Double Dare. \"I think we need one again for Saturday mornings like we had when I was a kid. Kids need that.\"\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News The Wallenda family at the Wisconsin State Fair. From left: Yanni, Erendira, Amadaos, Nik, Delilah, and Evita.\n\nWhen he talks about money, about his business acumen, about his brand, it doesn't seem as if he means to lord it over his peers and relatives who have not been as fortunate, but rather to remind how financially ruined and culturally eclipsed his profession has become, and what has been required to transcend that tradition while still honoring it. In April, I watched Wallenda walk atop the new Orlando Eye Ferris wheel, the main attraction at the grand opening of the city's new shopping center and 4D theater, broadcast live on the Today show. For this — a few minutes of strolling that would kill nearly any other human alive, accompanied by a couple days of international press — he pocketed $125,000. The house is currently in some disarray due to the construction, so we sit in Wallenda's office. A framed poster for Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth adorns a wall. Wallenda wants to not save just the circus as a tradition and as a viable business model, but rehabilitate the very word: It connotes chaos and distraction, clowns and carnies; a media circus is never good. But historically, circuses have been paragons of efficiency and expediency and entrepreneurship. An entire wing of the Ringling Bros. museum in Sarasota features a giant model detailing the logistics of trains coming into town full of humans and animals and unloading and setting up a self-sufficient community unto itself and then packing it all up and doing it all over again on an expanse of dry land in some other town. There is real order. There should be respect. \"When you go to the ballet, you wear a suit, and when you go to the circus, you wear shorts,\" Wallenda says. \"That's the circus's fault, in my opinion, for not making it as relevant as it should be. In Europe they wear suits and ties.\" One afternoon in Sarasota, we attend a matinee of the Summer Circus Spectacular that is indeed a casual affair. The crowd largely comprises families and is enthusiastic — no one more so than the teenage girl behind us who didn't stop shrieking in laughter throughout. Afterward, Wallenda gives a sober assessment: He thought the clown was trying too hard, cataloged an acrobat troupe's nervous tics, felt a little bad for the aging aerialist legend. Generally, performers in a circus like this might be making $750 a week, barely enough to cover the cost of the campsite where their trailer is parked. Yet he reserved high praise for the two foot-juggling brothers whom he speculated may be able to pull in $150,000 a year each performing around the world — they do something unique. Wallenda's dream is to not just make the circus cool, as he puts it, but to have his own — touring 30 to 40 weeks a year, that Erendira and Delilah can perform in regularly. \"Doing these walks is awesome, but performing in a one-ring tent, it's like when big movie stars go back to Broadway,\" he says. \"I have to build this huge brand in order to get back to where I want to be. And now I have a brand name; I am the Wal-Mart or McDonald's of our industry.\" \"From an industry standpoint, he's brought more popularity to it and a lot more people are realizing the significance of live entertainment as opposed to looking at something on YouTube,\" Blake tells me over lunch one afternoon. \"It's tough to get young people to go out and see a live show, but they see something like [Nik] and they see the energy.\"\n\nCourtesy Discovery Nik Wallenda crossing the Grand Canyon in 2013.\n\nFinding bigger and more exotic locales to walk has now become Wallenda's calling card. He has been trying to figure out how to walk between Malaysia's Petronas Towers, but the problem is finding cranes tall enough for the rigging. He wants to re-create, move for move, Karl Wallenda's most famous walk, some 700 feet above Tallulah Gorge in Georgia in 1970, as a split screen alongside a hologram of Karl doing it, but might need two years to put that together. \"That's how long it will take to get the funding and the sponsorships. I think it’ll cost somewhere between $500,000 and a million to do.\" (Some of Wallenda's relatives have speculated that he won't really be able to properly ape his great-grandfather's walk because he can't do a headstand on the wire like Karl did.)\n\n\"It’s about settings, it’s about world’s tallest, it’s about walking over the Serengeti, the Nile River full of crocodiles, it’s about walking over an active volcano,\" he explains as workers install hardwood floors outside the closed door. \"The Colosseum in Rome with lions underneath me, it’s about the pyramids in Egypt. It’s about doing amazing things and showing the world amazing things that they may not be able to get onto a plane and go see.\" The Walk is a two-hour meditation on the singular mind-set that compels people to do this, as well as on the intricacies of rigging a steel cable, but the man who inspired it wants nothing to do with his contemporary. Philippe Petit had planned to cross the Grand Canyon around the same spot — some of the rigging he was preparing for his walk is still installed at the site, abandoned — and was less than pleased when Wallenda did the walk himself.\n\nAlan Welner / Associated Press Philippe Petit walks between New York's Twin Towers in 1974.\n\n“Now, if that person was another artist with a creative soul and was making a magnificent crossing there, then maybe my anger would turn into some kind of respect,\" Petit said in 2013, just before Wallenda's Grand Canyon event. \"But I know the person who will walk there soon will just get — well, why not be cruel? — get his ass across, as they say sometimes in America, and nothing else... I don't know why people say he has guts, whoa, he has nerve, whoa — I don't think they were inspired. Certainly, I was not inspired because he was an uninspiring actor. I'm not impressed when I see something dangerous or something technically complex.” \"Philippe Petit is not a Nik Wallenda fan; he’s had nothing but horrible things to say about me,\" Wallenda says, smiling. \"He’s an artiste, I’m not a true artist and so on and so forth. There’s a lot of animosity there. He's an arrogant Frenchman.\" Wallenda cops to occasionally appearing to slip or wobble for the sake of adding drama; it is hard to imagine the Petit portrayed on screen willingly sacrificing gracefulness. Yet Wallenda respects his hustle: Petit's memoir about the Twin Towers caper was published a year after the World Trade Center collapse. \"People didn’t know who he was until all of a sudden he started capitalizing on it, which is smart, brilliant. My hat’s off to anybody who can market. He created a storyline and got an Oscar for it.\" We watch the trailer for The Walk on the iMac in his office, and it's clear that the movie's agenda isn't just to cement Petit's authority-flaunting folk-hero legend, but to re-create, in full IMAX glory, the sensation Petit has described, the rush that drives people to walk the wire. On this at least, the two men agree. \"There’s something about being up there that makes you feel alive, it makes you feel free,\" he says. \"Petit talks about that so I relate in a big way. You feel limitless. You feel invincible at times. It's surreal.\"\n\nSteve Kandell / BuzzFeed News\n\nFrom the high-wire platform in the backyard of Wallenda's parents' home, 25 feet above the ground, you can see a dozen ranch homes and trailers, many of which have some sort of Wallenda living in them. The house directly next door is the home of Delilah's brother Tino, now estranged from Wallenda; a big green storage locker emblazoned with a Wallenda logo sits in his backyard. Many of the houses have trapezes or wires or circus equipment. Two terriers, Lucy and Maggie, roam the backyard.\n\nAs opposed to nearly any crowd-pleasing death-defying act, there is something uniquely relatable about walking a tightrope — it's just walking in a straight line, we've all done it. There is not a huge range of results if things go wrong, you cannot only fall a little bit. \"I’ve lost seven family members and I think four or five of them were only 30 feet off the ground,\" Wallenda says. \"The death is the same.\" The elevated wire in the backyard, then, is not necessarily for the practicing of craft — that is done just across the yard on a wire of similar length, all of two feet off the ground, where the margin of error performance-wise is identical but the consequences manageable. Up here is for psychological conditioning, for learning to not care. On the lower wire, Delilah walks behind John, Wallenda's intern, as he crosses the wire, helping him adjust how he's holding the pole, which weighs about 40 pounds. I try standing on the wire while holding the pole and don't last two seconds; the pole feels impossibly heavy and awkward, the steel cable burrows into the bottom of my sock-covered feet, my inherited eye-hand coordination is decidedly not the caliber of Wallenda DNA. John is one of two trainees at the moment; Delilah generally spends her mornings training, then works afternoons and nights at the country club. Blake is also there practicing.\n\nSteve Kandell / BuzzFeed News\n\nBlake is one of Wallenda's closest associates and protégés, but his mother has been in a now-settledlegal battle with Wallenda over his grandmother Jenny's house that even made TMZ. With Wallenda's growing profile comes a brighter light on the kinds of squabbles that have been part of his family for generations; he claims this one contributed to his estrangement from his Uncle Tino, Delilah's brother and next-door neighbor. \"It needed to be restored, she had 13 years of back taxes, I was the only one who could help, so I did it,\" he says. \"They all want the house; I want my money back that I put into the house. So, long story short, Tino, I’ve always looked up to him, but we had this meeting a month ago and I was in tears, I loved him, he was my hero growing up, but there’s a lot of resentment and a lot of hard feelings. I think a lot of that stems from the success.\" His most ardent critic is probably Karl's grandson Ricky, a fellow performing Wallenda. \"It would be a Jerry Springer show if we all came together in any one place,\" Ricky says. He admits the attention surrounding Wallenda's walks have been good for business but overshadow others' contributions to the family legacy. His biggest gripe, though, may be that his Barnumesque flourishes of self-promotion are at odds with his declared piousness. \"I don't lie in my marketing and he does. One of Jesus's commandments is 'Don't bear false witness.' I don't have to be called the King of the High Wire; I'll call myself Rick Wallenda, Karl Wallenda's grandson.\" During dinner at an Italian restaurant in Sarasota weeks before the Wisconsin State Fair walk, Wallenda and his wife and two sons and his father and Blake and a couple family friends sit around a large round table as servers bring out plate after plate, all on the house. A framed photo of Wallenda walking a high wire over Sarasota hangs on the wall behind him. \"That other side of the family, their goal is to destroy me over themselves winning, or getting better,\" Wallenda says. \"That is winning to them. If they spent as much focusing on their own career, they'd be a lot better.\" He occasionally gets agitated referencing past stories about him that delved into the family melodrama, but he brings up the schisms unprompted and often. It's hard not to wonder whether he considers the strife and his role as a lightning rod as much a part of his brand as his accomplishments and his marketability. He defines himself by how he differs from others with his name, because who else can he really compare himself to?\n\nAnd the resentment isn't just from within the family. \"Nik's not blowing his own horn,\" Troffer says. \"When he crossed Niagara Falls, this circus industry fell silent. Not, 'Wow, that was great.' They were so incredibly jealous.\" Wallenda leans forward. \"When we're on the wire performing the seven-person pyramid and the lights flicker on and off...\" He raises his eyebrows. \"That's how much jealousy there is in the industry.\" \"The business model I raised my kids with, there's no way that's survivable in today's market,\" Troffer continues. \"The saying in the business is, 'How do you make a small fortune in the circus? Start with a large one.' Nik showed up with a team and a business plan where most performers — and I'll include myself in that — operated under a model that was created over 200 years ago and doesn't work. I can't imagine making a living.\" Wallenda says the Niagara Falls walk in 2012 cost $1.1 million, with upwards of $30,000 out of his own pocket — he didn't make any money on it. But the dividends are still paying as he continues to forge a path both inside and outside of the business's traditional infrastructure, to keep his name in lights. An endorsement deal with a major camera company will soon be announced. There will be more and bigger walks, subsidized by smaller ones — Grand Canyons and grand openings. There will be live televised one-off events from dramatic locations and more modest attempts at making Nik Wallenda a regular part of our lives. There will be members of his family and his community who will continue to paint him as an archenemy. None of that will dent him. \"David Copperfield, that's who I want to be,\" Wallenda says. \"He's a kid who grew up liking magic and now he's a billionaire. Not from investments, from magic.\" Moreover, he considers this goal within reach — each deal signed is a step toward it. \"I don't know how to say it without sounding arrogant, but I'm to a point where I don't think anyone in my industry has ever been. I think that's fair to say: the biggest name ever.\"\n\nDarren Hauck for BuzzFeed News",

The vast majority of us don’t spend much time thinking about global population issues, but for many among the elite it is an absolute obsession. Many of them truly believe that you are ruining their planet and they desperately want you to stop reproducing so much. Among the elite, the belief that the world is grossly overpopulated and that this is causing most of our major global problems crosses all political, cultural and social boundaries. This philosophy is taught as gospel at the vast majority of all colleges and universities on the planet, and it is being relentlessly pushed by the United Nations, the WHO, the World Bank and national governments all over the globe. When most people think of “overpopulation”, they think of places such as India, but the truth is that those of us living in America are considered to be the worst offenders because our lifestyles are “polluting” the planet so rapidly. In fact, one scientist recently estimated that a child born in the United States has a “carbon legacy” 55 times greater than a child born in India. The elite are convinced that if they can reduce the global population far enough and get the remaining people living on earth to switch over to “sustainable lifestyles” that they will be able to save “their” planet. But the draconian measures that would be necessary to achieve this dystopian dream would not be very palatable to the vast majority of us. In fact, if the most radical population control advocates get their way, we will experience global tyranny on a scale never seen before.\n\nRight now, most of us living in the western world are not prepared to accept “forced” population control measures and the global elite know this. But the truth is that they absolutely love what is going on right now in places such as China.\n\nIn China today, a one child policy is strictly enforced, and women are literally pulled from their homes and taken to abortion clinics when they are found to be in violation. The following example comes from a recent CNN article….\n\nWhen Ji Yeqing awakened, she was already in the recovery room. Chinese authorities had dragged her out of her home and down four flights of stairs, she said, restraining and beating her husband as he tried to come to her aid. They whisked her into a clinic, held her down on a bed and forced her to undergo an abortion. Her offense? Becoming pregnant with a second child, in violation of China’s one-child policy.\n\nSo does the international community condemn China for such actions?\n\nNo, in fact the United Nations gives China awards for their population reduction policies.\n\nIn the western world, there are also great efforts underway to reduce family sizes and to get women to choose not to have children. But these efforts are always “voluntary”. We are told that if women are “empowered” that they will always choose to have fewer children.\n\nBut many radical environmentalists are openly complaining that these voluntary methods are not getting the job done fast enough.\n\nFor example, the following is from a recent article by Julia Whitty for Mother Jones….\n\nThe only known solution to ecological overshoot is to decelerate our population growth faster than it’s decelerating now and eventually reverse it—at the same time we slow and eventually reverse the rate at which we consume the planet’s resources. Success in these twin endeavors will crack our most pressing global issues: climate change, food scarcity, water supplies, immigration, health care, biodiversity loss, even war. On one front, we’ve already made unprecedented strides, reducing global fertility from an average 4.92 children per woman in 1950 to 2.56 today—an accomplishment of trial and sometimes brutally coercive error, but also a result of one woman at a time making her individual choices. The speed of this childbearing revolution, swimming hard against biological programming, rates as perhaps our greatest collective feat to date. But it’s not enough. And it’s still not fast enough. Faced with a world that can support either a lot of us consuming a lot less or far fewer of us consuming more, we’re deadlocked: individuals, governments, the media, scientists, environmentalists, economists, human rights workers, liberals, conservatives, business and religious leaders.\n\nFor radicals such as Whitty, things are never moving fast enough. They truly believe that humanity is destroying the planet and that they are literally attempting to “save the world” by pushing for global population control.\n\nBut this kind of thinking is not just reflected in the writings of a few radicals.\n\nThe truth is that “scientific reports” advocating global population control are regularly featured in the most important newspapers all over the planet.\n\nThe following example comes from a recent article in the Guardian….\n\nWorld population needs to be stabilised quickly and high consumption in rich countries rapidly reduced to avoid “a downward spiral of economic and environmental ills”, warns a major report from the Royal Society. Contraception must be offered to all women who want it and consumption cut to reduce inequality, says the study published on Thursday, which was chaired by Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston. The assessment of humanity’s prospects in the next 100 years, which has taken 21 months to complete, argues strongly that to achieve long and healthy lives for all 9 billion people expected to be living in 2050, the twin issues of population and consumption must be pushed to the top of political and economic agendas.\n\nWhen was the last time that you saw an article that was 100% opposed to global population control featured in an important newspaper?\n\nSadly, this population control agenda has a complete stranglehold on the scientific community. The philosophy that the earth is massively overpopulated and that this overpopulation is causing most of our biggest problems is considered to be gospel at most of our colleges and universities today.\n\nIf you question this orthodoxy, you risk being academically blackballed.\n\nNot only that, but the scientific community considers the biggest offenders of all to be Americans because of our “excessive” lifestyles.\n\nFor example, just check out what statistician Paul Murtaugh of Oregon State University said a while back….\n\n“Using United Nations projections of fertility, and projecting statistically through the lifespan of the mother’s line—some lineages being short-lived, others indefinitely long—an American child born today adds an average 10,407 tons of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of her mother. That’s almost six times more CO 2 than the mother’s own lifetime emissions. Furthermore, the ecological costs of that child and her children far outweigh even the combined energy-saving choices from all a mother’s other good decisions, like buying a fuel-efficient car, recycling, using energy-saving appliances and lightbulbs. The carbon legacy of one American child and her offspring is 20 times greater than all those other sustainable maternal choices combined.”\n\nMurtaugh also believes that a child born in the United States has a “carbon legacy” that is 55 times greater than that of a child born in India.\n\nThis helps to explain why the elite are so obsessed with abortion and “family planning”.\n\nThe elite are desperate to convince you to stop reproducing.\n\nThey truly believe that they are helping to “save the world” when they convince us to have less children.\n\nIn fact, the amount of money that is being spent to promote “family planning” around the globe is absolutely staggering.\n\nFor example, according to a recent MarketWatch article Bill and Melinda Gates plan to spend 4 billion dollars to get contraceptive devices into the hands of 120 million more women by the year 2020….\n\nMelinda Gates recently announced a “new crusade” for her $32 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A recent Newsweek interview with Michelle Goldberg says it’s a “decision that is likely to change lives all over the planet.” Gates has “decided to make family planning her signature issue,” by investing “billions to revolutionize contraception worldwide,” with substantial economic consequences. The Gates decision will “be hugely significant for American women.” She’s “pouring money into the long-neglected field of contraceptive research, seeking entirely new methods of birth control,” a “whole new class of drugs,” some that could even work without hormones, and others, might be implantable devises that never need to be removed, can even be turned on and off by the woman.\n\nWhile Bill and Melinda Gates portray their population control efforts as “humanitarian endeavors”, others among the global elite are more open about what they consider the “endgame” to be.\n\nThe following examples are from a recent article by Paul Joseph Watson….\n\n– Finnish environmentalist guru Pentti Linkola, publicly called for climate change deniers be “re-educated” in eco-gulags and that the vast majority of humans be killed with the rest enslaved and controlled by a green police state, with people forcibly sterilized, cars confiscated and travel restricted to members of the elite. – Another Finnish environmentalist writer, Martin Kreiggeist, hails Linkola’s call for eco-gulags and oppression as “a solution,” calling for people to “take up the axes” in pursuit of killing off the third world. Kreiggeist wants fellow eco-fascists to “act on” Linkola’s call for mass murder in order to solve overpopulation. – In 2010, James Lovelock, the creator of the Gaia hypothesis, told the Guardian that “democracy must be put on hold” to combat global warming and that “a few people with authority” should be allowed to run the planet because people were too stupid to be allowed to steer their own destinies.\n\nThere are a surprising number of people out there that actually advocate for mass murder and mass enslavement for the good of the planet.\n\nDave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First, once stated that reducing the global population to 100 million people is one of his three main goals….\n\n“My three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness, with it’s full complement of species, returning throughout the world.”\n\nSadly, this philosophy has even infected the U.S. government. The truth is that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have been spent to promote population control around the globe, and it hasn’t mattered much whether Republicans or Democrats were in the White House. The following is an excerpt from an article entitled “The Population Control Holocaust” by Robert Zubrin…..\n\nOf the billions of taxpayer dollars that the U.S. government has expended on population control abroad, a portion has been directly spent by USAID on its own field activities, but the majority has been laundered through a variety of international agencies. As a result of this indirect funding scheme, all attempts to compel the population control empire to conform its activities to accepted medical, ethical, safety, or human rights norms have proven futile. Rather, in direct defiance of laws enacted by Congress to try to correct the situation, what has and continues to be perpetrated at public expense is an atrocity on a scale so vast and varied as to almost defy description. Nevertheless, it is worth attempting to convey to readers some sense of the evil that is being done with their money.\n\nIf you have not read the rest of that article yet, you really should. You can find the rest of that article right here.\n\nAt this point, nearly every major international organization is involved in these population control efforts to at least some degree.\n\nFor example, a recent article by Jurriaan Maessen detailed how the World Bank is actually using “financial assistance” as leverage to get developing nations to conform to the global population control agenda….\n\nAccording to two subsequent documents put out by the World Bank, its guidelines dictate that in order to qualify for World Bank lending, sovereign nations must implement population reduction objectives as outlined by the World Bank and UN Population Fund. If they refuse, lending will be withdrawn. Already pre-tested and implemented in Yemen and Niger, these guidelines are destined for global implementation within the next decade, says the World Bank.\n\nIsn’t that sick?\n\nLater in that same article, Maessen discusses how the UN, the WHO, the World Bank and many other international organizations all work together to move this twisted agenda forward….\n\nReturning to the essence, the intention and the strategy leave little for the imagination: a global consensus is in place between all the major transnational institutions and banks: the earth’s population must be brought down, with all means necessary. The World Bank uses financial tools to bring nations on their knees, demanding they cull their numbers; the UN guarantees the political legitimizing for these depopulation policies (Agenda 21); the Foundations develop the anti-fertility vaccines and GM Food, the World Health Organization takes care of the “health-standards” and distribution. With the help of this global construct, carefully coordinated from the top-down, the scientific dictatorship has circled the wagons around all of free humanity.\n\nSadly, there is so much more that could be said about all of this. If you are interested in learning more about the disgusting population control agenda of the global elite, the following are 10 more articles I would recommend checking out….\n\n#1 “They Love Death”\n\n#2 “From 7 Billion People To 500 Million People – The Sick Population Control Agenda Of The Global Elite”\n\n#3 “Al Gore, Agenda 21 And Population Control”\n\n#4 “The Green Agenda Is About Getting Rid Of As Many Humans As Possible”\n\n#5 “Governments Around The World Are Eagerly Adopting The Strict Population Control Agenda Of The United Nations”\n\n#6 “Yes, They Really Do Want To Reduce The Population – 22 Shocking Population Control Quotes From The Global Elite That Will Make You Want To Lose Your Lunch”\n\n#7 “One Less Child? Environmental Extremists Warn That Overpopulation Is Causing Climate Change And Will Ultimately Destroy The Earth”\n\n#8 “Hillary Clinton: Population Control Will Now Become The Centerpiece Of U.S. Foreign Policy”\n\n#9 “New U.N. Report: We Must Reduce The Population To Fight Climate Change”\n\n#10 “To The Global Elite The Math Is Simple: Human Overpopulation Is Causing Climate Change So The Solution To Climate Change Is Population Control”\n\nThis population control agenda is not going away any time soon.\n\nIn fact, thanks to endless propaganda in the media, it is winning over more hearts and minds with each passing day.\n\nJust ask some of your friends what they think. If you are like most Americans, it is almost inevitable that you will have some friends that believe in global population control.\n\nAnd without a doubt there will be readers that leave comments at the end of this article supporting the population control agenda of the global elite.\n\nThe idea that humanity is ruining the planet and that we need to dramatically reduce our numbers is being relentlessly pushed today. Millions upon millions of people all over the world have bought into this lie hook, line and sinker.\n\nUltimately, this philosophy will lead us down a path that will end in absolute global tyranny.\n\nSo what do you think about this issue?

  "latent_7856": "Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is threatening retaliatory measures against Ontario if it doesn't drop protectionist rules that favour local firms bidding for infrastructure contracts, complicating provincial efforts for freer trade across the country.\n\nThe two provinces appear to be heading for a showdown at the premiers' Council of the Federation meeting in Charlottetown this week over the issue.\n\nMr. Wall told The Globe and Mail that his government will \"react … and level the playing field for our companies\" if Ontario does not change its local preference rules, which he says gives Ontario companies as much as a 10-per-cent competitive advantage.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"If we can't get improvement on that front we are not going to be Boy Scouts about that in Saskatchewan,\" he warned.\n\nMr. Wall is pushing for the dismantling of interprovincial trade barriers that cost the Canadian economy billions of dollars every year. He is presenting his plan, which includes taking aim at Ontario's local preference rules, for open provincial borders Thursday.\n\nBarriers exist in many sectors, including energy, labour, transportation and procurement.\n\nInfrastructure Ontario, the agency that handles billions of dollars in construction each year, favours companies that have \"local knowledge\" in doling out contracts – a rule that gives a leg up to Ontario-based firms.\n\nMr. Wall's stand will come as no surprise to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, he says, as his officials have been talking to her people about these protectionist rules.\n\nOntario is attempting to pull itself out of economic doldrums through massive infrastructure spending. Ms. Wynne, who believes the economic policy will create jobs and stimulating the economy, allocated $130-billion for infrastructure in her July budget.\n\nThe province Tuesday showed no sign of backing down in the face of Mr. Wall's demands, defending Infrastructure Ontario's protectionist rules.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"When it comes to infrastructure procurement, our government believes that experience working with local firms is important because of the local job creation that comes with new infrastructure,\" Ontario Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid wrote in an e-mail. \"This approach is in line with existing trade agreements and it helps create even more jobs in communities across Ontario.\"\n\nOntario has fought hard to maintain the \"local knowledge\" provision: The province even gained a special exemption in Canada's free-trade deal with the European Union that allows Infrastructure Ontario and municipal governments to give priority to local companies.\n\nProponents of freer trade say Ontario is among the most protectionist provinces and is crucial to any nationwide loosening of trade restrictions.\n\n\"If Ontario doesn't lay down some of its arms, we can kiss goodbye any progress on internal trade for some time,\" Canadian Federation of Independent Business President Dan Kelly said in an interview.\n\nAnd he cautioned that matters would only get worse if Saskatchewan punished Ontario's intransigence by taking protectionist measures of its own.\n\n\"It would be a disaster if we saw retaliatory measures cropping up across Canada,\" he said. \"I understand Premier Wall's frustration, but the worst thing that could happen is to have more trade barriers slapped on.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Wall says, however, that if Ontario does not move on this issue that his government will \"have to consider every option.\"\n\n\"One of them might be the same sort of 10-per-cent head start for our companies,\" he said, adding that the measure would be limited to Ontario as it is a province \"engaged\" in this protectionist practice.\n\n\"But we are hopeful that will change,\" he said.\n\n\"After all of these decades, the issue of whether freer trade and freer procurement is better than protectionism, not perfect, but better than protectionism – the argument, I think for the most part, has been settled.\"\n\nHe says that in his province, the opposition NDP, for example, was once opposed to free trade but is now onside, as is federal NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair.\n\n\"So now at the provincial level … some perhaps want to defy what I think has been accepted by people of all parts of the political spectrum as to what might be better for the economy,\" he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Wall believes, however, that progress has been made so far on the internal trade file since he proposed the new plan in July. He and the other Western premiers sent a letter to their provincial colleagues calling for a \"commitment\" at the Charlottetown meeting to modernize the 20-year-old Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT).\n\nAt the time, Mr. Wall said that under the new international trade agreements negotiated by the federal government, it will be \"easier for a European country to get involved in some provincial procurement than it would be for companies from another province.\"\n\nUnder his proposed reforms, provinces would start from the premise that everything is open and then negotiate what should not be included in the agreement.\n\nThere would be stronger enforcement provisions, as well, giving some recourse to businesses bidding for contracts who felt that they were unfairly treated by another government.",
  "latent_7930": "Rare, as a wise friend noted, is the cultural pendulum that swings so hard and sharp it hits people smack in their foreheads and all but knocks them out cold.\n\nBut that’s precisely what happened in a criminal courtroom at Old City Hall in Toronto Thursday where Ontario Court Judge Marvin Zuker found former York University graduate student Mustafa Ururyar guilty of sexually assaulting another, Mandi Gray, in the wee hours of Jan. 31, 2015.\n\nTo scattered titters of pleased surprise at first and finally to applause, the judge also seemed to be trying to blow every so-called “rape myth” to smithereens and set right what he clearly sees as society’s failure, and perhaps the justice system’s, to deal better with the issue.\n\nIn the result, his judgment sometimes sounded as if borrowed from a college course on feminist thinking.\n\n“For much of our history,” Zuker wrote, and this was but one passage from a decision that ran to 179 pages that he read aloud, “the ‘good’ rape victim, the ‘credible’ rape victim has been a dead one.”\n\nAt another point, he said, “There are many misguided conceptions of what constitutes a ‘real’ rape or how a ‘real’ victim of sexual violence should behave (i.e. scream, struggle to the utmost and report immediately).\n\n“No matter how sophisticated the law is, any allegation that derogates from the stereotype is likely to be approached with a degree of suspicion.”\n\nThe judge entitled the last section of his decision “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” the title of an autobiography by the late American writer and poet Maya Angelou. It may also have been a nod to Gray herself, who has a tattoo of a caged bird on one arm.\n\nThe reference was greeted with delighted cries from several in the predominantly young, female audience, who immediately recognized it.\n\n“Rape in the case of Maya Angelou is used to reflect the suffering of her race, and to (her) a bird struggling to escape its cage, trying to understand and respect both her body and her words,” the judge explained for those less well-read.\n\n“Virginia Woolf suffered from what she called ‘looking-glass shame,’ an aversion to seeing herself in mirrors.\n\n“How do we understand our own sufferings, with what words and to what ends?” Zuker asked. “Going (to one hospital and then another, as Gray did), waiting 48 hours? 72 hours to go to the police? Is too long ever too long? Does pain have a time limit? … Mr. Ururyar raped Ms Gray …\n\n“Rape it surely was,” he said.\n\nThe 29-year-old Ururyar, who now lives in Vancouver, returns to court Monday when prosecutor Jennifer Lofft will attempt to persuade Zuker that Uruyar’s bail should be revoked pending his Oct. 24 sentencing.\n\n“The presumption of innocence is no longer operating,” Lofft told the judge. “He’s a convicted rapist now.”\n\nFor her part, the 28-year-old Gray wasn’t in court as Zuker delivered his verdict but showed up after the lunch break.\n\nAs befits a newfound activist, Gray steadfastly refused to appear remotely mollified by the verdict.\n\nAs befits a newfound activist — she testified she became one only after she reported the assault to Toronto police — Gray steadfastly refused to appear remotely mollified by the verdict.\n\nIn a written statement, she slammed the detectives on her case, demanded the police role in sexual assault investigations be “reconsidered and eventually abolished” and said, “My case is not a demonstration of achieving ‘justice’ or that the legal system is working to meet the needs of the sexually assaulted or even prevent future sexual assaults.”\n\nShe admitted she was “lucky” in the prosecutor and judge assigned to her case, whom she praised, but gave most of the credit to her independent lawyer, David Butt, and her own “numerous and intersecting privileges” — that she is a “white, heterosexual woman in my late 20s with a graduate level education and an in-depth knowledge of the legal system … what can be drawn from my experience is that if I am drowning in these systems, what does that mean for those who are not university educated white women who are sexually assaulted?”\n\nThe two had met and began sleeping together about two weeks before the assault, she a graduate student in sociology and a teaching assistant, he a first-year PhD student in political science.\n\nFittingly, they first met at a CUPE meeting where members voted in favour of a strike.\n\nUruryar, who testified in his own defence, admitted he and Gray had sex, but said it was consensual — and that, in fact, it was Gray who had been the aggressor, sending him a text earlier that night inviting him to join her at a bar to “Drink and then we can have hot sex.”\n\nUruryar said, in a story the judge ridiculed, that Gray embarrassed him by groping his thigh. He testified he was worried about his girlfriend, with whom he had an “open” relationship while she lived in Montreal, would find out.\n\nAs the judge said, in a summary of that bit of evidence, “Ms. Gray didn’t know why the union would care, everyone slept with everyone in that union.”\n\nZuker was bitingly dismissive of Ururyar’s explanation, saying no fewer than seven times, “It never happened this way,” and “His version, and I stress his version, without reality. It never, never happened.” He even characterized Gray’s alleged advances as Ururyar trying to turn the tables, and portray himself as a victim of her sexual aggression.\n\nAnd of the “hot sex” text, the judge said, “We don’t even know what the phrase ‘hot sex’ means.”\n\nThat may have been a florid phrase too many; as the judiciary is wont to say, on its face, sir, most of us know exactly what it means.\n\n• Email: cblatchford@postmedia.com | Twitter: blatchkiki",

  "latent_8180": "Politics makes for strange bedfellows, and so does the ongoing disruption of the cable-television universe. A case in point is the news that Comcast and Netflix have signed a deal that would make the streaming service available through the cable company’s X1 set-top boxes. It’s the first time Netflix will be distributed directly by Comcast’s network, and is expected to be available later this year.\n\nOne of the things that makes this arrangement surprising—or at least would have if it had occurred a year or two ago—is that Comcast and Netflix used to be seen as bitter enemies.\n\nThe enmity between the two started way back in 2010, when Comcast and Blockbuster launched a competitor to Netflix’s DVD-rental business (the service went nowhere and Blockbuster has since gone bankrupt). Then in 2014, Comcast forced Netflix to pay a fee to have its shows distributed on the cable network, triggering a heated battle over whether this was a breach of net neutrality.\n\nComcast said the fee was justified because Netflix accounted for a huge proportion of the data on its network. The streaming service paid the charges, but argued to the Federal Communications Commission that charging such fees was improper for a company with so much market power.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAlthough it agreed to pay the cable company, Netflix ultimately won the battle: The FCC said last year that it was prepared to hear complaints about such “interconnection” fees charged by cable providers as part of its investigation into new net neutrality rules.\n\nIn fact, some believe that a proposed $45-billion merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable was torpedoed in part because of lobbying by Netflix about the dangers of having a single company with so much control.\n\nEven without this history of bad blood between two companies, however, there is ample reason for Netflix and Comcast to be adversaries. The streaming service is widely seen as the future of television-style content, and cable networks are seen as the past—a cozy oligopoly whose days are numbered. Many “cord cutters” have tossed their subscriptions completely in favor of streaming shows via Netflix and other services.\n\nSo why would Comcast suddenly decide to cut a deal to carry Netflix? In part, it’s a rear-guard maneuver. The cable giant knows some people have given up its service—or are thinking about doing so—in favor of Netflix. So why not play ball with the enemy in order to keep some of them connected as long as possible?\n\nEven if large numbers of subscribers bail on their cable subscription in favor of streaming via services like Netflix and Hulu (and there is some debate about whether this is occurring or not), Comcast can still get some revenue from those who remain via its high-priced Xfinity boxes.\n\nApple has its sights set on Netflix. Watch:\n\nIn addition, Comcast has no doubt seen the writing on the wall when it comes to the FCC’s approach to the set-top market. Chairman Tom Wheeler has said his commission wants to break open the cable-box monopoly and allow other services access to the devices, so the Netflix deal may be an attempt to get in front of that.\n\nAlthough the deal between the two former enemies was widely described as a ground-breaking move for the cable company, Netflix’s share price (NFLX) didn’t really move much on the news, climbing by about 1.2%. In part, that’s likely because investors assume most Comcast subscribers who want Netflix already have it, and therefore any bump from the arrangement would be minimal. The stock was also hit by a downgrade from one Wall Street analyst, so the Comcast news just brought it back to even.\n\nFor Comcast, meanwhile, the deal might mean a moderate amount of extra Xfinity revenue, and a slowing down of the cord-cutting effect. But it’s not really going to change the long-term trend for the company, which is probably why its stock price (CMCSA) didn’t see much action on the news either.",

He said he counted 60 bodies scattered around after the insurgents left. Most have since been buried by the villagers, he said.\n\nIn a separate assault, insurgents killed eight people at a teacher training college in the remote village of Dikwa on Wednesday, witnesses said.\n\n“They entered at night. They killed my brother Madu. The insurgents shot him in front of his wife and two sons. Then they shot them, too,” Yakubu Saleh said, choking back tears over the telephone.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan ordered extra troops into northeast Nigeria last May to try to crush the rebels, the biggest security threat to Africa’s top oil producer.\n\nBut the rebels have retreated into the remote, hilly Gwoza area, bordering Cameroon, from where they have stepped up their campaign, mounting deadly attacks against security forces and civilians they accuse of being pro-government.",

We applied that data per capita for each city to determine which cities were the biggest purchasers of romantic titles,” said Keller.\n\nGranted, some of the most romantic cities in the country might also be buying the fewest products on Amazon, which would skew the results of the study.

  "latent_8577": "Sometimes the news rags just can’t believe their luck when some poor fool serves up a headline softball, begging to be hit out of the park to the sound of braying public calling for someone’s head. Yesterday delivered.\n\nIn a session of the House of Councillors Commission on the Constitution, house member Kazuya Maruyama (丸山 和也) put ‘Barack Obama’ and ‘slave’ into the same passage of speech. D’oh!\n\nThe quotes (or translations) vary:\n\n\"Now the United States has a black president. (He) is of black origin. That means slaves,\" The Mainichi\n\n\"In the United States, a black man has become its president. I mean, he is in a bloodline of black people, who were slaves,\" JIJ PRESS\n\nThe context of Maruyama’s remarks isn’t abundantly clear, although he seems to have been talking about the prospect of Japan becoming a 51st state of the United States (I wonder how many countries are competing for that title) and that, constitutionally, this could allow people from the “state of Japan” to become U.S. president. He then went on to talk about President Obama and slaves. Sounds like they were having a productive session then.\n\nToday, news sources are reporting that Maruyama has apologized for his remarks, hilariously, after reviewing the minutes of the session.\n\nWho is Kazuya Maruyama?\n\nA member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP), Maruyama is a former lawyer and graduate of Waseda University. He went to law school at University of Washington (Seattle) and spent three years living and working in Los Angeles. Politically he has (or is) sat on the Committee on Education, Culture and Science, the Political Ethics and Election System, and the aforementioned Commission on the Constitution.\n\nLooks to be a pretty well rounded CV then, so terms like ‘Ethics’ and ‘Culture’ only add to the troubling nature of his remarks.\n\nCommission on the Constitution\n\nThe Commission on the Constitution was set up for the following purposes (according to the homepage):\n\n(1) to conduct broad and comprehensive research on the Constitution of Japan and fundamental legislation closely related to the Constitution of Japan.\n\n(2) to consider Preliminary Draft Amendments to the Constitution, bills on the initiation of Amendments to the Constitution and/or a National Referendum thereon, and other matters.\n\nThe Commission is made up of 45 members. Meetings or open to the public. Great!! Unless decided otherwise. Troubling!!\n\nA History of Stupid Remarks\n\nKazuya Maruyama is the latest in a line of Japanese politicians guilty of making shocking blunders.\n\nYoshitaka Sakurada (former state minister of education): On Korean ‘comfort women’ (widely regarded as forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II): “We must no longer be hesitant to say that those women were prostitutes by occupation,” THE ASAHI SHIMBUN Jan 15, 2016 Sakurada since retracted his remarks.\n\nThen there was the time Ayaka Shiomura from Your Party was subject to sexiest (verbal) abuse by male politicians during a Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly meeting. On speaking to the issue of delayed marriage and childbirth she was interrupted when someone shouted, “before you make accusations like that, you should hurry and get married yourself.” The Japan Times, June 19, 2014.\n\nPolarizing political firecracker, and former Mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto hit world headlines when he said of the system whereby women were forced into prostitution for World War II troops, \"If you want them (troops) to have a rest in such a situation (war), a comfort women system is necessary. Anyone can understand that.\" BBC May 14, 2013. Hashimoto went on to acknowledge that the women were acting against their will.\n\nFormer Prime Minister and current Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, has on more than one occasion had the media wetting themselves with glee. On elderly residents of Japan and the country’s financial resources: \"Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die. I would wake up feeling increasingly bad knowing that [treatment] was all being paid for by the government,\" . Furthermore, \"The problem won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.\" The Guardian, Jan 22, 2013 Aso acknowledged that his comments had been inappropriate.\n\nIn the same year Aso also appeared to suggest that the government could learn from the way that Nazi Germany changed its constitution: \"Germany's Weimar Constitution was changed into the Nazi Constitution before anyone knew,\" going on to say, \"It was changed before anyone else noticed. Why don't we learn from that method?\" CNN Aug 2, 2013 The remarks were retracted.\n\nA Slip of The Tongue\n\nOf course, taken out of context, it’s more than easy to make something said look inflammatory, ill-judged, a slip of the tongue, or anything that fits your agenda.\n\nTo give things a broader context you can find interesting reading in a paper entitled, Political Outcomes of the Slips of the Tongue of Japanese Ministers by Noriyuki Kawano and Masatsugu Matsuo (both of Hiroshima University). In this paper they highlight that,\n\na cabinet minister is expected to respect the Japanese Constitution and the official view of the Japanese Government. If a minister betrays that expectation in his speech, therefore, it may become a slip of the tongue.\n\nKawano gives further details about political factors constituting slips of the tongue of a minister, saying, among others,\n\n(1) it justifies Japan’s military activities in the Sino-Japanese War and in the Pacific War, (2) casts doubt upon the necessity of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, (3) comments favorably on the nuclear armament of Japan, or (4) discriminates against Asian people or minorities in the United States.\n\nNot quite sure why only the United States is mentioned in point (4), and not, err, Japan (or any other nation for that matter). Either way, yesterday’s remarks by Maruyama can be considered a slip of the tongue by this definition. And he’ll have to bear responsibility for it, as he appears to have done.\n\nWhat does all this mean though?\n\nThe term a slip of the tongue seems to have that kind of easy to throw away nature, Oh it was just a slip of the tongue! But, are these people actually racist and/or sexist? Did they just get a bit nervous in front of the cameras? Are they so fed up with the bland nature of modern politics that they thought, To hell with it. I’m going cause a stir! Do they actually mean what they say?\n\nWe can’t be sure, I suppose. But these people have usually received the finest education money can buy, so should we not take them for their word, however unpleasant that may may be?\n\nIf there is any good to come out of all this, though, it’s that at least we know what these people are capable of thinking and saying. This gives us chance to better be aware of what they might be capable of doing.\n\nTwitter: City_Cost_Japan\n\nFacebook\n\nOther sources: Lib Dems / Wikipedia\n\nImage (cropped and text added)",
  "latent_8671": "How Do We Define Good Defense?\n\nWhen we talk, think, and strategize about Ultimate, defensive skill sometimes takes a back seat to offensive play. But we have begun to search for new ways to quantify good defense. Here we introduce one of those: the Ultiworld D rating.\n\nWhen we talk, think, and strategize about Ultimate, defensive skill sometimes takes a back seat to offensive play. We know our stars and Callahan winners for those moments when the disc is in their hands. Hours are spent discussing the virtues of horizontal, vertical, and split stack offenses –- more than is spent talking about backhand or forehand forces, or man vs. zone defense. And stat keepers usually track three variables of offensive interest – goals, assists, turnovers – but only track one on defense: blocks.\n\nPart of the problem is that it’s really hard to measure good defense. Is it good defense to bait a layout block or to stop your man from touching the disc? Is it better to front and deny your man at the risk of getting beat deep?\n\nWe have begun to search for new ways to quantify good defense and our goal is to improve defensive measurement in the long term. Using the UltiApps tracking system, we designed four new defensive metrics that we plan to employ during our coverage of the US Open.\n\nOur current view is that there is no single measurement or statistic that perfectly estimates a player’s defensive value. Intuitively, different players may employ different defensive styles to help their team. And some teams may rely on help schemes or momentary zones rather than one-on-one man coverage. But combining multiple metrics and statistics yields an interesting picture of a player’s defensive style and overall strength as a defender – a picture we are currently calling our “Ultiworld D Rating.”\n\nLike last year, we have been tracking statistics from each of the NexGen games — here’s an early look at the top defenders on the team, according to our ‘D Rating.’\n\nPlayer Ultiworld D Rating Aaron Neal 1.95 Tim Morrissy 1.61 Simon Montague 0.94 Dylan Freechild 0.86 Aaron Honn 0.86 Jacob Janin 0.55 Eli Kerns 0.43 Elliot Erickson 0.10 Camden Allison-Hall -0.19 Jimmy Mickle -0.61 Chris Kocher -0.81 Jay Clark -0.82 Mitch Cihon -0.83 Trent Dillon -1.19 Will Driscoll -2.85\n\nMetric 1: Good Defense Is Denying Scores\n\nThe offense’s job is to score, so good defenders should prevent scores. Our statistics track the closest man defender on each pass, including scores. The closest defender on a catch for a score acquires a “goal against.” The goals against number is then adjusted to account for number of defensive possessions played; otherwise OLine players would have fewer goals against simply because they played less defense.\n\nThe NexGen 2013 data is notable for who is so far not stopping goals: NexGen Veteran Will Driscoll. Driscoll has repeatedly been beat deep and given up 12 goals. But Driscoll’s case shows the volatility of this statistic, especially in a small sample: Each score hurts a player a lot, making it subject to a lot of noise. In contrast, Driscoll gave up relatively few goals in our 2012 NexGen stats. Through four games1, Aaron Honn, Simon Montague, and Aaron Neal have been the toughest defenders to score on, though a larger sample size of data would give a fuller and less noisy picture.\n\nMetric 2: Good Defenders Pick Their Spots, Giving Up Less Dangerous Options\n\nOne important finding of our 2012 NexGen series was that yardage matters as both an indicator of offensive impact and because scoring is easiest when you only have a few yards to go. And touches (or disusage, discussed below) matters in terms of yards: Giving up only one touch isn’t very useful if it is a reception for a 70 yard score. Finally, calculating the yardage against each player minimizes some of the ‘goals against’ bias. A player who gave up the 50 yard pass to the eventual assister is hurt on this yardage metric more than the guy who gave up the three yard upline cut to the scorer.\n\nIf there’s one player on NexGen 2013 that is athletic and smart enough to embrace this metric and limit his matchup’s positive yardage, it may be Simon Montague. In the below clip, Montague first poaches off his man, tries to make a play, and then quickly recovers –only giving up a few positive yards to his man despite the aggressiveness. The second clip shows his handler defense pushing the opposition backwards. He triangulates the dump’s upline cut and even flashes into other throwers’ upfield throwing lanes.\n\n[youtube iEU9ewgIBhs 600 377]\n\nMetric 3: Good Defense Is Denying Your Man The Disc\n\nEmphasizing “hand in pocket” defense and not allowing your man to touch the disc (rather than focusing on blocks) is an emerging trend. This piece doesn’t dwell too much on whether such defense is possible at the elite level or whether it’s even advisable to play so aggressively. But the NexGen data is interesting in that regard: NexGen 2013 shows more variance in offensive usage than in defensive “disusage”, which is the term and statistic we use to describe how often your man touches the disc (compared to the total number of opponent touches while you were on the field). In other words, the other elite club teams have been able to get touches on just about everyone.\n\nMetric 4: Good Defenders Get Blocks And Get Us The Disc\n\nFinally, we also track the number of blocks and interceptions each player generates. We adjust the number to account for the number of defensive possessions played. A player with two D’s in a point when his team was on defense three times has .66 D’s per defensive possession.\n\nSo What’s the Best Metric? Normalizing and Combining\n\nMy personal favorite defense is shutdown, disc-denying, yardage-preventing coverage. I tend to think that my blocks usually only follow prior defensive mistakes.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when, after tracking my college team’s data all season, we found that our best-regarded defenders were almost always the ones with the most blocks per defensive possession played. While that line of thinking is subject to bias, it’s also important to always evaluate new statistics in light of what you already know about players.\n\nBut blocks isn’t quite everything. Our favorite interpretation of individual defense, the Ultiworld D Rating, averages the three other defensive metrics (goals against, defensive disusage, and ratable share of yards against) and places it alongside blocks per possession.2 Essentially we are suggesting that each of those statistics has about one-third of the explanatory value as playing-time-adjusted blocks. Finally, all of the metrics are scaled so that higher values are always better and team means and deviations are calculated: The values in our graphs are measurements of standard deviations (ZScores), not raw values.3\n\nYour stud NexGen defenders (Aaron Honn, Dylan Freechild, Tim Morrissy, and Jacob Janin) are in the top right: These are guys that get good amounts of blocks but also do a better-than-average job in the other areas (diusage, yardage against, and goals against). Your worst defenders are in the bottom left, and, again, magnitude matters: Driscoll’s lone placement in -2 land reflects that he is giving up tons of huck yardage for goals against, and a decent amount of touches, too.\n\nAnother representation is the relationship between yardage against and disusage. Guys who give up lots of yards on a few touches should maybe consider backing more. Guys who give up few yards on a lot of touches could think about trying to reduce the amount of touches even at the expense of taking a risk; maybe fronting is in order. This graph shows that relationship:\n\nInterestingly enough, NexGen 2013 didn’t show many signs of obvious coaching improvements — fewer players are far off in the top left or bottom right quadrant than we see in typical college team data. These guys know what they’re doing on defense.\n\nCrunching the defensive numbers on NexGen 2013 after just four games is a bit of a fool’s errand. A great all-around player, Driscoll’s numbers are guaranteed to improve some while Montague will regress back towards the team mean. Our late-season NexGen defense article will be more decisive in support and critique of individual players. Nothing we do will ever be able to capture all the intricacies of help defense, flashing in the lane, marking, or even zone coverage. But we wanted to share our first small step in defensive quantification with the Ultimate community, introduce the metrics before our US Open coverage begins, and get our readers’ feedback.\n\nThanks to Husayn Carneige, Jeremy Weiss, Ian Guerin, and the UltiApps teams for their help in the project.

  "latent_8680": "Overview\n\nThe genetic basis of Down syndrome The genetic basis of Down syndrome\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.\n\nDown syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nBetter understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with this disorder and help them live fulfilling lives.\n\nSymptoms\n\nEach person with Down syndrome is an individual — intellectual and developmental problems may be mild, moderate or severe. Some people are healthy while others have significant health problems such as serious heart defects.\n\nChildren and adults with Down syndrome have distinct facial features. Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include:\n\nFlattened face\n\nSmall head\n\nShort neck\n\nProtruding tongue\n\nUpward slanting eye lids (palpebral fissures)\n\nUnusually shaped or small ears\n\nPoor muscle tone\n\nBroad, short hands with a single crease in the palm\n\nRelatively short fingers and small hands and feet\n\nExcessive flexibility\n\nTiny white spots on the colored part (iris) of the eye called Brushfield's spots\n\nShort height\n\nInfants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age.\n\nIntellectual disabilities\n\nMost children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Language is delayed, and both short and long-term memory is affected.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nChildren with Down syndrome usually are diagnosed before or at birth. However, if you have any questions regarding your pregnancy or your child's growth and development, talk with your doctor.\n\nCauses\n\nHuman cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother.\n\nDown syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21 occurs. These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. This extra genetic material is responsible for the characteristic features and developmental problems of Down syndrome. Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome:\n\nTrisomy 21. About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 — the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.\n\nAbout 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 — the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell. Mosaic Down syndrome. In this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.\n\nIn this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization. Translocation Down syndrome. Down syndrome can also occur when a portion of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) onto another chromosome, before or at conception. These children have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but they also have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome.\n\nThere are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.\n\nIs it inherited?\n\nMost of the time, Down syndrome isn't inherited. It's caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus.\n\nTranslocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child. However, only about 3 to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents.\n\nWhen balanced translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material. This means he or she has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children.\n\nRisk factors\n\nSome parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Risk factors include:\n\nAdvancing maternal age. A woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division. A woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age. However, most children with Down syndrome are born to women under age 35 because younger women have far more babies.\n\nA woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division. A woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age.

Both men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.\n\nBoth men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children. Having had one child with Down syndrome. Parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at an increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome. A genetic counselor can help parents assess the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome.\n\nComplications\n\nPeople with Down syndrome can have a variety of complications, some of which become more prominent as they get older. These complications can include:\n\nHeart defects. About half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of congenital heart defect. These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy.\n\nAbout half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of congenital heart defect. These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy. Gastrointestinal (GI) defects.

Having Down syndrome also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Other problems. Down syndrome may also be associated with other health conditions, including endocrine problems, dental problems, seizures, ear infections, and hearing and vision problems.\n\nFor people with Down syndrome, getting routine medical care and treating issues when needed can help with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife spans have increased dramatically for people with Down syndrome. Today, someone with Down syndrome can expect to live more than 60 years, depending on the severity of health problems.\n\nPrevention\n\nThere's no way to prevent Down syndrome. If you're at high risk of having a child with Down syndrome or you already have one child with Down syndrome, you may want to consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant.\n\nA genetic counselor can help you understand your chances of having a child with Down syndrome.

  "latent_9144": "Some ad-blockers are tracking you, shaking down publishers, and showing you ads\n\nThe ad-subsidized Web is at a crossroads: faced with pressure from social media platform, publishers are accepting ever-more-intrusive ads, which combine with the mounting public concern over privacy and tracking to encourage ad-blocking, which, in turn, makes publishers more desperate and more biddable to the darkest surveillance and pop-up desires of advertisers.\n\nWired recently started an anti-ad-blocking campaign that attempts to prevent ad-blocked users from reading articles unless they pay a monthly subscription fee. On the heels of this decision comes a roundup of the major ad-blockers, some of which are pretty dodgy indeed.\n\nAdblock Plus comes off the worst of the lot. The company charges publishers fees to allow their ads through its filters, based on criteria about size and placement. Ghostery blocks trackers, but by default gathers but allows you to opt into the collection of \"anonymized\" data about your browsing habits (it's very hard to conclusively describe any deep data set as anonymized).\n\nBoth tools allow you to customize them to change these behaviors, but most people never change their defaults, and in the case of Adblock Plus, the user interface is extremely difficult to navigate.\n\nThe nonprofit world does a lot better: EFF's Privacy Badger doesn't track you and doesn't take money to make exceptions. It also has a much narrower purpose: blocking ads that use \"non-consensual tracking\" that allow for \"retargeted\" ads that follow you from one site to another. It has a lot fewer options than, say, Adblock Plus -- it's not useful if you want to automatically block scripts that drive those \"subscribe to our email list\" popups, or opt out of cookies from news sites that try to limit you to 10 articles per month. On the other hand, fewer options mean fewer ways to accidentally turn on something that allows tracking.\n\nThe social media advertising apocalypse has driven publishers to more than obnoxious ads, of course. They're also running obnoxious campaigns to beg, cajole, trick or coerce you into handing over your email address -- not because email newsletters are such a great way to make money, but because they're the last real, federated, open channel through which ads can be sent without permission from a gatekeeper like Facebook. Of course, as so much email concentrates onto platforms like Gmail, the \"federated\" email system is increasingly federated in name only, as a misstep in Gmail's spam filter could destroy your business without any appeal.\n\nWired's final prediction is that all the ads will disappear into sponsored content within a decade. That may be OK when you're talking about car and booze campaigns, but what about political coverage, public safety, and wars? Would you want to read \"native advertising\" about the Flint water crisis, say, sponsored by Nestle's bottled water arm?\n\nTo some in the publishing and ad industries, these business models are nothing less than extortion. “The ad-block profiteers are building for-profit companies whose business models are premised on impeding the movement of commercial, political, and public-service communication between and among producers and consumers,” Randall Rothenberg, the president and CEO of advertising trade group Interactive Advertising Bureau, said in a speech earlier this year. “They offer to lift their toll gates for those wealthy enough to pay them off, or who submit to their demands that they constrict their freedom of speech to fit the shackles of their revenue schemes.” Adblock Plus in particular has come under fire from some publishers and advertisers. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Taboola, for example, have all reportedly paid hefty fees to Adblock Plus to have their ads whitelisted, according to The Financial Times.\n\nAd Blockers Are Making Money Off Ads (And Tracking, Too) [Julia Greenberg/Wired]\n\nUpdate: Hugh Cunningham from Affect Public Relations and Social Media writes:",

  "latent_10016": "Advertisement\n\nA fully assembled consumer friendly 3D printer is now within your grasp: at the time of the original Kickstarter, a $350 3D printer was basically unheard of, even with DIY kits. That’s why in 2014 they surpassed their funding goal of $50,000 in 11 minutes. We’ve finally got our hands on one, and it’s actually pretty good.\n\nFancy owning your own 3D printer? At the end of this review we’ll be giving away our M3D Micro test unit to one lucky reader!\n\nDesign and Specs\n\nThe Micro part of the name isn’t kidding: this thing is tiny. Here’s a banana for scale.\n\nPrint Quality: from 50 to 350 microns layer thickness\n\nBuild Area: 109mm x 113mm at the base, but reduced to 91mm x 84mm above a height of 74mm, up to a total of 116mm.\n\nPrinter Size: 185mm cube.\n\nDespite the overall small print size, I found it impressive how little space the printer took up on top of that – it’s built to make the most effective use of the space as possible, even down to a discreetly hidden area under the print bed for a filament spool to be seated.\n\nMy First Print\n\nAlthough there is that space under the print bed with a tube connecting it to the extruder, it’s actually recommended you use the external feed port. There’s no spool holder when used externally, but M3D do provide a 3D model of one that you can print out. In curious way, this was actually quite satisfying. The excitement of having a 3D printer can sometimes extinguish quickly as you’re overwhelmed by a catalogue of 3D printables from the Thingiverse or similar repositories. With the Micro, you know exactly what you need to print first, and it feels like quite the achievement to have printed a spool holder – something useful that you can point at and justify your extravagant purchase. Even if one should have been included anyway.\n\nThe software is incredibly easy to use, walking you through ink change procedures and reducing the complicated processing of sliding models into a simple case of click a button to load a 3D model, resize or rotate as you wish, then hit print and choose the quality.\n\nPrint Quality – ABS and PLA\n\nLike the Cubify I reviewed last year Cubify Cube 3D Printer Review and Giveaway Cubify Cube 3D Printer Review and Giveaway Most affordable 3D printers are sold as self-assembly kits, but the Cubify Cube promises to be plug-and-plug with minimal fuss. Does it live up to that promise? Read More , the Micro doesn’t come with a heated print bed, which results in ABS prints cooling rapidly and warping upwards before the print is finished – you can see an example of this in the video. This ends in a sticky mess of 3D printed spaghetti, and the Micro is no different – I was unable to print anything large or small directly onto the print bed. When used with a BuildTak surface applied, I did have some success on smaller ABS prints, but if you’re looking specifically to print in ABS I would advise you look elsewhere.\n\nPLA is a different matter, and can be printed just fine onto non-heated print beds. Anecdotally, the detail on the PLA prints rivals that of the $1000 Cubify 3D, and that’s a great achievement for something one-third of the price (and without the hassle of DRM’ed print cartridges). Both small and large PLA prints came out well, though again, I would still suggest a BuildTak surface anyway for easier removal and to prevent damage to the print bed.\n\nThe low poly dinosaur you see above was printed on high quality with a medium fill, and took approximately 8 hours to complete. The most intricate print I managed to get out the M3D was this stereographic projection sphere, which also happens to demonstrate perfectly the amount of plastic waste you’ll create due to the various support rafts that are needed for a model like this. I really hope they have a way of recycling this stuff soon.\n\n“Ink”\n\nThe Micro takes any standard 1.75mm ABs or PLA filament. It’s mildly frustrating that M3D have decided to call filament “3D ink”, but there you go. Branded spools cost $13 for 225g. The upside to purchasing their branded filaments is a “cheat code” on every spool, which the software will use to derive the optimal print settings from – temperature, material type, etc. If you do decide to load in third party filament, you’ll need to figure that out yourself, or source something similar. That’s not to imply this would be a difficult task to find out those details, but merely that a 3 letter code is definitely easier and it’s one less worry.\n\nSetup Woes\n\nAnyone who’s experienced a 3D printer will tell you that it’s not all roses: half the time will be spent re-calibrating, sorting out nozzle jams, or filament feed issues. Such is the nature of 3D printing by heated plastic filament extrusion. As new 3D printing techniques are refined (or rather, pulled down to a consumer level of affordability), these problems will likely be replaced by others – but for now, this is the playing field you choose. Even a $2000 MakerBot Replicator isn’t immune to nozzle jams. I will say this for the M3D Micro though: not once did I experience a nozzle jam. This may have just been luck, but it probably also down to rapid improvement in the core technologies used in the extruder and heating nozzle.\n\nWhat wasn’t so obvious was the calibration. Attempting to auto-calibrate fires up a warning message about damaging the printer if you don’t use a BuildTak. I had no idea what that was, and one isn’t included. It turns out they’re basically a layer of flexible plastic you place onto the build bed to provide better adhesion for print. Each one costs around $10 and is reusable a number of times, so after purchasing one I finally managed calibration. The BuildTak sheet itself comes with instructions to raise the height of your base layer a few hundredths of a millimeter higher – but upon doing so, whatever auto-calibration had occurred was apparently lost, and the next print saw the hot nozzle plummet directly into the BuildTak sheet, burning a hole directly through it and into the print bed. I’ll have a replacement sent to the winner, I promise. It turns out only the auto-calibration is necessary, but no worries – it works fine with a new sheet of the BuildTak applied.\n\nAlternatives\n\nA year earlier, the Pirate3D Buccaneer had made a similar claim, offering a $300 3D printer and gathering over a $1.3 million on Kickstarter. Today they’re deluged in a torrent of refund requests and lawsuits on a product they ultimately couldn’t deliver. They’ve moved on to peddling their device for closer to $1000, so it’s no longer a competitor to the Micro and may not even exist at all.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning HobbyKing has launched that a similar form factor fully assembled 3D printer called the Mini Fabrikator, for only $180.\n\nFor those more technically inclined who think they could handle constructing a 3D printer in kit form, you might want to look at an open source kit instead, such as this Kossel DLT-180 delta-style printer for $300 including delivery from China. The build area is larger and supposedly the print quality is better, plus there’s a vibrant community out there to aid with any problems and a multitude of upgrade options.\n\nIs This The 3D Printer You’re Looking For?\n\nEven facing stiff competition from open source 3D printer kits, the M3D Micro is an affordable way to take your first steps into 3D printing – and surprisingly produces prints that are on par or better than the $1000 “budget” Cubify printer we looked at last year. The Micro comes fully assembled, so if you’re looking for the cheapest 3D printer around that comes packaged and ready for consumer use, I see no reason to grab one now before the price increases (I say that because the website implies it might, though who knows). The only sacrifice is the small build area, though while testing the printer I didn’t come across many objects that required a larger area, or that couldn’t be suitably scaled down. If you need specifically to print in ABS, or anything over the size of a 10cm cube, then look elsewhere.\n\nOur verdict of the M3D Micro :\n\nThe M3D Micro is the most affordable consumer-ready 3D printer we’ve seen yet. There are cheaper open source kits out there if the small build area is too limiting for you, but if you just want to get started without spending thousands of dollars, we see no reason not to grab an M3D Micro now! 8 10\n\nM3D Micro 3D Printer Giveaway\n\nSend your products to be reviewed.

  "latent_10189": "Bleacher Report\n\nLeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love are obviously going to make the Cleveland Cavaliers into one of the NBA's best teams. Whether they're capable of moving past the Chicago Bulls and the rest of the Eastern Conference is up for debate, but they'll at least be a part of the competition for a No. 1 seed throughout the 2014-15 campaign.\n\nBut how do they stack up historically? Northeast Ohio now boasts an unprecedented amount of upside and potential, but does this Cavaliers squad have the best Big Three of the superteam era?\n\nIf we define the \"superteam era\" as the last seven seasons, dating back to when Danny Ainge assembled the Big Three that quickly turned around the Boston Celtics, then the field is a lot narrower. The C's of the early 1980s—Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish—don't count. Nor does the Los Angeles Lakers' trio of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, dominant as it may have been.\n\nAnd that's how it should be.\n\nBack then, those teams were the exceptions. They weren't the rule. Additionally, they were largely compiled in organic fashion, though some trades were obviously still involved. Such was the case for the Chicago Bulls' devastating triumvirate of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman during their second three-peat in the '90s.\n\nAndrew D. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nBut the Celtics changed things when Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett joined an incumbent Paul Pierce, engineering one of the biggest single-season turnarounds in NBA history. All of a sudden, that became the route du jour for championship-caliber team construction. It didn't even take a full season for the Lakers to react and trade for Pau Gasol, pairing him up with Kobe Bryant and Andrew Bynum.\n\nMeanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs steadily plugged along, content with their own Big Three of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, one that already had championships to its credit and would later earn more. That trio was assembled as organically as possible, but it's impressive in and of itself that Gregg Popovich, R.C. Buford and the rest of the San Antonio front office have been able to fight off every suitor that emerged for one of those three stars.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder stumbled upon a troika of their own—Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. The Miami Heat built one seemingly from scratch, luring the talents of LeBron James and Chris Bosh to South Beach in the summer of 2010.\n\nAnd that's saying nothing of the failed trios.\n\nNoah Graham/Getty Images\n\nThe Lakers tried to form another triumvirate with Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, but the eventual ill feelings and quick departure made them the closest comparison we have to Caesar, Pompey and Crassus. The Brooklyn Nets thought they might have something special with Brook Lopez, Deron Williams and Joe Johnson. The New York Knicks teamed up Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler with Amar'e Stoudemire.\n\nWhether the constructions have been successful or not, the concept of a Big Three has become ubiquitous in today's NBA.\n\nSome fans like the idea, as it tends to promote high-quality basketball and make it easier to catch multiple stars in action at the same time. Then again, a large crowd feels nothing but vitriol over the idea of manufacturing excellent teams, as there's this notion that stars of the past wouldn't have taken the \"easy route\" by teaming up with other great players.\n\nIs it right? Is it wrong? That's irrelevant here. It's a discussion for another time and place.\n\nNo matter your leanings, it's happening, and it's been happening for years now. The new-look Cavaliers are only the latest iteration in this \"superteam era,\" but they're far from being the best right now.\n\nThe Present\n\nDavid Liam Kyle/Getty Images\n\nIndividually, Cleveland has a handful of absolutely fantastic pieces.\n\nJames is the best player in the NBA, even if Durant is coming off a season in which he finally got over the hump, stopped finishing second and got his hands on the coveted Maurice Podoloff Trophy. Love is without question one of the league's elite power forwards, capable of making incredible offensive and rebounding contributions, even if his defense is questionable at best. Irving is an up-and-coming point guard with a knack for scoring and handles nearly unsurpassed throughout the vast reaches of the Association.\n\nThere's just one problem.\n\nIrving and Love have never played meaningful NBA basketball. Their regular-season games have mattered, sure, but neither player has been involved in a crucial stretch run that propelled his team into the playoffs. Nor have they played a single postseason game.\n\nIn many ways, that's understandable, seeing as neither player has been in a situation in which his front office has surrounded him with high-quality talent. Irving is still just 22 years old, while Love is four years his senior. Both players have plenty of time left to continue growing and learning the ropes when it comes to postseason basketball.\n\nComparing them to the Spurs right now is foolish, especially considering all that the trio has accomplished under Popovich's supervision. Except for Bird, McHale and Parish, no group of three players has ever won more games than this San Antonio pairing, who moved past Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson and Michael Cooper during the 2013-14 campaign.\n\nAndrew D. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nAnd as Parker told NBA.com's Fran Blinebury right before surpassing that Lakers trio, this sustained success means a lot to them:\n\nA great run and it feels very special. I feel very blessed to play with Timmy and Manu and I feel very lucky and privileged to be named next to Magic Johnson and Kareem and Michael Cooper. I grew up watching them and never thought in my wildest dreams that my name would be next to them. It’s crazy just to think about it. Once I retire, I can look at it and enjoy it. Now I try to stay focused on the season, but it’s unbelievable.\n\nSince then, the Spurs have won another title. It's their fourth since Ginobili joined the squad as a second-round draft pick. They may have been assembled before my arbitrary cutoff date in the summer of 2007, but they haven't been disassembled since.\n\nAgain, there's no point in bothering with a comparison between the Spurs and these new Cavaliers, but how does Cleveland stack up against other candidates—and this is key—at the time of assembly?\n\nWhen Garnett came to Boston, he had only just turned 31, still squarely in the midst of his prime. While with the Minnesota Timberwolves, he'd carried his team to the playoffs multiple times, won an MVP and established himself as one of the very best two-way players in the league.\n\nAllen, meanwhile, was just a year older. Though his athleticism was no longer as stellar as it was early in his career, he remained a superstar, coming off a season with the Seattle SuperSonics in which he averaged 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. A battle-tested seven-time All-Star, he already had 37 playoff games to his credit, including a run to the Eastern Conference Finals with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nFernando Medina/Getty Images\n\nPlus, Pierce was nearing the 30-year milestone and had been a part of multiple playoff runs with the Celtics during the opening salvo of his NBA tenure. And he was arguably the least successful of the three prior to their union in Beantown.\n\nAnd how about the Big Three James is leaving? When the Heat assembled in 2010, Wade (who had a Finals MVP to his credit) was being joined by a multi-MVP player and Bosh, who had proved himself as a No. 1 option with the Toronto Raptors. It was the big man who had the weakest resume, but he'd led Toronto to the postseason twice while serving as the top player.\n\nThese Cavaliers simply don't have the necessary experience to stack up against the other dominant Big Threes of this \"superteam era,\" at least at the time of inception.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they'll be kept from the top of the heap for too long.\n\nThe Future\n\nGonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images\n\nEven though the NBA world will inevitably be swept away with immediate expectations of titles, this Cleveland Big Three was assembled with the future in mind.\n\nWhile the youth of Irving and Love keeps the trio from coming anywhere close to earning status as the top Big Three of the \"superteam era,\" it also works in its favor going forward. Garnett, Pierce and Allen had to peak right away, as each was heading out of his prime. The same was true with James, Bosh and Wade, as well as Gasol and Bryant, though to a lesser extent.\n\nLimited windows abounded. But that's not the case for these Cavs.\n\nJames isn't going anywhere for at least a little while longer. He's a skilled enough player that he'll be able to stave off the ill effects of Father Time with his ridiculously cerebral play, his efficiency, his burgeoning post-up skills and his all-around game. Even if he's not numero uno in the basketball world, he won't be moving past cinco for a long time.\n\nAnd how about Irving?\n\nThat's not an exaggeration.\n\nIrving has a long way to go if he hopes to move past Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall and the other point guards currently in front of him. He'll have to play much more focused defense, improve his shooting efficiency and start leading a team rather than posting big, gaudy stats on a lackluster squad.\n\nBut he can do it.\n\nDavid Liam Kyle/Getty Images\n\n\"Accompanied by fellow stars and playing on a real title contender, Irving has the chance to develop in ways he couldn't before,\" Bleacher Report's Dan Favale explained while breaking down what it would take for Irving to ascend to that pole position. \"He has safety nets most cannot even fathom.\"\n\nAnd one of those safety nets will be an ever-improving Love, who finally gets to play on a team with a shot at doing something special. He's been an incredible source of numbers, historical performances and awe-inspiring box scores during the initial years of his NBA career, but his resume remains devoid of even a cup of coffee in the postseason.\n\nEven though he won't turn 27 until the 2015 offseason is drawing near to its conclusion, he may already have the best resume in NBA history for a player without a single playoff game under his belt. He's been that good while laboring away on nondescript Minnesota teams.\n\nHow will he play when defense finally matters? How will he fare when he has incredible offensive talents drawing defensive attention away from him? We have no idea, but the questions themselves are certainly intriguing for a player who somehow seems to be getting better each year he's healthy.\n\nDon't be surprised when the Cavaliers follow that same pattern.\n\nIs this the best Big Three assembled in recent memory? Absolutely not.\n\nBut it can be.",
  "latent_10317": "Scott Olson / Getty Images As automation threatens the existence of millions of jobs across the US, not every American is equally at risk of being replaced by a robot.\n\nTwice as many women than men are likely to lose their jobs as automation replaces human labor, according to a recent report by the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis (ISEA).\n\nThat's because women are more likely to be employed in jobs that face the highest automation risks. For example, 97% of cashiers are expected to lose their jobs in the coming years to automation. As of 2016, 73% of cashiers are women.\n\nWomen are not the only group that ISEA found will be disproportionately impacted by the rise of automation.\n\nEatsa, an automated restaurant, doesn't need cashiers or waiters. Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nHispanic and African-American workers are 25% and 13% more likely, respectively, to lose their jobs to automation than white workers. Asian workers are 11% less likely, compared to white workers.\n\nResearchers analyzed 2016 employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and research from Oxford on which jobs are most susceptible to automation to find out which groups would be hit hardest by employers increasing reliance on machines over human workers.\n\nThe biggest factor, according to the ISEA, is education level. People without a high school degree face an almost six times higher risk than those with a doctorate of losing their livelihoods, as they are more likely to be working jobs that are less complex and easier to automate.\n\nResearchers emphasized in the report that new technology will likely also result in new types of employment, replacing lost jobs. However, with the new forms of employment, there is no guarantee that these new jobs will provide well-paying livelihoods for the most vulnerable demographics.\n\n\"Decisions to get education or embark on certain careers are diverse and influenced by many factors,\" Professor Johannes Moenius, director of ISEA, said in a statement. \"But we do think it's important to see how different groups may be affected.\"",
  "latent_10338": "Several weeks ago I wrote about being on the fence about Alex Smith. I've been able to understand all season why some are down on the Chiefs starting quarterback. Unfortunately for my mental health, I've also been able to understand all season why some are NOT down on the quarterback. So all season, I sat on my fence and waited.\n\nI waited as Smith started suddenly throwing the ball down the field a lot more three weeks ago at Denver. Then I waited as Smith chucked three touchdowns and 7.7 YPA against the Chargers. Did he look different? Sure. But twice can be a coincidence. I kept telling people, \"Three times is a trend.\"\n\nI'm not on the fence any more.\n\nI'm on board the Alex Smith express. And as someone who has decided to buy in (for now. I'm fickle, remember), it becomes my duty to explain why you should buy in too (us homers are like a cult. We always want you to join us and be happy).\n\nLet's start with the basic stats. Smith went 26/42 (61.9% completion percentage) for 293 yards (6.98 YPA), with two touchdowns and one interception. That's a pretty respectable day. Of course, stats alone don't tell the whole story (and often not even half of it). So we're going to need to look at how Smith got to those stats, and how he looked doing it. Which means...\n\nAll-22 snap review time. For every single play Smith made in the air or on the ground last Sunday vs. Denver.\n\nGo get a snack, tell your kids to be quiet, and settle in. This is going to be a long one.\n\n(Quick note: we're only looking at Smith's throws and / or runs here. \"Snap 7\" will not be the 7th snap the Chiefs offense took, but the 7th snap in which Smith threw the ball or ran the ball. Hopefully that helps avoid confusion.)\n\nSnap 1\n\n1st and 10, pistol formation (for the sake of this column, it's all going to be \"pistol\" unless Smith is clearly at least five yards back. So basically, always pistol). Throws a short out to Dwayne Bowe to the left about 6-7 yards up the field. Hits him in stride, Bowe gets a few extra yards. Nine yard gain. Nice start, although that throw is one that should be hit nine out of 10 times.\n\nSnap 2\n\n2nd and 1, pistol again. Jamaal Charles is to his left, with Dexter McCluster lined up left of the line (though not wide). At the snap JC goes left, Smith fakes (in what appears to be a designed play) the throw to him, then fires across the middle to Dex. Champ Bailey's corpse is draped all over him, but Smith throws leading Dex farther inside, where Bailey's corpse has no chance. Six yard gain.\n\nTwo things of note. First, even though it was a mere six yards, that was a nice throw. Gunning it into tight coverage accurately is not easy, even from that range. Second, if the design was indeed to fake a screen to JC, that makes me happy. Teams are sitting on the Chiefs screens now, and plays like that will force them to back off a little.\n\nSnap 3\n\n1st and 20 at the 50 after a holding penalty (darn you, Jeff Allen). Pistol formation, Cyrus Gray (my boy!) lined up behind Smith. Play action to Gray, then Smith surveys the field. Not liking his options, he dumps off to Gray at the line of scrimmage, and Gray does a nice job making his man miss and getting seven yards.\n\nRe-watching on All-22, the dump-off was the correct option. With two receivers and a tight end on routes, no one was open and were in fact all heading into more coverage on their routes. This is why you watch All-22, so you know whether the check down was the right decision.\n\nAlso, I've had people tell me that Smith has been making receivers out of the backfield work too hard for the catch due to inaccuracy issues. I can say that this wasn't even kind of true on this particular play. Right in stride, it allowed Gray to catch and turn upfield in time and make golden boy Von Miller look foolish.\n\nSnap 4\n\n2nd and 13, I-formation. Play fake to Knile Davis, then a quick throw to A.J. Jenkins (we're winning that trade, guys!) for a gain of five. Just a quick curl pitch and catch. Nothing major to see here, except maybe to say good velocity on the ball.\n\nSnap 5\n\n3rd and 7, pistol formation. Dwayne Bowe manhandles \"elite\" Broncos DB Chris Harris and throws him to the ground (way to try and be physical, Harris!). Smith hits him in stride (though Bowe had to slow down a little) across the middle of the field, with the ball traveling about 17 yards in the air. Bowe does his thing, gain of 24. That's a throw you HAVE to make as a quarterback, as Bowe did a great job.\n\nSnap 6\n\n2nd and 8 from Denver's 11, shotgun formation with Smith alone in the backfield. Quick slant to Anthony Fasano (I think he released the ball about a second after the snap) on the right, perfect ball placement, gain of eight and a first down. The coverage was there, but the pass was perfect and Fasano did a great job sealing the cornerback off.\n\nSnap 7\n\nThe interception. So what happened? Some have said Smith waited too long to throw the ball, but that wasn't the problem. Fasano was WIDE OPEN initially, but the play was a a bootleg right, so Smith didn't see Fasano initially (as he was busy with the fake and the turn). He sees Fasano open and makes the throw pretty quickly. I believe there were two issues here.\n\nFirst, I'm not sure Smith even saw Wesley Woodyard, who was coming out from behind the line and did a great drop recovering from the fake and gaining ground in coverage.\n\nSecond, it wasn't a particularly good throw. Smith didn't set his feet at all but seemed like he was trying to gun it in there (maybe realizing how open Fasano had been and over-correcting?). Because of that, the ball had almost no air under it, allowing Woodyard (who again, did a great job getting depth in his zone after biting hard on the fake) to get the pick. Had he lofted the ball a little more, or led Fasano rather than trying to gun it right to him, that's a touchdown.\n\nOne myth to bust: No, Anthony Sherman was not open. However, Smith could have tried to run and hope that Sherman started blocking the CB in his path. Of course, seeing a wide open Fasano I'm not sure why he'd do that. The real mistake here was either not seeing Woodyard or a poor throw. It's tough to say which.\n\nHere's what Smith said about the play:\n\n\"No, I saw him late. I really think it was a good decision, I thought he was open. You know (it was) first down, it was just a bad throw. First down passing, you look back and you miss that ball high. You really throw it to (Anthony) Fasano or nobody because it wasn't fourth down or third down. Looking back on that, I thought it was a good decision. I thought he was open; I still think he was, it was just a bad throw, bad execution.\"\n\nSnap 8\n\n2nd and 8 on Denver's 19. He hits JC out of the backfield coming back toward the middle (JC easily beating the coverage). Right in stride, gain of 16. This seems like as good a time as any for a picture to give your eyes a break.\n\nA couple takeaways here. First, JC just burned that corner (who'd passed off Dex to take JC). Absolute humiliation. Second, that's great ball placement, which lead to a short throw going for 16 yards. Nice play (nothing super special, but nice) that might get overlooked.\n\nSnap 9\n\n1st and 10 from the 50, I-formation. Play fake, attempted screen to Knile Davis, who gets hung up and isn't available for the throw. Broncos' Danny Trevethan sees the screen and tackles Davis, leaving Smith with no options. Smith takes off, finds the edge with that speed that keeps surprising me, and gains 13 yards. Something out of nothing.\n\nSnap 10\n\n2nd and 10 on Denver's 17. This is the TD pass to Junior Hemingway. Smith looks first to Bowe, doesn't see anything he likes, resets, and fires it to Hemingway for the touchdown.\n\nFun fact: That throw was even better than it looked initially. The only reason Hemingway had to reach out for the ball is that as Smith released the throw, the beaten corner grabbed him and held him for a second. Hemingway broke free and made a nice catch. Great play by everyone involved.\n\nSnap 11\n\n1st and 10 at Denver's 22, double tight end, single back with Smith under center. Goes for the money shot to Sean McGrath, just a yard or two long. Chris Harris was right there with The Beard, so the throw had to go a little long. Very near miss. One thing I've noticed (and it happens here) is McGrath gets slowed down by light contact when he's on routes. The ball was probably a tad long regardless, but McGrath needs to work on that.\n\nSnap 12\n\nVery next play, four-receiver set, Smith under center with JC alone in the backfield. Looks to Bowe, who is covered, then goes to Hemingway, who sets up perfectly in the middle of the zone. Nine yard gain. I really, really like how Hemingway found the open spot there (time to see more of him). I'm still adjusting to seeing the quarterback go through reads and not panicking when the first read isn't open.\n\nSnap 13\n\nTouchdown to Fasano. The primary thing I've heard on this is that Fasano made a great catch to overcome a bad throw by Smith. Now, half of that is true; Fasano made a GREAT catch (we really miss that guy on offense when he's out, get well Anthony!). However, take a look at this.\n\nLook at the yellow circle (I know, I know, it's skinny). You see Fasano's gigantic hand reaching for the ball? Great. Now look what is immediately below that hand. Yep, the defender's arm. Smith HAD to lead Fasano to that point. If he hadn't \"overthrown\" the ball, it's knocked down or intercepted.\n\nThe coverage was actually very good. Smith and Fasano just made a better throw and catch. This is why you don't base your perception off watching the game live one time. Because you'll say stuff like, \"That was a bad throw and Fasano bailed him out.\" And be absolutely wrong.\n\nSnap 14\n\nGood Lord, I need to shorten these up. Incomplete pass to Sherman, should have been caught. It would have only been a gain of about two, but for stat geeks that makes a difference.\n\nSnap 15\n\n3rd and 8 on the five. Fasano comes wide open off the line. Smith hits him quickly, but the throw is high and requires Fasano to jump. He dives for the first down but is ruled out of bounds when he went over the marker. Had Smith hit him in stride, i think that's got a shot at a first down. On the flip side, if Fasano had headed straight upfield as opposed to toward the sideline it's got a shot, too.\n\nAlso ... does anyone else remember two weeks ago, when a Denver player was awarded the first down even though he dove forward with the ball clearly out of bounds? Because I sure do. Good times.\n\nSnap 16\n\n3rd and 5, ball at Denver's 19. Pistol formation. Smith is looking for Bowe on a crossing route, but he's hit by the linebacker in the middle of the field (WHY aren't the Chiefs doing more of that?). As that happens, Donald Stephenson gets beat. Charles is available (although he's being tracked by a cornerback on his wheel route), but Smith has to tuck the ball and run for his life before he can reset to throw. He breaks several tackles (including one very fun duck under a rusher's arms) but eventually gets run down.\n\nThis play could have ended in a big scramble, but as Smith ran right several of the Chiefs offensive linemen (Rodney Hudson, Jeff Allen, Branden Albert) all give up on the play and started walking, clearly thinking he'd get sacked. When Smith pulled a \"How the crap did he do that\" escape, they tried to recover and block for him but it was too late. That is absolutely unacceptable, and I hope Smith or Andy Reid said something to them afterwords. Block until the whistle, guys.\n\nOh, also happening on this drive (the prior play)\n\nLooks like Denver has finally found the solution to JC running by your defense: just trip him. This'll come back later, because it was happening all game. Feel free to show a Broncos fan the next time they claim Vickerson was their only dirty player.\n\nSnap 17\n\nVon Miller blows by Albert and hits Smith as he throws, resulting in an underthrown ball and a pick. Fortunately, a hold gives it back. Not much to be done here other than that might've been a time to just take the sack rather than throw as you get hit.\n\nSnap 18\n\nLooks like Denver has finally found the solution to JC running by your defense: just trip him\n\nNo one open (although Bowe could've maybe been hit on the slant), pressure comes up the middle. Smith is all, \"Fine, I'll do it myself,\" and takes off right. A Broncos defender badly underestimates Smith's speed and takes a terrible angle. Smith runs right by him and gets 26 yards. That guy can move. I also like that he rarely takes a real hit when he runs. Promotes longevity.\n\nSnap 19\n\nThe intentional grounding play. Wow. Looks like the refs were feeling needy and were looking for some attention.\n\nSnap 20\n\nPistol formation on 2nd and long. Hits Sherman out of the backfield for eight yards. Nothing to report on Smith, but I still can't BELIEVE Sherman got brought down by a secondary player like that. He's normally such a bruiser.\n\nSnap 21\n\n3rd and long, Smith throws to Dex for about two yards to effectively end our half. The throw to Dex has been criticized as a poor decision. I disagree. Smith was about to get killed by a blitzer. He absolutely HAD to get rid of the ball and had zero time.\n\nNotice the free man sprinting toward Smith? That was a very well-executed blitz. Smith made the right choice.\n\nWhat I WILL criticize, though, is the throw itself. Bad throw, and Dex had to dive for it. In Smith's defense, he had a guy screaming his way. But a better throw allows Dex a little room to run (though he still would've been tackled well short, as Denver's corner correctly passed deep coverage to come up on Dex).\n\nSnap 22\n\nWe're in the 2nd half now. 2nd and 9, pistol formation. A VERY quick out to Avery. One of those plays Reid uses to replace running plays, and I wish he'd stop. Denver was all over it.\n\nSnap 23\n\n3rd and 8 on Denver's 48. Pistol formation. Four receivers and JC go out on routes, Denver does a solid job in man coverage. Hudson gives up some ground to cause pressure up the gut, and Smith tries to take off. He looks to have a good shot at the first down, but slows down while leaving the pocket (we'll get back to that). A hold is called on Branden Albert and the whole thing comes back. Except...\n\nNow we see WHY Smith slowed down. Von Miller (who, to be fair, was being held) blatantly tries to trip Smith as he runs by. This should have been offsetting penalties and a replay of 3rd and 8. But nope. I hate everything, but especially Von Miller.\n\nSnap 24\n\n3rd and 18. Smith hits Avery on an out route for ... 16 yards. Bad throw. Avery had to come back for it. I get that a 15 yard out from the opposite hash is a tough throw, but still ... if credit should be given to Smith when he makes a good play, it's gotta be pointed out that his throw is what cost the Chiefs a first down on this particular play.\n\n(I'm still steamed Reid didn't go for it here, but whatever.)\n\nSnap 25\n\n1st and 10 on Denver's 20, Chiefs now down by a touchdown. Pistol formation with double TEs. Really well drawn-out play forces Woodyard to choose between Fasano and The Beard. He tries to bump Fasano and gets slammed into for his trouble (Fasano's a big dude). McGrath comes open across the middle, Smith hits him in stride. First down.\n\nSnap 26\n\n1st and 10 on Denver 31. I-formation, Two receivers, one tight end. NICE play fake to JC and Smith makes an absolutely gorgeous throw 40 yards in the air to A.J. Jenkins ... who drops it.\n\nI mean, seriously...\n\nSee the red circle? that's the ball, about to hit a running Jenkins in stride. There are drops, then there are bad drops, then there are \"OH GOOD GOD HOW COULD YOU DROP THAT?????\" drops. This falls in the last category. Jenkins hauls that in, even if he falls down immediately we're in field goal range (around the 30).\n\nBut since this is about Smith, I'm not going to stew too much longer over the drop. My main point is Smith just tossed a beautiful 40 yard bomb. He was overthrowing these earlier this year, but has been sticking them lately. Throws like this are the reason I'm no longer on the fence with Smith.\n\nSnap 27\n\nThrows like this are the reason I'm no longer on the fence with Smith.\n\n3rd and 8, same drive. Smith takes ANOTHER deep shot down the field, this one to Fasano. This throw was decent, but not all that good. Fasano dives and gets both hands on it, but drops it when he hits the ground (having very likely concussed himself). Von Miller was screaming up the middle toward Smith as he released.\n\nWhen I first watched the game I was furious about this drop. But now, I'd chalk this up as a \"meh\" play for Smith. The throw wasn't that good. I don't think Fasano had to lay himself out QUITE so much for it, but it would've been a very good catch.\n\nSnap 28\n\n1st and 10 on the 20. Fourth quarter, Chiefs down 14. Quick throw right to Bowe. It's high, but Bowe is able to get both hands on it ... and lets it go between them. I am filled with rage. Much worse drop than Fasano's in my opinion. Would've only been six yards or so, though.\n\nSnap 29\n\nNext play, out of shotgun. Von Miller owns Albert and is on Smith almost instantly. Smith breaks free and runs left for a gain of one. Literally no one even remotely open, and in my opinion Smith deserves props for not taking a sack here. A one ard gain isn't much, but when compared to an eight yard loss...\n\nSnap 30\n\n3rd and 17 (because of a hold on the aforementioned play). Smith in shotgun. No one gets open immediately, and you can see Smith start to dance around. But instead of taking off, he keeps his eyes down the field, keeps scanning, and throws right before the rush gets to him. Junior Hemingway in the middle of the field, having found the soft spot in the zone. Low throw but Hemingway snags it for the first down.\n\nWhat I like about this play is Smith clearly understood he HAD to keep his eyes downfield and find a receiver. The Chiefs absolutely needs a first down, and Smith was patient in waiting for someone to get open. Really nice play (and by Hemingway, too, who needs to see the field more).\n\nSnap 31\n\nI'm starting to wonder if Avery isn't part of some elaborate prank on Alex Smith. 35 yard back shoulder throw (though \"stop running all of a sudden\" throw would be more accurate) that arrives literally in Avery's lap...\n\n... and he dropped it. I have no idea how he even managed to drop it. I'm almost impressed. Avery is the ultimate quarterback tease. He's got wonderful speed and quickness and so gets separation very well. But his catching is about as consistent as ... something super inconsistent (you know I'm upset when I can't even come up with a bad analogy. Ugh).\n\nSnap 32\n\nI'm not even going to ... I can't even ... I just...\n\nIn case you're wondering, that got dropped. Re-watching the play 900 times or so, it seems like Avery was surprised the ball got there when it did and only got his hands up at the last second. But still ... Donnie, are you angry with Alex? Let's talk about this. You guys can work it out.\n\nSnap 33\n\nPass rush closes in before Smith can get past his first read, but he manages to run up the middle for a six yard gain. Very \"something out of nothing.\"\n\nSnap 34\n\nMiller badly beats Eric Fisher on the right side. Smith steps up and delivers a throw to Dex that falls incomplete (Dex was well covered). If Smith had waited a split second longer, he would've seen Junior Hemingway coming open across the middle for what could've been a pretty big gain. He could have and should have waited, as he'd stepped up and out of danger. Poor play.\n\nSnap 35\n\nScreen to Knile Davis. Not a great throw, Knile has to turn around to catch it. Knile compounds the issue by doing so very awkwardly. Gain of five.\n\nSnap 36\n\n3rd and 5. Single back with Davis, Smith under center. Hits Davis on a wheel route to the right, this time in stride. Gain of 11, first down. Good looking play.\n\nSnap 37\n\n1st and 10 on Denver's 17. Another screen, this time to Jamaal Charles. Executed very well, another first down.\n\nSnap 38\n\n1st and goal from the six. Another super quick out to Avery, knocked down at the line of scrimmage. Even had it gotten to Avery, the defender was all over it. Seriously, I hate that play call. Limits options (as Smith is clearly supposed to go straight to Avery) and is NOT an acceptable substitute for a run with our rushing attack.\n\nSnap 39\n\nQuick out to Dex, this one run slightly better (I still hate this play, though. Gets guys running horizontal rather than vertical). Dex gets facemasked to the ground at the one (otherwise he makes it across in my opinion).\n\nSnap 40\n\n3:32 left in the game, down seven, the defense FINALLY got a stop, and the Chiefs got the ball on their own seven yard line. Attempted back shoulder throw to Bowe. Very good coverage, high throw, incomplete.\n\nSnap 41\n\n2nd and 14 (because of course the Chiefs got a false start). The Avery non-fumble. And yes, it was a non-fumble. He was bobbling it as he started to run, never had full possession. Get over it, Broncos fans, and quit acting like it's even close to the same thing as the garbage non-calls you got or that it \"evened things out.\"\n\n(Sorry, got sidetracked there. I'm still irritated about the trips and the \"intentional grounding.\")\n\nAnyway, as far as decisions go, I would've rather seen Smith dump the ball off to Charles, who would've had only one defender to beat in the open field. \"Meh\" play.\n\nSnap 42\n\nYou know what happened here. 3rd and 14, ball on the four, pressure on. The Broncos bring SEVEN on the blitz, so many that Bowe stays in to block (WHAT?????). And Alex Smith is all, \"Whatever,\" as he does this...\n\n... which led to this...\n\nI could watch that play a million times. Stands tall in the pocket, sees the corner is fronting Jenkins (who was basically standing still when the ball was thrown) and the safety is too deep, so throws it up over the head of the corner where only Jenkins can catch it.\n\nAlex Smith: the calm in the storm. That's a play that gets a fence sitter to take a side.\n\nSnap 43\n\n1st and 10 on Denver's 30. Shotgun, 3 WR's and The Beard. Smith overthrows McGrath down the middle of the field. Tight coverage, required a long throw. McGrath once again allowed jostling to slow him down, but I believe it would've been overthrown either way.\n\nAlex Smith: the calm in the storm. That's a play that gets a fence sitter to take a side.\n\nSnap 44\n\nShotgun again, Smith gets great protection and throws 30 yards down the middle of the field to Dex. He fits the throw between three defenders (coverage was solid so he had to go over the top) who were in the area, and Dex makes an exceptional diving catch (Smith should've taken about a yard off that ball). Great protection, good (but not great) throw, and great catch.\n\nSnap 45\n\nYou know what is absolutely impossible to defend? A back shoulder throw 20 yards down the field when it's put right here...\n\nHoly crap. That might be the best throw of the day, considering the timing and placement with a back shoulder throw that far down the field. Unbelievable play, and a great job by Bowe as well.\n\nSnap 46\n\nOverthrown to Bowe down the left sideline. Very good coverage on the play, ball was put where it was either Bowe or no one. Another yard lower and that's a completion, so it's gotta be noted as an overthrow.\n\nSnap 47\n\nQuick throw right to Dex, who had gained separation with a fake inside. Smith throws it a few feet high, forcing the ever-tiny Dex to jump for it and gain only a couple yards. Hitting Dex in stride makes that a 5-6 yard play.\n\nSnap 48\n\n3rd and 7 at the 17. Smith is alone in the backfield with four receivers bunched to his left. He motions Dex to the backfield and it's a screen to Jenkins with Bowe and Hemingway blocking, with a quick play fake to Dex going right. Ends up as a four yard gain.\n\nThis was a very creative play call, and I like the idea of Bowe / Hemingway blocking (both are excellent. However, I hate the fake to Dex, as it delays a throw that should be instantaneous. Denver's defense didn't bite and they were swarming pretty quickly Also, a few things went wrong execution-wise.\n\nBowe and Hemingway didn't hold their blocks as well as one would hope, Smith threw the ball too low (in a hurry to get it there I assume), and Jenkins hesitated before cutting to the outside. Had any one of those things been different (especially the blocks), that play goes for a first down.\n\nAll that said, I like that play call ... in the first half of a game. Late in the fourth on a drive where your quarterback and receivers have been winning the battles straight up? I hated it. Smacked of over-coaching in my opinion. Again, though, had it been executed better (and had they left out the silly play fake) that play could have been a good one. I hope to see it again.\n\nThe Last Down\n\nA few things here. First, Adams was sitting on Bowe's route and didn't bite when Alex looked right to Avery and then briefly at Charles coming out of the backfield. Really good discipline by the safety.\n\nSecond, Sean McGrath gets mauled during his entire route, well past five yards. I understand officials don't want to be the reason games change radically, but good Lord, you can't play press coverage all the way down the field (I wish they could, but they can't). It's made even worse by the fact that it literally happened right in front of the official. Ugh.\n\nThird, the left side of the line allowed Robert Ayers to gain penetration and get in Smith's face. Stephenson didn't help Allen engage (though he had no one else to block), and Allen lost Ayers on a solid spin move.\n\nFourth, I think Smith made the wrong throw here, AND (after re-watching about 50 times), I'm not sure if Bowe wasn't his second or third read. He genuinely appears to be looking to go to Avery first, but doesn't like what he sees. Either that or it's a heckuva fake.\n\nThat said, I think the correct throw is a corner route to Avery. Had Smith kept his eyes on Avery for a split second longer, he would've seen Avery do a decent job beating the press and starting to gain separation heading toward the corner. Now, it would've required a fantastic throw and a great catch, but I think it's got a better chance of succeeding than the throw to Bowe.\n\nThat said, when Alex looked away, Avery hadn't really gained any traction yet. And by the time Smith got to Bowe as a read, Ayers was coming quickly. At that point, there was no other option but to try and squeeze the throw in there. So one can knock the throw to Bowe, but it was either make that throw or take a sack. The correct thing to (maybe) knock is the lack of taking a shot on the corner route.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nWe've taken a long road to a short thought: Alex Smith played an exceptional game. I thought he was solid on my live viewing and first re-watch, and my opinion of the game only got better upon the more detailed re-watch. Several of the major \"mistakes\" Smith made that people have criticized were not, upon All-22 review, mistakes at all (like the throw to Dex that ended a drive).\n\nMy overall point is that Smith has me off the fence. The man has been making plays for weeks now.\n\nSmith made multiple exceptional throws, more than I've seen him make in any game yet (including the more statistically impressive Chargers game). He also made very good plays with his feet on multiple occasions.And had he not been the victim of several inexcusable, horrific drops (leaving out even \"borderline\" drops), he tosses for 375 yards.\n\nMy overall point is that Smith has me off the fence. The man has been making plays for weeks now. He's shown he can push the ball down the field. He's shown that he can stay calm in a tough spot.\n\nThe bottom line is simple: if Alex Smith plays at this level for the remainder of the year and the defense bounces back to even 75 percent of what it has been this year, the Chiefs are going to make noise in the playoffs. If the receivers decide that hey, catching the ball down the field is a good thing (paging MOAR Junior Hemingway), the Chiefs are a legitimate contender. And no, I'm not kidding.\n\nSo someone take care of that fence for me. I won't be needing it for now.\n\n(For MOAR Chiefs analysis, give me a follow @RealMNchiefsfan. I use pretty pictures these days)",

  "latent_10433": "The future of Uber is about pharmacies and rickshaws.\n\nSo says CEO Travis Kalanick, who is bullish the company is worth more than its $18 billion valuation. Currently, Uber is quadrupling each year, he said.\n\nOne of several avenues for expansion is in a category of delivery that's about running errands.\n\n\"In Los Angeles, we're doing something called Uber Fresh, which is you push a button and you get a lunch in five minutes,\" Kalanick told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. \"In DC, we're doing Uber Corner Store. So imagine all the things you get at a corner store. ...\n\n\"FedEx isn't going to your nearest pharmacy and delivering something to you in five minutes,\" he continued.\n\nAnother is in emerging markets, where the company may focus on rickshaws, rather than high-end black cars, Kalanick said. Uber operates in more than 200 cities, including Cali, Colombia; Jakarta, Indonesia; Lima, Peru; and New Delhi, India.\n\nBut it's not all smooth sailing. The company faces competition from the traditional taxi industry as well as other, smaller ride-sharing and transportation apps, like Lyft, Gett and Sidecar. Uber and Lyft have engaged in a particularly nasty battle.\n\nThere are also challenges from regulators. That's why Kalanick -- who said \"I can make really good code,\" but is not so skilled at working political systems -- hired President Obama's former campaign manager, David Plouffe.\n\n\"There's a lot of regulations that go way back that didn't contemplate what the future was going to look like,\" he said. Those laws didn't imagine a smartphone era where \"you'd be able to get out an app and get a car in two minutes.\"",
  "latent_10463": "10 Ways to Live Longer, Without Help from Google\n\nXconomy National —\n\nWith a simple blog post or news exclusive, Google can instantly glamorize any field of research, whether it’s teaching cars to drive themselves, sending robotic rovers to the Moon, blanketing Earth with wireless data from balloons, or—this week—helping people live longer. The airiest of promises from the company evokes the world’s awe and admiration, and raises our expectations enormously.\n\nAfter all, we nod, why shouldn’t the same “10x thinking” that helped Google tame the Web, earn a vast fortune on keyword-based ads, and build the world’s leading mobile operating system allow it to solve other pressing problems, like, say, death? “Oh great, Google is on the case!” we say. “I guess we can just sit back and wait for those robot chauffeurs and longevity pills.”\n\nI certainly applaud Google’s boldness—at least they’re using their billions for something other than just making more billions. But Calico, the Google-founded company that will reportedly develop new technologies to tackle aging and age-related illness, already shows hallmarks of what scholar Evgeny Morozov has called “technological solutionism”—the idea that there’s no problem so large that it can’t be solved with enough data and processors.\n\n“I have some knowledge of [anti-aging technology], just being in Silicon Valley,” Google CEO Larry Page told Time in an exclusive interview published this week. Curing cancer, Page said, is “not as big an advance as you might think”—the implication being that Calico means to think even bigger.\n\nWhat worries me every time I hear about another “moon shot” project like Calico is that the resulting media coverage will reinforce the hero worship that already surrounds companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook, and make us complacent about the future. Too often, the fixation on what’s coming next from these companies draws our attention away from the simpler things that can be done to make the world better right now.\n\nDid you know, for example, that an inexpensive blue-LED phototherapy light developed by a San Francisco non-profit called D-Rev has been used to treat more than 7,000 infants born with jaundice, saving 142 babies from death or disability? That’s Silicon Valley innovation at work too—but because it’s not about apps or big data, you aren’t going to read about it in TechCrunch.\n\nThe truth is that if we want to live longer as individuals, or improve life expectancy across the human population, there are plenty of low-tech, low-cost health strategies that yield big rewards. We don’t need to wait years while Arthur Levinson, the chairman of Genentech and Apple and now the CEO of Calico, starts putting Google’s money to work. Here are 10 things consumers, citizens, elected leaders, and medical providers can do right now to boost life expectancy:\n\n1. Support Improvements in Maternal and Prenatal Care\n\nThe absolute best way to raise the average lifespan of a country’s population is to reduce the number of infants who die from preventable causes. That’s a complex problem, but two good ways to fix high infant mortality rates in the U.S. (we’re a shocking 27th in the world rankings) would be to improve overall care for women, especially those with chronic conditions like diabetes and obesity, and expand access to prenatal care for pregnant women. More smoking-cessation programs for pregnant moms would be another big boost. There’s also some research showing that scheduling C-sections later, when possible, would reduce the rate of complications due to pre-term birth.\n\n2. Vaccinate Yourself and Your Children\n\nIt’s a crime that Jenny McCarthy has been allowed to continue her ill-informed crusade to warn parents about a non-existent link between vaccines and autism. (And shame on ABC for giving her an even louder megaphone.) The truth is that the declining rate of death from infectious disease—almost entirely due to the arrival of vaccinations and better sanitation in the 20th century—is one of the biggest contributors to growing lifespans globally. The risk of side effects from vaccinations is tiny compared to the risks of catching a condition like measles, which killed 2.6 million children every year before vaccination became routine.\n\n3. Stay Out of the Hospital\n\nI’m not joking. The gruesome truth is that 1 in 10 people admitted to U.S. hospitals get a new infection while they’re there; these nasty, often antibiotic-resistant bugs kill 100,000 hospital patients every year. If you have to go to a hospital, it pays to look for one with low infection rates (25 states now require hospitals to report rates of common infections). Smart hospitals are fighting bacteria like staph and C. difficile by doing basic things like cleaning rooms more carefully, following checklists, and enforcing hygiene standards like hand-washing.\n\n4. Take Your Medicines As Directed\n\nDeaths from coronary artery disease, stroke, and diabetes could be cut drastically if people were better at managing their blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And there are good medications to control all these conditions; the real problem is that half of all drugs dispensed in the U.S. every year aren’t taken as prescribed. So, take your medicine on schedule. If you or a loved one need some help with that, check out companies like MedMinder that offer automatic pill dispensers. Researchers say increasing medication adherence on a truly large scale will take better coaching by doctors and pharmacists, as well as price breaks for people who can’t afford maintenance medications.\n\n5. Get Rid of Your Gun, or Lock It Away\n\nHaving a gun in your home drastically increases the risk that someone in your family will be die in a gun-related accident, suicide, or homicide. The position of the American Academy of Pediatrics is that the best way to protect kids from gun violence is to remove guns from homes altogether. But if you must exercise your Second Amendment rights, lock your gun away in a safe. That way, anyone who’s feeling suicidal or murderous will be forced to turn to less lethal means.\n\n6. Don’t Drive\n\nAfter the four big “natural” causes of death—heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, and stroke—the most common way to die in this country is to get into an automobile accident. So getting rid of your car is a hugely healthy step. But unfortunately it only eliminates half of your risk, given that half of all traffic fatalities involve pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Until those infallible robot cars come along, we all need to wear seat belts and look both ways when crossing the street.\n\n7. Eat Like a Vegetarian\n\n“Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.” That’s author Michael Pollan’s seven-word summary of the best nutritional strategy for avoiding major killers like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Eating less red meat can lower your risk of heart disease, and foods like berries, broccoli, and tomatoes contain antioxidants that neutralize the free radicals thought to damage cells. Limiting your overall food intake—leaving the table before you’re full—is also an excellent idea. Not so much because of the studies linking caloric restriction to increased lifespan in mammals (that scientific fad seems to be passing), but because it will help you sidestep obesity and all of its attendant health problems.\n\n8. Exercise 20 to 30 Minutes a Day\n\nYes, this is a no-brainer, but it’s one you can’t afford to dismiss. A recent study from the National Cancer Institute showed that adults who exercise moderately to vigorously for at least 150 minutes per week live 3.4 to 4.5 years longer than those who don’t exercise. If you need a better reason than that, consider that exercise also improves your mood, energy level, sleep quality, and sex life.\n\n9. Be Social and Beat Stress\n\nOne key to successful aging may be controlling inflammation, which contributes to atherosclerosis, diabetes, and dementia. And one way to control inflammation is to reduce stress. Hanging out with your friends or loved ones turns out to be a big stress reducer and life-extender. That may be because people who feel connected to groups have a sense of purpose and take better care of themselves, according to one group of researchers at Brigham Young University. The converse also seems to be true—a lack of social interaction is as damaging to health as smoking, being an alcoholic, or never exercising.\n\n10. Get a Cat\n\nThe day may come when physicians prescribe a pet as a way to increase life expectancy. A 10-year study of 4,300 U.S. residents by the Minnesota Stroke Institute found that the risk of death from a heart attack was 30 percent lower among study participants who currently owned—or had ever owned—a cat. Alas, there weren’t enough dog owners in the group to reveal whether canines have a similar effect.\n\nI could have listed plenty of other longevity tips. Don’t smoke, obviously. Get your vitamins—including Vitamin D, which is best obtained spending 15 minutes a day outdoors in the sun. Limit your alcohol intake. Floss daily—it not only slows tooth decay and gum disease, but lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease. See your doctor regularly and get all the usual health screenings, in order to catch real problems early.\n\nThe point is that we don’t need to wait for some amazing Google-funded medical advance in order to start improving our own chances of living to 100 or beyond. In fact, modernity itself is adding to our lifespans even as we go about our daily tasks. In high-income countries, average life expectancy has been increasing at the rate of 2.0 to 2.5 years every decade since 1900, and there’s no sign that those gains are tailing off.\n\nThat means more people are avoiding early death from malnutrition and infectious disease, and living to an age when heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s start to be bigger problems. So if Google and Calico can make progress toward curing those conditions, more power to them. But personally, I’m not going to trust my future to the “I’m feeling lucky” button.",
  "latent_10484": "WELLAND\n\nThe gold medal was a perfect accessory to what Canadian kayaker Mark de Jonge treated as a dress rehearsal for the big race that awaits in 2016.\n\nThe world champion and Olympic bronze medallist from Nova Scotia added Pan Am gold to his growing collection on a rainy Tuesday morning here. And he did it with what is becoming his usual forceful effort in the men’s K-1 200 metres.\n\nIn the process, de Jonge may be powering his way to becoming one of the more prominent faces of Canada’s accomplished canoe-kayak team and a huge medal contender for next summer’s Rio Olympics.\n\n“I was really happy to see that there was pressure here, see it as a good thing and being able to perform under pressure pressure was amazing,” De Jonge said at a wet Welland Flatwater Centre where the canoe-kayak sprint competition wrapped up.\n\n“I had a really strong plan for these games and everything went to plan. I will take all of that forward to next year, which is great.”\n\nWith the world championships still five weeks away, de Jonge viewed the Pan Am competition as a perfect checkpoint on his road to Rio. He knew he’d get some heat from some his South American opponents, he knew there’s be some pressure to perform in front of the home crowd and he knew it would give him another indication of his progress.\n\nMission accomplished on three levels, with an added bonus of a bronze medal later in the morning when he teamed with partner Pierre-Luc Poulin in a dead heat for third in the K-2 200 metres.\n\nDe Jonge’s rise to the top of his sport is a true tale of an athlete taking advantage of opportunity. Prior to the London 2012 Olympics, he was coming back from a broken finger and the beginnings of a career as an engineer.\n\nBut when his sport’s governing body opted to replace the 500-metre events with 200 metres, it was de Jonge’s athletic calling. The explosiveness that was his strong suit was made for the new event and despite not training for a full Olympic quadrennial, he was able to reach the podium in London.\n\nWhile he trained hard for the 2012 Games, he did so fitting it around first his studying and later his work schedule. And he was still able to win bronze.\n\n“All that stuff, the broken finger, coming back from the job in engineering added to the drama of (being in London),” De Jonge said. “I made the epic climb to the top of the world in a couple of years.\n\n“Now the story is really different. I’m a full-time athlete now and I’ve been training consistently for several years towards this one goal. I’ve continued that climb and continue to refine and work on the details I just didn’t have time to do back then. It’s become a lot more refined now and I see myself on top of that podium.”\n\nDe Jonge knows there will be expectations on him next year in Brazil and he’s ready to embrace it. It’s the reason he left a career and the benefits of Dalhousie University engineering degree behind him to train full time for Rio.\n\nThough the world championships next month will be more important – a good result is needed to qualify his boat for Rio – de Jonge integrated the Pan Ams into his training strategy.\n\nWith Tuesday’s result, it will only add to the confidence that if he continues on his current path, a different colour of medal could be awaiting him next summer.\n\n“I do want to win, but the real joy is having the perfect race,” de Jonge said. “To me, chasing that sense of perfection and to have all those little fine details come together on one day, win or lose, I think it’s going to make me pretty happy.\n\n“Last year, I became a world champion and all those little steps that I’ve taken, feel like the pieces are in place for me to have success.”\n\nrob.longley@sunmedia.ca\n\ntwitter.com/longleysunsport",

They are actors, novelists, writers, directors, celebrities, names, all names, big names (who got left off?). The EU may be facing the darkest crisis in its existence, but never has it received such a dazzling testimonial.\n\nIt is indelicate to ask how an Equity card conveys authority on target two balances, optimum currency areas and the sheep-meat premium.

I am sure the same might be said of commentators, except that some of us do at least try to read up on the subject.\n\nA few lucky people have done well out of European subsidies. There is no reason for such subsidies to be decried. But that lucky people benefit from Brussels’ largesse is hardly a clincher for everyone else. It is also absurd to imply that British actors excluded from the EU would be “outsiders shouting from the wings”. Most do far more work in America anyway, which is outside the EU’s open borders.\n\nThey are hardly outsiders in Hollywood. These are bad, silly arguments. There is no open EU market in services and that is a fact. It is one of the EU’s many failures.\n\nThe luvvies’ letter, like those on both sides from sportsmen, scientists and cheap-jack employers, merely shows what we know: that most people vote with their wallets. Political argument is easier when couched, not in facts or predictions, but in fears and favours. We search the news for signs of comfort, not for reasons. When Montagues and Capulets meet at the street corner they do not swap statistics. They puff up their finery. They boast their allies and show their muscle.\n\nRemain’s purpose today is to show the Brexit tribe as a bunch of outsiders, small guys, nobodies, people who cannot dream of “vital EU funding”.

  "latent_10589": "The Reproducibility Project: Psychology (OSC, 2015) was a huge effort by many different psychologists across the world to try and assess whether the effects of a selection of papers could be replicated. This was in response to the growing concern about the (lack of) reproducibility of many psychological findings with some high profile failed replications being reported (Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2016 for ego-depletion and Ranehill, Dreber, Johannesson, Leiberg, Sul, & Weber, 2015 for power-posing). They reported that of the 100 replication attempts, only ~35 were successful. This provoked a strong reaction not only in the psychological literature but also in the popular press, with many news outlets reporting on it.\n\nBut it wasn't without its critics: Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, & Wilson ( 2016) examined the RP:P's data using confidence intervals and came to a different conclusion. They were looking for \"whether the point estimate of the replication effect size [fell] within the confidence interval of the original\" (Srivastava, 2016). Some of the authors from the RP:P responded (Anderson et al., 2016) by pointing out some of the errors in the Gilbert et al. paper. Another analysis was provided by Sanjay Srivastava ( 2016) who highlighted that whilst Gilbert et al. use confidence intervals, they incorrectly define them (calling into question any conclusions they draw). Etz & Vandekerckhove ( 2016) reanalysed 72 of the original studies' data using Bayes' statistics and found 64% of those 72 studies (both originals and replications) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis. Simonsohn ( 2016) argued that rather than ~65% of the replications failing, ~30% failed to replicate and ~30% of the replications were inconclusive.*\n\nBut there is one response and one explanation for the low replication rate I want to focus on: the context sensitivity of an experiment.\n\nLocation, location, location:\n\nContext sensitivity is the idea that where you conduct an experiment has a large impact on it. It is a type of hidden moderator as it is a variable that affects the experiment that usually isn't being directly manipulated or controlled by the researcher. The environment in which you perform the study plays a role in the result and should be considered when conducting a replication. It is argued that you cannot detach the \"experimental manipulations... from the cultural and historical contexts that define their meanings\" (Touhey, 1981). The context of an experiment is very important in social psychology and it has been studied for years, with evidence that it does shape people's behaviour (for one of many examples, you can look at Fiske, Gilbert, Lindzey; 2010).\n\nvan Bavel, Mende-Siedlecki, Brady, & Reinero ( 2016) argue that context sensitivity partly explains the poor replication rate of the RP:P. They found that the context sensitivity of a study (rated by 3 students with high inter-rater reliability) had a statistically significant negative correlation with the success of the replication attempt (r=−0.23, P = 0.02). This means the more contextually sensitive the finding was, the less likely it was to replicate. It was still significantly associated with replication success after controlling for the sample size of the original study (which has been suggested to have a significant impact on the success of a replication; Vankov, Bowers, Munafò, 2014). It was not the best predictor of a replication though: the statistical power of the replication and how surprising the replication was were the strongest predictors. They also analysed the data to see whether the discipline of psychology the original study was taken from (either social or cognitive psychology) moderated the relationship between contextual sensitivity and replication success. They did not find a significant interaction (this last point is very important but I'm going to examine it in more detail further on).\n\nSo this study appears to show that contextual differences had a significant impact on replication rates and that it should be taken into account when considering the results of the RP:P.\n\nThere's no such thing as...\n\nOne of the responses to the paper was by Berger ( 2016). He stated that \"context sensitivity\" is too vague a concept to be of any scientific use. There are an enormous number of ways that \"context\" could impact on a finding and to present it as a uni-dimensional construct (as was done in van Bavel et al, 2016) is illogical. Context sensitivity can therefore be used to justify any unexplained variance in psychological results. He calls for a more rigorous and falsifiable definition of context sensitivity (namely lack of theory specificity and heterogeneity) and for researchers to be specific when it comes to the source of the problems e.g. is it variation in the population, location, time-period, etc. He also argues that researchers should a prior predict the heterogeneity and effect directions so we can scientifically evaluate the effect of these hidden moderators.\n\nThe hidden variable:\n\nAnother problem with the paper was highlighted by Schimmack ( 2016) and Inbar (in press). When you run the analyses again and properly control for sub-discipline (rather than test for the interaction as was originally done), the significant result van Bavel et al. found disappears (from p=0.02 to p=0.51). They also calculated the correlation within groups (so the correlation between context sensitivity and replication success for cognitive psychology studies and for social psychology studies) and again found non-significant results (r = -.04, p = .79 and r = -.08, p = .54 respectively). This suggests context sensitivity only has a significant impact on replication rates when you don't control for sub-discipline (so some disciplines of psychology are more likely to replicate than others). van Bavel has replied to this by arguing you can't control for sub-discipline as it is \"part of the construct of interest\" (van Bavel, 2016).\n\nSimpson's Paradox:\n\nSo how does Simpson's Paradox fit into all this? (Not those Simpsons unfortunately, Edward H. Simpson). Well, this is a perfect example of Simpson's paradox: where a trend is found when groups are combined but disappears or reverses when they are examined separately. The classic example comes from Bickel, Hammel, & O'Connell ( 1975). They examined the admission rates for graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley for 1973. They appeared to show a gender bias towards men as 44% were admitted whereas only 35% of women were.\n\nBut when you examine all of the departments individually they show that 6 of them admitted more women than men (and 4 admitted more men than women). When analysed, this preference for females was shown to be statistically significant. So how does this work? It's because of a third variable: rate of admission within the department. As stated in the article: \"The proportion of women applicants tends to be high in departments that are hard to get into and low in those that are easy to get into.\"\n\nTable showing the 6 most applied to departments [Wikipedia]\n\nThis is exactly the same thing that happened in the van Bavel (2016) paper: the original significant finding (r=−0.23, P = 0.02) disappeared after you controlled the hidden variable of sub-discipline.\n\nSo what does all this mean?\n\nThe purpose of this post isn't to show that context sensitivity doesn't have an impact on the RP:P (it almost certainly did and it will have an impact on other research).

  "latent_10821": "Photo by Tony Webster\n\n***\n\nIn the fall of 2013, the town council of Sorrento, Louisiana voted to abolish its own police department.\n\nDespite the obvious drawbacks of going without law enforcement protection, the vote was unanimous.\n\nJust two months earlier, a newly hired officer had gotten into a 100 mile-per-hour car wreck on the highway. It was later revealed that the same cop was already one of the town’s most zealous issuers of speeding tickets, hundreds of which were later thrown out in court.\n\nBut that was only the latest controversy to befall Sorrento’s men and women in blue. The previous spring, the department had been forced to fire two of its members—one, an assistant chief, for undisclosed reasons, and another, a rank-and-file officer for improperly using his Taser on a college student. This scandal, in turn, had come on the heels of three sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits filed by former police officers against the chief of police himself.\n\nYet it was neither scandal nor lawsuit nor budget cut that finally compelled the town leaders to give their disreputable police department the axe. Instead, the death blow had come from a soft spoken man in Baton Rouge named Jerry Cronin.\n\nCronin is the general manager of Risk Management Inc., a for-profit risk pool that provides legal liability protection to two-thirds of the police departments in the state of Louisiana. As the organization ultimately responsible for the Sorrento Police Department’s ever-mounting legal bills, Cronin finally decided that enough was enough.\n\n“We just didn’t feel like the supervision was adequate to protect our risk,” he explains. “They basically ignored underwriting regulations—the things we required them to do, they didn’t do.”\n\nSo Risk Management canceled the Sorrento P.D.’s coverage. Without legal liability insurance, a single patrol car accident, wrongful arrest, or workers’ compensation claim could bankrupt the government of the small town. In the face of such legal risk, the town council made the only choice they could. A month after Cronin’s decision, the department was gone.\n\nAbolishing an unaccountable police agency with the stroke of a pen—police reform advocates can only dream of such power.\n\nOver the last few years, police shootings in Ferguson, Chicago, Charleston, and countless other cities and towns across the country have brought unprecedented attention to the question of when police should use lethal force and how cities should respond to allegations of police misconduct. Though reformers often point to independent prosecutors and civilian review boards as possible arbiters of good policing, one unlikely change-agent has largely been left out of the conversation: the insurance company.\n\nAs the town of Sorrento shows, the financial corporations that provide legal liability insurance to police departments can sometimes succeed where activists and journalists fail. Because while police departments may be able to ignore protest and moral condemnation, they are less likely to overlook the appeal of lower insurance premiums or the threat of coverage termination. With ample financial resources, well-honed analytical capabilities, and a profit-driven focus on avoiding lawsuits, insurance companies might just be reform advocates' best hope for bringing abusive police departments in line.\n\nSurrogate Regulators\n\nThe basic premise behind law enforcement legal liability insurance is straight-forward: if a police department has insurance and it gets sued, the insurance company picks up the legal tab. This gives insurance companies a strong motivation to keep the departments that they insure out of court. In the words of John Rappaport, a law professor at the University of Chicago, this transforms the insurance companies into “surrogate regulators.”\n\nAs a rule, law enforcement agencies do not go out of their way to get sued. Police chiefs and city mayors certainly care about their legal liability. But according to Rappaport, insurance companies might care better.\n\n“They have the profit motive,” he says. “The insurance company is the one that wants to turn around and put pressure on the police department to make it rank-and-file officers behave better.”\n\nIn contrast, city officials have “a more complicated profile,” he says.\n\nAside from not getting sued, a police chief may also want to minimize crime, to keep the police union happy, or to stick to the department’s budget.\n\nImagine a department is offered a particular training program that promises to improve officer behavior and reduce the risk of lawsuit. But let’s say it also costs tens of thousands of dollars and is likely to irk the cops on the street who feel like they're being told how to do their jobs. A police chief will have to prioritize these various concerns. Minimizing legal liability may not always come out on top.\n\nAn insurance company, on the other hand, doesn’t care about the crime rate or the union or the city budget. It just wants to minimize payouts.\n\n“It’s not too hard to imagine scenarios, especially where a city government is not working particularly well, where the insurance company might have the edge [at minimizing risk],” says Rappaport.\n\nThis runs against the conventional wisdom. Up until just a few decades ago, most towns actually prevented their police departments from buying liability insurance. After all, the entire premise of this type of coverage is that law enforcement agencies are insulated from the consequences of their own risky behavior.\n\nEconomists call this concept “moral hazard” and it applies to all types of insurance. Someone with a policy on their car is less likely to buy an alarm because if the car is broken into, the insurance company will pay for the new window. A bank with FDIC-backing is more likely to make risky investments, because they won’t face any downside if those lousy bets go bust. Likewise, an insured police department might take fewer steps to reduce incidents of wrongful arrest, illegal use-of-force, or sexual harassment.\n\nBut beginning in the 1960s, concerns about moral hazard began to give way to concerns about litigation. The Supreme Court bolstered the rights of suspects and defendants in rulings like Monroe v. Pape (which made it easier for citizens to sue city governments for civil rights violations) and Miranda v. Arizona (of “you have the right to remain silent” fame). Suddenly, police departments were exposed to a wave of potential lawsuits. Cities and towns across the country began turning to private insurance companies or banding together to form insurance pools. They did this, despite the fear that insured police departments might behave more recklessly, because they couldn’t afford not to.\n\nPhoto by Fibonacci Blue\n\nBut according to Rappaport, legal liability insurance arrangements may actually improve police department behavior because these contracts come with strings attached. If an insurer wants to stay in business, it has to be smart about encouraging, training, or browbeating the various departments that it insures into staying out of court.\n\nInsurance companies do this with both carrots and sticks.\n\nPreventing Loss By Any Means Necessary\n\nIn the insurance industry biz, these carrots and sticks are called “loss-prevention programs.” In a paper posted earlier this year, Rappaport details the lengths that these companies will go to in order to keep their insured departments from being sued. Some of the methods are more straight-forward than others.\n\nIn some cases, insurance companies will either hold or subsidize training programs. These can range from information sessions to sophisticated virtual reality simulators designed to teach police officers how to safely pursue a fleeing car or when (and when not) to shoot a suspect.\n\nThese simulators and training sessions serve a dual role: insurance companies teach their insured officers to behave in a way that will minimize litigation and police officers learn some valuable legal, technical, and administrative skills. Sometimes the departments get lower premiums too. Think of this like your health insurance company subsidizing your gym membership to keep you healthy.\n\nBut sometimes insurance companies will step beyond the role of useful noodge and directly into the business of writing police department policies. This can actually be useful for small town police departments, where staff are small and the level of expertise is low. A five-person sheriff department might very well welcome a bean counter from the insurance company offering a pre-written use-of-force guideline.\n\nAnd when these various incentives and encouragements fail, insurance companies can always roll out the Sorrento option. According to an article in the Washington Post, city officials in Maywood, California, and Lincoln Heights, Ohio have disbanded their police departments at the behest of their insurers. Likewise, the towns of Waukeegan, Illinois and Irwindale, California were forced to enact major reforms.\n\nInsurance companies can be very specific in their demands. In 2013, the police department in Niota, Tennessee was required to fire two of its officers. According to the town’s mayor, Niota’s municipal insurance provider had threatened to drop the town’s coverage if the two cops, who had been accused of beating a suspect, remained on the payroll.\n\nPresumably, this was not an ethical decision, but an unfeeling, financial one.\n\n“When activists and civil rights litigators and criminal defense lawyers talk about police behavior, it’s dripping with moral judgment,” says Rappaport, from the University of Chicago. “With the insurers, the language is very anodyne. It’s just ‘look, we have a problem, we’re experiencing a greater than average loss, and we need to control this loss.’”\n\nPhoto by 888bailbond\n\nPolice departments and city bureaucrats may ultimately be more receptive to that kind of language and logic, he says.\n\n“It is a moral issue,” says Rappaport. “But in terms of optimizing outcomes on the ground, I’m not convinced that making it all a moral issue and passing moral judgment on the police...I don’t know if that’s the right way to go.”\n\nNot A Silver Bullet\n\nBut if legal liability insurance is the right way to minimize alleged police misconduct, we still have a long way to go.\n\nAccording to Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA Law, while most law enforcement agencies rely on insurance, most of the big city police departments (“and, presumably, the vast majority of liability claims,” she writes) tend to go without.\n\nInstead, many large cities will simply set aside a certain amount of money and build their own risk management programs and legal war chests in-house.\n\nThe decision to self-insure may be entirely rational. Insurance companies bring financial resources, risk-management expertise, and risk pooling opportunities to the table. Big cities have all three of these at their disposal. But for those who are looking to insurance companies as the de facto regulators of the police, this presents an obvious problem: insurance companies, writes Schwartz, “can only influence those law enforcement agencies that purchase insurance.”\n\nJohn Rappaport from the University of Chicago has considered the possibility of an insurance mandate for police agencies. The idea is appealing: if insurance companies are better at regulating risk and the police departments most in need of risk management are self-insuring, why not force these go-it-alone law enforcement agencies to enter the market?\n\nBut Rappaport says he isn’t so sure that the relative success that insurance companies have had in keeping smaller police departments in line could be replicated at the big city level. Large police departments are complex organizations. Reducing misconduct across the board may take more than simply getting the incentives right at the top.\n\n“I pity the insurance adjuster who has to penetrate the bureaucracy of the City of Chicago to get things done,” he says.\n\nPlus, the benevolent influence of insurance companies can be selective.\n\nAfter all, an insurance company is only interested in avoiding large legal payments. Thus, they are likely to encourage their insured police departments to avoid misconduct, but only the kind that might result in large legal payments. Avoiding less financially deleterious civil rights infringements is not likely to be a top priority.\n\nPhoto by Michael Fleshman\n\n“Not all the things we call police misconduct are equal in the eyes of insurers,” says Rappaport. “With use-of-force and [vehicle] pursuit policies, we can expect insurers to be pretty good and pretty proactive on those issues.”\n\nThat’s because an unjustified shootings or a police-caused car wrecks are the stuff of multimillion dollar lawsuits. But not all misconduct packs such a big financial punch.\n\nFor example, stop-and-frisk.\n\n“As big of a problem as it is on a societal level,” says Rappaport, “if you conduct an illegal stop-and-frisk, there’s no [financial] damages.”\n\nThat’s both because courts do not typically award substantial damages for illegal searches, but also because the people who are most commonly stopped and frisked are often the least likely to have ready access to legal representation. As a result, insurance companies often regard these types of official misconduct as “low dollar” infractions, he says.\n\nAs a financial calculation, reasonable search-and-seizure virtual reality simulators probably just aren’t worth the investment.\n\nMoving the Needle\n\nStill, there is some evidence that the insurance companies are pushing police departments in the direction of reform.\n\nIn 2015, a month after Freddie Gray was killed while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department, John Chino, a California public entity insurance broker, told Risk & Insurance that police shootings now “lead the conversation” within the industry, even if they hadn’t yet had a major impact on premiums across the market.\n\nAnd as high-profile police shootings encourage litigants to come out of the woodwork and prime jurors to distrust police officers, he predicted that “law enforcement claims are going to be way more expensive to defend.”\n\nIn the meantime, insurers are pushing cities to update their training and adopt body cameras. At the same time, many of the certification and training programs that insurance companies contract with have also revised their policies in recent years. The Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) may be the most prominent of these organizations. According to Daniel Shaw, a CALEA program manager, the non-profit used the Obama administration’s “21’st Century Policing” report and recent Department of Justice investigations on policing misconduct as its “benchmark” when it overhauled its law enforcement standards manual a year and a half ago.\n\n“They are on alert now,” says John Rappaport. “[Insurers] woke up and thought, ‘aw crap, we’ve been pretty lax for a while.’”\n\nAccording to Rappaport, the string of high-profile police shootings that have dominated headlines in recent years has had a subtle effect on the legal liability industry. Though the incidents occur all too regularly from a human perspective, they are still relatively rare as a matter of actuarial risk. The insurance industry is not facing a wave of claims resulting from the shooting of unarmed civilians.\n\nBut what these incidents (and the resulting protests) have done is reduced the level of trust between civilians and police. And that, he says, has a big financial impact.\n\n“If tomorrow some cop shoots someone or beats someone up in Paris, Texas, well those potential jurors have been watching the TV and seeing what’s happening in Ferguson and Cleveland,” says Rappaport.\n\nToday, more so than a few years ago, if a police officer goes to court, the jury may now be less likely to reflexively take him at his word. That has insurers in Paris, Texas, and everywhere else, worried. And when insurers get worried, police departments should take note.\n\nOur next article examines the data to figure out what percentage of people don’t get married on Saturday.

  "latent_10899": "2015 Seahawks Re-Watch, Wild Card Playoff: Little to the Left\n\nBy utilizing home field advantage, the Seattle Seahawks had propelled themselves to consecutive NFC Championship wins. As a sixth seed in 2015, they would have to win out on the road to experience Super Bowl glory. While historically an inconsistent road team, this year’s Seahawks, after losing their first three away games, had actually won out the regular season at San Francisco, Dallas, Minnesota, Baltimore and Arizona. This playoff game was hosted at a locale the Hawks surely remembered, but not exactly how they remembered it. TCF Stadium was home to the Minnesota Vikings, the exact stadium they had played in on December 6th, save on December 6th the temperature at kickoff was 37 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas it was minus-six degrees for this January 10th matchup, making it one of the coldest playoffs games ever.\n\nCold weather and its effects had been a hot topic. In 2014’s playoffs, the New England Patriots had been using under-inflated footballs during a game against the Indianapolis Colts. Some argued that taking a football from room temperature to forty degrees could naturally-but-not-significantly change its air pressure. If so, then a ball at below freezing temperatures faced far greater challenges than just its inflation. The characteristics of the ball—its feel, weight, and grip—could change so dramatically that quarterbacks struggle to intuitively know how hard to throw a ball and how to put an appropriate arc on it. Likewise, receivers may not correctly anticipate how a ball will handle when caught or may find that errant passes exceed their catch radius. Players who handle snaps faced the same challenges. But, if the cold so affected the football, what it did to the field conditions was worse. Fortunately, this would present no issue during the wildcard game, as TCF had had a hydronic heated field installed prior to the Vikings moving into the facility.\n\n* * *\n\nClearly affected by the weather, Russell Wilson was floating throws from the start, beginning the game 1 of 4 for 7 yards. The inability to reach the second level put caution in offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, who abandoned his timed passing system for shorter passes. The offensive improved but the consequences were damning. The Seahawks who lit up the Vikings for 35 points would no show the wildcard game.\n\nDoug Baldwin injected early life in the offense with a 22-yard reception, and eventually caught the game’s sole touchdown, but his greatest feat occurred early in the second half. On 3rd and 10, Baldwin came up from the slot. He shimmied before heading inside. It was not the greatest route, nor was Baldwin necessarily open, but Wilson fired at his go-to receiver anyway. The throw was high and behind. Baldwin stopped hard before jumping backward, twisting himself to face the pass. At the peak of his leap, Baldwin extended his arm, his hand, his fingers to the furthest his joints would allow. He tamed the wild throw in his grasp, securing it in both hands as he rolled to the ground.\n\nHaving vastly improved as a pocket quarterback, what set Wilson apart was still his creativity under duress. In this slugfest, it would again be his greatest attribute. At the beginning of the fourth, with the Hawks down by nine, center Patrick Lewis joined the long list of players who struggled controlling the football. He sent a corkscrewing snap at Wilson that went over Wilson’s shoulder. The ball bounced backward, and Wilson chased it, sliding to establish possession. On his hands and knees, five Vikings were closing in and not a one had a Seahawk in his path. Two-handing the ball, Wilson planted his left foot. His first step was so fast that cornerback Captain Munnerlyn was turned around by it. Suddenly free of this purple net, Wilson took off for the sidelines. With linebacker Eric Kendricks barreling down on him, Wilson located Tyler Lockett, whom the Vikings secondary had lost in the confusion. The sixteen yard pass was off-target, but Lockett leapt to catch it. With only cornerback Xavier Rhodes in his way, Lockett circumvented Rhodes by taking a wide run-around past Rhode’s flank. Jermaine Kearse came down to assist, splitting Lockett and Rhodes as they passed, a very savvy football move on Kearse’s part. Lockett reached the four yard line before cornerback Josh Robinson brought him down by the neck, dragging Lockett out of bounds.\n\nThe drive resulted in a touchdown.\n\n* * *\n\nThe unanticipated wrinkle of the week was not only the weather, it was the sudden loss of Marshawn Lynch. Absent the team since week 11, due to his rehabbing of a surgically repaired abdomen, Lynch rejoined the Hawks for the playoff run. He had practiced with the team and taken the majority of snaps. By week’s end, Lynch was supposedly ready to go, with Pete Carroll saying, “He’s going to play.” But then, under vague circumstances, Lynch benched himself and did not board the plane to Minnesota. For the eighth consecutive week, Lynch did not dress, and with this latest setback, many wondered if Beast Mode was gone forever.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fuel that kept the Vikings offense operating was Adrian Peterson. In week 13, Peterson was held to 18 yards, a feat the Vikings knew could not be repeated. Well, try as they did, the Seahawks defense was too suffocating for even the legendary tailback to thwart. The Hawks were committed to run stuffing, holding Peterson to 45 yards on 23 carries.\n\nOn the game’s first play, the defense played run with Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor at the line of scrimmage while the linebackers were two yards off the heels of the defensive line. At the snap, Michael Bennett shed offensive lineman Brandon Fusco like he were swatting away a bee. Using his right arm, Bennett wrapped up Peterson, displaying the strength of a bear. Peterson’s attempted escape was shut down by Sherman, who had come from the edge to complete the tackle. Later in the drive, on 3rd and 1, Bennett shed his blocker and dove into the backfield, grabbing onto Peterson’s ankle. Peterson escaped by backtracking. As Peterson did so, Bobby Wagner leapt over Bennett, grabbing ahold of Peterson’s shin. Kam Chancellor leapt third, clawing at Peterson’s shin, as well. Peterson escaped both by running backwards, but he stumbled. KJ Wright put an arm into him, followed by DeShawn Shead standing Peterson up, followed up Earl Thomas knocking Peterson backward. Jordan Hill got in on the fun, pushing Peterson back further. Mercifully, the play was whistled dead.\n\nLow scoring games could often be decided by a critical turnover, something Chancellor understood well. Earlier in the year, his forced fumble on Calvin Johnson prevented a loss against the Detroit Lions. In the fourth quarter against the Vikings, Chancellor found himself before a charging Peterson. With the ball held poorly, Peterson lowered his shoulder, but Chancellor, who had a physique that closer resembled a linebacker than a safety, accepted the blow, prying free the ball while doing so. Plays like these were Chancellor at his best, using his strength and size to impose his will, complimented by his high-risk, high-reward playing style. Kam was always looking for the big turnover, in any situation. But things didn’t always go according to plan. Chancellor often lined up out-of-position, trusting his athleticism to overcome any disadvantages his opponent may exploit. He could blow easy tackles by attempting to pick-pocket receivers and tailbacks. As easily as Kam’s gambling on Peterson created the deciding turnover, leading to a one-point lead, 10-9, it swung the game back in the Vikings favor. One play after giving up 19 yards on a pass interference penalty to tight end Kyle Rudolph, Chancellor was set to guard Rudolph again. Rudolph ran a dig, heading toward the sideline. Chancellor chose not to attack Rudolph’s legs, instead reaching in the cookie jar for either a pass deflection or a strip fumble. Chancellor never established his footing, but Rudolph did, and he shed Chancellor, running the sideline for a 24 yard gain.\n\nBefore these two plays, the ball was on the Vikings 39 with 1:38 left in the game. After them, the Vikings offense was 1st and 10 on the Seahawks 18 yard line with 1:26 left. And just like that, the defense was no longer solely facing the Vikings, but also its yearlong nemesis: losing a fourth quarter lead.\n\n* * *\n\nSpecial teams was the most affected by the chill. During the second quarter, with the score at 0-3, Pete Carroll passed on a forty-seven yard field goal attempt for a 4th and 13 dump off pass to Fred Jackson. This decision was costly, as Hauschka later made a forty-six yard field goal with little trouble; however, Carroll had reason to be concerned. Halfway through the first quarter, long-snapper Clint Greshman snapped the ball so low that punter John Ryan had to bend at both knees to control it, like he were fielding a ground ball. About to kick, Ryan’s motion was interrupted by Vikings receiver Adam Thielen. Ryan committed to a run, securing the football and heading forward. Somewhat forgetting himself, Ryan attempted to hurdle not only defensive back Melvin White but linebacker Jason Trusnik for the first down. The result was Ryan going bottoms-up and landing square on his facemask, leaving his nose bloody.\n\nThe Vikings special teams unit was excelling. Placekicker Blair Walsh converted field goals of 22 yards, 42 yards and 47 yards, accounting for all nine of Minnesota’s points. With 26 seconds left, he was set to kick a 27 yard field goal for all the marbles. The ball was a clean snap, though holder Jeff Locke presented the ball to Walsh with the laces in, a fact that many would say resulted in Walsh’s hooked attempt, missing the uprights. One player had a different theory. Walsh’s previous attempt was a fingernails length from being blocked by cornerback Richard Sherman, who had coiled up his body on the line of scrimmage as if he were a sprinter, a stance Sherman duplicated on the final kick. Sherman stated, “I think how close I got on the last one might have factored [into the missed field goal].” Walsh seemed to agree, stating, “When you pull it to the left like that you didn’t stay long enough into the kick and commit through it enough.”\n\nThe Seahawks survived a hard game, and avoided a fourth-quarter implosion, adding another tale to their long list of playoff highlights, including the Beast Quake, Sherman’s Tip, and Matthew’s onside recovery.\n\nThe divisional round will post next Tuesday, July 5th.

  "latent_11405": "The Legend of Zelda is a name so entrenched in gaming history that it’s been at the forefront of every major breakthrough in the industry. The first title in the series popularized more open-ended exploration in gaming in a time when high scores dominated the marketplace, Ocarina of Time helped bring the industry into the world of 3D models back in 1998, and Skyward Sword tried to show exactly what Nintendo wanted out of motion control on the Wii, even though it was too late. Now, The Legend of Zelda is at the forefront of the next frontier that blurs the lines between home and mobile gaming with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Make no mistake about it; this is a home console experience all the way, making it the perfect introduction to the Nintendo Switch. But more importantly, this is the culmination of every concept Nintendo had for the series since its inception, carefully planned and beautifully executed, making this a standout title in this beloved franchise.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a balancing act for Nintendo. Clearly, the company wants to flip the Zelda formula on its head, but somehow they manage to keep things feeling somewhat the same. Players are dropped into a Hyrule in despair as Link (this time you cannot change his name). He wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection upon hearing the voice of Zelda calling him to action. He has no recollection of who he is, where he came from, or what his purpose is, all he really has is this ancient tablet-like device called the Sheikah Slate. Thankfully, a kind, yet familiar looking character to long time players, fills him in.\n\nPlayers learn that in anticipation of the return of Ganon, Hylians began excavating Hyrule in search of Sheikah technology, not unlike his tablet, designed to stop Ganon as a prophecy foretold. During these digs, they found beastly, squid-like laser-shooting robots along with absolutely gigantic machines called Divine Beasts. With these machines, Link fought alongside Zelda to take down the most dangerous form of Ganon yet. They failed however, and Ganon took control of the technology that was supposed to save them, causing Link to go into a cryogenic state until the time was right to return. Now he’s back, but he’s lost his memory after his 100-year slumber. He must traverse a devastated Hyrule, slowly remembering who he was, the people he touched, and the world he needs to save.\n\nThe story cues are presented through voiced cut scenes, a first for the series (I refuse to acknowledge any of the CD-i titles that actually were the first to use voiced video for plot), which admittedly takes some time to get used to. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild jumps between the use of voice work, and traditional text box depending on the situation, and surprisingly, they complement each other very nicely. It is a little jarring when the first voiced scenes hit, but soon enough, it becomes just part of the experience like everything else. Some of the performances aren’t great, but for the most part, it’s passable, and the story is emotional and touching enough those players will be invested regardless of some of the less-than-stellar voice work at times.\n\nHyrule itself tells the story just as well as any cut scene, however. This is the largest, most beautiful Hyrule in the series. Easily dwarfing Skyrim, this completely interactive land is different from over-worlds in the past. It looks lived in, but devastated. Remnants of ancient civilizations are scattered throughout the fields, dilapidated wagons are found in the middle of paths. The fields are now over-run with bokoblins, with camps of them found scattered across the land, while others hide in tall grass or behind rocks waiting to ambush you. Yet, the emotions evoked from Hyrule tell a story of loss.\n\nMusic cues help hit that point home even further. While I don’t recall there being many iconic tracks this time around, this score is more atmospheric than ever. Sometimes that atmosphere is heightened by a lack of music altogether. In these situations, players are left to take in the surroundings with nothing more than the sound of Link’s boots and the rustling of trees. This lack of music drives home the despair felt across Hyrule, hitting the player in a way other Zelda games just couldn’t in the past.\n\nYet, small pockets of civilization remain. Throughout the adventure, players will run into people going about their daily business, staving off a bokoblin attacks, searching for treasure, or even looking to murder Link specifically. Humanity was shaken but not destroyed, and in a sense, it’s kind of inspirational. Towns are still intact, each with a distinct cultural feeling. Kakariko Village, for instance, parallels traditional Japanese structures, while the town next to it seems more European. The one thing these towns have in common, however, is a sense of optimism. These are the survivors, and while many of the residents now only know a post Calamity Ganon world, it hasn’t stopped the citizens of Hyrule from living.\n\nHyrule isn’t just a hub world anymore; it’s treated more like a temple with mini bosses, secrets, and surprising encounters scattered throughout the world. There is a new refreshing sense of wildlife as well, with different provinces hosting unique creatures that can be tamed or slaughtered depending on the animal’s type. The biggest change is how users interact with Hyrule. To start, the entire map isn’t shown right out of the gate. Instead, gigantic towers are scattered throughout the land, and players must climb them and place the Sheikah Slate in a slot at the top to unlock the area on the map in a very Ubisoft inspired manner. Sometimes these towers a test of Link’s stamina, along with the user’s patience, but once unlocked, players also have a fast travel point, so it’s worth it. The view is gorgeous as well and allows players to find the newly implemented Goddess Trials throughout the land.\n\nGoddess Trials are just one way the dungeon and temple experience has changed in The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, and in many ways, they compliment the mobile experience. Imagine a single room in a typical Zelda dungeon. Goddess Trials are scattered across Hyrule, and offer a more compact experience, usually offering one puzzle to solve. Players are rewarded at the end of the trial, and they can spend that reward on upgrading hearts or stamina. It’s an interesting new idea in the franchise, and a welcome one at that, especially if this is a game that will be taken out of the house, players might not have enough time to commit fully to a temple.\n\nThat’s because the temple experience should be witnessed at home on the big screen. Instead of going to a random dilapidated shrine-like in Zelda’s of the past, temples play a more active role in taking out Ganon. In fact, they aren’t even really temples; they’re the Divine Beasts. These are massive machines have turned on civilization, and Link must fight them to get inside and traverse their innards so he can essentially rewire them. Starting with a massive boss battle, then opening into a more traditional temple experience, I’ve never been so impressed with the design of a dungeon before. Inside one Divine Beast modelled after an elephant, for instance, Link can control the machine’s trunk to alter the way certain parts function and open up new areas.\n\nIt feels just enough like a Zelda title, but different enough that it is a wholly unique experience, and that is felt outside of temples as well. Hearts don’t really exist except as a way to track health. Instead, players hunt, gather, and cook to regain hearts, and temporarily boost attributes. This makes the way players approach combat completely different as enemies are stronger than ever, so running in head-on is not a smart approach. Instead, stealth plays a big role, as it gives Link a tactical advantage before all hell inevitably breaks loose. Staying out of sight, surveying the land, and waiting to strike are the most opportune ways to approach most combat. But the fighting mechanics themselves feel completely refined as well. There’s more strategy in each battle, with a higher emphasis on blocking and dodging. Link is more vulnerable this time around, so each battle has a heightened sense of drama. That’s only made worse on Blood Moon nights. This special event is introduced by the sky turning red and enemies looking beefier. Now, they’re stronger and more dangerous, so players need to be on their toes in this newly difficult Legend of Zelda title.\n\nIf that wasn’t a stressful enough, weapons all have a wear and tear factor, which has an effect on combat as well. Players can carry multiple weapons thankfully, but be prepared to go through a lot of weapons throughout the play through. Thankfully, there are some ways around wearing everything out. The Sheikah Slate mentioned earlier is filled with runes that can be used in combat. There are two bomb options, a magnet, stasis, and an ice block creator. Trying to blend that right mix of using the Slate and the eroding weapons will be the difference between life and death in most situations.\n\nThere are a variety of smaller effects that players need to track as well as they move across the countryside. First and foremost, next to the map, is a temperature gauge. Not unlike other Zelda titles, Link is affected by extreme temperature differences, so finding ways to keep him warm in the snow, or cool while climbing Death Mountain are essential. Noise will draw enemy’s attention, and there are a variety of factors that can cause them to take notice. The type of armour you use will affect how loud you are, or how fast you can move, and thus changing the play style of the user. There’s a lot to keep track of.\n\nBut with so much going on, it seems that sometimes The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can’t keep up. Whether that’s with small glitches like Link’s arrow case going through parts of his clothing, or more major hiccups like frame rate drops, it there are tons of small issues scattered throughout the experience. At one point, I had the game completely freeze on me, and I was just walking around. In the grand scheme of things though, these weren’t huge issues. The freeze only happened once, and the tight controls and beautiful, rich open world made me forget about any technical issues immediately.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece in design. This is the biggest free-flowing game I’ve ever experienced, and the fact that it’s in Hyrule only makes it that much sweeter. This is the perfect launch title for the Nintendo Switch, proving Nintendo can still make AAA titles that are uniquely their own. More importantly however, this is a much-needed shot in the arm to the franchise. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild throws the familiar in a completely new world, making for an experience unlike anything other all wrapped up in a Zelda tortilla. And even with some small technical issues, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the new benchmark for the series.",
  "latent_11603": "NASA shows off new algae farming technique for making biofuel RATE THIS! +0 Share Posted in Business on 17th Apr, 2012 01:19 AM by AlexMuller\n\nThe whole thing is called Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae or more concisely, OMEGA, and will be demonstrated to reporters at one of San Francisco’s public utilities water pollution control plants tomorrow and is the culmination of $10 million worth of research.\n\nThe idea is more practical than revolutionary says Trent, who has spoken to reporters already about the project. The idea was to figure out a way to create an algae farm that could be placed close to a waste treatment facility, without taking up a bunch of land. That’s when he came up with idea of using plastic bags floating in the ocean. Conventional systems use large pools of water set up on dry land. In the test facility, each bag is four meters long and has been seeded with wastewater and carbon dioxide. Sunlight makes its way through the clear plastic as the bags float on seawater, which not only serves as a place for the bags to reside, but also help keep the algae cool, which must be done mechanically in other facilities. The algae eat the wastewater and grow until the bag is filled, at which point it is removed to be used for making biofuel.\n\nReports thus far show that algae farms set up in this manner would be capable of producing over two and a half million gallons of fuel annually in an area just under two square miles.\n\nWastewater with oil-producing algae circulate through photobioreactors (green tubes) floating in a seawater tank at the San Francisco Southeast Wastewater Treatment Plant, where NASA has set up one of its OMEGA research facilities.\n\nTrent says with a real farm, the carbon dioxide come could from nearby power plants, helping to reduce the carbon footprint of the whole process. Not helping, on the other hand, is that the whole scheme is based on petroleum based plastic bags, which in addition to their inherent carbon footprint would also have to be disposed of once a year as they degrade in saltwater. Trent suggests that California farmer’s could use them as field cover instead of the large tarps they currently use. He also says that if one or more of the bags should break, like say in a storm, there is no worry as the algae would die in the seawater and the wastewater released would be the same as wastewater facilities such as those in San Francisco already pump into the bay.\n\nAt this point it seems clear that a new type of plastic will need to be developed for the project to become viable, especially if it is to be ported to space exploration applications at some point; perhaps one made from biodegradable material so that it could be grown along the way, and then could be used as fertilizer afterwards.",
  "latent_11702": "The most feverishly discussed show on Netflix right now isn’t an outrageous sadcom featuring a middle-aged comic playing a horse. Rather, the streaming giant’s biggest sleeper hit is a Japanese reality show – in which almost nothing happens at all.\n\nJapanese television might come with a whole host of traumatic associations – the country is famous for its wacky gameshows featuring people eating household objects and performing sex acts on each other. But reality show Terrace House is light years away from that kind of Technicolor debauchery. A dating programme in which three boys and three girls move into an impeccably stylish house (the terrace of the title doesn’t refer to an Anglophilic two-up, two-down, sadly, but a balcony), the contestants’ budding romances move at a snail’s pace – months in and they are still trying to negotiate their way of the friendzone, let alone cross the border into each other’s beds. Love Island this most certainly isn’t.\n\nSo what exactly is the appeal? On the Adam Buxton podcast, the comedian Mae Martin explained how she had become enchanted by the show, describing it as “incredibly dull, but so comforting”. It’s true that watching Terrace House is an extremely meditative experience. The contestants are visions of chic, understated style, who spend their time discussing riveting topics such as “who is at work”, “what they ate for dinner” and – very occasionally – “who they fancy”, in a manner so polite and restrained it’s almost hypnotic. Yet despite the narrative crawling along, you can’t simply scroll through Instagram to pass the time – instead, you’re forced to keep your eyes glued to the screen lest you lose track of the subtitles. It’s impossible to multitask while watching Terrace House – the show will have you remembering how it felt to have a pre-social media attention span in no time.\n\nThe (in)action on Terrace House is interspersed with commentary from a panel of TV personalities and comedians (plus a 14-year-old schoolboy, for the mandatory dose of cuteness known as “kawaii”), who drill down into banal conversations and overanalyse facial twitches or physical gestures. Not only are these observations and jokes, which could have so easily been lost in translation, still funny, but this level of analysis feels strangely generous – it suggests, as Andrew Ridker put it in the New York Times, that “these young people’s lives are worthy of examination, however pedestrian they might be”.\n\nAnd unlike the roll call of tiresome eccentrics that have graced every British reality show since the dawn of time, these contestants actually seem human. They couldn’t be less attention-seeking or exhibitionist – despite their constant boozing. Indeed, in one scene the contestants watch the new trailer for their series and look genuinely alarmed by the amount of views it has racked up in a matter of hours.\n\nAt a time when we’ve become inured to the slippery world of “structured reality”, which combines documentary and drama to produce something with the value of neither, it feels refreshing that a story producer clearly hasn’t been within a hundred miles of the Terrace House narrative – nobody in their right mind would map out something this uneventful. Instead, the contestants’ muted behaviour provides room to properly witness the universal minutiae of human interaction – the minor disappointments and thrills of the early days of a relationship are stretched out over realistically long time periods.\n\nFor those who hold the basic tenets of reality TV dear – that the truth is more compelling than fiction, and the interaction between people is a limitless source of entertainment and fascination, regardless of their status – Terrace House is a profound joy. It might also be one of the shows to stick most closely to those ideals. For everybody who has been consistently disappointed with the gulf between the principles of reality TV and the actual reality, Terrace House might be the genre’s saving grace.",

  "latent_12025": "Businesses that fail to focus on customer experience will hear a giant sucking sound from their vanishing profitability. Because in today's dynamic global marketplace, consumers now hold the power in the buyer-seller equation, and sellers need to revamp their strategy for this new world order.\n\nThe ability to relentlessly deliver connected, personalized and rewarding customer experiences is rapidly becoming one of the primary sources of competitive advantage in today's dynamic global marketplace. And the inability or unwillingness to realize that the customer is a company's most important asset will lead, inevitably, to decline and failure.\n\nWelcome to the lifecycle of customer experience, in which consumers explore, engage, shop, buy, ask, compare, complain, socialize, exchange, and more across multiple channels with the unconditional expectation that each of those interactions will be completed in an efficient and personalized manner however, wherever, and whenever the customer wants.\n\nWhile many niche companies are offering point solutions within that sprawling and complex spectrum of needs and requirements, businesses looking to deliver superb customer experiences are still left having to do multiple product evaluations, multiple contract negotiations, multiple test projects, multiple deployments, and--perhaps most annoying of all--multiple and never-ending integration projects to string together all those niche products from all those niche vendors.\n\nWith its new suite of customer-experience solutions, Oracle believes it can help companies unravel these challenges and move at the speed of their customers, anticipating their needs and desires and creating enduring and profitable relationships. Those solutions span the full range of marketing, selling, commerce, service, listening/insights, and social and collaboration tools for employees.\n\nWhen Oracle launched its suite of Customer Experience solutions at a recent event in New York City, president Mark Hurd analyzed the customer experience revolution taking place and presented Oracle's strategy for empowering companies to capitalize on this important market shift.\n\nFrom Hurd's presentation and related materials, I've extracted a list of Hurd's Top 10 Insights into the Customer Revolution.\n\n1. Please Don't Feed the Competitor's Pipeline!After enduring a poor experience, 89% of consumers say they would immediately take their business to your competitor. (Except where noted, the source for these findings is the 2011 Customer Experience Impact (CEI) Report including a survey commissioned by RightNow (acquired by Oracle in March 2012) and conducted by Harris Interactive.)\n\n2. The Addressable Market Is Massive. Only 1% of consumers say their expectations were always met by their actual experiences.\n\n3. They're Willing to Pay More! In return for a great experience, 86% of consumers say they'll pay up to 25% more.\n\n4. The Social Media Microphone Is Always Live. After suffering through a poor experience, more than 25% of consumers said they posted a negative comment on Twitter or Facebook or other social media sites. Conversely, of those consumers who got a response after complaining, 22% posted positive comments about the company.\n\n5. The New Deal Is Never Done: Embrace the Entire Customer Lifecycle. An appropriately active and engaged relationship, says Hurd, extends across every step of the entire processs: need, research, select, purchase, receive, use, maintain, and recommend.\n\n6. The 360-Degree Commitment. Customers want to do business with companies that actively and openly demonstrate the desire to establish strong and seamless connections across employees, the company, and the customer, says research firm Temkin Group in its report called \"The CX Competencies.\"\n\n7. Understand the Emotional Drivers Behind Brand Love. What makes consumers fall in love with a brand? Among the top factors are friendly employees and customer reps (73%), easy access to information and support (55%), and personalized experiences, such as when companies know precisely what products or services customers have purchased in the past and what issues those customers have raised (36%).\n\n8. The Importance of Immediate Action. You've got one week to respond--and then the opportunity's lost. If your company needs more than a week to answer a prospect's question or request, most of those prospects will terminate the relationship.\n\n9. Want More Revenue, Less Churn, and More Referrals? Then improve the overall customer experience: Forrester's research says that approach put an extra $900 million in the pockets of wireless service providers, $800 million for hotels, and $400 million for airlines.\n\n10. The Formula for CX Success.

We salute Malala’s efforts to help make these dreams come true.”\n\nMalala said she was honored to meet Obama and that she raised concerns with him about the administration’s use of drones, saying they are “fueling terrorism.”\n\n“I thanked President Obama for the United States’ work in supporting education in Pakistan and Afghanistan and for Syrian refugees,” Yousafzai said in a statement published by the Associated Press. “I also expressed my concerns that drone attacks are fueling terrorism. Innocent victims are killed in these acts, and they lead to resentment among the Pakistani people. If we refocus efforts on education it will make a big impact.”\n\nRecently Malala won the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. She was nominated for the Nobel peace prize, but she didn’t get it.\n\nShe is now living in Britain, where she underwent treatment for the injuries sustained in the attack, and campaigns for girls’ right to education.\n\nRead here the Quotes of Malala, and watch here inspiring speech of Malala at U.N.\n\nMalala’s activism started after the Taliban banned girls from schools in Pakistan’s Swat Valley in 2009. She anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order, and became an open advocate for girls’ education.\n\nIn 2011, Malala told CNN, “I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk.”\n\nA year later, she was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head. She nearly died.\n\nSince then, Malala has recovered and continued advocating for girls’ education, despite ongoing death threats from the Taliban.\n\nRecently Malala Yousafzai brought down the house at The Daily Show with Jon Stewart when asked what she would do if attacked again by a Taliban gunman.\n\n“I would tell him how important education is and that I would even want education for your children as well,” the Pakistani girl said. “That’s what I want to tell you, now do what you want.”\n\nWatch below the video of The story of Malala Yousafzai told by The Times’s Adam B. Ellick, who made a 2009 documentary about her before she was an international star.\n\nAnd, watch below the actual 2009 documentary.\n\nDrone attacks in Pakistan:\n\nThe United States government has made hundreds of attacks on targets in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency’s Special Activities Division. Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan. These strikes were begun by President George W. Bush and have increased substantially under President Barack Obama. Some media refer to the series of attacks as a “drone war”.\n\nUntil very recently, the U.S. had officially denied the extent of its policy; in May 2013 it acknowledged for the first time that U.S. citizens had been killed in the strikes. Surveys have shown that the strikes are deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where they have contributed to a negative perception of the United States.\n\nThere is a contentious and ongoing debate regarding the number of civilian and militant casualties caused by the strikes.\n\nUS Drone Strike Statistics estimate according to the New America Foundation (As of 30 September 2013) Source:wikipedia\n\nYear Number of\n\nAttacks Casualties Militants Civilians Unknown Total 2004 1 3 2 2 7 2005 3 5 6 4 15 2006 2 1 93 0 94 2007 4 51 0 12 63 2008 36 223 28 47 298 2009 54 387 70 92 549 2010 122 788 16 45 849 2011 73 420 62 35 517 2012 48 268 5 33 306 2013 21 128 4 0 132 Total 364 2,274 286 270 2,830",
  "latent_12445": "In March, the organizers of NorCal Regionals 2016 suddenly announced that their title sponsor was Avyd, a company no one had heard of before. Shortly after, Avyd announced a $100,000 fighting game championship series featuring Street Fighter V, Mortal Kombat X, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Wii U, Guilty Gear Xrd and Killer Instinct, then pulled SFV from the qualification tour during NCR, one of the qualification tournaments.\n\nMany people in the fighting game community are confused about Avyd. There's isn't much information about them available online, and some aren't even certain if they were still sponsoring NCR. Avyd CEO Scotty Tidwell says that he wants to assuage people's fears about his company. He says Avyd is ready to support the FGC, and that's why they started with a fighting game tournament, though he can't say much else about Avyd's future plans.\n\n\"We announced an FGC event first for two very simple reasons,\" Tidwell told theScore esports. \"First, we believe in the FGC and we believe in the potential that it has. Second, we also know that the FGC is a very guarded community and we wanted to put the event on the table so that we could then focus on growing that trust throughout the rest of the year.\"\n\nAvyd is an esports platform that will let players compete for prizes on a ladder, much like ESL and MLG. The company was founded in early 2016, but the platform isn't ready yet. Tidwell says they plan to launch in the Spring.\n\nAccording to Tidwell, Avyd felt the best course of action to show their support for the FGC was to support existing events with their qualification circuit. He does feels that they may have made the announcement too early though.\n\n\"We were very excited to work with NCR so we pushed that announcement forward. Looking back do we wish we had handled the announcement a bit differently, yes. Do we regret supporting the NCR event, certainly not.\"\n\nTidwell clarified that Avyd did not pull out their NCR sponsorship, and the only reason they removed NCR from the qualification circuit was because they wanted to rethink the qualification process. Contrary to some rumors that were floating around online, Capcom had nothing to do with that decision, Tidwell said.\n\nBut Capcom is running the Capcom Pro Tour at all the events Avyd listed as being part of their SFV qualification circuit, and that could cause problems. In fact, casters at NCR sat in front of a banner covered in Avyd logos, which was swapped out when the Capcom-sponsored SFV tournament was on-stream. But Tidwell insists that Capcom had nothing to do with Avyd pulling SFV from the tour.\n\n\"SFV was removed from our qualification process because our goal is to work with others to grow esports, not conflict or interfere with existing events or leagues,\" Tidwell said. \"Our plan with doing the qualification tour was to link all of these great events to one single event at the end of the year that the FGC could look forward to throughout the year. We quickly realized after making the announcement that many saw it as a conflict with the existing Capcom Pro Tour. We quickly went to the drawing board on how to rectify that, as we certainly do not want to damage a relationship with such an influential company in the FGC.\"\n\nAccording to Tidwell, Avyd is working on something with Capcom, but all he can say is that he's optimistic about the partnership.\n\nSimilarly, Tidwell says that Avyd is looking to expand past the FGC and into more esports, but can't talk about that yet either. Right now, he says that the focus is on the FGC, and what he says Avyd can do for that community.\n\n\"We believe that grass root community driven events are a vital part of the FGC and nothing is going to change that,\" he said. \"However, we also believe that the FGC is deserving of events that show what they're truly capable of accomplishing. EVO is a great example of that and it’s an amazing event that has been vital in the growth of FGC. So yes, we will do events. No, we will not attempt to take over the event scene in any way. If anything we want to see those events become even bigger.\"\n\nIn terms of future plans Tidwell can talk about, he says that Avyd is still sponsoring Combo Breaker, CEO, CEOtaku, The Big House 6 and SoCal Regionals this year, along with their Winter Championship at the end of the year. Notably, CEO organizer Alex Jebailey is one of the few major figures in the community to publicly support Avyd.\n\nJust had dinner with some of the @AvydTweets team. They have some cool stuff coming and I fully support it. I'm putting my reputation on it. — Alex Jebailey (@CEOJebailey) March 25, 2016\n\nTidwell also clarified that the $100,000 prize pool for the Winter Championship will be split across the six games, with distribution based on game popularity, and participation from players at the qualification tournaments. It may not be the biggest SFV prize pool in the world, but it's large for games like Killer Instinct and Guilty Gear.\n\n\"We understand there is a lot to be skeptical about and we will not try to prevent that,\" he said. \"We do, however, plan to prove to the FGC that we are here for them and we are not going anywhere.\n\n\"Obviously we want to run an amazing event for the FGC, but for us it’s more then that. We look at 2016 as our year to prove to the FGC that they can trust us and that together we can do great things. Running an event the FGC can be proud of is part of doing that.\"\n\nDaniel Rosen is a news editor for theScore esports. He likes to start a match by hitting parry, just so you know how bad he is.

  "latent_12457": "Washington, DC, passed one of the nation’s most generous paid family leave laws on Tuesday, joining four other states with programs in place or in the works that make sure all workers can take paid time off to care for their families. It will give eight weeks of paid leave to new parents, and six weeks of leave for other family caregiving, to more than half a million private sector and nonprofit workers.\n\nWhile DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said she doesn’t want to sign the bill, there’s not much point in her vetoing it; the DC City Council passed it with a veto-proof 9-4 majority. So unless Congress intervenes to stop the law from going into effect, benefits should start paying out in 2020.\n\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that doesn’t offer national paid maternity leave — and new birth mothers aren’t the only ones who might need time off to care for their families. New dads and adoptive parents need time off to bond and establish caregiving routines. Anyone at any time might need to care for a relative, or for themselves, due to a long-term illness like cancer or a short-term medical emergency like a broken leg.\n\nIt’s a basic enough need that even President-elect Donald Trump, who isn’t known for his support of progressive reforms, says he has a plan for paid maternity leave. It’s a really bad one, though, and it’s not clear whether Republicans in Congress would make the issue a priority. They certainly didn’t under President Obama.\n\nThat’s why four states and the District of Columbia haven’t waited for Congress to act to pass their own paid leave programs, and why we can expect more states to pass family leave legislation under President Trump.\n\nDC’s plan is an insurance program, not an employer mandate — which is the best policy bet for universal paid leave\n\nDC’s plan sets up a new social insurance program, funded by a 0.62 percent payroll tax on employers. This is the same approach taken by the other four states that have passed paid family leave: California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey have already implemented their programs, and New York’s will go into effect starting in 2018. While the exact tax rates and benefit formulas differ from state to state, all four states have established (or are establishing) insurance programs to pay employees while they are on leave instead of mandating pay by employers.\n\nAs Vox’s Matt Yglesias has explained, this kind of model is the best option for truly universal coverage and, in particular, better than simply requiring employers provide paid leave — an option that some DC business interests and council members tried to push through at the last minute.\n\nEmployer mandates like these almost always have exceptions for small businesses, since it’s harder for them to come up with the resources to offer leave than big companies like Walmart. But that also means leaving many people who work at smaller businesses without paid leave.\n\nBecause the DC parental leave benefit is funded through a payroll tax instead of an employer mandate, DC was able to cover not just employees of small businesses but also people who work part time or for tips, or who are self-employed. It covers everybody who works in the District of Columbia and not for the government, even if they live outside the District. While that’s prompted some grumbling over the idea that a tax collected inside the District would be paying for people who live elsewhere, advocates argue that it will give DC businesses a competitive advantage. They also argue that including Virginia and Maryland residents expands the program’s risk pool, helping to smooth out demand for benefits and ultimately lowering the program’s cost.\n\n“It’s a tiny cost for an awesome benefit”\n\nThe original proposal was for a groundbreaking 16 weeks of leave, which would have topped the 12-week plan that New York state passed in April and that will go into effect in 2018. But DC’s 16 weeks got whittled down to eight weeks of parental leave for a new child, six weeks for family caregiving, and two weeks for personal medical leave (which is the most expensive benefit to insure because it happens most frequently, but also the one that workers are least likely to need for more than a week or two at a time).\n\nBut it’s still the nation’s most generous plan in terms of how much money workers will get. People who make up to 1.5 times the minimum wage (or about $810 a week) can get 90 percent of their income from the program and then 50 percent of whatever they make above that with a cap of $1,000 per week.\n\nMayor Bowser said she opposed the bill’s $250 million price tag and the fact that DC would have to set up new bureaucracy to run it. But advocates say it’s worth it, and that no other model comes close to working as well.\n\n“The standard pushback is, ‘Oh, if you make businesses pay more, they’ll just lay people off’ — but really it’s a tiny cost for an awesome benefit,” said Rebecca Ennen, deputy director of development and communications at Jews United for Justice. “It makes a lot of sense for businesses.”\n\nA 0.62 percent tax is so small that it’s almost a “rounding error,” Ennen said, especially for companies with big payrolls. Besides, paid leave keeps employees happier and reduces turnover costs, and has worked well for businesses in California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey, where similar social insurance programs have already been implemented.\n\nBut paid leave insurance is especially important for both low-income workers and small businesses, Ennen said.\n\nLow-wage workers and part-time employees are both the least likely to be offered paid leave through their jobs and the least likely to be included under new employer mandate programs. It’s hard enough to survive on minimum wage, let alone on 55 percent of it, which some paid leave programs that are less generous than DC’s offer.\n\nAnd for small businesses like dog walkers or bakeries, you still need somebody to walk the dogs or bake the muffins when somebody has a baby, which often means hiring temporary help to replace someone on leave. Paying a small tax into an insurance program is a lot cheaper than paying for two workers at once — the one on paid leave, and the one working — and a lot more humane than offering no pay at all to the person who needs to take time off.\n\nJews United for Justice was one of many local groups, including the DC Working Families Party, DC Jobs With Justice, and local unions, that banded together to form the DC Paid Family Leave Coalition and work to pass the bill.\n\nA strong grassroots movement for paid leave has been gaining momentum over the past several years, and doesn’t show signs of stopping under Trump. Activists already have their sights set on other near-future victories in states like Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Oregon.\n\nAmerica is way behind other countries on paid parental leave — and low-income workers have it the hardest\n\n\"Compared to what the rest of the world does, [the United States is] definitely backward,\" said paid leave advocate Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, a leading national coalition on paid leave efforts. \"We're the outlier.\"\n\nIn America, only 12 percent of workers have access to paid family leave through their employer, and that access is unequally distributed. Only 5 percent of workers in the lowest-paid 25 percent of the workforce have employer-sponsored paid leave, while 22 percent of the top 10 percent of earners do. These figures don't count policies like short-term disability or sick leave, which many new parents use to cobble together a sort of ad hoc parental leave.\n\nMany employers don't provide unpaid leave, either. There is a federal law called the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) that protects your job for up to 12 weeks — unpaid — if you take time off for a new child or another serious family or medical issue. But 40 percent of American workers don't qualify for those benefits, either because they haven't been at their job long enough or because their company is too small (the FMLA regulations only apply to companies with 50 or more workers). And even among those who do qualify for FMLA, many can't afford to spend three months without drawing a paycheck.\n\nLacking paid leave puts a huge burden on new parents. It hurts women's overall ability to participate in the workforce, prevents fathers from being equal partners in child rearing, and has devastating effects on women's health and ability to parent.\n\nA recent investigation by In These Times found that one in four working mothers goes back to work within two weeks of childbirth, usually due to financial pressures. But going back to work so soon can have nightmarish consequences for a mother's physical and mental health.\n\nWomen report going back to work still bleeding from vaginal injuries or C-sections. They work 12-hour days and can't breastfeed their new baby, either because they're too stressed or because they simply don't have time. They plunge into postpartum depression, and they despair of establishing a healthy parenting routine.\n\nThe grassroots push for paid family and sick leave at the state and local level has had a lot of success in a short time. But the vast majority of the country still has no universal paid leave guarantees at all, much less benefits that compare to those in Silicon Valley or in the rest of the developed world.\n\nThe national public policy answer to this problem could look something like the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY Act), introduced in Congress by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT). It minimizes the burden on employers by levying a tiny (0.2 percent each on the employer and employee) payroll tax on everyone, and it guarantees 12 weeks of leave at two-thirds pay for everyone who works.\n\nThe FAMILY Act is similar to programs passed by four states and the District of Columbia over the past decade. So far, research on the three that have been enacted in California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey has been encouraging — the programs have helped workers, and haven’t harmed businesses or killed jobs.\n\nBut as promising as it is, the FAMILY Act has gone nowhere in a Republican-dominated Congress under President Obama, and the same is likely to be true under Trump. It’s possible that Republicans could get behind Trump’s maternity leave plan, but it would be woefully inadequate in comparison — it only covers new mothers, and only for six weeks, and Trump’s plan to pay for it doesn’t make any sense.\n\nSo at least for the next four years, state and local efforts like DC’s are the most promising for working families.",
  "latent_12465": "The numbers are staggering. Recent research, conducted by Edelman Berland and commissioned by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk, estimates that 34 percent of the American workforce, approximately 53 million Americans, are doing some type of freelance work. And this likely doesn't fully count all independent contractors, including the approximately 22 million one-person small businesses around the country.\n\nRead MoreThat millennial you're working with may be a jerk\n\nHowever, while the work landscape has and will continue to evolve, the government-affiliated groups like that IRS who define who is considered an employee, have not. That means that there is a disconnect between people who consider themselves independent and the businesses that engage their services on one hand, and the tax and paperwork implications of the IRS definition of what is an independent worker on the other hand.\n\n\"1099\" workers are those considered independent by the IRS. \"W-2\" employees are those they consider employees. However, for many freelancers, small businesses and their temporary employers, the definitions often don't match. Moreover, this distinction can end up being very costly, both in penalties from miscategorizing contractors and freelancers, as well as from the opportunity cost of not bringing on freelancers or service providers that may subject a business to categorize them as employees and the extra work associated with doing so.\n\nPer the IRS, \"Generally, you must withhold income taxes, withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, and pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. You do not generally have to withhold or pay any taxes on payments to independent contractors.\"\n\nRead MoreOp-ed: Why women should say 'No!' more often\n\nThis may seem like a small distinction, but to small-business owners who are already consumed with burdensome administrative tasks, not to mention a cost structure that may not be yet scalable, it is a significant one. It creates more time and expense related to paperwork and compliance. Plus, having freelancers and contractors categorized as employees can impact the 401(k) or other retirement plans of a businesses.\n\nThe criteria for who is considered a freelancer/contractor by the IRS, and who is not, is fairly stringent. The IRS says that if you perform work that would be done in the normal course of business by an employee (including, among other things, not setting your own hours or methodology for completing the work), you are considered an employee, not an independent contractor, for tax purposes. This stands even if you own your own firm, have additional clients and/or just plain want to be one.\n\nThis can have tremendous financial implications for businesses. Business owners can be hit, as was this recently profiled small business, with thousands of dollars or more in back taxes if the IRS believes that your freelancers or contractors are should be categorized as employees. Others small business owners are purely reluctant to hire because they don't want to accidentally run afoul of any regulations and face issues down the road.\n\nRead MoreDon't do it! 9 habits of highly ineffective leaders\n\nIt is very clear that this outdated definition creates a barrier to hiring, which is neither good for the growth of small business or for the growth in the workforce, and is precisely why it should be changed immediately.\n\nImagine that a small business only needs a person for projects, for shortened hours or even for part of the year. Having an updated 1099 definition would allow a freelancer to be able to be employed by multiple businesses without creating redundancy in administrative work and other paperwork.\n\nIf both parties are in agreement that an independent contractor arrangement makes sense, why would the government stop that? If the contractor or freelancer is paid more than $600 a year by a business and have a non-corporate entity (LLC, Sole Proprietorships), their income is reported through a form 1099-MISC to the IRS each year. Income and other taxes are still getting paid. While businesses pay and collect Social Security and Medicare taxes (aka FICA taxes) for each employee, an independent contractor is subject to self-employment taxes, which cover both Social Security and Medicare contributions in an amount roughly equivalent to the FICA tax. So, why should the government and the IRS care which entity is responsible for those taxes? Shouldn't that be up to the parties in the work arrangement?\n\nAllowing more individuals to work as freelancers and be classified by independent contractors as they are hired by other businesses should, in fact, increase tax revenues by making it easier to create jobs.\n\nAs we look at ways to put people back to work and foster a pro-growth environment for small business, a simple definitional change in the tax code would go a long way towards helping our economy. The freelance economy is not going away and it's time for the IRS to catch up.\n\nCommentary by Carol Roth, a \"recovering\" investment banker (corporate finance), entrepreneur/small-business owner, investor and author of \"The Entrepreneur Equation.\" Follow her on Twitter @CarolJSRoth.",

And Dollar Tree, which sells household supplies and party goods for $1 or less, will gain in its newest acquisition a retailer with a number of (still low-cost) price points and access to poorer markets.\n\nGetting bigger may also help the pair pull together their buying power, negotiating bigger discounts from suppliers while finding ways to cut costs. The two companies expect to save $300 million in annual costs by the third year after closing.\n\nThat could prove especially important if Walmart continues to introduce more small-format stores to complement its traditional supercenter locations.\n\nMr. Sasser played down the prospects of Dollar Tree’s taking on the colossus of American retail.\n\n“We’re staying in the dollar sector,” he said. “We’re still going to be in the value retail sector.”\n\nThe deal will still keep alive the Family Dollar brand, begun in Charlotte, N.C., 55 years ago by Leon Levine, the father of Howard Levine, the chief executive.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Dollar Tree will pay $74.50 for each share of Family Dollar, with $59.60 of that in the form of cash and the remainder in shares of itself. That bid represents a premium of nearly 23 percent to Family Dollar’s closing price on Friday.\n\nFamily Dollar was contending with intensifying pressure from activist shareholders to pursue a sale of itself. The billionaire Carl C. Icahn emerged as a noisy gadfly last month when he disclosed owning 9.4 percent of the company’s shares and demanded board seats.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis campaign put him in the same boat as the hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz, whose investment firm gained a board seat nearly three years ago after failing to buy out the whole company. As recently as this month, Mr. Peltz said publicly that he was not satisfied with the company’s performance.\n\nBut by that point, Family Dollar was already in talks to sell itself to its competitor, according to a person briefed on the talks. The company had begun weighing strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of itself, as far back as last winter. And by March, the company and its advisers had begun sales talks with Dollar Tree, even before Mr. Icahn had begun accumulating shares.\n\nStill, even after the announcement, investors appeared to be wagering that a bidding war would emerge over the company, with Dollar General or another big retailer potentially topping the takeover bid. Shares of Family Dollar closed on Monday at $75.74, above the price of Dollar Tree’s offer.\n\nBy the time that Mr. Icahn emerged, analysts and investors had bet that Dollar General, not Dollar Tree, would emerge as a probable bidder. But last month, Dollar General’s chief executive, Rick Dreiling, said that he would step down, damping expectations of a takeover bid.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, the leader in the dollar retail sector may be moved to act. Analysts with Sterne Agee wrote in a research note on Monday that the future of Dollar General appeared a bit more cloudy if the deal were to go through.\n\n“Dollar General has clearly benefited from Family Dollar’s struggles over the past decade,” they wrote. “With a new sheriff in town, Family Dollar will be a much sharper competitor going forward.”\n\nDollar Tree has already assembled a significant amount of support for its current deal. Shareholders representing about 16 percent of Family Dollar’s shares, including Mr. Levine and Mr. Peltz’s firm, have already agreed to back the current takeover bid.\n\n“Trian strongly believes that the combination with Dollar Tree represents the best path forward for Family Dollar and is a great outcome for all of the company’s shareholders,” a representative for the hedge fund, which owns a 7.3 percent stake, said in a statement. “By joining with Dollar Tree, Family Dollar is becoming part of a stronger organization that will drive significant value for shareholders of both companies.”\n\nMr. Icahn himself appeared to hold out hope that a higher takeover bid would emerge, arguing in a blog post that “a handful of potential buyers” could emerge with superior offers.\n\nStill, he expressed pleasure with Monday’s bid. “This is a big win for all shareholders of Family Dollar,” he added, “and yet another validation of the activist investment philosophy in general.”\n\nMr. Icahn has reason to be happy. The activist began buying securities in the company in April, paying an average price of $58.20 a share — scoring a 28 percent gain for a three-month investment.",
  "latent_12912": "The Russian Supreme Court’s July 17 ban on the Jehovah’s Witnesses was the result of a decades long conspiracy funded by the French government, blessed by the Russian Orthodox Church, and sanctioned by the Putin administration.\n\nA French NGO — fully-funded by the French government with the aim of combatting religious minorities — partnered with the Putin administration and the Russian Orthodox Church to label non-Orthodox religions in Russia as extremist groups and eliminate them. The latest phase of that plan first garnered international attention with Russian authorities’ arrest of a Danish citizen.\n\nThe Arrest of Dennis Christensen\n\nThe May 25 arrest of Danish citizen Dennis Christensen in Russia thrust the plight of the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) into the global spotlight. Russian authorities arrested Christensen, along with 15 other Jehovah’s Witness members, during a raid on a JW compound while the members within were engaged in a Bible study. The raid was conducted after the the Russian Supreme Court banned the JWs in Russia on April 20, and labeled them an extremist organization.\n\nWATCH:\n\nChristensen appealed his pre-trial incarceration, but a Russian court denied his appeal June 21. Parallel to Christensen’s court hearings was the legal battle of the entire Russian JW organization. The JWs appealed the April 20 ruling to the Russian Supreme Court, which ruled against them and upheld the ban against them July 17. Christensen faces up to 10 years imprisonment on the charge of organizing an illegal religious activity, since the Bible study took place after the initial banning of the JWs on April 20.\n\nThe Russian Supreme Court’s April 20 ruling against the JWs upheld the Russian Justice Ministry’s decision that added the group in May to a list of organizations officially banned for extremist activities.\n\nBut why did the Justice Ministry have Christensen, a peaceful man honored by Russian authorities for outstanding community service, arrested? Why did the Justice Ministry add the JWs, who are avowed pacifists and eschew political activity, to a list of banned extremist organizations?\n\nThe French Connection\n\nThe Justice Ministry made its decision based on counsel from the Ministry’s Expert Council for Conducting State Religious-Studies Expert Analysis. The Expert Council’s purpose is to investigate religions that deviate from Russian Orthodox teaching and to recommend actions against those religions to the state. The Expert Council is headed by Aleksander Dvorkin, vice president of the Russian branch of FECRIS.\n\nFECRIS, the European Federation of Research and Information Centers on Sectarianism, is a French NGO dedicated “according to its bylaws, to identify as a sect/cult or a guru the organization or the individual which misuses beliefs and behavioral techniques for his own benefit,'” according to the Coordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience (CAIFC).\n\nThe UN and the Council of Europe recognize FECRIS as an NGO, despite the fact that the department of the French prime minister supplies 100 percent of the organization’s funding, according to CAIFC.\n\n“How can a Prime Minister declare that there is no legal definition of a sect/ cult in France and at the same time finance at the level of 100% a NON-GOVERNMENTAL association whose objective is to point at ‘sects/cults'” the statement from CAIFC reads.\n\nFECRIS in Russia\n\nCAIFC also noted the partnership of FECRIS, and Dvorkin, with the Russian Orthodox Church in the campaign in Russia against religious minorities like the JWs.\n\n“If the action of FECRIS is not religious and claims to be neutral in this regard, how can it explain that an organization registered in a secular state – France – is massively financed with the money of all French tax-payers, while its vice-president, Alexander Dvorkin, a Russian citizen is blessed and financed by the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church for its anti-sect activities,” CAIFC’s statement added. “This same Russian Orthodox Church which, along with Putin, has been persecuting religious minorities for years in Russia.”\n\nFECRIS’ campaign against the Russian JWs had been going on for years before Christensen’s arrest. A FECRIS associate organization partnered with the Russian Orthodox Church, the Committee for the Salvation of Youth from Totalitarian Cults, filed the first legal complaint against the JWs of Moscow in 1995, according to a study of FECRIS published in the Journal for the Study of Beliefs and Worldviews (JSBW).\n\nThe initial complaint was dismissed, but the committee refiled their complaint against the JWs in Moscow four times, until Russian authorities agreed to launch an investigation in 1998. A Moscow district court upheld the complaint against the JWs in 2004 after a prolonged legal battle, and ordered a permanent ban against the Moscow community of JWs. Several suits todisperse individual JW communities were filed in other cities as well, despite the European Court of Human Rights ruling in 2010 that the ban on the Moscow JWs violated Russian law.\n\nThe Russian Supreme Court’s latest ruling made the ban on JWs nationwide.\n\nAleksander Dvorkin\n\nDvorkin is not only the vice president of FECRIS, but also the director of FECRIS’ member organization in Russia, the St. Irenaeus of Lyons Religious Studies Research Centre, which is partnered with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nDvorkin’s campaign through FECRIS against the JWs in Russia attacked them on both the legal and the social front. Violence against the JWS, including arson and assault, was linked to several comments by Dvorkin encouraging public suspicion and action against the religious group and others according to JSBW’s study.\n\n“Their adepts recruit failed university enrollees, and people on vacation as well; they have a wide range of psychological influence, especially on the unstable minds of adolescents and youths,” Dvorkin said of Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Hare Krishna sect. Dvorkin encouraged the public to “take part in the fight against sects, file complaints and collect raw data so that the local authorities can react quickly.”\n\nDvorkin also gave an interview in a 2009 documentary called Emergency Investigation: Jehovah’s Witnesses, in which he compared the JWs to drug dealers and called them “slaves.” According to the study from JSBW, that documentary was used as a justification for public violence against JW members in Russia.\n\nLegalization of Russian Religious Purification\n\nRussia’s 2002 Anti-Extremism Law paved the way for Dvorkin and FECRIS to label a peaceful group like the JWs as extremists and have them banned nationwide.\n\nThe Putin administration passed the law ostensibly in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, but soon began to use the 2002 law to make Putin’s “spiritual security” concept a Russian reality, as described in the administration’s 2000 National Security Concept.\n\n“Assurance of the Russian Federation’s national security also includes protecting the cultural and spiritual-moral legacy and the historical traditions and standards of public life, and preserving the cultural heritage of all Russia’s peoples,” the statement read. “There must be a state policy to maintain the population’s spiritual and moral welfare, prohibit the use of airtime to promote violence or base instincts, and counter the adverse impact of foreign religious organizations and missionaries.”\n\nThe law initially listed violent action as one of the qualifications for extremism. A 2006 amendment to the Anti-Extremism law removed violence as a qualification, and gave the following qualifications for extremist activity, according to the JSBW study:\n\nA. The definition of extremism shall include libel against state officials related to accusation in extremism or in a particularly grave crime;\n\nB. Any act of violence (incl. hooliganism) against an official shall qualify as extremism; and\n\nC. Not only calls to extremist activity but also “justifications” of extremist activity will be banned.\n\nThe law then defined extremism as “incitement to racial, nationalistic, or religious enmity, and also social enmity.” With the addition of incitement to religious or social enmity, FECRIS and its associate organizations, with its partnership with the Russian Orthodox Church and its members’ positions in the Russian government, were free to label any religion that deviated from Russian Orthodox doctrine as extreme.\n\nDvorkin has reveled in that freedom and targeted Mormons, Hare Krishna, New Pentecostals, Falun Gong, and Jehovists, labeling them more dangerous than Satanists because they “conceal evil under the guise of good,” according to the JSBW study.\n\n“As part of the strategy of religious purification in Russia, complaints have been lodged by anti-sect groups and various state institutions seeking the liquidation of a number of non-Orthodox movements, including Catholic organizations,” the study’s section on Russia concluded.\n\n“However, the reality is that State neutrality and impartiality in the countries covered by this research work (France, Austria, Germany, Russia and Serbia), unfortunately does not exist. In all five countries, the state and public powers take sides with FECRIS’ affiliates and finance their activities even if they are used for the missionary activities of a mainline Church or if they are meant to defend the position and influence of a specific Church in society, to fight against the erosion of its membership or to expand it,” the study added.\n\nFollow Joshua on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "latent_13031": "SXSW: Mark Duplass' 8 Improvised Tips for Success in the Film Industry\n\n“The cavalry isn’t coming.”\n\nWith those words, actor-director-producer Mark Duplass launched into a rousing keynote at the SXSW Film Festival on Sunday. Currently writing a second season of HBO’s “Togetherness” with his brother Jay, Mark continues to act in a wide variety of projects, while he and his brother produce several movies a year and recently signed a four-picture deal with Netflix.\n\nA decade ago, their feature-length debut “The Puffy Chair” became a sleeper hit on the festival circuit, which led the pair to Los Angeles, direct two studio projects (“Cyrus” and “Jeff, Who Lives at Home”) and continue building momentum. These days, both brothers also act on television (Mark on “The League” and Jay on “Transparent”). The Duplass brothers’ brand has never been stronger — but it hasn’t always been that way.\n\nREAD MORE: This Is How You Do It: 10 Filmmaking Tips from Mark and Jay Duplass\n\nDespite all their success, Mark told the crowd that their origin story had more than a few rough patches.\n\n“I was living in Austin in shitty apartments around town,” he said. “I was sitting there thinking, ‘I’m inspired, I’m excited, I want to be a filmmaker. I have no connections. Everyone says pick up a camera and do it, but how am I going to get there? What can you do when you’re absolutely nowhere?’ ”\n\nOver the course of his half-hour presentation, he shared this improvised eight-point plan based on his experiences. (Backstage, Duplass told Indiewire that he assembled his speech on scraps of paper at his hotel shortly beforehand.)\n\n1. The $3 Short Film\n\nTechnology is so cheap. There’s no excuse for not making short films on the weekend with your friends. We had a film we shot on an iPhone at Sundance this year that sold to Magnolia [“Tangerine,” directed by Sean Baker]. Our first film starred me. It was called “Vince Del Rio.” We spent $65,000 on this movie and it was a steaming pile of dog diarrhea. We almost gave up making movies. [Jay] was depressed. I was slightly less depressed. All we had was our parents’ video camera, which had a dead pixel in the middle of it. I said, “I’m gonna get a tape.” Twenty minutes later, Jay said he couldn’t get his answering machine message right and recorded it a hundred times. I said, “That’s great. It’s us.” So we shot one 20-minute improvised take. We edited it down to seven minutes. Our friend David Zellner said, “You should just submit this around to festivals.”\n\nThat three-dollar movie was our first to get into Sundance. It changed everything for us. We realized that it doesn’t matter what your movie looks like. I recommend making one of these every weekend with your smartest group of friends. They don’t have to be film people, just charismatic. It should be one scene, five minutes, and ideally comedic, because those program well at festivals. Your first ones are going to suck. Probably. They’ll be like a little nugget you can show your friends. Then you hone in on that little giggle. Somewhere you’re going to discover you have something unique to offer.\n\n2. Make a Feature For Under $1,000\n\nAt the risk of saying you should make a self-indulgent film for your first movie, you should absolutely make a self-indulgent film for your first movie. This is going to be the start of your career. The whole time you’re going around this festival, there’s a small chance an agent is going to sign you. They’re going to say the cavalry is coming. It’s probably not. But you’re going to be writing a feature script the whole time that can be made for less than $1,000.\n\nYou’re going to spend a year making this movie with available material. You can ask everyone who can support you what they can lend you. When my brother Jay and I made “The Puffy Chair,” we had my apartment in Brooklyn. I had a van. There was a furniture store going out of business in Maine where we got two chairs. That was perfect because I needed to burn one of them in the movie. We knew we wouldn’t have to wait to make this — we could make it at a cheap price. So you’re going to go out with a group of five to eight people. You’re going to buy lights and extension cords… and they have a 30-day return policy. So you’re going to make your movie for free. And there are places… where you can buy cameras and return them — or shoot it on your iPhone. If you have an agent at this point, they’ll say, “Don’t do this.” If you listen to them, you won’t get your movie. Go make this movie on your own.\n\nRead More: Watch: Mark Duplass’ First Feature ‘The Puffy Chair’ Online Now For Free!\n\n3. Show Your Movie to Movie Stars\n\nThere are movie stars at these film festivals. Every film festival has three to five movie stars that come because of the sponsors. You’re going to get your movie in front of them. Tell your agent to send your $5,000 movie to every actor in the agency. You want to build your movie with them. A lot of those stars are going to be like, “Fuck that, this dude doesn’t know what he’s doing.” But one of them will respond. Let’s call him Randy Hercules. He was on a bad CBS show and he’s super-depressed. You’ll say, “Randy, I saw your show, and I think you’re better than this.” You’re going to say, “I want to build a role for you, Randy.” And he’s going to fall in love with you. He will follow you to the end of the earth.\n\n4. Make Another Cheap Movie\n\nNow you are going to do the unthinkable — you’re going to make another $1,000 movie, but this one has Randy Hercules in it. Even if you make a stinker, you’ll make at least $50,000 on it. Randy will make 20%. You can go to him and ask him to give it to the rest of the crew. And he’ll do it. You might go to Sundance and sell it for a million dollars. Probably won’t happen. That’s OK. Now you have a movie that has extreme value on VOD because it has Randy Hercules in it.\n\n5. Embrace VOD\n\nGod bless VOD. Please do not reject VOD. Don’t blow all your money on a theater that’s going to lose money. Let someone put it out on VOD and you’ll make at least $5,000 because Randy Hercules is in it. More importantly, the industry is starting to notice you. Now your agent will say, “The cavalry is really coming.”\n\n6. Move to TV\n\nAs the death of the middle class of film continues, it has moved to TV. If you made a good movie with Randy Hercules, you’ll sell a pitch. You might get to make that show. Probably not. But you could probably make some episodes independently and license them back to these companies at a quarter of the price. So you’re going to take out Randy and his friend, Dingleberry Jones. Make two episodes and outline the rest. I guarantee you can sell the show to a place that wants content from a vetted, cool filmmaker like yourself.\n\n7. Produce Your Friends’ Work\n\nAll your friends are going to say, “I have an idea, I want to make my first film with Randy Hercules.” Then you can throw a thousand dollars at them and say, “Go for it. If you shit the bed, it’s a write-off.” But take 80% of it and share it with your crew.\n\n8. Accept the Hard Facts\n\nSo now you’re at this weird crossroads in your life — making money, not rich, sustaining your friends. Your agent will call you: “This time, the cavalry is fucking beating down your door.” And she’s right. You’re gonna look at your career and say, “I’m a little tired, because I’ve had to self-generate every project. It would be really amazing not to work that hard.”\n\nThis is the really hard truth: Still, when I’m at this place that I am at, the cavalry is not coming. It sucks. But this is where the good news starts to come in. You realize, “I made two micro-budget features, critically acclaimed short films, and licensed a TV show. How is it possible that the cavalry is not coming?”\n\nHere’s the good news: Who gives the fuck about the cavalry? You are the cavalry. You have a group of friends that needs your support. As they get more successful and you make a shitty movie, they will lift you up. This will equalize you. You have a bevy of work behind you and not one of those are you embarrassed to show your children later on. Most importantly, you’re now in a corner of the sandbox that is completely your own. No one can stop you from doing exactly what you want to do. If you can accept that the cavalry won’t come, and if you can be the cavalry, it gives you a chance to be happy.\n\nREAD MORE: Jay & Mark Duplass on Selling TV at Sundance\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

  "latent_13035": "Once I installed Windows 8 on my MacBook Air (there was no Surface Pro at the time), I thought I had everything I wanted in a computer. But once I’d spent some time writing on it, I found the trackpad might be a tad over-sensitive for my needs. I had tried Trackpad++ in the past, but the prerequisite software was off-putting, and I’d still find myself typing into the middle of another paragraph. Why couldn’t I just turned the darned thing off?\n\nWell, it turns out that I could and, after a few hours of fiddling around, I’m here to tell you how. I think this method should work for any post-XP Windows laptop (and probably even on XP), but I’ve only tried it on my Late 2010 , 13.3” MacBook Air 3.2, running Windows 8 x64, and my wife’s Mid 2011, 11” Air 4.1 running Windows 7 x64 (both in Boot Camp). So, if you’ve got a little Windows experience and aren’t scared of trying out some simple scripts, let’s get started.\n\nNOTE: If you have some command line experience, this will be really straight forward, and (after reading the disclaimers below, of course) you can jump to Section One – Less Than 10 Steps to Touchpad Freedom. If you don’t have a lot of experience, but want to try this out anyway (because it is soooo nice to be able to turn the touchpad off), check out Section Two – The Nitty-Gritty, Step-by-Step Details which details all of the steps. Some users may know most of the big steps in Section One, but need help on other steps. For this reason I’ve linked each short step to a more detailed version that you can access by clicking on the ‘Step X’ link. When you’re done with the detailed step, you can click on the ‘Back to Short Version’ link to bring you back to the top. Finally, if you reach the end and forget where a link was, or just want some further information, check out the Resources & Links.\n\nNasty Disclaimer:\n\nWhile I experienced no negative side effects from this procedure (and don’t expect you will either), I cannot be held responsible for you messing up your computer in any way. Any errors that arise as a result of this procedure (concerning your laptop, or your personal life) are yours and yours alone. That said, I’d be happy to help if I’ve got the time, and encourage you to reach out if you come up against a wall.\n\nSection One – Less Than 10 Steps to Touchpad Freedom\n\nStep 1: Download and install the latest versions of Advanced BAT to EXE Convertor (Alternative CNET Download) and AutoHotKey (Alternative CNET Download)\n\nStep 2: Download and extract the DevCon tools from the Microsoft Technet page How to Obtain the Current Version of Device Console Utility (DevCon.exe) or grab the already isolated DevCon executable (though I don’t promise to keep this up to date) zip file from my DropBox.\n\nmd5 for devcon.zip = 9e2856cbb7853b2fb9306fb2924bc249\n\nExtract the executable to a permanent folder location that will be used for this project.\n\nStep 3: In a Command Prompt window with administrative privileges, change directory to the folder now containing your DevCon.exe file. Input the appropriate DevCon ‘find’ command using the ‘=mouse’ argument to indicate that DevCon should find only devices associated with a mouse, and the ‘>’ argument to write out the program’s return to a file (below: mouse_list.txt).\n\nHINT: You could just as easily have DevCon ‘find’ all of your devices by using the ‘*’ argument.\n\nOpen the mouse_list.txt file created in step 3 and note the ID strings.\n\nStep 4: Test the individual device ID strings using the DevCon disable and enable functions in command prompt. Once you have isolated the touchpad’s device ID, take note of it. We’ll by using this in our script.\n\nNOTE: You’ll know when you have found the right ID string when you disable a suspect string and the touchpad (mouse) fails to respond to user input. Pressing the ‘up arrow’ and changing the disable to enable (then pressing enter) should restore touchpad function. Using the red ID in the image above did nothing on my computer, while using the blue string in my DevCon ‘disable’ command, disabled the touchpad and made it completely unresponsive. Perfect.\n\nStep 5: Open an instance of Advanced BAT to EXE Converter, and paste in the following script modifying both; the path information to reflect the folder of your DevCon executable, and the device ID in quotes after the ‘@’ symbol to reflect your specific device ID.\n\nNOTE: Your device ID needs to be placed in all three devcon calls (unless you wish to build a variable) in the script.\n\ncd \"C:\\users\\michael\\devcon\" devcon status @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" > EnOrDis.txt findstr \"disabled\" EnOrDis.txt IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( devcon enable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" ) ELSE ( devcon disable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" )\n\nWhen finished, you should have something like:\n\nEDIT: I noticed (when trying to do this on my new 2015 12″ Air w/ Windows 8) that Advanced BAT to EXE Convertor throws an error if the text file (here: EnOrDis.txt) doesn’t already exist. If you get an error, try creating a blank text file with a matching file name in the correct location first.\n\nBuild and save the executable by clicking on the ‘Build EXE’ button highlighted in red above, making sure to select the ‘Start Invisible’ option on the following screen.\n\nStep 6: Once the EXE file is built, set it to ‘Run as Administrator’ on the ‘Compatibility’ tab of the file’s ‘Properties’ menu.\n\nStep 7: Using Notepad, generate an AutoHotKey script to call your executable on a button press and save it as a ‘.ahk’ file in your DevCon Folder. On my machine I used the keys ‘CTRL+ALT+n’\n\n^!n:: Run \"C:\\users\\michael\\devcon\\EnaDis.exe\"\n\nStep 8: Set the AutoHotKey.exe file (default path: “C:\\Program Files\\AutoHotkey”) to ‘Run this program as an administrator’ in the ‘Change settings for all users’ section of the ‘Compatibility’ tab on the ‘Properties’ menu.\n\nStep 9: Finally, create a Scheduled Task to call the AutoHotKey ‘.ahk’ script with the following conditions:\n\nGeneral\n\ni. Using the local User Account\n\nii. Set to ‘Run only when user is logged on’\n\niii. Set to ‘Run with highest privileges’\n\nTriggers\n\ni. At log on of any user\n\nActions\n\ni. Start a program\n\nii. Browse and select the location of your ahk script.\n\niii. ‘Add arguments’ and ‘Start in’ left blank.\n\nConditions\n\ni. None: Uncheck all conditions\n\nSettings\n\ni. Default\n\nHistory\n\ni. Default\n\nSection Two – The Nitty-Gritty, Step-by-Step Details\n\nStep 1.) Gathering and Installing Supplemental Software\n\nWhen I did this on my own, I had to play around with different versions of software to find out what worked and what didn’t. If I knew then what I know now (that these two programs work well and can be trusted), I would have taken care of this step at the beginning.\n\nA.) Download and install Advanced BAT to EXE Converter. This software will allow us to overcome a limitation of batch files (namely, that you can’t set them to always Run as the Administrator) by transforming the scripts that we write into executable files.\n\n1.) You can download the software from CNET but I wouldn’t. I’ve missed checkmarks in CNET’s installer before and it has installed unwanted stuff onto my computer. Instead I’d go over to the Advanced BAT to EXE Converter webpage and download it straight from the source. In fact here’s a link directly to the download.\n\n2.) Locate the downloaded installer in your Downloads folder and double-click on it to begin the installation.\n\n3.) If you get a UAC (User Account Control) warning, agree to it, and agree to the terms and conditions of the software. Finish clicking ‘Next’ through the installation.\n\n4.) Once the program finishes installing, you’ll be asked if you want to run the software. Go for it, but close it once you’ve seen that it runs.\n\nB.) Download and install AutoHotKey. This software will allow us to link a set of keyboard buttons to the program that we build. Outside of our immediate needs, AutoHotKey is a very simple and powerful software that can map most computer actions to your keyboard keys. While I don’t have time to cover it here, if you like to check out their FAQ and tutorials I think you’d be glad you did.\n\n1.) Again, download the software either from CNET, the AutoHotKey website, or directly.\n\n2.) Find the installer and double-click it to start the installation.\n\n3.) Agree to UAC warning (if applicable) and wait for this screen to pop up, signaling installation.\n\n4.) Once you’re here, click ‘Exit’ and we can proceed to the next step.\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 2.) Finding and Installing the DevCon Tools\n\nWhen I first started toying with the idea of disabling my mouse, I went to the Windows Device Manager to see how the computer would react to me repeatedly disabling and enabling the device. This method worked well, but what I didn’t have was ‘command line’ access the sweetness of the Device Manager.\n\nThe good news is that Microsoft built a software tool to allow us this access. The bad news is that to get it, you need to download and extract it from the latest version of the Windows Driver Kit. (A 600+MB download for a 600 KB file, come on Microsoft!) Anyway, like AutoHotKey, DevCon is a powerful little software and Microsoft’s got a great write-up about it plus many examples at their Dev Center website.\n\nA.) We’ll start by downloading the latest version of DevCon. Like I said above, if you want, you can head over to the Microsoft Social Technet Page and follow their instructions on extracting the tiny DevCon.exe from their huge Windows Driver Kit. Or (while I can’t promise to keep it up to date) I’ve linked the extracted file to my DropBox account. Your call.\n\nB.) If you downloaded the file from my DropBox, check the md5 sum against this code for the zipped file: 9e2856cbb7853b2fb9306fb2924bc249\n\nC.) However you acquired it, once you have DevCon.exe, you’ll need to place it in a folder where it can live forever. Once we’re done with these instructions, this is the program we’ll be calling to do our heavy lifting. Just for reference, I placed mine in my personal folder at: c:\\users\\michael\\devcon, and in the future I’ll refer to this as ‘Your DevCon Folder.’\n\nThat’s it. We don’t have to install DevCon as the program is a stand-alone. If that’s confusing, don’t worry – you’ll understand in a few minutes.\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 3.) Creating the mouse_list.txt File\n\nOnce we’ve got DevCon.exe stowed away, we’ll need to ask it to give us a list of all the mice (touchpads are ‘mouse’ devices) and their device identification numbers. Think about it like this; Windows needs the touchpad’s phone number so that it can call the touchpad and tell it it’s time to go to sleep, but before we can find the right phone number we need a list of all the numbers associated with the name ‘mouse’ in the computer. To generate this list:\n\nA.) Open a Command Prompt window with administrative privileges.\n\nHit the Windows Key and type ‘cmd’\n\nNOTE: For DevCon to function properly, it needs access to the computer’s lower-level functions, hence running this window (and later our full program) in ‘Admin mode.’\n\nHINT: On most Windows PCs, once you find the ‘Command Prompt’ icon, you can right-click on it and select Run as Administrator. If you’re still confused, there’s a great walkthrough over to Technet. Read all about it.\n\nB.) Now that we’ve got our Command Prompt window open, let’s navigate to the folder where you placed the DevCon.exe file.\n\nFor me this was done by typing in ‘cd’ and then the path to my file that I mentioned earlier ‘c:\\users\\michael\\devcon’ You can see it clearly in the window below.\n\nC.) Once we’re in the correct directory, we’ll need to tell DevCon to give us our list of mouse device IDs. You’ll type in the command below to tell DevCon to use its ‘Find’ function to find and create this list. Specifically, you’ll want to type:\n\ndevcon find =mouse > mouse_list.txt\n\nWhat do these things mean, you ask? I’m glad you did. They simply mean:\n\n1.) devcon – tells the command prompt we want to use the devcon program.\n\n2.) find – tells DevCon that we specifically want to use its Find facility.\n\n3.) =mouse – tells the Find facility that we want to find only mouse devices.\n\n4.) > – tells DevCon that we want the list of devices written somewhere specific.\n\n5.) mouse_list.txt – tells DevCon that this specific place should be a text file called mouse_list.txt\n\n6.) For a simple explanation see: DevCon instructions\n\n7.) For an in depth discussion, see: Microsoft’s Dev Center DevCon Page\n\nD.) The resulting ‘mouse_list.txt’ file will be placed in your DevCon directory, and the command window should look something like this:\n\nNOTE: We could just as easily ask DevCon to find and output a list of all the devices on our computer. To do this, just replace the ‘=mouse’ with the wildcard argument ‘*’ as seen below. We don’t do this here because the list contains over one hundred items and can be a lot to look through.\n\nA.) Open File Explorer and navigate to your DevCon folder. There you should find your freshly created device_list.txt file.\n\nB.) Double-click on this file to open it, and take a look at what’s inside. It should look like the image below, with a list of device IDs on the left and list of corresponding device descriptions on the right.\n\nNOTE: Just like any phone directory (well, US at least), there’s more than one Smith in this book. The list above has two mice listed: The first (in blue) turns out to be my touchpad. The second (red) is my Apple Bluetooth mouse that I use occasionally at home. It follows then that every mouse device that I’ve ever plugged into my computer will have its own device ID, as each one would need its own line of communication with the computer. It also makes sense then that if we disable the wrong device (say, my Apple Bluetooth mouse), we wouldn’t be able to tell until something (my Apple Bluetooth mouse) simply didn’t work. We’ll need to carefully isolate the precise ID for the touchpad, which brings us to our next step.\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 4.) Isolating the Touchpad’s ID\n\nNow we need a way to test our IDs to isolate which one is associated with our touchpad. Using the DevCon functions ‘disable’ and ‘enable’ we’ll step through our list of suspect device IDs to figure out exactly which one controls the touchpad.\n\nA.) The commands we’ll issue to test our suspect device IDs are:\n\ndevcon disable @”HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000” devcon enable @”HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000”\n\nNOTE: The various parts of these commands can be described as follows:\n\ndevcon – Just like our Devon ‘find’ example in step 3, this tells the command prompt that we want to use the DevCon program. enable/ disable – Bolded above only for emphasis, tells DevCon that we want to either enable or disable whichever device that we tell it to. @”TEST_DEVICE_ID_GOES_HERE” – Tells DevCon which device to perform the action on. Here, the @ symbol tells DevCon to look ‘at’ the specific ID in quotes. For more examples, check out Microsoft’s Dev Center page.\n\nB.) Working down your list of suspected device IDs, you’ll take turns turning things off, testing to see if they work (hopefully not), and then turning them back on.\n\nHINT: When working in Command Prompt, you can hit ‘up-arrow’ on the keyboard to re-type the last command quickly. Then using the left and right arrows and delete, you can modify this command (changing enable to disable by deleting ‘en’ and typing ‘dis’).\n\nThis example below disabled a Bluetooth mouse, but not my touchpad…\n\nBy substituting the correct string (yellow boxes below), I had rendered my touchpad inoperable when the device was ‘disabled’ and turned it back on when ‘enabled.’ I had found my touchpad’s device ID. Now find yours.\n\nNOTE: I believe these IDs are unique for every system. Though I haven’t confirmed this for many devices, I can report that the IDs were not similar across my 13”, and my wife’s 11” MacBook Airs, likely due to the different hardware.\n\nC.) Once you have found your touchpad’s device ID string, make a special note of it. We’ll be using this in the script we write to turn the device on and off for us.\n\nBack to Short Version\n\nStep 5.) Building an Executable\n\nThis is without a doubt our longest step and the one that will likely cause the most ‘Hunh?’ moments, so I’m going to go over it very slowly.\n\nNow that we have isolated our touchpad’s device ID, we’ll want to make a small program that turns this device on or off based on the device’s current status. This will require three major steps; A.) finding a way to check if the mouse is on or off (its ‘status’), B.) turning the mouse on or off, and C.) saving the program as an excecutable file that we can run as an administrator.\n\nA.) First we’ll need to devise a way to check if the device is enabled or disabled (what we’ll call the ‘status’ of the device).\n\ni. To their credit, the DevCon team made the first step very easy. They built a function into DevCon that outputs a file for the user telling them if the device in question is enabled or disabled. This command looks like:\n\ndevcon status @”HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000” > EnOrDis.txt\n\nii. This works in a very similar way to DevCon’s ‘find’ command in Step 3, only it outputs a text file with the current status of the device.\n\nHere is the Command in action:\n\nAnd the file output:\n\nIf we disable the device, and re-write the status file EnOrDis.txt:\n\nThe file then looks like:\n\nThe difference between the two being in the third line of the EnOrDis.txt file, which tells us if the device is running or disabled. Now that we know this, we can combine it with our knowledge of how to turn devices on or off. Then we can write a script to do all of this for us.\n\nB.) If you’re unfamiliar with batch files, they’re simply very basic computer programs that are written in a text editor (for us, Notepad) and saved as a .bat file. While we won’t be actually creating a stand-alone batch file, the structure of our code will be the same as the format and commands which you would use to create one. These programs are basically the same as typing commands into the command prompt, only you don’t have to physically type them in every time. The program will do that for you.\n\nNOTE: If you want to find out more about Batch Files, check this Wiki and Rob Vanderwoude’s web page on all things script.\n\n1.) Before trying to type out a program, it’s always a good idea to think through what we’re going to ask the program to do for us. So, what steps do we want this program to take?\n\ni. We want our program to start off in the directory where we keep the DevCon program devcon.exe\n\ncd \"C:\\users\\michael\\devcon\"\n\nii. Once there, we want our program to ask Devcon to write the current status of our touchpad device out to a file.\n\ndevcon status @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC& 0&0000\" > EnOrDis.txt\n\niii. We then want our program to check if it can find the word ‘disabled’ in the file made by DevCon in the previous step.\n\nfindstr \"disabled\" EnOrDis.txt\n\niv. If our program finds the word ‘disabled’ (indicating that the touchpad is disabled) we want it to ask DevCon to ‘enable’ the touchpad (or turn it on for us).\n\nIF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( devcon enable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\"\n\nv. But, if our program doesn’t find the word ‘disabled’ (indicating that the touchpad is enabled) we want it to ask DevCon to ‘disable’ the touchpad (or turn it off for us).\n\n) ELSE (\n\ndevcon disable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\"\n\n)\n\n2.) Let’s open an instance of Notepad. (It’s usually found under Start -> Programs -> Accessories, but you can find it quickly by typing ‘notepad’ into the start menu’s search bar.)\n\ni. Copy and paste from ‘cd’ to the final ‘)’ into your open Notepad window:\n\ncd \"C:\\users\\michael\\devcon\" devcon status @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" > EnOrDis.txt findstr \"disabled\" EnOrDis.txt IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( devcon enable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" ) ELSE ( devcon disable @\"HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000\" )\n\nii. Modify the “C:\\users\\michael\\devcon” to reflect your path\n\niii. Modify the device ID string “HID\\VID_05AC&PID_023F&MI_01&COL01\\7&D8303FC&0&0000” to reflect your touchpad’s device ID.\n\nNOTE: You need to do this in all three locations of your code (status, enable, and disable).\n\nHINT: In order for the program to function, formatting is very important. Even small alterations to the flow of the code or syntax can result in errors. If you get lost, check your file against the image below, or download my sample file (md5: 11ae75d842248932c3a48f522cf01c42) for comparison. For further information, see the Batch File Wiki, or SS64’s page on Batch Commands.\n\nHINT: Here, the ‘findstr’ command is telling the command prompt that we want to look for the string ‘disabled’ in the file EnOrDis.txt. If findstr finds the word ‘disabled’ in the file, it sets what’s known as the ‘error level’ to a value of 0 (In other words: I found it. zero problems.) If it does not find it, it sets the same error level to 1 (Or: I have an error, I can’t find that here.) The code section that follows simply tells the program what to do based on this information.\n\n3.) The only thing left for this step it to save the text file to your DevCon folder. While you won’t need this file when we’re done (we’ll turn it into an executable in the next step) it’s small and doesn’t hurt anything to have hanging around for reference.\n\n4.) Take a break. Stretch. Focus on something in the distance to relax your eyes. You’ve come quite far! Now you’ve got some code that can turn your mouse on and off. Next we’ll put it some place where we can make it useful.\n\nC.) Now we need a program that we can tell to ‘Run in Administrator Mode’ every time it runs. We need this because Windows (for security reasons) is picky about just who it lets do what. The software we’ll use to accomplish this is Advanced BAT to EXE Convertor (Alternative CNET Download) which (just like it says) will take the code that we’ve written and create what’s known as an executable file, which we can run as the Administrator. If you haven’t already, download the software from the link above and run it. Advanced BAT to EXE Converter should install in seconds. Once it does:\n\n1.) Run the program to open up a new instance. It should look like:\n\n2.) Remember the Notepad window full of code that we left minimized in part B.) just above? Find this window and copy all of the text.\n\nHint: Once you have the window called up, you can use the keyboard shortcuts ’Ctrl.+a’ to select all of the text, and ‘Ctrl.+c’ to copy it.\n\n3.) Once you have copied the contents of the Notepad window to the clipboard, select the Advanced BAT to EXE window and past the clipboard contents ‘Crtl.+v’ to the line directly below ‘@echo off’ You should have something that looks like this:\n\n4.) Next, click on the Build EXE icon highlighted in red in the image above. This will bring up the Save EXE dialog box. Browse to your DevCon folder and give your program a name. I chose EnaDis.exe.\n\n5.) Once you click Save, you’ll be presented with several options for your file. I’m not sure what most of these do, but I do know that I don’t want a bunch of pop-ups every time it does. If you’re like me, Place a check in the box that tells the executable that you want it to ‘Start Invisible’ (unless you want a nice pop-up every time):\n\nAccept the warning that comes with running a program in ‘invisible’ mode.\n\nAnd viola, you should have an executable in your DevCon directory.\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 6.) Setting the Executable to Run as Administrator\n\nHere we’ll tell Windows that we always want this program to run in Administrator mode.\n\nA.) In File Explorer, navigate to your DevCon folder, find the EnaDis.exe, and Right-click on the program’s icon. This brings up the file options.\n\nB.) From the options list, select ‘Properties’\n\nC.) This will bring up the EnaDis.exe Properties menu. On the Compatibility tab, click the ‘Change settings for all users’ box.\n\nD.) Check the box near the bottom that says ‘Run this program as an administrator’ followed by ‘Apply’ and ‘OK.’\n\nE.) Click ‘OK’ again to exit the ‘Properties’ dialog box\n\nPerfect, now every time you run the program, it will run in Administrator Mode, and be able to turn the mouse on and off.\n\nCAUTION: If you double-click on the exe that you created at this stage, you’ll turn off your touchpad. This isn’t a big deal if you have another mouse plugged in, but if you don’t you’ll have to ‘ALT+TAB’ through open windows and ‘TAB’ through these windows’ interiors.\n\nNOTE: There’s one issue that makes this setup less than ideal. Every time you run the executable, you’ll be asked if you want to allow the program to make changes to the computer. This is a necessary evil at this point, but we’ll overcome it when we setup a Scheduled Task to call our AutoHotKey script.\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 7.) Linking the File to a HotKey Press.\n\nIn this step we’ll create the hotkey press that will run the executable file that we created in Step 6. To do this:\n\nIf you haven’t already, download and install AutoHotKey (Alternative CNET Download). The express installation only takes a couple of seconds and when it’s done you’ll be presented with this:\n\nChose ‘Exit’ for the time being. We’ll see how this is run momentarily.\n\nA.) Building an AutoHotKey script is a lot like writing a batch file, first open a new instance of Notepad.\n\nB.) Copy and paste the following AutoHotKey preamble into your Notepad window:\n\n#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.\n\n; #Warn ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.\n\nSendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.\n\nSetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir% ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.\n\nC.) Next, below the preamble, enter the following line into the open Notepad window:\n\n^!n:: Run \"C:\\users\\michael\\devcon\\EnaDis.exe\"\n\n1.) This tells AutoHotKey that every time it sees you press the CONTROL (^), ALT (!), and n (n) keys it should run your program.\n\n2.) Modify the path to reflect the location of your DevCon directory.\n\nNOTE: Here, I chose the Control, ALT, and n keys for my button press, but you can choose from almost any combination imaginable. Just be careful that the key press you choose doesn’t already do something else. When I first tried this, I thought about useing the m (instead of the n) key. However, after testing Control, Alt, m in Microsoft Word, I discovered that this key-press inserts a comment. If you’re curious about other key combinations in AutoHotKey, or Microsoft Word hotkeys, just follow the links for more info.\n\nD.) Now, type in the following line (or copy and paste):\n\nIfWinExist alert window Send !Y\n\nNOTE: This tells AutoHotKey that, if it sees an alert window (like a UAC alert), to automatically answer yes so that the window doesn’t bother you.\n\nE.) Save the file using the ‘Save As…’ option, selecting ‘All Files’ in the ‘Save as type:’ dropdown, and save your script (in your DevCon folder) as ‘AutoHotKeyScript.ahk’\n\nHINT: To edit a script file (like an .ahk file or .bat file) you can no longer double-click on them to edit them, as this will run them as scripts. Instead, to edit any script (AutoHotKey, batch file, or otherwise), right-click on the file and select ‘Edit’\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 8.) Set the AutoHotKey.exe to Run as Administrator\n\nIn order to call the AutoHotKey script we created above without setting off any warnings, we need to set AutoHotKey.exe to always run as an administrator for all users. To do this:\n\nA.) In File Explorer, navigate to the folder location of your AutoHotKey installation.\n\nMine was C:\\Program Files\\AutoHotKey\\ Alternatively, you could search your computer for the file.\n\nB.) Right-click on the AutoHotKey.exe file, and (just as we did with our EnaDis.exe file in Section 7):\n\nClick on ‘Properties’ Select the ‘Compatibility’ tab Click on ‘Change settings for all users’ Check the box next to ‘Run the program as an administrator’ Click Apply Click OK to close the Compatibility window Click OK to close the Properties window\n\nBack to the Short Version\n\nStep 9.) Create a Scheduled Task\n\nFace it: Windows is a little quirky. If we double-click on our .ahk script at this point, the script will run and we’ll be able to press ‘CTRL+ALT+n’ to turn our touchpad off and on. But every time we run the AutoHotKeyScript.ahk file, we’ll come up against a Windows UAC alert warning. To overcome this, we’ll setup a Scheduled Task to call the AutoHotKeyScript.ahk file for us with administrative privileges whenever we log into our Windows account. No more annoying pop-ups, just a nice, clean hotkey. Let’s wrap this up.\n\nA.) Open the Task Scheduler from the Start menu.\n\nYou can either:\n\nClick ‘Start’ – ‘All Programs’ – ‘Administrative Tools’ – ‘Task Scheduler’\n\nOr you can:\n\ni. Click ‘Start’\n\nii. Type in ‘Task Scheduler’ in the start menu’s search box and hit enter.\n\nB.) Once the Task Scheduler opens, click on the “Create Task” option.\n\nC.) Our first stop will be the ‘General’ tab. Here you’ll want to do a few things.\n\n1.) Give your scheduled task a name.\n\nI chose the ridiculously descriptive ‘AutoHotKeyScriptCall’\n\n2.) Give your task a good description.\n\nA few seconds spent on a good description can save a lot minutes down the road.\n\n3.) Make sure the ‘Run only when user is logged on’ radio button is selected.\n\nWe choose this because there’s no point in letting our process run when no one’s there, and choosing another option can introduce known conflicts.\n\n4.) Check the box next to ‘Run with highest privileges’\n\nThis is the setting that allows us to run the script as an administrator, without getting a nasty UAC warning every time.\n\nD.) On the ‘Triggers’ tab:\n\n1.) Click ‘New…’ to bring up the ‘New Trigger’ dialog box\n\n2.) Change the drop-down menu at the top from ‘On a schedule’ to ‘At log on’\n\nThe default on my machine was for ‘Any user’ this should work fine and allow other users to run our script as well, though I haven’t tested this.\n\n3.) Click ‘OK’ to close the ‘New Trigger’ dialog, and let’s move on to ‘Actions’\n\nE.) On the ‘Actions’ tab:\n\n1.) Click ‘New…’ to bring up the ‘New Action’ dialog box.\n\n2.) Make sure the action selected is ‘Start a program’\n\nThis should be the default.\n\n3.) Browse to the location of your AutoHotKeyScript.ahk file and select it.\n\n4.) Click ‘OK’ to close the ‘New Action’ dialog box and move to ‘Conditions’\n\nF.) On the ‘Conditions’ tab:\n\n1.) Uncheck the box next to ‘Stop if the computer switches to battery power’\n\n2.) Uncheck the box next to ‘Stop the task only if the computer is on battery power’\n\n3.) Move on to the ‘Settings’ tab.\n\nG.) On the ‘Settings’ tab:\n\n1.) Leave the defaults in place\n\n2.) Click ‘OK’ to complete the ‘Create Task’ wizard.\n\nH.) Take a look at your brand new scheduled task.\n\nAnd that should be about it. Barring any problems, you should be able to restart you’re computer, and (once it’s done loading) press ‘CTRL+ALT+n’ (at the same time) to turn your mouse on and off. If it works, great! If not, let me know what’s not working and I’ll see what I can do to help. I hope you found this tutorial interesting. If you have any comments or suggestions on how to make it better, please let me know in the comments section.\n\nLater,\n\nMichael\n\nResources & Links:\n\nRequired Software\n\nSample Files\n\nPotentially Helpful Links\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_13079": "ARE SIT UPS A WASTE OF TIME?\n\nARE SIT UPS REALLY A WASTE OF TIME?\n\nI’ve been hearing something going around lately that’s really getting to me.\n\n“SIT UPS ARE A WASTE OF TIME!”…really?!\n\nAt first I thought to myself, “Yeah, I see how they can be a waste of time.” BUT the more I thought about it the more I started thinking, “WAIT A MINUTE…that’s some Bull Sh$@ I simply cannot support and/or agree with.”\n\nYou see, like all things in life, it’s not that simple…and it completely depends.\n\nWHEN ARE SIT UPS A WASTE OF TIME\n\nLet’s say you are just starting to workout and that you need to lose more than 75 pounds, well then, sit ups would be a waste of your time.\n\nSIT UPS ARE A WASTE OF TIME WHEN…\n\nSit ups for anyone trying to lose more than 30 pounds and/or are over 23% body fat for men and about 30% fat for women, is simply a waste of time IF and only IF they can replace a 15-minute ab routine with a good high-intensity cardio routine.\n\nThe reason is simple; a 15-minute ab routine never burns as many calories as a higher intensity cardio routine. So, if you’ve only got time for abs or to run, ALWAYS RUN…hard!\n\nNow, that being said, note exactly what was just said – “IF you only have time for EITHER an ab routine or a run.”\n\nSo, if you have time for both, a nice cardio routine and an ab routine, THEN DO BOTH!\n\nI can’t stress this important point enough to the people I hear tell me, “Well, I heard sit ups are a waste of time because abs is all about cardio and diet….and genetics”\n\nThe truth of the matter is that getting those side obliques and lower abs is all about what we put in our mouths and how many calories we burn…AND AS FOR THE GENETICS EXCUSE – DON’T GET ME STARTED…another post for another time!\n\nBUT THERE’S SO MUCH MORE TO SIT UPS!\n\nWHY SIT UPS ARE NOT A WASTE OF TIME!\n\nA WEAK CORE = AN OVERALL WEAKER YOU\n\nFirst and foremost, most of the people working out across America do your typical-run-of-the-mill circuit training and or weight lifting, and that’s all fine and dandy BUT it’s not really working out the core…so for most of these people an ab routine 3 days a week is CRUCIAL!\n\nIf your workout routine already involves a lot of core-engaging exercises then you most likely DO NOT need to make room for an ab routine…especially if it comes in the way of a cardio routine that will burn more calories.\n\nBUT, if the only core workout you do during the week is your ab routine, then you better try to fit it in ON TOP of your cardio routine…for those of us trying to lose weight that is.\n\nONCE THE WEIGHT COMES OFF YOU WANT TO SEE THE ABS…NO?\n\nSo, as mentioned above, if your workout program does not include solid core engagement, then sit ups are pretty important,\n\nBUT A STRONG CORE IS NOT THE ONLY REASON TO DO SIT UPS!\n\nI don’t know how many times I’ve heard people get discouraged because they’ve “Been dieting and working out for weeks and still can’t see (their) abs.” Well my friends, I hate to break it to you but if you’re not doing sit ups because they are “a waste of time” and your workout regime doesn’t include core development, then chances are you’ll have no abs to show. I mean, yeah, you’ll have abs…we all have abs…but we won’t really get to see them…you know what I mean.\n\nDON’T BE THAT GUY OR GAL\n\nSo, simply put – don’t be that guy or gal!\n\nMake sure that as you start losing the weight you really start working in time for those sit ups because nothing is more disheartening then working your tail off for results and seeing none!\n\nWHEN TO START DOING SIT UPS IF YOU AREN’T ALREADY DOING SO?\n\nSO, WHEN SHOULD YOU START DOING ABS?\n\nFirst and foremost, it’ll be different for everyone.\n\nFirst of all – everyone’s body build and genetics are different. Second, body fat percentage is not an exact science unless you’re submerged in water in a facility about exact science.

Bush’s post-reelection inaugural committees. The company’s former CEO Rex Tillerson is now Trump’s secretary of State.\n\nDow Chemical, who is among Trump’s largest inaugural donors with a $1 million donation, also gave $250,000 to Bush’s 2005 inaugural.\n\nA few weeks after the contribution, Trump named Dow Chemical’s CEO as the head of the American Manufacturing Council in his administration.\n\nTrump lauded CEO Andrew Liveris as “one of the most respected businessmen in the world,” who is keeping jobs with the Michigan-based Dow in the United States.\n\nLivernis praised Trump in turn.\n\n“You’re paving the way with your administration and your policies to make it easier to do business in this country,” said Liveris, a native Australian, at the event announcing his appointment to the council. “Not a red-tape country, but a red-carpet country for America’s businesses. America first!”\n\nSeveral companies that helped fund Trump’s inauguration did not give money to the reelection inaugurals of Obama or Bush, including Aetna, Anthem, MetLife Group, CVS Health and Monsanto.\n\nWalmart and UPS also gave money to support Trump’s inauguration, according to Fox News, though the amounts remain unknown.\n\nTrump’s presidential inaugural committee reportedly raised $90 million to put on the events surrounding his swearing in on Jan. 20, dwarfing the amount raised by his predecessors.\n\nObama raised $53 million for his first inaugural in 2009 — and ended up with cash left over. He held 10 inaugural balls in 2009, which were all funded by donations to the presidential inaugural committee, while Trump only threw three of the galas.\n\nBush took in $42 million following his election to a second term in 2004, with more than $20 million coming from corporations, industry groups, investment firms and lobby shops, according to a tally of federal records by The Hill.

Part of that included eschewing corporate donations for his 2009 inaugural.

  "latent_13730": "Christian author Tim LaHaye (Screen cap).\n\nTim LaHaye, evangelical leader and best-selling author of the Left Behind series died earlier today, July 25, 2016 after suffering a stroke. He was 90. LaHaye had made a career out of preaching a version of Christianity that saw gay people as monsters and Catholics as pagans among other views. Here is a list of reasons that Raw Story suspects he may be “left behind” should the Rapture turn out to be anything more than a fictional event.\n\n1. LaHaye was prompted to write his best-selling book series after judging others’ behavior. At LaHaye’s bio page, he explained that he was prompted to write the first book in the series of Left Behind novels, which tell the story of a post-apocalyptic world where Christ has selected deserving Christians in the Rapture and left behind those who sinned, after observing a couple flirting.\n\n“Dr. LaHaye said the idea for the apocalyptic series came during a flight when he noticed a married pilot flirting with an attendant. The incident prompted the minister to wonder what would happen to the pilot if the pre-tribulation rapture came at that moment.”\n\n2. LaHaye was convinced that gay people were not “gay,” but could only live lives of misery. In 1978, LaHaye penned a book entitled The Unhappy Gays. In a review published in Bookslut, LaHaye’s views of the unhappy gay “lifestyle” were described as:\n\nFor the record, LaHaye doesn’t actually approve of the word “gay.” Or at least he didn’t in 1978. The third chapter of The Unhappy Gays is titled, seriously, “Gay It Isn’t!” LaHaye explains: “Not many years ago ‘gay’ meant ‘fun’ and was a word utilized by all kinds of people….It costs the taxpayers of California approximately $20 million a year to treat homosexuals for VD. Taking massive doses of penicillin to cure VD certainly is not gay!” Uh, I guess not. LaHaye goes on to list “sixteen reasons why ‘gay’ isn’t gay.” These include loneliness, guilt, selfishness, depression, and my personal favorite, “vulnerability to sadism-masochism.” LaHaye’s image of gays seems to have been wholly informed by those horrible ’70s melodramas about the evil dark side of the gay world. Think Al Pacino’s Cruising — which, in fairness, was released after LaHaye’s book was published.\n\n3. He was one of the founding members of the Moral Majority. The right-wing Christian political organization was founded by Jerry Falwell, Tim LaHaye, and Greg Dixon. Among the campaigns that the Moral Majority was associated with included supporting Anita Bryant’s campaign to discriminate against gay people in Florida, and running evangelist Pat Robertson for president.\n\n4. LaHaye dismissed Catholicism as a “false religion.” He was removed as chair of the Jack Kemp presidential campaign in 1988 after just four days when his anti-Catholic views came to light. LaHaye had founded a mission to Catholics that was virulently anti-Catholic and sought to convert them to evangelical Christianity.\n\nWriting about Pope John Paul II, LaHaye and his co-writer for the Left Behind books were described as believing:\n\nThe present pope,” the pair assert, “is on record as believing in the Trinity and may indeed pray in the name of Jesus Christ. However, his infatuation with the vision of Fatima and his reverence for Mary (whom he credits with saving his life from an assassin’s bullet) concerns some who fear he could be setting up his church and the religions of the world for the fulfillment of Revelation 17, where the ‘Mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots,’ unifies all the religions of the world during the first half of the Tribulation.”\n\n5. He believed that the “Illuminati” controlled worldly events. According to an article published by the organization “Americans United for the Separation of Church and State,” LaHaye wrote in one of his books:",

  "latent_13803": "This article is about the 1917 revolution in Russia. For the 1848 revolution in France, see French Revolution of 1848 . For the 2014 revolution in Ukraine, see 2014 Ukraine revolution\n\nThe February Revolution (Russian: Февра́льская револю́ция, IPA: [fʲɪvˈralʲskəjə rʲɪvɐˈlʲutsɨjə], tr. Febrálʹskaya revolyútsiya), known in Soviet historiography as the February Bourgeois Democratic Revolution,[2] was the first of two revolutions which took place in Russia in 1917.\n\nThe main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd (present-day St. Petersburg), the then-capital of Russia, where long-standing discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing on 23 February Old Style (8 March New Style).[3] Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days, involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes, the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S. (12 March N.S.) mutinous Russian Army forces sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, ending Romanov dynastic rule and the Russian Empire. A Russian Provisional Government under Prince Georgy Lvov replaced the Council of Ministers of Russia.\n\nThe revolution appeared to break out without any real leadership or formal planning.[4] Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914. Disaffected soldiers from the city's garrison joined bread rioters, primarily women in bread lines, and industrial strikers on the streets. As more and more troops deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Front, the city fell into chaos, leading to the overthrow of the Tsar. In all, over 1,300 people were killed during the protests of February 1917.[5]\n\nCauses [ edit ]\n\nA number of factors contributed to the February Revolution, both short and long term. Historians disagree on the main factors that contributed to this. Liberal historians emphasise the turmoil created by the war, whereas Marxists emphasise the inevitability of change. Alexander Rabinowitch summarises the main long-term and short-term causes:\n\nThe February 1917 revolution ... grew out of pre-war political and economic instability, technological backwardness, and fundamental social divisions, coupled with gross mismanagement of the war effort, continuing military defeats, domestic economic dislocation, and outrageous scandals surrounding the monarchy.[7]\n\nLong-term causes [ edit ]\n\nDespite its occurrence at the height of World War I, the roots of the February Revolution date further back. Chief among these was Imperial Russia's failure, throughout the 19th and early 20th century, to modernise its archaic social, economic and political structures while maintaining the stability of ubiquitous devotion to an autocratic monarch. As historian Richard Pipes writes, \"the incompatibility of capitalism and autocracy struck all who gave thought to the matter\".\n\nThe first major event of the Russian Revolution was the February Revolution, which was a chaotic affair, caused by the culmination of over a century of civil and military unrest. There were many causes of this unrest of the common people towards the Tsar and aristocratic landowners. The causes can be summarized as the ongoing cruel treatment of peasants by the bourgeoisie, poor working conditions of industrial workers and the spreading of western democratic ideas by political activists. All of these causes led to a growing political and social awareness in the lower classes of Russia. Dissatisfaction of proletarians was compounded by food shortages and military failures. In 1905, Russia experienced humiliating losses in its war with Japan, then Bloody Sunday and the Revolution of 1905, in which Tsarist troops fired upon a peaceful, unarmed crowd, further dividing Nicholas II from his people. Widespread strikes, riots and the famous mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin ensued.\n\nThese conditions caused much agitation among the small working and professional classes. This tension erupted into general revolt with the 1905 Revolution, and again under the strain of war in 1917, this time with lasting consequences.\n\nShort-term causes [ edit ]\n\nStudents and soldiers firing across the Moyka at the police\n\nThe revolution was provoked by Russian military failures during the First World War, as well as public dissatisfaction with the way the country was run on the home front. The economic challenges faced due to fighting a total war also contributed.\n\nIn August 1914, all classes supported and virtually all political deputies voted in favour of the war.[11] The declaration of war was followed by a revival of nationalism across Russian society, which temporarily reduced internal strife. The army achieved some early victories (such as in Galicia in 1915 and with the Brusilov Offensive in 1916) but also suffered major defeats, notably Tannenberg in August 1914, the Winter Battle in Masuria in February 1915 and the loss of Russian Poland during May to August 1915. Nearly six million casualties—dead, wounded and missing—had been accrued by January 1917. Mutinies sprang up more often (most due to simple war-weariness), morale was at its lowest, and the newly called up officers and commanders were at times very incompetent. Like all major armies, Russia's armed forces had inadequate supply. The pre-revolution desertion rate ran at around 34,000 a month. Meanwhile, the wartime alliance of industry, Duma (lower house of parliament) and Stavka (Military High Command) started to work outside the Tsar's control.\n\nIn an attempt to boost morale and repair his reputation as a leader, Nicholas announced in the summer of 1915 that he would take personal command of the army, in defiance of almost universal advice to the contrary. The result was disastrous on three grounds. Firstly, it associated the monarchy with the unpopular war; secondly, Nicholas proved to be a poor leader of men on the front, often irritating his own commanders with his interference;[15] and thirdly, being at the front made him unavailable to govern. This left the reins of power to his wife, the German Tsarina Alexandra, who was unpopular and accused of being a spy and under the thumb of her confidant, Grigori Rasputin, himself so unpopular that he was assassinated by members of the nobility in December 1916. The Tsarina proved an ineffective ruler in a time of war, announcing a rapid succession of different Prime Ministers and angering the Duma. The lack of strong leadership is illustrated by a telegram from Octobrist politician Mikhail Rodzianko to the Tsar on 26 February O.S. (11 March N.S), 1917, in which Rodzianko begged for a minister with the \"confidence of the country\" be instated immediately. Delay, he wrote, would be \"tantamount to death\".\n\nOn the home front, a famine loomed and commodities became scarce due to the overstretched railroad network. Meanwhile, refugees from German-occupied Russia came in their millions. The Russian economy, which had just seen one of the highest growth rates in Europe, was blocked from the continent's markets by the war. Though industry did not collapse, it was considerably strained and when inflation soared, wages could not keep up. The Duma, which was composed of liberal deputies, warned Tsar Nicholas II of the impending danger and counselled him to form a new constitutional government, like the one he had dissolved after some short-term attempts in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution. The Tsar ignored the advice.[4] Historian Edward Acton argues that \"by stubbornly refusing to reach any modus vivendi with the Progressive Bloc of the Duma... Nicholas undermined the loyalty of even those closest to the throne [and] opened an unbridgeable breach between himself and public opinion.\" In short, the Tsar no longer had the support of the military, the nobility or the Duma (collectively the élites), or the Russian people. The result was revolution.\n\nEvents [ edit ]\n\nTowards the February Revolution [ edit ]\n\nThe abdication of Nicholas II on March 2, 1917 O.S. In the royal train: Minister of the Court Baron Fredericks, General N. Ruzsky, V. V. Shulgin, A. I. Guchkov, Nicholas II. ( State Historical Museum\n\nOn 29 December O.S. (11 January N.S.), a hesitating Nikolai Golitsyn became the successor of Trepov, who was dismissed. Golitsyn begged the Emperor to cancel his appointment, citing his lack of preparation for the role of Prime Minister. On 3 January O.S. (16 January N.S) Dmitry Shuvayev, who did not speak any foreign language, was succeeded by Mikhail Belyaev as Minister of War, likely at the request of the Empress.[20]\n\n\"In the seventeen months of the 'Tsarina's rule', from September 1915 to February 1917, Russia had four Prime Ministers, five Ministers of the Interior, three Foreign Ministers, three War Ministers, three Ministers of Transport and four Ministers of Agriculture. This \"ministerial leapfrog\", as it came to be known, not only removed competent men from power, but also disorganized the work of government since no one remained long enough in office to master their responsibilities.\"[21]\n\nThe Duma President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice.[22] Many people came to the conclusion that the problem was not Rasputin.[23] According to Rodzianko the Empress \"exerts an adverse influence on all appointments, including even those in the army.\" On 11 January O.S. (24 January N.S.) the Duma opening was postponed to the 25th (7 February N.S.).[24] On 14 January O.S. (27 January N.S.) Georgy Lvov proposed to Grand Duke Nicholas that he take control of the country. At the end of January/beginning of February major negotiations took place between the allied powers in Petrograd; unofficially they sought to clarify the internal situation in Russia.[25] On 14 February O.S. (27 February N.S.) police agents reported that army officers had, for the first time, mingled with the crowds demonstrating against the war and the government on Nevsky Prospekt. Kerensky took the opportunity to attack the Tsarist regime.\n\nProtests [ edit ]\n\nRevolutionaries attacking the Tsar's police during the first days of the revolution\n\nCrowd on the Nevski Prospekt\n\nBurning of monarchistic symbols on 27 February (O.S.)\n\nMutinying soldiers in and on a car\n\nBy 1917, the majority of Russians had lost faith in the Tsarist regime.[26] Government corruption was unrestrained, and Tsar Nicholas II had frequently disregarded the Imperial Duma. Thousands of workers flooded the streets of Petrograd (modern St. Petersburg) to show their dissatisfaction.[27] The first major protest of the February Revolution occurred on 18 February O.S. (3 March N.S) as workers of Putilov Factory, Petrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike to demonstrate against the government.[5] Strikes continued on the following days. Due to heavy snowstorms, tens of thousands of freight cars were stuck on the tracks, with the bread and fuel. On 22 February O.S. (7 March N.S.) the Tsar left for the front.[28]\n\nOn 23 February O.S. (8 March N.S.), Putilov protesters were joined in the uprising by those celebrating International Woman's Day and protesting against the government's implemented food rationing.[29] As the Russian government began rationing flour and bread, rumors of food shortages circulated and bread riots erupted across the city of Petrograd.[29] Women, in particular, were passionate in showing their dissatisfaction with the implemented rationing system, and the female workers marched to nearby factories to recruit over 50,000 workers for strike.[30] Both men and women flooded the streets of Petrograd, demanding an end to Russian food shortages, the end of World War I and the end of autocracy.\"[27] By the following day 24 February O.S. (March 9 N.S), nearly 200,000 protesters filled the streets, demanding the replacement of the Tsar with a more progressive political leader.[27] The protesting mob called for the war to end and for the Russian monarchy to be overthrown.[29] By 25 February O.S (10 March N.S), nearly all industrial enterprises in Petrograd were shut down by the uprising.[5] Although all gatherings on the streets were absolutely forbidden some 250,000 people were on strike. The president of the Imperial Duma Rodzianko asked the chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikolai Golitsyn to resign; the minister of Foreign Affairs Nikolai Pokrovsky proposed the resignation of the whole government. There were disturbances on the Nevsky Prospect during the day[31] and in the late afternoon four people were killed.\n\nThe Tsar took action to address the riots on 25 February O.S (10 March N.S) by wiring garrison commander General Sergey Semyonovich Khabalov, an inexperienced and extremely indecisive commander of the Petrograd military district, to disperse the crowds with rifle fire[32][33] and to suppress the \"impermissible\" rioting by force. On the 26 February O.S (11 March N.S) the center of the city was fenced off.\n\nThat evening Golitsyn used a (signed,[34] but not yet dated) ukaze declaring that his Majesty had decided to interrupt the Duma until April, leaving it with no legal authority to act.[note 1]\n\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 February O.S (11 March N.S) the Fourth Company of the Pavlovski Replacement Regiment broke out of their barracks upon learning that another detachment of the regiment had clashed with demonstrators near the Kazan Cathedral. After firing at mounted police the soldiers of the Fourth Company were disarmed by the Preobrazhensky Regiment. This marked the first instance of open mutiny in the Petrograd garrison.[36]\n\nOn the next day (27 February O.S, 12 March N.S), the Duma remained obedient, and \"did not attempt to hold an official sitting\". Then some delegates decided to form a Provisional Committee of the State Duma, led by Rodzianko and backed by major Moscow manufacturers and St. Petersburg bankers. Its first meeting was on the same evening and ordered the arrest of all the ex-ministers and senior officials.[37] The Duma refused to head the revolutionary movement. At the same time, socialists also formed the Petrograd Soviet. In the Marinsky Palace the Council of Ministers of Russia, assisted by Rodzyanko, held its last meeting. Protopopov was told to resign and offered to commit suicide.[38] The Council formally submitted its resignation to the Tsar.\n\nBy nightfall, General Khabalov and his forces faced a capital controlled by revolutionaries.[39] The protesters of Petrograd burned and sacked the premises of the district court, the headquarters of the secret police, and many police stations. They also occupied the Ministry of Transport, seized the arsenal, and released prisoners into the city.[39] Army officers retreated into hiding and many took refuge in the Admiralty building, but moved that night to the Winter Palace.[40]\n\nTsar's return and abdication [ edit ]\n\nGathering of the Duma on 1 March (O.S.)\n\nProtests in the street of Petrograd\n\nProtesters on Znamensky Square in front of the statue of Alexander III\n\nOn 26 February O.S (11 March N.S) Mikhail Rodzianko, Chairman of the Duma, had sent the Tsar a report of the chaos in a telegram (exact wordings and translations differ, but each retains a similar sense ):\n\nThe situation is serious. The capital is in a state of anarchy. The Government is paralyzed. Transport service and the supply of food and fuel have become completely disrupted. General discontent is growing ... There must be no delay. Any procrastination is tantamount to death. Rodzianko's first telegram to the Tsar, 11 March [O.S. 26 February] 1917.\n\nNicholas's response on 27 February O.S (12 March N.S), perhaps based on the Empress's earlier letter to him that the concern about Petrograd was an over-reaction, was one of irritation that \"again, this fat Rodzianko has written me lots of nonsense, to which I shall not even deign to reply\". Meanwhile, events unfolded in Petrograd. The bulk of the garrison mutinied, starting with the Volynsky Life Guards Regiment. Soldiers of this regiment brought the Litovsky, Preobrazhensky, and Moskovsky Regiments out on the street to join the rebellion,[39] resulting in the hunting down of police and the gathering of 40,000 rifles which were dispersed among the workers.[5] Even the Cossack units that the government had come to use for crowd control showed signs that they supported the people. Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified. Symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city and governmental authority in the capital collapsed — not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. Attempts were made by high-ranking military leaders to persuade the Tsar to resign power to the Duma in an effort to collapse war efforts and establish far-left power.[4] The response of the Duma, urged on by the Progressive Bloc, was to establish a Provisional Committee to restore law and order; the Provisional Committee declared itself the governing body of the Russian Empire. \"Chief among them was the desire to bring the war to a successful conclusion in conjunction with the Allies; and the very cause of their opposition was the ever deepening conviction that this was unattainable under the present government and under the present regime.[43] Meanwhile, the socialist parties re-established the Petrograd Soviet, first created during the 1905 revolution, to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day.\n\nOn 28 February, Rodzianko invited the Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich to put their signatures to the drafting of the Manifesto, in which Emperor Nicholas II was recommended to introduce the constitutional system in Russia. Rodzianko said that the Emperor will be asked to sign this Manifesto on 1 March at the station of Tsarskoe Selo immediately after his return. Late in the evening the text \"Grand Manifesto\" was signed by the Grand Dukes Paul Alexandrovich, Kirill Vladimirovich and Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich. But the Empress refused to sign the draft. \"I'm not a ruler – said the Empress – and have no rights to take the initiative in the absence of the Emperor. Moreover, this paper may not be only illegal, but useless.\"[45]\n\nOn 28 February O.S (13 March N.S), at five in the morning, the Tsar left Mogilev, (and also directed Nikolay Iudovich Ivanov to go to Tsarskoe Selo) but was unable to reach Petrograd as revolutionaries meanwhile controlled railway stations around the capital. Around midnight the train was stopped at Malaya Vishera, turned, and in the evening of 1 March O.S (14 March N.S) Nicholas arrived in Pskov. In the meantime the units guarding the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo either \"declared their neutrality\" or left for Petrograd and thus abandoned the Imperial Family. The Provisional Committee declared itself the governing body of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Army Chief Nikolai Ruzsky, and the Duma deputies Vasily Shulgin and Alexander Guchkov who had come to advise the Tsar, suggested that he abdicate the throne. He did so on behalf of himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday, 2 March O.S (15 March N.S), Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to succeed him. The next day the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown, stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action by the Russian Constituent Assembly, which shall define the form of government for Russia. The 300 year-old Romanov dynasty ended with the Grand Duke's decision on 3 March O.S (17 March N.S).[47] On 8 March O.S (22 March N.S) the former Tsar, addressed with contempt by the sentries as \"Nicholas Romanov\", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. He and his family and loyal retainers were placed under protective custody by the Provisional Government in the palace.\n\nEstablishment of Dual Power [ edit ]\n\nThe February Revolution immediately caused widespread excitement in Petrograd. On 3 March O.S (16 March N.S), a provisional government was announced by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma. The Provisional Government published its manifesto declaring itself the governing body of the Russian Empire that same day.[47] The manifesto proposed a plan of civic and political rights and the installation of a democratically elected Russian Constituent Assembly, but did not touch on many of the topics that were driving forces in the revolution such as participation in World War I and land.[51] At the same time, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) began organizing and was officially formed on 27 February. The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government shared dual power over Russia. The term dual power came about as the driving forces in the fall of the monarchy, opposition to the human and widespread political movement, became politically institutionalized.[52]\n\nPrince Georgy Lvov, first head of the Provisional Government\n\nNikolay Chkheidze , first Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet\n\nWhile the Soviet represented the proletariat, the provisional government represented the bourgeoisie. The Soviet had stronger practical power because it controlled the workers and the soldiers, but it did not want to become involved in administration and bureaucracy; the Provisional Government lacked support from the population. Since the Provisional Government did not have the support of the majority and, in an effort to keep their claim to democratic mandate, they welcomed socialist parties to join in order to gain more support and Dvoyevlastiye (dual power) was established.[47] However, the Soviet asserted de facto supremacy as early as 1 March O.S (14 March N.S) (before the creation of the Provisional Government), by issuing Order No. 1:\n\nThe orders of the Military Commission of the State Duma [part of the organisation which became the Provisional Government] shall be executed only in such cases as do not conflict with the orders and resolution of the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. Point 4 of Order No. 1, 1 March 1917.\n\nOrder No. 1 ensured that the Dual Authority developed on the Soviet's conditions. The Provisional Government was not a publicly elected body (having been self-proclaimed by committee members of the old Duma) and it lacked the political legitimacy to question this arrangement and instead arranged for elections to be held later. The Provisional Government had the formal authority in Russia but the Soviet Executive Committee and the soviets had the support of the majority of the population. The soviets held the real power to effect change. The Provisional Government represented an alliance between liberals and socialists who wanted political reform.\n\nThe initial soviet executive chairmen were Menshevik Mikola Ckheidze, Matvey Skobelev and Alexander Kerensky. The chairmen believed that the February Revolution was a \"Bourgeois revolution\" about bringing capitalist development to Russia instead of socialism.[52] The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenyevich Lvov, a man with no connections to any official party. The Provisional government included 9 Duma deputies and 6 from the Kadet party in ministerial positional, representing professional and business interests, the bourgeoisie.[51] As the left moved further left in Russia over the course of 1917, the Kadets became the main conservative party. Despite this, the provisional government strove to implement further left leaning policies with the repeal of the death penalty, amnesty for political prisoners and freedom of the press.[51]\n\nDual Power was not prevalent outside of the capital and political systems varied from province to province. One example of a system gathered the educated public, workers and soldiers to facilitate order and food systems, democratic elections and the removal of tsarist officials.[51] In a short amount of time, 3,000 deputies were elected to the Petrograd soviet.[52] The soviet quickly became the representative responsible for fighting for workers and soldiers hopes for \"bread, peace and land\". In the spring of 1917, 700 soviets were established across Russia, equalling about a third of the population, representing the proletariat and their interests.[47] The soviets spent their time pushing for a constituent assembly rather than swaying the public to believe they were a more morally sound means of governing.[52]\n\nLong-term effects [ edit ]\n\nAfter the abdication of the throne by the Tsar, the Provisional Government declared itself the new form of authority. The Provisional Government shared Kadet views. The Kadets began to be seen as a conservative political party and as \"state-minded\" by other Russians. At the same time the Provisional Government was put into place, the Soviet Executive Committee was also forming. The Soviet represented workers and soldiers, while the Provisional Government represented the middle and upper social classes. The Soviet also gained support from Social Revolutionists and Menshoviks when the two groups realized that they did not want to support the Provisional Government. When these two powers existed at the same time, \"dual power\" was created. The Provisional Government was granted formal authority, but the Soviet Executive Committee had the support of the people resulting in political unrest until the Bolshevik takeover in October.[52]\n\nA scene from the July Days. The army had just opened fire on street protesters.\n\nThe queue at the grocery store in Petrograd. 1917\n\nVladimir Lenin, exiled in neutral Switzerland, arrived in Petrograd from Zürich on 16 April O.S (29 April N.S). He immediately began to undermine the provisional government, issuing his April Theses the next month. These theses were in favor of \"Revolutionary defeatism\", which argues that the real enemy is those who send the proletariat into war, as opposed to the \"imperialist war\" (whose \"link to Capital\" must be demonstrated to the masses) and the \"social-chauvinists\" (such as Georgi Plekhanov, the grandfather of Russian socialism), who supported the war. The theses were read by Lenin to a meeting of only Bolsheviks and again to a meeting of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, both being extreme leftist parties, and was also published. He believed that the most effective way to overthrow the government was to be a minority party and to give no support to the Provisional Government.[55] Lenin also tried to take control of the Bolshevik movement and attempted to win proletariat support by the use of slogans such as \"Peace, bread and land\", \"End the war without annexations or indemnities\", \"All power to the Soviet\" and \"All land to those who work it\".[51]\n\nInitially, Lenin and his ideas did not have widespread support, even among Bolsheviks. In what became known as the July Days, approximately half a million soldiers, sailors, and workers, some of them armed, came out onto the streets of Petrograd in protest. The protesters seized automobiles, fought with people of authority, and often fired their guns into the air. The crowd was so uncontrollable that the Soviet leadership sent the Socialist Revolutionary Victor Chernov, a widely liked politician, to the streets to calm the crowd. The demonstrators, lacking leadership, disbanded and the government survived. Leaders of the Soviet placed the blame of the July Days on the Bolsheviks, as did the Provisional Government who issued arrest warrants for prominent Bolsheviks. Historians debated from early on whether this was a planned Bolshevik attempt to seize power or a strategy to plan a future coup.[56] Lenin fled to Finland and other members of the Bolshevik party were arrested. Lvov was replaced by the Socialist Revolutionary minister Alexander Kerensky as head of the Provisional Government.[57]\n\nKerensky declared freedom of speech, ended capital punishment, released thousands of political prisoners and tried to maintain Russian involvement in World War I. He faced many challenges related to the war: there were still very heavy military losses on the front; dissatisfied soldiers deserted in larger numbers than before; other political groups did their utmost to undermine him; there was a strong movement in favor of withdrawing Russia from the war, which was seen to be draining the country, and many who had initially supported it now wanted out; and there was a great shortage of food and supplies, which was very difficult to remedy in wartime conditions. All of these were highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers, and peasants who claimed that little had been gained by the February Revolution. Kerensky was expected to deliver on his promises of jobs, land, and food almost instantaneously, and failed to do so.[58]\n\nThe Kornilov Affair arose when Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General Lavr Kornilov, directed an army under Aleksandr Krymov to march toward Petrograd with Kerensky's agreement. Although the details remain sketchy, Kerensky appeared to become frightened by the possibility of a coup and the order was countermanded. (Historian Richard Pipes is adamant that the episode was engineered by Kerensky). On 27 August O.S (9 September N.S), feeling betrayed by the Kerensky government, who had previously agreed with his views on how to restore order to Russia, Kornilov pushed on towards Petrograd. With few troops to spare on the front, Kerensky was turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help.[59] Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries confronted the army and convinced them to stand down. Right-wingers felt betrayed, and the left wing was resurgent. Pressure from the Allies to continue the war against Germany put the government under increasing strain. The conflict between the \"diarchy\" became obvious, and ultimately the regime and the dual power formed between the Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government, instigated by the February Revolution, was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution.[60]\n\nHistoriography [ edit ]\n\nWhen discussing the historiography of the February Revolution there are three historical interpretations which are relevant: Liberal, Soviet, and Revisionist. These three different approaches exist separately from one another because of their respective beliefs of what ultimately caused the collapse of a Tsarist government in February.\n\nSoviet historians present a story in which the masses that brought about revolution in February were organized groups of 'modernizing' peasants who were bringing about an era of both industrialization and freedom. [61] Soviet historian Sokolov has been outspoken about the belief that the revolution in February was a coming together of the people and was more positive than the October revolution. Soviet historians consistently place little emphasis on the role of World War I (WWI) in leading to the February Revolution.\n\nSoviet historian Sokolov has been outspoken about the belief that the revolution in February was a coming together of the people and was more positive than the October revolution. Soviet historians consistently place little emphasis on the role of World War I (WWI) in leading to the February Revolution. In contrast, Liberal perspectives of the February revolution almost always acknowledge WWI as a catalyst to revolution. On the whole, though, Liberal historians credit the Bolsheviks with the ability to capitalize on the worry and dread instilled in Russian citizens because of WWI. [62] The overall message and goal of the February Revolution, according to the Liberal perspective, was ultimately democracy; the proper climate and attitude had been created by WWI and other political factors which turned public opinion against the Tsar.\n\nThe overall message and goal of the February Revolution, according to the Liberal perspective, was ultimately democracy; the proper climate and attitude had been created by WWI and other political factors which turned public opinion against the Tsar. Revisionist historians present a timeline where revolution in February was far less inevitable than the liberals and soviets would make it seem. Revisionists track the mounting pressure on the Tsarist regime back further than the other two groups to unsatisfied peasants in the countryside upset over matters of land-ownership.[63] This tension continued to build into 1917 when dissatisfaction became a full blown institutional crisis incorporating the concerns of many groups. Revisionist historian Richard Pipes has been outspoken about his anti-communist approach to the Russian Revolution.\n\n\"Studying Russian history from the West European perspective, one also becomes conscious of the effect that the absence of feudalism had on Russia. Feudalism had created in the West networks of economic and political institutions that served the central state[;] once it replaced the feudal system, as a source of social support and relative stability. Russia knew no feudalism in the traditional sense of the word, since, after the emergence of the Muscovite monarchy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, all landowners were tenants-in-chief of the Crown, and subinfeudation was unknown. As a result, all power was concentrated in the Crown.\" — (Pipes, Richard. A Concise History of the Russian Revolution. New York: Vintage, 1996.)\n\nOut of these three approaches, all of them have received modern criticism. The February Revolution is seen by many present-day scholars as an event which gets \"mythologized\".[64]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNote [ edit ]\n\n^ [35] On February 8, 1917 on request of the Emperor N.

  "latent_13826": "For 4 months now we’ve been hacking on a new syscall for the linux-kernel, called memfd_create. The intention is to provide an easy way to get a file-descriptor for anonymous memory, without requiring a local tmpfs mount-point. The syscall takes 2 parameters, a name and a bunch of flags (which I will not discuss here):\n\nint memfd_create(const char *name, unsigned int flags);\n\nIf successful, a new file-descriptor pointing to a freshly allocated memory-backed file is returned. That file is a regular file in a kernel-internal filesystem. Therefore, most filesystem operations are supported, including:\n\nftruncate(2) to change the file size\n\nread(2), write(2) and all its derivatives to inspect/modify file contents\n\nmmap(2) to get a direct memory-mapping\n\ndup(2) to duplicate file-descriptors\n\n…\n\nTheoretically, you could achieve similar behavior without introducing new syscalls, like this:\n\nint fd = open(\"/tmp/random_file_name\", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRWXU); unlink(\"/tmp/random_file_name\");\n\nor this\n\nint fd = shm_open(\"/random_file_name\", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRWXU); shm_unlink(\"/random_file_name\");\n\nor this\n\nint fd = open(\"/tmp\", O_RDWR | O_TMPFILE | O_EXCL, S_IRWXU);\n\nTherefore, the most important question is why the hell do we need a third way?\n\nTwo crucial differences are:\n\nmemfd_create does not require a local mount-point. It can create objects that are not associated with any filesystem and can never be linked into a filesystem. The backing memory is anonymous memory as if malloc(3) had returned a file-descriptor instead of a pointer. Note that even shm_open(3) requires /dev/shm to be a tmpfs-mount. Furthermore, the backing-memory is accounted to the process that owns the file and is not subject to mount-quotas.\n\nThere are no name-clashes and no global registry. You can create multiple files with the same name and they will all be separate, independent files. Therefore, the name is purely for debugging purposes so it can be detected in task-dumps or the like.\n\nTo be honest, the code required for memfd_create is 100 lines. It didn’t take us 2 months to write these, but instead we added one more feature to memfd_create called Sealing:\n\nFile-Sealing\n\nFile-Sealing is used to prevent a specific set of operations on a file. For example, after you wrote data into a file you can seal it against further writes. Any attempt to write to the file will fail with EPERM. Reading will still be possible, though. The crux of this matter is that seals can never be removed, only added. This guarantees that if a specific seal is set, the information that is protected by that seal is immutable until the object is destroyed.\n\nTo retrieve the current set of seals on a file, you use fcntl(2):\n\nint seals = fcntl(fd, F_GET_SEALS);\n\nThis returns a signed 32bit integer containing the bitmask of currently set seals on fd. Note that seals are per file, not per file-descriptor (nor per file-description). That means, any file-descriptor for the same underlying inode will share the same seals.\n\nTo seal a file, you use fcntl(2) again:\n\nint error = fcntl(fd, F_ADD_SEALS, new_seals);\n\nThis takes a bitmask of seals in new_seals and adds these to the current set of seals on fd.\n\nThe current set of supported seals is:\n\nF_SEAL_SEAL : This seal prevents the seal-operation itself. So once F_SEAL_SEAL is set, any attempt to add new seals via F_ADD_SEALS will fail. Files that don’t support sealing are initially sealed with just this flag. Hence, no other seals can ever be set and thus do not have to be enforced.\n\n: This seal prevents the seal-operation itself. So once is set, any attempt to add new seals via F_ADD_SEALS will fail. Files that don’t support sealing are initially sealed with just this flag. Hence, no other seals can ever be set and thus do not have to be enforced. F_SEAL_WRITE : This is the most straightforward seal. It prevents any content modifications once it is set. Any write(2) call will fail and you cannot get any shared, writable mappings for the file, anymore. Unlike the other seals, you can only set this seal if no shared, writable mappings exist at the time of sealing.\n\n: This is the most straightforward seal. It prevents any content modifications once it is set. Any write(2) call will fail and you cannot get any shared, writable mappings for the file, anymore. Unlike the other seals, you can only set this seal if no shared, writable mappings exist at the time of sealing. F_SEAL_SHRINK : Once set, the file cannot be reduced in size. This means, O_TRUNC, ftruncate(), fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE) and friends will be rejected in case they would shrink the file.\n\n: Once set, the file cannot be reduced in size. This means, O_TRUNC, ftruncate(), fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE) and friends will be rejected in case they would shrink the file. F_SEAL_GROW: Once set, the file size cannot be increased. Any write(2) beyond file-boundaries, any ftruncate(2) that increases the file size, and any similar operation that grows the file will be rejected.\n\nInstead of discussing the behavior of each seal on its own, the following list shows some examples how they can be used. Note that most seals are enforced somewhere low-level in the kernel, instead of directly in the syscall handlers. Therefore, side effects of syscalls I didn’t cover here are still accounted for and the syscalls will fail if they violate any seals.\n\nIPC : Imagine you want to pass data between two processes that do not trust each other. That is, there is no hierarchy at all between them and they operate on the same level. The easiest way to achieve this is a pipe, obviously. However, to allow zero-copy (assuming splice(2) is not possible) the processes might decide to use memfd_create to create a shared memory object and pass the file-descriptor to the remote process. Now zero-copy only makes sense if the receiver can parse the data in-line. However, this is not possible in zero-trust scenarios as the source can retain a file-descriptor and modify the contents while the receiver parses it, causing any kinds of failure. But if the receiver requires the object to be sealed with F_SEAL_WRITE | F_SEAL_SHRINK , it can safely mmap(2) the file and parse it inline. No attacker can alter file contents, anymore. Furthermore, this also allows safe mutlicasts of the message and all receivers can parse the same zero-copy file without affecting each other. Obviously, the file can never be modified again and is a one-shot object. But this is inherent to zero-trust scenarios. We did implement a recycle-operation in case you’re the last user of an object. However, that was dropped due to horrible races in the kernel. It might reoccur in the future, though.\n\n: Imagine you want to pass data between two processes that do not trust each other.

However, that was dropped due to horrible races in the kernel. It might reoccur in the future, though. Graphics-Servers: This is a very specific use-case of IPC and usually there is a one-way trust relationship from clients to servers. However, a server cannot blindly trust its clients. So imagine a client renders its window-contents into memory and passes a file-descriptor to that memory region (maybe using memfd_create) to the server. Similar to the previous scenario, the server cannot mmap(2) that object for read-access as the client might truncate the file simultaneously, causing SIGBUS on the server. A server can protect itself via SIGBUS-handlers, but sealing is a much simpler way. By requiring F_SEAL_SHRINK, the server can be sure, the file will never shrink. At the same time, the client can still grow the object in case it needs bigger buffers for growing windows. Furthermore, writing is still allowed so the object can be re-used for the next frame.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are a lot more interesting use-cases. However, note that sealing is currently limited to objects created via memfd_create with the MFD_ALLOW_SEALING flag. This is a precaution to make sure we don’t break existing setups. However, changing seals of a file requires WRITE-access, thus it is rather unlikely that sealing would allow attacks that are not already possible with mandatory POSIX locks or similar. Hence, it is possible that sealing will expand to other areas in case people request it. Further seal-types are also possible.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nAs of June 2014 the patches for memfd_create and sealing have been publicly available for at least 2 months and are considered for merging. linux-3.16 will probably not include it, but linux-3.17 very likely will. Currently, there’s still some issues to be figured out regarding AIO and Direct-IO races. But other than that, we’re good to go.\n\nAdvertisements",

But since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” – Andre Gide\n\nThere is a global pogrom underway.\n\nThis is a terrible truth. And people tend to ignore terrible truths.\n\nSo it must be said again: There is a global pogrom underway.And there is another terrible truth: The global pogrom has been underway for more than a decade. It has taken lives. It has destroyed property. It has wounded, brutalized and terrified Jews and Jewish communities in many nations. And it is creating a silent exodus, a de facto expulsion, an ethnic cleansing in slow motion.This is a terrible truth that almost no one wants to acknowledge. But over the past month, it has become a truth that is impossible to ignore.Violence against Jews has been ongoing since the Palestinian terror war began in 2000. But the moment when the global pogrom became impossible to deny took place last month in France.On June 13, 2004, an ostensibly pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris quickly devolved into the pogrom that, perhaps, it was always meant to be. A mob of thugs descended upon the Synagogue de la Roquette, trapped the congregation inside, and tried to break in while brandishing deadly weapons.An eyewitness described how the crowd threw “stones and bricks at the building, ‘like it was an intifada.’” A Jewish leader made the horrifying statement, “We could have had something like Kristallnacht.”The attackers, he said, “Had rocks, glass, axes, knives... they were armed and I made sure that no one would leave the synagogue, in order to protect the lives of our people.”Due to the ineffectiveness of the French police, the synagogue and its congregation were only saved by the actions of Jewish self-defense groups.We have seen this before. There is only one word for mob attacks on Jews. Attempts to defile and destroy Jewish houses of worship.The desire to wound and kill defenseless human beings because they are Jews.And the indifference, incompetence, or collaboration of non-Jewish authorities: Pogrom.If what happened at the Synagogue de la Roquette is not a pogrom, then nothing is.It is far from over. Following the attack on la Roquette, the French authorities banned further anti-Israel demonstrations. The pogromists marched anyway. And, as is their wont, they went on a rampage. They stormed through the Jewish neighborhood of Sarcelles, destroying, looting, defacing and generally acting like what Mayor Francois Pupponi later called “a horde of savages.”At another illegal demonstration on July 26, protesters gave both the Nazi salute and its now-popular pogromist variation: the so-called “Quenelle,” popularized by a virulently racist comedian in order to skirt France’s laws against racial incitement.And the pogrom has gone global.In Antwerp, Haaretz reported, 500 people “protested” Israel’s war on Hamas by hailing a progromist who chanted “a call in Arabic that means ‘slaughter the Jews.’” Attendees “also called out ‘Jews, remember Khaybar, the army of Muhammad is returning,” referencing a seventh-century slaughter against Jews in Saudi Arabia.In Germany, protesters chanted, “Hamas Hamas Juden ins gas!” (“Hamas Hamas Jews to the gas!”). A 200-strong mob in Essen chimed in, “Scheiss Juden!” (“Jewish s**t”).In Berlin, “an angry mob” spewed rhetoric that would have enchanted the Fuhrer: “Jude, Jude feiges Schwein! Komm heraus und kämpf allein!” (“Jew, Jew, cowardly swine, come out and fight on your own!”).In nearby Austria, the pogrom invaded one of Europe’s last truly sacred places: the soccer field. During a friendly match between Lille and Maccabi Haifa, a group of thugs stormed the field and attacked the Israeli team.In London a series of protests have been fairly peaceful, but the rhetoric remained one of unrelenting incitement and defamation.As a result, the British Jewish community is now under siege. Death and bomb threats are flowing in by the dozen. Hate crimes are skyrocketing. A Muslim woman threw stones at a Jewish boy. A rabbi was the target of a gang attack. Chants of “Heil Hitler” are defiling Jewish neighborhoods.A global pogrom does not end at the borders of Europe. It has reached North America.In Boston, The Times of Israel reported that several pro-Israel students were “Surrounded by pro-Palestinian activists chanting ‘Jesus killers’ and ‘drop dead’” before being physically attacked. In Calgary, an entire family was assaulted by a mob of anti-Israel pogromists, sending several of them to the hospital. The attackers chanted “baby killers,” “kill Jews” and “Hitler should finish you off.” In New York, there were more chants of “baby killers” and the blood libel found itself resurrected.The pogrom has reached as far as Australia.Jews have been physically attacked, and the blood libel appeared again. A billboard was unfurled showing a caricature of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu with fangs dripping blood. Above were the words “can’t get enough.”In Turkey, the only Muslim country where a substantial Jewish population remains, the pogrom reached a fever pitch, with Prime Minister Recip Tayyep Erdogan and the Turkish media spewing anti-Semitic rhetoric. And there was mob violence, this time directed against the Israeli consulate and the ambassador’s residence. Pogromist graffiti read, “Die out murderer Jew!” This ongoing violence and murderous rhetoric has had an ominous result: Turkish Jews are leaving. The younger generation no longer feels it has a future in Turkey.Soon, this ancient community will likely no longer exist. Put simply, in Turkey, the global pogrom has become an act of expulsion and ethnic cleansing.And not only in Turkey. Seven decades after it handed most of its Jews over to extermination, France is now acquiescing in their expulsion. The Los Angeles Times reports, “In 2013, 3,288 French Jews left for Israel, a 72% increase from the year before, and the first time French émigrés outnumbered those from the United States.” In other words, French Jews believe that an Israel under Hamas rockets is safer than France.There is a global pogrom underway. I speak the terrible truth again because it must be spoken again.The global pogrom is driven by a simple motive: To brutalize, slaughter and expel a people against which it has ignited an inferno of racist hatred.The global pogrom operates with impunity.It has made life impossible for Jews in numerous countries.The global pogrom is now committing a crime against humanity: Expulsion and ethnic cleansing.And if it is not stopped, the global pogrom will spread.This is not just a Jewish issue. A global pogrom is a global issue. It forces us to ask if the world is capable of doing justice to one of its smallest minorities. And if it is not, we must speak the terrible truth that Haim Nahman Bialik spoke in the wake of another pogrom: “Let the throne be hurled down forever.”The author is a Tel Aviv-based writer and editor.

A short release is posted to the resort's website, which also reports injuries among guests escaping the fire.\n\nBoyne Highlands confirmed 12 people were injured in a large fire at the resort's main lodge hotel Sunday morning. The statement said one person was transported to a hospital outside of the area for additional treatment but did not name the individual.\n\nThe ski slopes will remain closed Sunday. Central services like lodging check-in are being moved to another location on the property.\n\nAlmost half of Boyne Highlands lodge damaged by fire, resort closed indefinitely A re-opening date has not been determined.\n\nPetoskey photographer Alex Childress headed to the scene after receiving the emergency alert, arriving at 3 a.m. He said thick black smoke poured from rooms spanning the entire right side of the main lodge.\n\n\"The smoke was awful,\" he said. I wasn't even close (to the fire) and when I left I was coughing for two hours.\"\n\nChildress saw firefighters attempt to cut a hole in the roof of the lodge and enter in the middle of the building. While trucks blasted water down from above, firefighters waded through smoke in the dark.\n\nWhen he left around 5 a.m., Childress said there were no exposed flames on the outside of the lodge.\n\n\"It seemed like the fire was the whole length (of the right side),\" Childress said. \"I was thinking you would see flames but it must have been all deep within it.\"\n\nThe building's fire detection system alerted first responders from the Harbor Springs Area Fire Department and 911 dispatched additional firefighters as well as emergency medical and law enforcement officials. Harbor Springs Police Officer Lyle Reece said attempts to extinguish the fire were ongoing as of 8 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\"Anyone who available was called out; it's mostly volunteers up here,\" he said.\n\nThe popular northern Michigan resort is a destination for family skiing, ziplining, sleigh rides and other outdoor activities.",
  "latent_14008": "Desmond Tutu, one of the world's most eminent religious leaders, has made an extraordinary intervention in the debate over assisted death, by backing the right of the terminally ill to end their lives in dignity.\n\nWriting in the Observer, the 82-year-old retired Anglican archbishop, revered as the \"moral conscience\" of South Africa, says that laws that prevent people being helped to end their lives are an affront to those affected and their families.\n\nHe also condemns as \"disgraceful\" the treatment of his old friend Nelson Mandela, who was kept alive through numerous painful hospitalisations and forced to endure a photo stunt with politicians shortly before his death at 95.\n\nTutu, who calls for a \"mind shift\" in the right to die debate, writes: \"I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living. Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying. I revere the sanctity of life – but not at any cost.\"\n\nTutu's intervention comes at the start of a momentous week in the assisted dying debate. On Friday, the House of Lords will witness one of the most significant moments in its recent history when peers debate an assisted dying bill proposed by the former lord chancellor, Lord Falconer. A record number of peers – 110 so far – have registered to speak.\n\nOn Saturday the former archbishop of Canterbury Lord (George) Carey spoke out in favour of the bill. But in an article in the Times, Justin Welby, the current archbishop and head of the Church of England, reaffirmed the church's traditional hostility to any move that would endanger the principle of the sanctity of life. In a sign of the debate that has now been unleashed within the Anglican communion, the bishop of Carlisle, the Right Rev James Newcome, called for a royal commission to examine the \"important issue\" at length.\n\nFalconer's proposed legislation would make it legal for a doctor to hand over a lethal medication to a terminally ill patient who is believed to have less than six months to live.\n\nTutu notes that Falconer's bill will be debated on Mandela Day, which would have been the 96th birthday of South Africa's first black president. He calls for his own country to follow Britain's lead in examining a change in the law.\n\n\"On Mandela Day we will be thinking of a great man,\" he writes. \"On the same day, on 18 July 2014 in London, the House of Lords will be holding a second hearing on Lord Falconer's bill on assisted dying. Oregon, Washington, Quebec, Holland, Switzerland have already taken this step. South Africa has a hard-won constitution that we are proud of that should provide a basis to guide changes to be made on the legal status of end-of-life wishes to support the dignity of the dying.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Observer, Falconer, who said he was now confident that his bill would live on in parliament beyond Friday's debate, claimed that the intervention by Tutu illustrated that religious faith should be no obstacle to supporting a change in the law. He said: \"I am really glad that someone of his stature is taking part in this important debate. It is a debate in which countries look to other countries for guidance. For someone of Archbishop Tutu's stature, understanding and human experience to speak out is really welcome. He is an Anglican bishop who has shown his moral strength to the world better than anybody. I very much hope that it will indicate that religion is not a bar to supporting this bill.\"\n\nA London rabbi, Jonathan Romain, speaking on behalf of 60 religious leaders in support of the Falconer proposals, said he believed that backing the bill was the \"religious response\" to a situation where medical progress allowed people to live on in a physical and mental state that many felt was intolerable. He said: \"I see no sanctity in suffering, nothing holy about agony.\"\n\nJane Nicklinson, widow of the campaigner Tony Nicklinson, a sufferer of locked-in syndrome who fought for the right to be helped to die in the UK, said she believed public opinion was now in favour of change, adding: \"I hope that it is true among those that matter – the decision-makers.\"\n\nFalconer's proposals are being fiercely opposed by key figures such as Welby, and campaigners for the rights of disabled people. Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope, said he feared the bill would put some people under pressure to end their lives. He said: \"Why is it that when people who are not disabled want to commit suicide, we try to talk them out of it, but when a disabled person wants to commit suicide, we focus on how we can make that possible?\"\n\nHowever, in his article for the Observer, Tutu says that he has been moved by the case of a 28-year-old South African, Craig Schonegevel, who suffered from neurofibromatosis and felt forced to end his life by swallowing 12 sleeping pills and tying two plastic bags around his head with elastic bands because doctors could not help him.\n\nTutu writes: \"Some say that palliative care, including the giving of sedation to ensure freedom from pain, should be enough for the journeying towards an easeful death. Some people opine that with good palliative care there is no need for assisted dying, no need for people to request to be legally given a lethal dose of medication. That was not the case for Craig Schonegevel. Others assert their right to autonomy and consciousness – why exit in the fog of sedation when there's the alternative of being alert and truly present with loved ones?\"\n\nHe also discloses that he has now had a conversation with his family about his own death. \"I have come to realise that I do not want my life to be prolonged artificially,\" he writes. \"I think when you need machines to help you breathe then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent. This may be hard for some people to consider.\n\n\"But why is a life that is ending being prolonged? Why is money being spent in this way? It could be better spent on a mother giving birth to a baby, or an organ transplant needed by a young person. Money should be spent on those that are at the beginning or in full flow of their life. Of course, these are my personal opinions and not of my church.\"\n\nThere was bitter controversy in South Africa in April last year when President Jacob Zuma and other African National Congress politicians visited Mandela at his home with a TV crew. The statesman looked weak, rheumy-eyed and uncomprehending. Mandela's family and personal assistant condemned the publicity stunt as exploitative and in poor taste. Tutu echoes that view. \"What was done to Madiba was disgraceful,\" he writes. \"There was that occasion when Madiba was televised with political leaders, President Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. You could see that Madiba was not fully there. He did not speak. He was not connecting. My friend was no longer himself. It was an affront to Madiba's dignity.\"\n\n\"People should die a decent death,\" he continues. \"For me that means having had the conversations with those I have crossed with in life and being at peace. It means being able to say goodbye to loved ones – if possible, at home.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I can see I would probably incline towards the quality of life argument, whereas others will be more comfortable with palliative care. Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind, actually.\"\n\nTutu, who chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and admitted he was \"angry with God\" during apartheid, has never been afraid to take unpopular positions or stir debate. Mandela once said of him: \"Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless.\"",

  "latent_14110": "Older items: 2015: ( J F M ), 2014: ( J F M A M J J A S O N D ), 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, legacy html\n\nMany areas of LibreOffice have been hugely improved in recent times, from the general cleanup of the code, to the huge VCL / UI layout re-work touching all of our dialogs, the significant re-work of Calc's internals - many areas of the code have had big improvements. One area that has however sadly fallen behind is the Visual Class Libraries (VCL) rendering model - that is used to draw nearly everything in the document, and chrome around it.\n\nOpen GL - as-is\n\nOpenGL from the Khronos Group is, of course, the premier cross-platform rendering API for hardware acceleration in the modern world, with implementations from iOS and Android to Windows, Linux & Mac. We have started to use OpenGL in LibreOffice in several places, but unfortunately OpenGL has some pretty unfortunate all-or-nothing type decisions in its platform implementation. What does that mean ? Take for example our infamous Collada duck:\n\nNotice the grey background that surrounds this duck, and unusual sizing handles. This is caused by this all-or-nothing curse: whereby we cannot have a duck 'element' inside a presentation, suitably happily animated - without either having a grey window nailed onto the screen (as is familiar from accelerated video windows), or without taking a major performance hit. The root problem here is that we cannot possibly mix Windows/GDI rendering with OpenGL rendering.\n\nTo fix this we need to move LibreOffice rendering into the modern world of hardware accelerated / OpenGL graphics. By rendering all the normal, 2D work into an OpenGL context, we can embed rich, 3D visualisations and data seamlessly into the suite with good performance.\n\nFaster, higher quality rendering\n\nThe graphics compute units in modern hardware GPUs are great at rendering (as well as calculating complex spreadsheets). They work in parallel to the CPU, thus (effectively) asynchronously off-loading lots of work from the CPU which can get on with all the heavy lifting to layout your documents.\n\nVCL in contrast, has had extremely variable performance. This is extremely noticeable on mobile devices like Android - where VCL has had to use pure basebmp / CPU rendering on some already under-powered CPU hardware. Meanwhile the powerful GPU cores in your phone/tablet have been idling. By using OpenGL we can ensure that each compute unit is doing the right thing and make optimum use of the available power.\n\nImage scaling is another area where we currently suffer; with several open bugs - first one complains about performance, and then when you lower rendering quality to get performance, another bug complains about rendering quality. Doing high quality image interpolation of large images takes time, even when threaded. People love to whack large, high-DPI images into their documents and presentations. By moving all of the image interpolation work to the GPU we should be able to have our cake: pretty scaled images, and also eat it quickly: with fast rendering.\n\nAnother area that is currently slow is gradient rendering; with current VCL implementations, most gradients that you see are decomposed into innumerable smaller polygons by VCL and then many hundreds of these are rendered. This can bring a significant performance penalty. Thanks to Chris Sherlock we now have the ability to render arbitrary gradients in the platform / OpenGL backend. This makes a lot of sense since rendering gradients is something that can be done almost for free by a GPU - lovingly shading each pixel at incredible speed.\n\nVCL / Structural issues\n\nAs the Linux world moves to Wayland, LibreOffice will need to adapt. In particular the option of client-side rendering in software (as used in our current gtk3 port) is not incredibly attractive - that suffers from a number of existing rendering problems, as well as being very substantially slower. By moving straight to an OpenGL solution, we should be able to have reasonably optimal Wayland rendering too.\n\nOne other problem plagues VCL rendering however; and that is 'immediate' rendering. LibreOffice renders in one of two ways - either immediately: so when you press an 'A' it tries to nail the pixels for 'A' immediately to the screen; or - a very deferred idle rendering which happens a hard-coded 35ms later. This situation is really non-ideal for modern rendering where we want to ensure the scene is perfect before showing it on-screen. However, this is not something that we can fix immediately. Faster deferred rendering will miss 4.4 - the problems are too wide-spread. Having said that, some great work has been done by Jennifer Liebel and Tobias Madl from the Limux team (Munich) - who are implementing a new way for 'idle' tasks - such as re-drawing invalidated rectangles to be run immediately with prioritisation instead of hoping that various combinations of timeouts: 35ms, 50ms etc. arrive in the right order. This should form a great foundation for us to remove immediate rendering in favour of idle rendering without a performance impact in subsequent releases. Thanks also to Kendy (Collabora) for finding and nailing a nasty Windows timer issue; using high-resolution Timer Queues to avoid Windows' (unbelievable) Timers which cannot sleep for less than 10ms.\n\nWhat we're doing\n\nThe new OpenGL rendering code provides a VCL back-end implementation that can be used to render all VCL Windows' content via shared code on all platforms, poke in vcl/opengl for that. Of course, there is also a certain amount of per-platform setup and context management work that has to be done for each platform as well, but the great bulk of the code is fully shared. Markus has also re-factored to help split the Native Widget framework (used for platform theming) and the Text APIs (which are also different per-platform) from the stock GL rendering code.\n\nThe new OpenGL backend, thus allows all application rendering to happen to the same OpenGL context. This allows us to avoid a dichotomoy of rendering with GDI or X11 on windows, and then needing to box all 3D / OpenGL content into its own window. This should allow seamless integration of 3D content, as well as giving much better performance particularly on mobile platforms.\n\nTesting VCL implementations\n\nOne area that VCL has not been ideal is the lack of a well written test / demo application. This is somewhat ironic since the LibreOffice code-base stated off decades ago as the demo app for the VCL toolkit. Over the last week, we've done a little expansion and started to implement something that aims at exercising all of the relevant backend / VCL API in an easy to extend fashion.\n\nNaturally, the OpenGL code is not for everyone - neither now, or for the forseable future. Many OpenGL implementations have debilitating bugs, despite using only a small and simple sub-set of OpenGL features : we believe that will need to black-list these. Similarly, we will want to white-list newer and more stable drivers, but of course users will be able to choose between legacy and OpenGL rendering too.\n\nWhat it looks like\n\nSo - when you put all of that together; it is advancing rapidly. Markus just checked some code into master which shows some of the VCL primitives that we can render already:\n\nOngoing work\n\nYou can play with the work on master; clearly LibreOffice is not rendering perfectly with this yet - that goes without saying; and help is much appreciated in the lead-up to LibreOffice 4.4; we love to work with other people.\n\nCredits\n\nThanks to Markus Mohrhard (Collabora), Louis-Francis Ratté-Boulianne (Collabora), Ptyl Dragon (CloudOn), Chris Sherlock, along with more future / pending work in-progress from Michael Jaumann working on OpenGL canvas and Stefan Weiberg on OGL Transitions both mentored by Thorsten Behrens (SUSE).",

If the Agency wished to disseminate anti-communist propaganda, cause dissension in leftist ranks, or have Communist embassy personnel expelled, it need only prepare some phony documents, present them to the appropriate government ministers and journalists, and – presto! – instant scandal.” (William Blum, CIA Manipulation: The Painful Truths Told by Phil Agee, Anti-Empire Report 27 June 2013)\n\nIndependent media outlets are increasingly challenging the powers that be and, thanks to social media, the truth about what is really happening in our world can be shared at the click of a button.\n\nSadly, the imperial war machine continues to rear its violent head in exponential proportion under the guise of democracy and “War on Terrorism”.\n\nThis war machine is promoted by the mainstream media who cannot be trusted for many reasons. It is a well documented fact that the CIA has used journalism as a cover for its agents and has planted stories in the media.\n\nAccording to CIA documents, “more than 400 American journalists … in the past twenty‑five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency“, wrote Carl Bernstein in 1977.\n\nIn this episode of Alternative views, former CIA agent John Stockwell explains “how CIA ‘disinformation’ tactics manipulate public opinion by planting stories in the press and by financing and supporting right-wing newspapers“.\n\nPlanting stories in the media is a standard CIA technique:\n\nA common Agency tactic was writing editorials and phony news stories to be knowingly published by Latin American media with no indication of the CIA authorship or CIA payment to the media. The propaganda value of such a “news” item might be multiplied by being picked up by other CIA stations in Latin America who would disseminate it through a CIA-owned news agency or a CIA-owned radio station. Some of these stories made their way back to the United States to be read or heard by unknowing North Americans. (Blum, op. cit.)\n\nMoreover several journalists are members of the very influential foreign policy think tank Council on Foreign Relations, which has among its corporate members:\n\n1.

(99% of revenues from federal government)\n\nIn addition, mainstream media experts on foreign policy issues are often linked to the military-industrial complex and are very often presented as “independent”.\n\nDuring the public debate around the question of whether to attack Syria, Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush, made a series of high-profile media appearances. Hadley argued strenuously for military intervention in appearances on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg TV, and authored a Washington Post op-ed headlined “To stop Iran, Obama must enforce red lines with Assad.”\n\nIn each case, Hadley’s audience was not informed that he serves as a director of Raytheon, the weapons manufacturer that makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles that were widely cited as a weapon of choice in a potential strike against Syria. Hadley earns $128,500 in annual cash compensation from the company and chairs its public affairs committee. He also owns 11,477 shares of Raytheon stock, which traded at all-time highs during the Syria debate ($77.65 on August 23, making Hadley’s share’s worth $891,189). Despite this financial stake, Hadley was presented to his audience as an experienced, independent national security expert.

  "latent_14328": "I’ve been meaning to create this post for quite sometime because I knew it would be helpful to have a page dedicated to the subject of EIG hosting for visitors to reference: including their background, what hosting brands they own, noteworthy outages, and trends of reliability/support. I have included some of my own opinion, however I feel that if you read through this whole post, follow the sources that I have referenced, and think about the whole EIG story things do add up.\n\nFor those who aren’t aware, Endurance International Group (EIG) is a Burlington, Massachusetts-based company known for its silent takeovers of some of the largest web hosting companies in the industry. To date, EIG has control of over 60 web hosting brands – which include some of the major players in the hosting business, such as HostGator, BlueHost, HostMonster, iPage, FatCow, JustHost, Arvixe, A Small Orange, and HostNine. In the web hosting industry, there is this misconception that “larger, well established companies will always offer the best in quality and service.” While this may be true for some industries, it definitely cannot always be attributed to the web hosting industry. With a very large portion of the major hosting companies owned and operated by EIG, it is important for you to know exactly what happens behind the scenes.\n\nEIG Web Hosting Circle\n\nEIG focuses on buying web hosting companies which helps them increase their customer base. The acquired companies continue to operate under their established brand names and do not try to publicize that they are owned by EIG, which can result in the following scenario:\n\nA dissatisfied customer leaves EIG host number 1 and goes in search of a new host.\n\nand goes in search of a new host. The customer searches for the term best web host on Google and comes across top 10 lists consisting of mostly other EIG hosting brands (unbeknownst to the customer).\n\nThe customer decides to go with EIG host number 2 . The end result is EIG has not lost this customer!\n\n. The end result is Rinse and repeat, until the customer does some more in depth research, and discovers a list of all EIG web hosting companies.\n\nFor your reference here’s a listing of all of the brands and hosting companies EIG owns.\n\n2slick.com\n\nAccountSupport\n\nA Small Orange\n\nApolloHosting\n\nAptHost\n\nArvixe\n\nBerry Information Systems\n\nBigRock\n\nBizLand\n\nBlueDomino\n\nBlueFur\n\nBlueHost\n\nBuyDomains\n\nCirtex Hosting\n\nCloud by IX\n\nConstant Contact\n\nDirecti\n\nDollar2Host\n\nDomain.com\n\nDomainHost\n\nDot5Hosting\n\nDotster\n\neasyCGI\n\neHost\n\nEntryHost\n\nEscalate Internet\n\nFastDomain\n\nFatCow\n\nFreeYellow\n\nGlob@t\n\nHomestead\n\nHostCentric\n\nHostClear\n\nHost Excellence\n\nHostGator\n\nHostMonster\n\nHostNine\n\nHostYourSite.com\n\nHostV\n\nHyperMart\n\nIdeaHost\n\nIMOutdoors\n\nImpress.ly\n\nIntuit Websites\n\niPage\n\nIPOWER/iPowerWeb\n\nIX Web Hosting\n\nJustCloud\n\nJustHost\n\nLogicBoxes\n\nMojoMarketplace\n\nMyDomain\n\nMyResellerHome\n\nNetFirms\n\nNetworks Web Hosting\n\nNexx\n\nPowWeb\n\nPureHost\n\nReadyHosting\n\nResellerClub\n\nSEOGears\n\nSEO Hosting\n\nSite5\n\nSiteBuilder.com\n\nSitelio\n\nSitey\n\nSoutheast Web\n\nSpry\n\nStartLogic\n\nSuperGreen Hosting\n\nTypePad\n\nUSANetHosting\n\nvDeck\n\nVerio\n\nVirtualAvenue\n\nVPSLink\n\nWebHost4Life\n\nWebHosting.info\n\nWebsiteBuilder.com\n\nWebstrike Solutions\n\nWebzai\n\nWorld Wide Web Hosting\n\nXeran\n\nYourWebHosting\n\nThat sure is a long list of EIG companies to remember (70+), and I’ll add to it as EIG acquires more web hosts. Make sure to bookmark this page, share it, like it, tweet it, or something so you can refer back to it in the future.\n\nThere’s much more to this story below, but if you only came to this page in search of reliable web hosts that are not owned by EIG, here’s a list of EIG hosting alternatives for you.\n\nEIG Web Hosting Outages\n\nEIG has had several large scale outages over the years. The most famous, and perhaps eye opening, for many customers occurred on August 2nd, 2013. Millions of HostGator, BlueHost, and HostMonster customers lost services as the EIG datacenter in Utah took a hit. It affected phone lines and servers in all their hosting facilities and was one of the biggest outages the web hosting industry has seen in recent years. As multiple large hosting companies were all under EIG, it made it apparent as to why they all went down at once.\n\nOther Big EIG Outages\n\nThe switch from SoftLayer to the EIG-owned datacenter in Provo, Utah is one of the biggest reasons HostGator customers saw a reduction in quality and service. Since EIG took over HostGator servers were a lot slower; support staff was not as helpful; live chat, tickets, and phone support response times increased; etc. A combination of these problems has shed some light for existing customers and many have made the switch to other hosting companies.\n\nA very important factor that needs to be taken into account here is the fact that EIG will continue to acquire small, medium, and large sized web hosting businesses from around the world. When other web hosting companies flourish with their own customer base it is something Endurance International Group sees as an opportunity.\n\nEIG’s Acquisition and Business Structure\n\nThe executives and decision makers behind EIG devote a great deal of their resources to finding up-and-coming web hosting businesses that have a strong customer base. Upon acquiring a new hosting business, EIG often makes several notable changes to the business. These changes can include the implementation of their own control panel, migrating accounts to different servers or datacenters, as well as a reduction or complete abolishment of the existing operational staff.\n\nEndurance International Group has their own team of support staff that they use for many of their hosting companies. Despite the acquisition of a new hosting business, which in turn brings new customers, EIG eventually transitions to using their own short-staffed support personnel. The downside of their actions is that both their existing and new customers will potentially have to learn to deal with lower quality support service. There is simply not enough staff to deal with their ever growing customer base. This trend is likely to persist as EIG continues to buyout other web hosting companies, but could be reversed if the decision makers at EIG prioritize staffing their support/technical departments.\n\nIn most cases, both existing customers and potential new customers of EIG-owned companies will only see these brands from the outside. For example, HostGator still looks pretty much the same as it did – they continue to have the same brand name, logo, website, promotions, plans, etc. However, EIG has completely revamped and overturned the administration and technical side of the business.\n\nHere are some examples of customer complaints from Twitter\n\n@hostgator – What a way to screw up a good thing. You used to be good. I am tired of the outages and EIG SUCKS! Time to move on! — Debt RoundUp (@DebtRoundUp) August 2, 2013\n\n@drpareshsoni using Hostgator since 2010, but seems like their quality gng down with every passing day — Harsh Agrawal (@denharsh) March 27, 2015\n\nWhat has happened to @Hostgator’s once excellent support?

Still nothing, nada, zip from ipage. How ridiculous! You’d think if they give a link to contact them, they’d answer it! — a. puog (@ByondPolitics) March 25, 2014\n\nI have also included a big collection of customer complaints about A Small Orange’s long support ticket response times in a recent post titled: Things You Don’t Want in a Web Hosting Company\n\nExamples from webmaster forums\n\nI am freelance web developer and I have been using HostGator since 2011. They used to be my top choice webhosting provider, but recently their servers and support has become unreliable. I have 2 VPS, 1 Reseller and 1. Dedicated server where I have hosted all of my clients domains. Even though all the plans are managed but recently they are taking up to 8 days to reply to support ticket that I had raised. Every time their excuse is “First, I would like to apologize for our delayed response. Our ticket queues are much higher at the moment than we would like. We are taking steps to reduce overall wait times, but reducing the current load will take some time.”. They have been telling this for last two months.\n\n— HostGator Services has become unreliable recently\n\nI have never had such terrible support from them as I am getting now. Just a few months ago, It took about 30-45 minutes to get them on the phone. The ticket system was faster. So I tried it. Now it takes 3 days or longer to get a reply. As for the phone, I hang up after an hour, so that isn’t working either. The chat countdown from 30 minutes never works. I have also noticed that the servers, which never before had more than 70% of drive space used, are now running 98%. Everything is so slow on my reseller server that I can’t stand to be on the website any longer. My standard hosting account is starting to bog down as well. The answers, which I have already found by the time they arrive, give a one-line answer and a 4-5 line apology for the support delays which they are working on to fix. They need to quit “fixing” them because the more they fix it the worse it gets. I am very loyal, but I gotta go!\n\n— Hostgator Support Very Poor These Days\n\nAs I write this I am in Hostgator Hell. Exactly as Brad says, I waited 1 hour and 40 minutes for Live Chat to finally get around to chatting with me – and the timer was set at 30 minutes forever….And what’s more, when they did finally get to me they gave me mistaken information – so now I’m back on the treadmill – waiting for the Live Chat timer to move from 30 minutes again. Definitely not impressed. Not in the least. Happy to move if there is a better option out there… and there really must be. This is not even close to reasonable customer service.\n\n— HOSTGATOR – WARNING – DO NOT USE\n\nOne theory I’ve heard throw around as to why some of their hosting brands have a high rate of complaints is just the sheer size of their customer base. As an example, if you take 1,000,000 customers and 1% of them are unhappy that’s 10,000. A smaller sized company with 10,000 customers with 1% dissatisfied would be 100. Regardless of the plausibility of this theory, what I see is a huge company that needs to maximize profits as a publicly traded company (EIGI), trying to manage too many hosting brands with millions of hosting accounts, and the result is the original brands are clearly worse.\n\nThe Unfortunate Truth in the Web Hosting Industry\n\nThe unfortunate and unavoidable truth in the web hosting industry is the following: EIG owns a massive portion of the medium to large sized hosting businesses in the industry. If you are dissatisfied with HostGator or any other EIG-owned company and decide to switch – there is a very high probability that you may still end up with another EIG-owned brand. That is if you don’t do your research and know about the full list of EIG hosting companies (see above). From a business standpoint, EIG has done its part in acquiring a significant market share, however, customers are the ones who are affected by their actions.\n\nFor current customers of EIG web hosts (or any web host for that matter) that are happy with their web hosting services, I have a few suggestions for you. Make sure you have uptime monitoring setup so you know when your websites go down (e.g. Uptime Doctor and Uptime Robot). Also run a speed test on your websites to see how fast they load (e.g. Pingdom). You might discover that you are not satisfied with the amount of downtime you are experiencing over time or that your loading speeds are sub-par. The reason why I’m bring this up is some webmasters have no idea that their websites are not performing as well as they could. Last but not least, make sure you create your own backups regularly, so if you ever face problems you are in control of your data and can move to another web hosting company.\n\nAvoiding Disappointment: Non EIG Hosting (Choose a Web Host Not Owned by EIG)\n\nThe good news in all this is that there are still many reliable hosting companies not owned by EIG. Customer satisfaction oriented hosting companies who make it a priority to offer quality services are aware of EIG and their practices. Hopefully, they avoid potential buyout deals from EIG, despite the monetary gain.\n\nFor those who are looking for reputable hosting companies that are not owned by EIG and most likely never will be, please refer to my earlier post made after EIG acquired Arvixe, which lists non Endurance International Group hosting companies. You can also see all of the web hosting companies (good and bad) I’ve reviewed so far here.\n\nChoosing the right web hosting company has always been a hard choice, especially because of the number of companies in operation. However, once we disregard those owned by EIG, there still is a great selection of trusted hosting companies out there. Consider asking other webmasters for hosting recommendations and see which one offers the best plan according to your needs. Then do your full research on that company, including searching on WebHostingTalk for feedback on them. If you are new to web hosting or need a brief refresher, read through my web hosting guide. Making the decision to choose the right web host for your needs is important – as it will prevent frustration, disappointment, and the need to switch to other web hosting providers.\n\nThe bottom-line here is: try your best to avoid EIG brands as the majority of them have been a consistent source of trouble for many customers.\n\nEIG Hosting Story Updates",
  "latent_14373": "Amazon.com has tapped the city of Aurora and the Majestic Commercenter to park its first Colorado facility.\n\nLocated 5 miles south of Denver International Airport, the 452,400-square-foot facility will be a sorting center, where sealed packages arrive and are then sorted by zip code for delivery to local U.S. Post Offices.\n\n“We are hiring for hundreds of associates for our new package sortation center in Aurora,” Amazon spokeswoman Ashley S. Robinson confirmed in an e-mail on Monday. She said the new facility is at 19799 E. 36th Drive in Aurora, also known as Building 29 in Majestic Commercenter.\n\nThe move comes two months after the Seattle-based online retailer began charging Colorado residents sales tax on their purchases. It fueled speculation that the company had established a business presence in the state.\n\nIn a full-page ad in Sunday’s Denver Post newspaper, Amazon said it was hiring part-time fulfillment associates for its Aurora facility. The company also created an online Denver job portal, which said future employees would ” sort, pack and ship customer orders.” The positions start at $13 per hour.\n\n“Aurora’s location, workforce and business-friendly environment were key ingredients in attracting in the world’s largest e-commerce retailer to our city,” Aurora Economic Development Council president and CEO Wendy Mitchell said.\n\nRobinson clarified that these advertised jobs are only for the sorting center. While hiring has begun, no opening date was available, she said.\n\nThe Majestic Commercenter is a 1,500-acre business park that also houses hubs for FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. Majestic Realty last year began construction of Building 29, saying it expected to complete the speculative warehouse and distribution center by Nov. 1, 2015.\n\nAfter getting stung by UPS shipping delays during the 2013 Christmas season, Amazon began opening intermediary facilities to better control the delivery process. Last year, it also bought a fleet of trailers to move packages between facilities, which helps Amazon rely even less on FedEx, UPS and other carriers.\n\nAmazon also operates large fulfillment centers in more than two dozen states scattered mostly along the coasts.\n\nSince late March, Amazon has announced plans to open at least three more fulfillment centers, each creating 1,000 full-time jobs.\n\nThose include an 800,000-square foot facility near Kansas City in Edgerton, Kansas; a 1 million-square- foot center in Haslet, Texas, north of Fort Worth; and its seventh in California — a 1.1 million-square-foot center in San Bernardino.\n\nSortation centers tend to be smaller, at around 200,000 to 300,000 square feet, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL.\n\nBut they are also in cities that already have fulfillment centers.\n\nIn Kent, Wash., an Amazon sortation center cut delivery time by nine hours so customers could still get two-day delivery if they ordered by 11:59 p.m., instead of the previous 3 p.m., according to a story in The Seattle Times. It also enabled Sunday delivery.\n\nRobinson did not share whether the new Aurora site will also have a nearby fulfillment center, as is the case for Seattle and 15 other sortation locations.\n\nAmazon’s expansion into Colorado is “to better serve customers and this facility will enable faster delivery time,” Robinson said.\n\nAmazon also posted its first Denver-based job for a logistics manager in February. The job required everything from implementing new technology platforms to having the ability “to lift up to 49 pounds with or without reasonable accommodation.”\n\nSeveral more Denver jobs popped up on Amazon’s careers page this month. Most are tech-related and are part of Amazon Web Services, including solutions architect, DevOps cloud architect and a technical trainer.\n\nHolly Shrewsbury, a spokeswoman for the state’s Office of Economic Development and International Trade, confirmed that Amazon officials “engaged our office to talk about tax environment and real estate options,” she said. But she added that Amazon did not receive any financial incentives to expand in Colorado.\n\nLast November, Majestic Realty Co. acquired 530 acres to expand the business park. The park has 3.5 million square feet in industrial space and the ability to hold 12 million square feet in warehouse and distribution facilities.\n\nAt the time, Majestic Realty executive vice president Randy Hertel said “E-commerce is driving the commercial real estate industry in ways we’ve not seen before. We’re seeing greater demand in the 1 million-and-up-square-foot range with land requirements and tenant improvements slightly different than the traditional warehouse and distribution building.”\n\nHertel declined to comment Monday.\n\nThe Denver industrial market saw “record levels of development” in the first quarter this year, according to a report by CBRE, a commercial real estate agency.\n\nApproximately 4.4 million square feet of projects are in development, with more than half located near the airport. Construction on industrial projects is 52 percent greater than the previous peak of second quarter 2007. About 80 percent of the activity is speculative, according to CBRE.\n\nA major change between Amazon and its Colorado customers began Feb. 1, when Amazon started collecting sales tax in Colorado. It fueled speculation that the company had established a business presence in the state.\n\nThe states where Amazon operates fulfillment centers align with where the company charges sales tax.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Amazon was issued a business license in Aurora and filed to collect sales taxes in that city on Feb. 8, according to public filings.\n\nThe company’s move tax shoppers also came amid developments in 5-year-old lawsuit involving a Colorado law that imposes reporting requirements on internet retailers that do not collect sales taxes.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld Colorado’s “Amazon Tax,” which requires retailers that do not charge sales taxes to track customers’ purchases in Colorado, report the taxes that should have been paid to the state and advise buyers of their tax obligations.\n\nHowever, Amazon instituting sales tax collection may not be a boon for Colorado. Tax revenue limits set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights could result in most of the collections from Amazon having to be refunded to taxpayers.",
  "latent_14392": "Beatification (from Latin beatus, \"blessed\" and facere, \"to make\") is a recognition accorded by the Catholic Church of a dead person's entrance into Heaven and capacity to intercede on behalf of individuals who pray in his or her name. Beati is the plural form, referring to those who have undergone the process of beatification.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nLocal bishops had the power of beatifying until 1634, when Pope Urban VIII, in the apostolic constitution Cœlestis Jerusalem of 6 July, reserved the power of beatifying to the Holy See.[1][2]\n\nSince the reforms of 1983, one miracle must be believed to have taken place through the intercession of the person to be beatified, though the medical investigations of the Church are conducted privately and are therefore subject to speculation about their methods.[3][4]\n\nThe requirement of a miracle for beatification is waived in the case of someone who died as a martyr.[5]\n\nThe feast day for a Blessed person is not universal, but is celebrated only in regions where the person receives particular veneration. For instance, Saint Kateri Tekakwitha was especially honored in the United States and Canada during her time as Blessed. The person may also be honored in a particular religious order, diocese, or organization, such as John Duns Scotus among the Franciscans, the Archdiocese of Cologne and other places. Similarly, veneration of Blessed Chiara Badano is particular to the Focolare movement; her case also demonstrates that, contrary to popular opinion, beatification may take place within a relatively short time after a person's death of an individual (for Badano, twenty years).\n\nPractices under the Popes [ edit ]\n\nPope John Paul II (18 May 1920 – 2 April 2005) markedly changed previous Catholic practice of beatification. By October 2004, he had beatified 1,340 people, more than the sum of all of his predecessors since Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590), who established a beatification procedure similar to that used today. John Paul II's successor, Pope Benedict XVI, removed the custom of holding beatification rites in the Vatican with the Pope presiding; they now can be held where the subject lived with the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints[note 1] designated to preside over the ceremony as Papal Delegate. The Pope himself still can preside, as happened on 19 September 2010, when Benedict XVI beatified John Henry Newman in Cofton Park, Birmingham, on the last day of his visit to the United Kingdom. Benedict XVI also personally celebrated the Beatification Mass for his predecessor, John Paul II, at St. Peter's Basilica, on the Second Sunday of Easter, or Divine Mercy Sunday, on 1 May 2011, an event that drew more than one million people.\n\nCultus confirmation [ edit ]\n\nCultus confirmation is a somewhat different procedure, wherein the church recognizes a local cult of a person, asserting that veneration of that person is acceptable. Such a confirmation is more an official sanctioning of folk Catholicism than an active step in a canonization procedure, but the object of the cult may equally be addressed as \"Blessed\".[6]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ There have been occasions where a Cardinal from the local region was put in place instead.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nSources [ edit ]",

But David Cameron is against the plan, and Tory MPs will be whipped to vote against it. Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow Europe minister, said: 'When the EU Referendum bill returns to the Commons this week, Labour will press the case for 16 and 17 year olds to be allowed to vote in the referendum.

  "latent_14628": "By now you’ve already heard about the “backlash” being directed toward the entire state of Indiana over the recent passage of their new religious freedom law. The NCAA is hinting about moving their basketball tournament away. They might even lose their comic book convention. (How much of a “loss” that would be is subjective.) But one of the more interesting threats being made comes from the CEO of online review site Yelp.\n\nYelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman isn’t happy. He penned an open letter on Thursday bashing Indiana’s new religious freedom bill, railing against “laws that would allow for business to discriminate against consumers based on certain traits including sexual orientation.”\n\nThe Yelp executive didn’t stop with voicing his displeasure, though. He further hinted that he couldn’t see how he could create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in Indiana or any other state which instituted such policies. In case that requires translation, he’s saying that he will happily punish everyone in the state by removing or intentionally avoiding the creation of jobs. Isn’t that just a positive, helpful message to send?\n\nBut if Mr. Stoppelman can’t be associated with businesses which “discriminate” based on certain traits, then one of the core functions of his own business comes into question. Some of the most popular reviews on Yelp are for restaurants, particularly high end ones where diners expect to pay a hefty price but receive top end quality in return. What’s the problem there? Well, many of those eateries have dress codes for the dinner hour and will turn away people who don’t adhere.\n\nAlso, restaurants are well within their rights to set a specific dress code and require guests to follow it. If the restaurant is black tie, and you arrive in a t-shirt and jeans, expect them to ignore you. The dress code is considered part of the restaurant’s ambience, and is legally protected. In short, dressing to meet the classification is considered a choice. If you choose to eat at the restaurant, then you must choose to dress appropriately.\n\nBut how should we interpret this in the current era of political correctness? If you are turning away those who are not well dressed, they most likely fall into one category of those people of certain traits, specifically those who can’t afford dressy clothes. And in most cities, which people are most likely to be economically disadvantaged? Minorities! So, by the rule of the transitive property, dress codes are discriminatory against minorities so the restaurant owners are racists. Right? So why does Yelp allow people to write reviews for them?\n\nIt’s a categorically stupid argument, but I’ve heard far worse being argued in the name of political correctness. The fact is that the Indiana law is going to wind up being an important milestone for civil liberties no matter which way it goes in the end. We have a situation where activists are claiming that some form of discrimination exists against one subset of people (gays) and are perfectly willing to trample of the rights of another, less politically popular group of people (Christians) if it achieves their long term goals. Passing a law intended to correct this imbalance is setting people’s hair on fire in the usual circles, but it’s going to prove to be an instructive test case.\n\nBeyond all of this, however, I have to feel a bit disappointed that the debate ever had to be constructed as one of religious liberty in the first place. True, the religious liberty aspect of it is an important one and the courts need to speak to it. But underneath it all we’re talking about the freedom of private business owners to conduct their business as they see fit. The hard core libertarian argument which underpins this rests on the fact that a private business can’t actually “discriminate” against you in the same fashion that the government can. For one example, the state can’t pass a law refusing to issue a driver’s license to black motorists. The state holds an absolute monopoly on licenses and the black motorist can’t simply go down the street to Bob’s House of Discount Licenses and get one there.\n\nBut a wedding cake is no different than any other food item once you remove the gay marriage element from the equation. Businesses who decide to refuse service to various people will be subject to the same market forces which always apply. If there is a market for any given goods or services and one owner chooses not to capitalize on that market, another will move in to fill the vacuum. If you refuse too many customers you will eventually go out of business, but that’s the nature of the business world. Sadly, the courts stopped defending the idea of free markets in cases where political correctness manages to stick its nose under the edge of the tent many decades ago. But the religious liberty aspect of this case gives it additional legs, so it won’t be batted aside as easily.",

  "latent_15003": "Are you an athlete looking to increase your leg strength, power and explosiveness? Are you mom or female exerciser working out in the gym and hoping to firm up your legs and improve a jiggly butt and reduce the visibility of cellulite on the back of your thighs and butt?\n\nTo keep up with the latest from Zig Ziegler, follow Zig on twitter @zig_ziegler.\n\nIf you look around the internet at various training websites including youtube videos, you will hear numerous experts explain proper squatting technique touting squat technique as the answer to your dreams. The truth about fitness is that there is only one squatting technique. The best technique for squatting is the one you were born with and used until a fitness expert tried to instruct you, you read an article in a fitness magazine, or followed the advice of a friend.\n\nIf you watch children up until the age that they begin organized training, their bodies develop at a rate in which we perceive is balance between strength and flexibility. Coordination, however, takes a while to catch up for those children of all ages who experience a growth spurt or constant changes in activity.\n\nIn fact, a developing toddler to adolescent is capable of demonstrating strength and flexibility while constantly battling coordination mainly because they have no perception of failure or understanding of instructions given to them on how to walk, run, squat, or throw. They just do it. In fact, the first signs of struggle we see from children while performing physical activities is after their first words of instructions.\n\nRecently i began to instruct my teenage daughter on how to play a new sport. The more practice and instruction I provide, the more she struggles. The more I allow her body to do what she does naturally, the better her performance and the better the result. My goal is to provide her with the strength, balance, coordination, and flexibility to assist her body in performing the task and allow the skill to benefit from her body having the strength, coordination, and flexibility to perform the skills necessary to play the sport. With those things, I am instructing around one weakness or another.\n\nHave you ever heard a strength coach or a fitness professional say, you’re going to struggle until you learn proper squatting technique. I’m glad no one sad that the kid in the pictures. Who knows how long it would have taken him to get up and move on to the next toy. Over the next few minutes I hope to shed a little light on a topic that has finally started to negatively impact, sports, fitness, and life.\n\nI wanted to keep this post brief with the idea of making several points. Here’s how the body works when you perform a squat or for that matter any task on your feet:\n\n1. The first segment of the body to store absorb, and transfer forces absorbed from the ground is the big toe on both feet while performing any activity while standing, walking, running, jumping or lunging. That force is transfer through the joint between the big toe and the foot (the interphalangeal joint). This is the first joint to store and release energy into the entire foot as it passes through the foot and ankle. As forces pass through the toe, it is the bottom of the foot (not the top) that must properly absorb the force and pass it on to the ankle.As a result of forces applied to the ground, the soft tissue of the bottom of the foot contracts and releases efficiently in order to properly move the forces out of the foot or injury may occur.\n\n2. The next segment of the body to absorb, store, and transfer energy is the entire lower leg. The muscles which must first absorb the force as it comes out of the ankle is the gastrocnemius/soleus complex (posterior compartment of the lower leg also knows as the calves) but only after the force passes through the Achilles tendon which connects the ankle to the posterior (back) lower leg muscles.\n\n3. The gastroc/soleus provides the necessary muscle contraction to transfer the forces properly out of the lower leg and next segment, the femur and the muscles of that segment which begins with the hamstrings and glutes. The glutes and hamstrings help to stabilize the pelvis and put it into position to complete the entire squat. The quadriceps act as a stabilizer and help to extend the knee during when elevating the body from the squat position. The quadriceps are triggered to extend the knee and are stimulated by any other anterior muscle contraction in the lower leg or foot.\n\nIn the 1960s/1970s/1980s and even the early 1990s, weightlifting was done primarily by body builders including Arnold Schwarzenegger. The legendary body builders focused on squatting through the forefoot. In the mid 1990’s some so called expert (no one will ever take credit for it now) began to instruct people to squat, lunge, leg press, etc while pushing through the heels of the feet. In fact, if you watch just about every fitness video, or so called expert in glute training, every one stresses pushing the the heels.\n\nHere’s a test for you to run through your common sense meter. Perform a toe raise by shifting the weight towards the heels. In performing toe raise, notice the increase intensity in your quadriceps contraction and some contraction of your glutes. Shift the weight into your heels by raising your the entire front part of your foot off the ground, step, or where ever you are doing this test. In doing so you may feel a some contraction in the glutes.\n\nHowever, you should notice that the more you try to squeeze your qlutes, the more you squeeze your qaudriceps (thighs) instead.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned the role of the big toe. If the weight is in the heel, what happens to the big toe? It lifts off of the ground as the top of the foot and toes extend upwards, initiating the front side contraction of the entire leg.\n\nNow try this test. Perform a standing calf raise (heel lift). As you lift your heel, try to contract your glutes (squeeze your butt). Were you successful? If you were, your kinetic chain and kinematic sequence are correct. Your kinetic chain and kinematic sequence are easily explained as the flow of energy and order (sequence) of muscle contraction.\n\nWhat you feel here is the muscles contraction and areas of intensity you should feel when are at the top of your squat. While in performing the heel raise, you should have noticed a significant difference in muscle contraction on the calves, hamstrings, and glutes.\n\nBut is the contraction greater or less than the Toe Raise (heel press) rather than the Calf Press (heel lift).\n\nIn Biomechanics and Kinesiology, in order to push through the heels a person must first shift the weight backwards. To do so, requires a contraction of the muscles on the front of the lower leg. In EMG research testing in my lab, the entire anterior compartment of the lower leg (shin) contracts once the weight shifts behind the mid point of the foot.\n\nThe gastroc/soleus complex also contracts but only acts more as a stabilizer than a primary mover. This means the calves neither receive nor deliver any force to the middle of the foot or the big toe when pushing through the heels. In other words if the weight is in the heels and the lifter pushes through the heels, the entire front of the leg contracts to help with the squat. NOT THE BACK OF THE LEG!\n\nAs a result of the single exercise cue “Push through the heels” sports and fitness professionals have inadvertently contributed to an increase in Achilles tendon injuries, knee injuries, low back pain and injuries, tight hips, and numerous other injuries. It’s time for a change in the industry and it starts with exercise professionals. I have come to that conclusion based not on opinion but after evaluation of the Biomechanics data of over 50,000 athletes and exercisers over the past 18 years.\n\nBy the repetition and migration of injuries to different parts of the body, it’s easy to conclude that many professional athletes like Greg Oden, Tiger Woods and others were instructed to push through their heels while squatting and lunging during rehab. Because it is clearly a cue given as an industry standard, I can imagine that even Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose, as he rehabs in hopes to return to play this season has been repeatedly instructed to push through his heels. Even though Adrian Peterson had an incredible 2012 NFL season, he still exhibits signs of a weakened left foot and left ankle demonstrating that he may have been pushing through his heels while training.\n\nHere’s the problem: When you apply force back into the heels, you disable the foot and ankle’s ability to resist internal tibia (lower leg) rotation. In doing so, the athlete’s body is inadvertently ENABLING that same rotation that the foot could be preventing. It is that rotation that cause stress in the Achilles tendon and may cause medial and even lateral knee pain. In addition, the same rotation is what contributes to patella femoral syndrome and can lead to patella tendon ruptures. In previous chapter, I discussed Greg Oden’s injuries and what could have been done to prevent all of his injuries from 2008 to present. It is this simple cue that may have contributed to his repeated injuries. I am able to conclude this because of the presence of rotational stability issues in while he performed running and squatting Biomechanics tests. Brandon Roy, currently signed to play for the Minnesota Timberwolves also exhibited signs of rotational instability. And in numerous exercise videos on the internet Roy can be seen showing those same signs of knee rotational instability due to weight in his heels in various youtube videos. Later in this book, I will share research data from over 1,000 individuals performing squats and other exercisers in evidence of my findings.\n\nPersonally, I used to recommend pushing through the heels, as well. In fact, in my early days in the industryI used it as a common exercise cue believing what at the time made sense. However, looking back, my reason for suggesting it didn’t make “common” sense and as I began to apply more of the principles of Kinesiology, I knew I needed to change many of my exercise cues which came from the still evolving fitness industry. From 1997 on, I advocated mid-foot striking while on long distance runs and mid to forefoot pressing while performing strength training and conditioning. I switched to this cue as a way to allow the body to develop and utilize the foot as it was intended: a shock absorber. In order for the foot to assist in absorbing shock with high, low, or no impact activity, the forces start at the segment nears the end (distal) part of the foot, not in the heel.\n\nAs a former hurdler, I NEVER ran on my heels. However distance runners (more in the US than other countries) were instructed to run with a heel strike. Here’s a common sense question, if pushing through your heels help increase glute muscle contraction, wouldn’t distance runners have large glutes and strong hamstrings? In addition, would sprinters (who incidentally run on the balls of their feet) have small glutes and stronger quads when compared hamstrings? Instead, its just the opposite. Distance runners have large quads and non-existent glute muscle development when compared to sprinters.\n\nThe bottom line is time for a change in this simple cue. Please stop instructing clients to push through their heels unless you are trying to develop strong anterior (front side) leg muscles. Because as a cue to develop more glute strength or get rid of cellulite on the butt, it’s just not gonna happen.\n\nThis is an excerpt from my upcoming book: Absolute Kinetix: Fitness From the Ground Up.

That’s hardly surprising given that the sport was developed in America in 1968 and hippies athletes have been tossing the disc around the country ever since.\n\nBut this past week’s performance at the World Ultimate Championships in London was dominant even by U.S. standards. For the first time since 1994, the United States swept the open, women’s and mixed division championships: The mixed team defeated Australia, 15-6; the women defeated Colombia, 15-7; and the men defeated Japan, 15-11.\n\nThe week-long tournament, hosted by the sport’s governing body, World Flying Disc Federation, is ultimate’s top international competition, but it might not be for long. Last summer, WFDF was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee, which paves the way for its inclusion in the Olympics.\n\n“Our hope is that we’ll be in a position, in 2017, to make a credible pitch to put forward the mixed-gender division of ultimate as a viable candidate for the 2024 Olympics,” the organization’s president, Robert Rauch, told the New Yorker last summer.\n\nPart of the sport’s appeal to the IOC was that it was spectator friendly and it has a low financial and logistical barrier to entry, as noted in a New Yorker story last summer. It is played in more than 80 countries by about 7 million people, and WFDF represents 59 member associations in 56 countries.\n\n“There are still skeptics out there,” said Tom Crawford, the head of USA Ultimate and a former director of coaching for the U.S. Olympic committee, “who say, in response to the IOC decision, ‘They’re just a bunch of pot-smoking hippies and an example of how the Olympic movement is going in the tank.’ There’s also those saying how cool this would be.”\n\nAs for this weekend’s championships, the U.S. went 45-0 overall, winning the men’s and women’s masters finals — in addition to the aforementioned sweep of the open, women’s and mixed — and taking home five gold medals.

  "latent_15256": "If only he had shaved that morning.\n\nBasilios Bessarion grew up in an Eastern Orthodox community in present-day Turkey in the early 15th century. He become a monk, then an abbot, and was eventually appointed to be a metropolitan bishop by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, with whom he attended the ecumenical Council of Florence with hopes to reunite eastern and western Christianity. Though Bessarion was originally against reunion with Rome, he quickly changed his mind and became the most important Eastern Orthodox advocate for reunion at the council. Pope Eugene IV was so impressed by him that he made Bessarion a cardinal. From that point on, Bessarion lived and worked in Italy.\n\nFlash forward to 1455: the cardinals, including Bessarion, are in the midst of another papal conclave to elect a new pope. There are two factions, each aligned with a different Italian politician. After a number of votes with no consensus, the cardinals start looking for a more politically neutral candidate. Bessarion was an obvious choice since he was from the east and was less invested in Italian politics. And in fact he received a number of votes in the next round.\n\nBut there was one problem: he had a beard and refused to shave it.\n\nIt had long been a tradition in Eastern Christianity for priests to have beards. In the 11th century following the Great East-West Schism, Rome made it against canon law for priests in the west to have beards, although there was continued debate about it for many centuries.\n\nAlthough Bessarion had accepted the ecclesiological role of Rome, he wanted to keep for himself various Orthodox customs that weren’t contrary to the faith. And apparently he had been allowed to do so up until that time.\n\nBut now that he was being considered for the papacy, cardinals who were displeased with his eastern Christian practices started voicing their disapproval. One french cardinal reportedly pleaded with the whole group of cardinals:\n\nShall we select for Pope, for head of the Latin Church, a Greek, a mere interloper? Bessarion still wears his beard—and forsooth, he is to be our Lord! How poor, then, must be our Latin Church, if we can find no worthy man in it, but must needs resort to a Greek, and to one, too, who but yesterday attacked the Roman faith! And because he has now returned shall he be our master and the leader of the Christian army? Behold, such is the poverty of the Latin Church that she cannot find an apostolic sovereign without resorting to a Greek! Oh, Fathers! Do what you think fit; but for myself and those who think with me, we will never consent to a Greek head of the Church!”\n\nIn other words, the fact that he still had a beard was taken to symbolize that he wasn’t Roman enough to be pope.\n\nBessarion made no attempt to defend himself, saying that he wasn’t interested in being pope anyway. The cardinals ended up electing Pope Callixtus III, the Church’s first Spanish pope.\n\nThough he lost the 1455 conclave, Bessarion remained well-respected among many of the cardinals and was also a strong papal candidate in the 1464 papal conclave.\n\nBut he never did shave that beard.",
  "latent_15414": "Willis Hawley and Reed Smoot were reviled for a bill blamed for triggering the Great Depression. Will Trump follow their lead?\n\nAnyone, anyone? What happened when the US last introduced tariffs\n\nAs America inches towards a potential trade war over steel prices can Donald Trump hear whispering voices? Alone in the Oval Office in the wee dark hours, illuminated by the glow of his Twitter app, does he feel the sudden chill flowing from those freshly hung gold drapes? It is the shades of Smoot and Hawley.\n\nWillis Hawley and Reed Smoot have haunted Congress since the 1930s when they were the architects of the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill, among the most decried pieces of legislation in US history and a bill blamed by some for not only for triggering the Great Depression but also contributing to the start of the second world war.\n\nPilloried even in their own time, their bloodied names have been brought out like Jacob Marley’s ghost every time America has taken a protectionist turn on trade policy. And America has certainly taken a protectionist turn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Willis Hawley (left) and Reed Smoot, co-sponsors of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nSuccessful presidents including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have campaigned on the perils of free trade only to drop the rhetoric once installed in the White House. Trump called Mexicans “rapists” on the campaign trail. And China? “There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are,” Trump said.\n\nAs commander-in-chief he has shown no signs of softening and this week took major action announcing steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%.\n\nCanada and the EU said they would bring forward their own countermeasures. Mexico, China and Brazil have also said they are considering retaliatory steps.\n\nTrump doesn’t seem worried. “Trade wars are good,” he tweeted even as the usually friendly Wall Street Journal thundered that “Trump’s tariff folly” was the “biggest policy blunder of his Presidency”.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!\n\nIt is not his first protectionist move. In his first days in office the president has vetoed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the biggest trade deal in a generation, said he will review the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal he has called “the worst in history”, and had his visit with Mexico’s president cancelled over his plans to make them pay for a border wall.\n\nFree traders may have become complacent after hearing tough talk on trade from so many presidential candidates on the campaign trail only to watch them furiously back-pedal when they get into office, said Dartmouth professor and trade expert Douglas Irwin. “Unfortunately that pattern may have been broken,” he says. “It looks like we have to take Trump literally and seriously about his threats on trade.”\n\nNot since Herbert Hoover has a US president been so down on free trade. And Hoover was the man who signed off on Smoot and Hawley’s bill.\n\nHawley, an Oregon congressman and a professor of history and economics, became a stock figure in the textbooks of his successors thanks to his partnership with the lean, patrician figure of Senator Reed Smoot, a Mormon apostle known as the “sugar senator” for his protectionist stance towards Utah’s sugar beet industry.\n\nBefore he was shackled to Hawley for eternity Smoot was more famous for his Mormonism and his abhorrence of bawdy books, a disgust that inspired the immortal headline “Smoot Smites Smut” after he attacked the importation of Lady’s Chatterley’s Lover, Robert Burns’ more risqué poems and similar texts as “worse than opium … I would rather have a child of mine use opium than read these books.”\n\nBut it was imports of another kind that secured Smoot and Hawley’s place in infamy.\n\nThe US economy was doing well in the 1920s as the consumer society was being born to the sound of jazz. The Tariff Act began life largely as a politically motivated response to appease the agricultural lobby that had fallen behind as American workers, and money, consolidated in the cities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest President Ronald Reagan: after Smoot and Hawley ‘we lived through a nightmare’. Photograph: Marcy Nighswander/Associated Press\n\nForeign demand for US produce had soared during the first world war, and farm prices doubled between 1915 and 1918. A wave of land speculation followed and farmers took on debt as they looked to expand production. By the early 1920s farmers had found themselves heavily in debt and squeezed by tightening monetary policy and an unexpected collapse in commodity prices.\n\nNearly a quarter of the American labor force was then employed on the land, and Congress could not ignore heartland America. Cheap foreign imports and their toll on the domestic market became a hot issue in the 1928 election. Even bananas weren’t safe. Irwin quotes one critic in his book Peddling Protectionism: Smoot Hawley and the Great Depression: “The enormous imports of cheap bananas into the United States tend to curtail the domestic consumption of fresh fruits produced in the United States.”\n\nTrump-Mexico relations hit new low after 20% border wall tax mooted Read more\n\nRepublicans called protective tariffs “essential for the continued prosperity of the country” and Hoover, who said agriculture was “the most urgent economic problem” facing the nation, said “an adequate tariff is the foundation of farm relief”.\n\nHoover won in a landslide against Albert E Smith, an out-of-touch New Yorker who didn’t appeal to middle America, and soon after promised to pass “limited” tariff reforms.\n\nHawley started the bill but with Smoot behind him it metastasized as lobby groups shoehorned their products into the bill, eventually proposing higher tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods.\n\nSiren voices warned of dire consequences. Henry Ford reportedly told Hoover the bill was “an economic stupidity”.\n\nCritics of the tariffs were being aided and abetted by “internationalists” willing to “betray American interests”, said Smoot. Reports claiming the bill would harm the US economy were decried as fake news. Republican Frank Crowther, dismissed press criticism as “demagoguery and untruth, scandalous untruth”.\n\nIn October 1929 as the Senate debated the tariff bill the stock market crashed. When the bill finally made it to Hoover’s desk in June 1930 it had morphed from his original “limited” plan to the “highest rates ever known”, according to a New York Times editorial.\n\nThe extent to which Smoot and Hawley were to blame for the coming Great Depression is still a matter of debate. “Ask a thousand economists and you will get a thousand and five answers,” said Charles Geisst, professor of economics at Manhattan College and author of Wall Street: A History.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unemployment in the US rose to 25% during the Great Depression. Photograph: Dorothea Lange/Getty Images\n\nWhat is apparent is that the bill sparked international outrage and a backlash. Canada and Europe reacted with a wave of protectionist tariffs that deepened a global depression that presaged the rise of Hitler and the second world war. A myriad other factors contributed to the Depression, and to the second world war, but inarguably one consequence of Smoot-Hawley in the US was that never again would a sitting US president be so avowedly anti-trade. Until today.\n\nFranklin D Roosevelt swept into power in 1933 and for the first time the president was granted the authority to undertake trade negotiations to reduce foreign barriers on US exports in exchange for lower US tariffs. The backlash against Smoot and Hawley continued to the present day. The average tariff on dutiable imports was 45% in 1930; by 2010 it was 5%.\n\nThe lessons of Smoot-Hawley used to be taught in high schools, said Geisst. Presidents from Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan have enlisted the unhappy duo when facing off with free trade critics. “I have been around long enough to remember that when we did that once before in this century, something called Smoot-Hawley, we lived through a nightmare,” Reagan, who came of age during the Great Depression, said in 1984.\n\nThey even got a mention in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off when actor Ben Stein’s teacher bores his class with it. “I don’t think the current generation are taught it. It’s in the past and we are more interested in the future,” said Geisst.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bueller! Smoot and Hawley failed to impress students in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\n\nBut that might be about to change. “The main lesson is that you have to worry about what other countries do. Countries will retaliate,” said Irwin. “When Congress was considering Smoot-Hawley in the 1930s they didn’t consider what other countries might do in reaction. They thought other countries would remain passive. But other countries don’t remain passive.”\n\nThe consequences of a trade war today are far worse than in the 1930s. Exports of goods and services account for about 13% of US gross domestic product (GDP) – the broadest measure of an economy. It was roughly 5% back in 1920.\n\n“The US is much more engaged in trade, it’s much more a part of the fabric of the country, than it was in the 1920s and 1930s. That means the ripple effects are widespread. Many more industries will be hit by it and the scope for foreign retaliation, which in the case of Smoot-Hawley was quite limited, is going to be much more widespread if a trade war was to start,” said Irwin.\n\n“When you start talking about withdrawing from trade agreements or imposing tariffs of 35%, if you are doing that as a protectionist measure, that would be blowing up the system.”\n\nThat the promise of “blowing up the system” got Trump elected may be why the ghosts of Smoot and Hawley are once again walking the halls of Congress.",
  "latent_15491": "The pictures were har­rowing — bloody corpses sprawled on the floor of a train station.\n\nChinese state media’s descriptions of the attack were equally shocking: a group of knife-wielding assailants had burst into the station in southern China on Saturday night and slashed to death at least 29 people.\n\nYou don’t often hear about terrorist attacks like this in China, a one-party Communist state.\n\nThe government-run Xinhua News Agency described the Kunming train station assault as a “premeditated violent terrorist attack” and identified the perpetrators as separatists from China’s restive Xinjiang region.\n\nFor readers seeking to understand one of the thorniest challenges facing China’s leaders, here’s some background on the problems in Xinjiang:\n\n1. What is Xinjiang?\n\nXinjiang is a region on the westernmost edge of northern China. It is home to an ethnic Muslim minority called Uighurs (also spelled Uyghurs), a Turkic-speaking people who have long chafed under Chinese rule and have protested the steady influx of ethnic Chinese into the region. Over the course of centuries, the Xinjiang region has been part of many different — and, at times, competing — empires. It has been under Communist rule since the party took control of China in 1949.\n\nFor years, many Uighurs and other smaller Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have agitated against China’s authoritarian government. Their protests are a reaction, Uighur groups say, to oppressive official policies, religious restrictions and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe Chinese government has long denied any oppression of Uighurs or any other ethnic group.\n\n2. What do Uighurs in ­Xinjiang want?\n\nYou can’t lump all Uighurs together. Different factions want different things — from more equitable treatment to outright secession from China. Many complaints have to do with China’s religious restrictions.\n\nJust as Chinese leaders try to control other religions, including Catholicism and evangelical Christianity, they have issued strict policies for Muslim Uighurs. They must use a state-approved Koran. Mosques are managed by the government. And Uighur men who want government jobs have been forced to shave their beards; women are forbidden to wear head scarves.\n\nSeparatists who seek full independence from China call the Xinjiang region “East Turkestan” and want the right to govern themselves.\n\nHuman rights groups have been fairly critical of China’s treatment of Uighurs. One of the most egregious examples they cite occurred just weeks ago, when authorities seized a prominent Uighur scholar named Ilham Tohti at his home without explanation.\n\n3. Who are Uighurs, and why does the name sound familiar?\n\nReaders who closely followed the debate over detainees held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may recall a group of Uighurs who were essentially stranded there for more than a decade, after the U.S. military determined they had no ties to al-Qaeda or the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. government didn’t want to send the Uighurs, who had been captured in Pakistan, back to China because of fears that the Chinese government would persecute them. When U.S. officials tried to transfer them to other countries, China warned the nations not to accept them. Finally, in December, the last three Uighurs were released from Guantanamo to Slovakia. Files released by the group WikiLeaks say the former prisoners were “probable” members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a separatist group that Chinese authorities blame for several attacks in recent years.\n\nReaders in Washington may also remember reports about “the mother of the Uighur movement,” Rebiya Kadeer, a Northern Virginia resident and president of the exile group World Uyghur Congress.\n\n4. How serious is the ­Uighur-\n\nChinese conflict?\n\nThe violence has been bad for a while. What’s different now is the emergence of targeted terrorist strikes.\n\nEthnic rioting and clashes in Xinjiang reached a peak in 2009, causing roughly 200 deaths and triggering a crackdown by local authorities. Renewed protests last year also turned violent and are thought to have claimed more than 100 lives.\n\nTo Chinese, the most shocking attack blamed on Uighurs occurred in October when a jeep veered into a crowd in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, then crashed and burst into flames, killing five people. Almost immediately, authorities declared it the work of terrorists from Xinjiang, and within 10 hours of the crash, authorities said they had arrested five suspects who were in possession of long knives and flags calling for “jihad.”\n\n5. How have Uighurs ­responded to these attacks?\n\nWhile some Uighur leaders have condemned the attacks, they have also expressed skepticism about the government’s version of events.\n\n“There is no legitimate reason to attack civilians. We express our condolences to the family members of the dead,” Dilshat Rexit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, said Sunday. But, he added, “China has to deal with the incident transparently; it cannot serve as a new political excuse for further clamping down on Uighurs, serious discrimination and repressing policies.”\n\nAfter the Tiananmen Square crash, Kadeer issued this statement: “The Chinese government will not hesitate to concoct a version of the incident in Beijing, so as to further impose repressive measures on the Uighur people.”\n\nCritics accuse the government of using the threat of separatists to justify their heavy-handed ­security and policies in Xinjiang and fear that the recent incidents will result in tougher crackdowns.",
  "latent_15514": "Michael Angelakos is one of the last guys who needed to do a Reddit AMA. The Passion Pit mastermind has voluntarily shared more intimate parts of his life with the casual music news reader than most people do with their closest friends. He’s spoken with candor about his battles with bipolar disorder and comment section trolls, publicly announced both his divorce and came out as gay in a single podcast with Bret Easton Ellis, and handed over the Passion Pit Twitter account in the name of scientific advocacy. If you smashed that RT, Tremendous Sea of Love showed up in your inbox. If you didn't, it's currently easier to find video of Angelakos receiving an electromagnetic current to his brain than official audio of Passion Pit’s fourth album, one completely divorced from the vestigial “album cycle” that Angelakos has no use for in 2017.\n\n“You’re over the money but under the gun/You came in the front door so where can you run?” he sings to himself on “I’m Perfect,” one of the nine tracks Angelakos pumped onto YouTube under the Wishart Group banner before they disappeared. In both subject matter and execution, Tremendous Sea of Love is Angelakos trying to rediscover the joy of process rather than the satisfaction of product. He said many of these songs were written and uploaded within a day, as if to let us all know that whether he took three years or three hours, it all ends up as data anyways.\n\nAs it was in Angelakos’ Boston dorm room, Passion Pit is still a project defined by synaptic synthesizers, blaring falsetto, and relentless major-key melodies. He has never been one to hunch over an acoustic guitar; there are no false starts or tape hiss to signify a more DIY approach. But when he sings about a complicated relationship with his mother over a minimal, staccato string figure on the closing “For Sondra (It Means the World to Me),” he sounds both terrified and freed, finally able to face the kind of raw and confessional songwriting he previously avoided out of instinctual fear.\n\nRaw and confessional are relative for Passion Pit, of course. The extreme dissonance between the hyperglycemic sound of Passion Pit songs and their bitter emotional content should be a starting point, not a revelation. Angelakos said “Take a Walk” is his least favorite song, but it’s still a definitive work in an illustrative way—come for the Doritos Locos commercial, stay for a devastating recount of how the promises of capitalism brought the Angelakos family to America and poisoned its next three generations of men. The full disclosure of Gossamer caused Angelakos to aspire for a well-earned positivity and universality on Kindred, but taking cues from professional, suit-and-tie songwriters like Cole Porter and Irving Berlin (“Holy shit, no one gets to the chorus faster than they do”) led to an album where the stereotype of Angelakos as a jingle writer could’ve stuck.\n\nMeanwhile, no Passion Pit song has ever taken longer to get to the chorus than “Somewhere Up There.” There isn’t a chorus at all, but like Angelakos’ best hooks, the first three minutes can feel frightening and giddy, either a free-fall or a sudden uplift. It’s his idea of a classical suite, stopping mid-air to meditate on Bowlby’s Attachment Theory and ending with a banal phone message from his mother about gardening. No song has done a more convincing job of transposing Angelakos’ centrifugal brain into music and “Somewhere Up There” validates the process of making Tremendous Sea of Love: a stunning artistic achievement and something that would be totally useless to ad execs.\n\nIf not a rejection of its predecessor, Tremendous Sea of Love is a reaction to it—while just as streamlined and compact, it lacks the hermetic seal that defined Kindred. When “Inner Dialogue” and “I’m Perfect” abruptly shut down at two-and-a-half minutes, they’re over but not necessarily finished; it’s conceivable that Angelakos could get The Life of Pablo with these songs and add another bridge or pitch-shifted choir. “Hey K” and “You Have the Right” are first-take sequels to the exquisite and ornate “Constant Conversations,” addressing the same person (ex-wife Kristy Mucci), the subject of Angelakos’ crippling remorse and shame, but from a healthier place. “To the Otherside” and “The Undertow” don’t fuss much over their metaphors or really create them at all, but the listener is probably aware that Angelakos is now heading up a potentially game-changing artist’s services group with $250 million worth of funding. Would “I made it to the other side” be any more powerful if it was phrased differently or would it just be more clever?\n\nWhether or not Tremendous Sea of Love actually exists without the legitimizing vestiges of the music business, it relieves Angelakos from the burdens of having to reestablish the Passion Pit brand in the way that peers such as MGMT and Phoenix will once they return. It’s presented as a gift—free of charge, with a targeted audience, but not necessarily an altruistic act. “I wrote this album to tell myself and to tell you that you were always good enough,” Angelakos wrote via a typed, smudged letter that serves currently as his pinned Tweet. “I do not need your money. I just want you, I just NEED you, to listen to me.” On “I’m Perfect,” Angelakos is honest about the coexistence of neediness and grandiosity in his superego: “Tell me I’m so damn perfect/Tell me it all of the time.” But even if you did, Angelakos doesn't sound like he'd believe it anyway. Tremendous Sea of Love isn't perfect, nor is it meant to be; under the weight of the world, we should just aspire to be good enough from now on.",

  "latent_15642": "Those who dispute the theory that global warming is producing more extreme weather events received a boost Wednesday with the release of a federal forecast indicating another milder-than-average hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center said in a statement that its 2015 Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook shows a “below-normal hurricane season is most likely this year,” thanks in large part to the effect of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.\n\n“The main climate factor expected to suppress this hurricane season is El Nino, which is now present and is expected to last through the hurricane season,” said the forecast summary.\n\nChip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the free-market Cato Institute, had this to say: “So much for claims that human-caused global warming is leading to ever-worsening extreme weather conditions.”\n\n“In now the ninth year without a major hurricane making landfall in the U.S. (the longest such period on record), the global warming hysteria has largely been muted when it comes to Atlantic hurricanes,” Mr. Knappenberger said in an email.\n\nThe NOAA forecast calls for six to 11 tropical storms this year, including Tropical Storm Ana, which formed earlier this month. Three to six of those are expected to reach hurricane status with wind speeds of 74 miles per hour, while two may become major hurricanes at 111 miles per hour, said the summary.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists and others have said that increased temperatures brought on by higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would likely result in more intense hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.\n\n“Recent scientific evidence suggests a link between the destructive power (or intensity) of hurricanes and higher ocean temperatures, driven in large part by global warming,” said the organization in its report, “Hurricanes in a Warmer World: Exploring the potential causes of increase story intensity.”\n\n“With rapid population growth in coastal regions placing many more people and structures in the path of these tropical cyclones there is a much greater risk of casualties, property damage, and financial hardship when these storms make landfall,” says the report.\n\nSuch arguments intensified after the destructive 2005 season that saw Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita wreak devastation along the Gulf Coast.\n\nOther scientists, often derided as “deniers” or “skeptics,” have challenged the connection between extreme weather events and carbon dioxide levels, saying there are too many other factors involved.\n\n“The voices reached a crescendo in the mid-2000s after the destructive hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005,” said Mr. Knappenberger. “But all along, NOAA hurricane forecasters/researchers have maintained that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation was the culprit — not rising greenhouse gases.”\n\nMore recently, environmental groups have pointed to this year’s disastrous flooding in Texas and the Midwest as evidence of climate change.\n\nIn a Wednesday article in Scientific American headlined, “Climate Change May Have Souped Up Record-Breaking Texas Deluge,” Texas Tech researcher Katharine Hayhoe said that “climate change will affect us in the ways we’re already vulnerable to climate and weather today, and Texas is no exception.”\n\n“When you have a warmer atmosphere, then you have the capability to hold more water vapor. When storms organize, there’s much more water you can wring out of the atmosphere compared to the past,” Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Climate Wire.\n\nMyron Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Energy and Environment, cautioned both sides against putting too much faith in the NOAA forecast.\n\n“Predictions by NOAA’s Hurricane Center have proved to be wrong more often than not over the past several years, as have many others’ predictions,” Mr. Ebell said in an email.\n\nNo matter what happens, however, the result is likely to fuel the debate over global warming and extreme weather.\n\n“If, despite NOAA’s prediction of a below-average Atlantic hurricane season, a major storm hits the U. S. and does a lot of damage, you can be sure that many alarmists will be quick to credit it to global warming — which by the way has been non-existent for the past 18 years,” Mr. Ebell said.\n\n“NOAA is also predicting above-average hurricane activity in the Pacific,” he added. “That prediction may turn out to be wrong, too.”\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_15692": "Boosting Trump Dooms the Right, Advances Democrats\n\nWhat if one-third of the right’s seething, trust-only-their-gut rabble cram Trump, already a General Election underdog, down their party’s throat? Early in the primaries, fire-breathing Trumpery has already dismantled the rightwing propaganda machine. Plus, he’s discredited all elitist “conservative” ideologues and their tiresome, failed ideology. Overall, Trump is a wedge widening the broken Bush coalition of billionaires, evangelicals and seething white workers. Why, top Repugs are almost as distressed as the frustrated blue collar mobs cheering the new Trump towers.\n\nThat all sounds good to this progressive: let’s toast the Donald as the greatest schismatic force in politics, splitting open a staggeringly insular, anti-thought and Constitution-defying party. And this happy news precedes the inevitable tsunami of scandals coming Trump’s way, as his personal and business dirt oozes to the surface. Agreed, Trump is less extreme, less ideological (on abortion, taxes, trade, Israel, Asian wars) than the fanatic Cruz, even Rubio (or Carson’s fans). One embraces a disruptive Trump nomination though not without dreading the Trumpster trashing the White House.\n\nWith GOP mud flying fast and furious. all the more reason for the exceptionally clean, scandal-free Sanders to emerge as the strongest Democrat. Hillary, with negative baggage the size of Maryland, is the perfect bulls eye for vicious, demagogic Trumpian antics. Look how Trumpery demolishes all opponents, with decades of fewer ducks in a row (vs. HC). Against Sanders, but not Hillary (with also high negative ratings), Trump’s sky-high disapproval numbers (pushing 60%) will be front and center.\n\nWill Trump suddenly win over the 65% of his own party who reject him (many like Meg Whitman with fervor) and/or consider him unelectable in the General Election? Does Trump yet have a national constituency —beyond his one-third of the disempowered. Will evangelicals forever dismiss hard evidence linking Trump to sinful gambling and strip joints, the underworld, KKK support, inherited wealth, multiple divorces and bankruptcies? Are there enough under-and unemployed angry, white, bigoted yahoos — and how many will certainly vote in all-important battleground states?\n\nWhere’s Trump’s National Party?\n\nLet’s concede all the ’08 “Romney states” to any Republican nominee, but how does the Donald take over half of the key, close contests, like VA, WI, CO, NH, OH, PA and FL? What if nominee Trump, seriously more discredited by November (however hard to believe), drives down all Republican voting, as the less objectionable Romney fell millions short of McCain’s ’08 totals? That’s why elected Republicans fear Trump, as not only a blown chance against vulnerable Democrats, but a wrecking ball to its entire power structure.\n\nThus, is it such a reach to project that a divisive Trump nomination offers the greatest chance to make America greater: by boosting reform Democrats, even pulling some out of the shadows? More than half the activist billionaires will likely support Hillary, the predictable, multi-millionaire whose Senate and State careers did not damage their treasure. The rest will tone down or go with fellow oligarch Trump, who only happens to be the richest, most business-friendly, anti-tax corporatist ever to run for president.\n\nWill Trump’s zero program specifics not torpedo all those vacuous promises to bring industry and job growth to countless Rust Belts? What imaginable majority of voters will embrace foul language, illegal bans against entire groups, loutish defenses of torture worse than waterboarding PLUS directing violence against rally protesters or unarmed families of alleged terrorists? And let’s not forget delusions of self-defeating walls (real, and with tariffs) that will alienate most the world. Finally, what happens when the military refuses to follow a lawless and unconstitutional President Trump order? A coup comes even quicker than an impeachment.\n\nYes, Trump could draw in angry non-standard voters, but for how long will hardscrabble workers tolerate Trump’s fat cat, anti-worker sense of entitlement? Will mounting negatives not grow when the world learns in depth about his unChristian, go-for-the-throat business practices? What happens when his great wealth is exposed as no less corrupt than that of his billionaire buddies? And more for there will be a definite electoral price for Trump’s dramatic, infamous flip-flopping (on abortion, taxes, trade, guns).\n\nLaw of Unintended Consequences\n\nSo, I present this great irony: marginally literate, Obama-hating pitchforkers are mobbing together to make a long-shot bet — that trashing GOP candidates polling best against Clinton or Sanders (like Rubio or Kasich) will liberate them from anti-worker, pro-outsourcing dinosaurs they help elect. Thus, backward Tea Party types today push a disrupter who’s destroying GOP power bases on the ludicrous chance things will “just turn out right in the end.” If Trump were a Democratic plant, could he any better obliterate the entire Republican Party and brand? In short, rightwing outrage, by grinding away at sacrosanct rightwing foundations, will produce mayhem that advances Democratic chances. The longer Trump lasts, the greater the divisions.\n\nTrumpery, the best con job ever on the blinkered right, looms as the best lever to reverse Senate control, even cost GOP House Seats. That’s why that snake, Senator Mitch McConnell, just insisted that elected Republicans would “drop [nominee] Trump like a hot rock.” McConnell is not alone and Christie’s Trump endorsement is getter slammed. Even against the vulnerable Hillary, Trump looks to divide the party of Bush-Cheney and produce a Goldwater-like fiasco. Thus, Republicans will have an utterly contradictory, two flank battleground: they will viciously attack the Democratic nominee while somehow distancing themselves from Trump the loose cannon, assaulting both disdained Democrats and Republicans alike? That way lies GOP mayhem — and about time, too.\n\n3 Stages, New Progressive Era\n\nTo kickstart a generation-long Progressive Era, three things must happen. The GOP hegemony (over state houses, Congress, and the judiciary) must be permanently splintered, its core contradictions splattered, its national leadership humiliated. Two, we need a new crossover coalition (as with the Sanders movement) among white voters victimized by job-outsourcing and crony capitalism with millions of minorities shut out from jobs, training and housing options. 3) sufficient electoral disruption so that a generation of progressive voices are motivated to run for office, propose bold solutions, and push for systemic reform promised in ’08. Now we’re talking change, not theatrics — and yes, we must transcend obsessions with the bizarre, personality-addicted, presidential circuses.\n\nThis week, that means renewing support for Sanders so he maximizes his challenge to Hillary’s re-found media “inevitability.” Simply nominating Sanders triggers a national consciousness-raising campaign that will make his agenda for social democracy palatable. Because Sanders will not stoop to gutter politics, and his career is invulnerable to rightwing cheap shots, Sanders offers more constituent crossover leverage and fewer vulnerabilities than Clinton.\n\nSo, go for it, Trumpsters: eviscerate the Republican brand, humiliate national leadership and shred the ideological folly that makes the right such lock-step goons. Then see what happens when a majority of rational adults ultimately reject an undisciplined, dangerous narcissist who indulges his lowest, gut instincts. Best of all, Trump vs. Sanders dramatizes all the key differences between a rank amateur and crass opportunist playing a dangerous game vs. a genuine, honorable movement leader on the brink of what could define the Second Progressive Era.",
  "latent_15785": "EmbracePace is back again, for the third straight year, creating an updated NBA 2K17 offseason roster for PlayStation 4 fans, which includes the 2017 rookies that were just drafted and much more.\n\nFILE NAME: 2017 Offseason w/All Rookies\n\nPSN ID: EmbraceThePace\n\nFull details can be seen in his OS Forum thread.\n\nAll New Draft Picks Included\n\nEver since September of last year, I’ve been hard at work creating loads of NBA draft prospects in order to create the most realistic draft classes possible. Hundreds of hours of research and film study went into making these prospects look and play the same way they do in real life. As always, those same creations will be featured in this roster. I’m hopeful that every player that hears his name called will be on their respective teams when this roster drops. If I have not created a player that gets drafted, they will be added in very, very shortly after the initial release. If there is not enough space on a team’s 15-man roster to add a 2nd round pick, he will be placed in the free agent pool until he is officially signed. Also, because I have over 80 players in my 2017 draft class, that means there will be at least 20 undrafted free agents included in the free agent pool!\n\nBrand New Players\n\nNot only will all the 2017 draft picks and several undrafted free agents be included in this roster, but several other new players will be included as well! These players include: Draft & Stash prospects, G-League prospects, Summer League invites, etc.\n\nUpdated Ages/Years Pro\n\nI have gone in and updated every single player’s age and service time to replicate the 2017-2018 season. All players (including free agents) are now 1 year older and all have 1 more year of experience under their belt.\n\nUpdated Contracts\n\nAll of the current NBA players now have their contracts fully updated to reflect the 2017-2018 season. I have also given all of this year’s new draftees contracts that match the NBA’s rookie scale. Before I go on, let me quickly explain how I handled upcoming free agents. Because 2K requires that no less than 13 players be on a roster, it is impossible to release all upcoming free agents into the F/A pool, so when this roster releases, most upcoming free agents will still be on their 16-17 team’s roster. I’ve also given some of the bigger name players projected contracts. I chose to handle free agents this way in an effort to make the roster more playable right away. If you plan on starting a multi-year MyLEAGUE with this roster, I recommend waiting until mid-July when most of the big name free agents have signed their new deals.\n\nFrequent File Updates\n\nOne of the main things I’ve focused on with my draft classes and rosters the past 3 years has been keeping them as updated as possible. As soon as I noticed a player was traded, had declared for the draft, signed a new contract or even just changed up his hairstyle, I made sure I updated it as quickly as possible. That habit will continue this summer. I’ll be keeping tabs on all of the latest player movement, contract signings, number changes, etc. all throughout the offseason and making sure the file stays updated.",
  "latent_15925": "BTC-E Claim Illegal Seizure by US Law Enforcement, to Recover User Funds\n\nBTC-E, the oldest bitcoin exchange in the market which was seized by the US law enforcement in July due to the involvement of Alexander Vinnik, the founder of the exchange, in some of the largest bitcoin exchange hacks including the Mt. Gox and Bitcoinica incidents, is planning to recover its services and user funds by distributing BTE tokens to users.\n\nIn 2016, when Bitfinex was hit with a $70 million security breach, the exchange’s development team designed a solution in which users were able to claim their lost funds through the Bitfinex (BFX) tokens as time passed. In essence, users were given the right to claim their balances through company profits. Eventually, Bitfinex bought back all of the BFX tokens issued after the hack, restoring the stolen funds of users.\n\nAt the time, Bitfinex stated:\n\n“A combination of factors has led to this seminal moment for Bitfinex, including a dramatic uptick in equity conversions; record operating results in March; and, the decision to reduce our reserves in favor of this opportunity. We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point.”\n\nBTC-E is trying to pursue a similar plan to Bitfinex by issuing convertible BTE tokens. Users that have lost funds during the seizure of BTC-E’s hot wallets and domains will be allowed to reclaim their funds through BTE tokens as BTC-E resumes its services and generates a stable source of profit.\n\nOne important condition of the token-based user fund recovery system which BTC-E users must take into consideration is that like Bitfinex, BTC-E must be in operation and should be able to generate profits in order for the company to purchase back its BTE tokens like Bitfinex ultimately did. However, in July, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement NetworK (FinCEN) fined the BTC-E team with a $110 million penalty and before settling it, BTC-E will likely not be able to resume its operation. More importantly, the BTC-E.com domain and its servers are currently being handled by the US law enforcement.\n\nAt the time, Jamal El-Hindi, Acting Director for FinCEN, stated:\n\n“We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. anti-money laundering laws. This action should be a strong deterrent to anyone who thinks that they can facilitate ransomware, dark net drug sales, or conduct other illicit activity using encrypted virtual currency. Treasury’s FinCEN team and our law enforcement partners will work with foreign counterparts across the globe to appropriately oversee virtual currency exchangers and administrators who attempt to subvert U.S. law and avoid complying with U.S. AML safeguards.”\n\nDespite the announcement of the FinCEN, the BTC-E team announced on their social media platforms that the exchange will be back live within five to ten days. Almost immediately after the BTC-E team released their statement, their servers, domains and funds were seized by the US law enforcement.\n\nAs of current, the only logical and possible way for BTC-E to release BTE tokens and operate its exchange is by obtaining its servers, domains and funds from the US law enforcement. According to the BTC-E team’s statement released on the BitcoinTalk forum, the company has recovered 55 percent of the funds and plans to sue the US FinCEN to recover the rest of its funds. Another statement released August 14 stated, “For each currency, a recalculation will be made taking into account the currently available assets. Currently 55 percent of funds are available, so 55 percent will remain in currency, and 45 percent will be converted to a specific currency token.”\n\nBTC-E has already made false promises to its users, clients and investors. It claimed to recover its platform within five to ten days since its closure and yet, nearly a month after the incident, the exchange is far from being in operation.",
  "latent_16009": "[+]Enlarge Up In The Air Researchers measured higher-than-expected levels of organophosphate esters—compounds used as flame retardants—at five sites around the Great Lakes. The sites are part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. Eagle Harbor, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Sturgeon Point are remote sites in the network. Credit: Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett.\n\nManufacturers have used organophosphate esters for more than 40 years as flame retardants in items such as upholstered furniture, electronics, and plastics. The chemicals’ use has increased over the past decade as manufacturers have phased out brominated flame retardants due to environmental and human health concerns. A new study measures organophosphate flame retardants in outdoor air at levels 100 to 1,000 times higher than the brominated flame retardants they are replacing (Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2013, DOI: 10.1021/ez400034n). The study suggests that organophosphate esters, which also have raised health concerns, are more persistent and get transported more easily in the environment than once thought.\n\nIn 2004, manufacturers volunteered to find alternatives to flame retardants known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), following two decades of research linking them to neurological damage and endocrine disruption. Manufacturers replaced them in part with a range of organophosphate esters. Cell-based studies have suggested that some of these compounds could be carcinogenic (Science 1978, DOI: 10.1126/science.347576) and neurotoxic (Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2011, DOI: 10.1016/j.taap.2011.01.005). Nevertheless, studies in the 1980s concluded that most of these compounds hydrolyze easily, so researchers thought they would break down in the environment and not pose much harm.\n\nHowever, scientists started to pay more attention to organophosphate flame retardants about five years ago after researchers found the compounds in indoor dust and human blood and milk. Because the compounds appeared to travel readily in indoor environments, “we concluded that we needed a comprehensive look at organophosphate flame retardants in outdoor air,” says Amina Salamova, an environmental chemist at Indiana University, Bloomington. “That’s the main pathway for compounds to move through ecosystems.”\n\nSalamova and her colleagues analyzed air samples from five sites in the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN), a project to monitor air quality in the Great Lakes region. The scientists collected samples for 24 hours every 12 days from March to December 2012. They analyzed the particulates in the samples with electron impact gas chromatographic mass spectrometry, looking for 12 organophosphate flame retardants.\n\nThe concentrations for the 12 compounds ranged from 120 to 2,100 pg per m3. Those levels were 100 to 1,000 times higher than PBDE levels in the region measured through IADN. “In fact, these organophosphate levels are higher than any historic levels of PBDEs measured during their active production and use,” Salamova says.\n\nAlthough the remote sites had lower concentrations of organophosphate esters than the urban sites, the levels were not as low as expected. “Organophosphate esters are supposed to have a half-life of a day or more,” says Rainer Lohmann, a geochemist at the University of Rhode Island. “Therefore you expect to see a strong decrease in concentration as you move away from large urban sources.” More studies are needed to explain why the compounds are more persistent in the environment than earlier thought, he says.",

The library was later rebuilt with donations coming from around the world.\n\nPHOTO: AP Photo, Geert Vanden Wijngaert In this picture taken on Monday, Jan. 6, 2014, the interior of the Leuven University Library in Leuven, Belgium. The German invading forces set the heart of Leuven alight during the early days of World War I, paying special attention to the gem of learning and history, the university library. The library was later rebuilt with donations coming from around the world.\n\nLEUVEN, Belgium – A century after German forces burned down the Leuven University library, Marie Legrand still has visions of the horrid scene. Even the scent of smoke she smelled as a 3-year-old stings in her mind to this day.\n\n“When I close my eyes like I do now, I see the whole city in front of me, and the flames,” she told The Associated Press at her home, fanning invisible flames with her frail hands.\n\n“The old Leuven, the old town, the old history. In short: History itself all went up in flames,” she said of the fire that invading German forces started on Aug. 25, 1914, targeting the university library in the heart of the Belgian town east of Brussels.\n\nThe First World War had started weeks earlier and Belgium had slowed Germany’s march on France much more than expected. German irritation turned to anger, then to atrocities.\n\nThe destruction of the university library served little strategic purpose beyond ruining what people held dear — a practice that continues to thrive today, especially in the Middle East and Africa, where roaming rebels and defiant dictators are robbing the world of some of the highlights of human history.\n\n“The strategy is destroying the identity of a community,” said Leuven University archivist Mark Derez.\n\nThe torching of the Leuven University library drew international condemnation and was widely used in propaganda to purport that Germany lacked any civilized standards. Still, as shocking as it was a century ago, its example appears to have done nothing to check the practice of cultural vandalism during wartime.\n\n“It is getting worse,” said Joris Kila, a heritage protection expert. “And strangely enough, the worse it gets, the less money and determination there is to do something about it.”\n\nThe 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict makes it mandatory for signatory nations to ensure that such destruction does not happen. But many of today’s conflicts rage in states with weak central governments and rebel forces that answer only to themselves.\n\nIn March 2001, the Taliban in Afghanistan dynamited the huge Bamiyan Buddhas, deeming them idolatrous and anti-Muslim. It was one of the regime’s most widely condemned acts.\n\nTwo years ago, Muslim extremists destroyed key parts of the heritage of the ancient Malian city of Timbuktu, razing tombs and burning ancient documents, saying they acted on divine orders. Similar actions have happened in Somalia and continue in Iraq, where the Islamic State group is destroying the holy shrines of other religions.\n\n“You try to demoralize a local population. It is an attack on the identity of the population. It is an attack on the collective memory,” Kila said.\n\nIn today’s Leuven, the rebuilt university library displays a few of the charred books, sealed in glass cases and “serving as a kind of evidence for the German burning of the library,” Derez said.\n\nThe printed letters that once combined into sentences and books of wisdom are now blackened beyond recognition, gone at the edges, curled up at the centre.\n\nAmong the library’s 300,000 lost books and manuscripts was the 16th century “Atlas of the human anatomy” by Andreas Vesalius, the founding father of that branch of science, a gift to the university from Emperor Charles V.\n\nDerez said much evidence suggests that German forces wilfully destroyed the library to demoralize the people of Leuven, at the time a town of 42,500. The fires ultimately razed 1,081 of its 8,920 buildings.\n\n“That kind of terror has something to do with reducing, assuring a minimum of civilian resistance during the invasion and a maximum of civilian co-operation during the occupation,” he said.\n\nIt certainly worked on Legrand.\n\n“Just talking about ‘Germans’ scared the kids,” she said. To this day, at 103 years of age, Legrand said that “some residue of worry always remains.”\n\nWhen someone says they are German, it still gives her a small shock, she said.\n\n“It should not be. But that’s how it is,” Legrand said.\n\nIf it leaves such an impression a century later, it is hardly surprising that demolishing monuments and cultural venues remains such a popular strategy. Even though individuals may run the risk of being prosecuted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for such crimes, this rarely happens, Kila said.\n\n“They all make promises, but at the end nobody puts their money where their mouth is by going out to arrest these people,” he said.\n\nAP photographer Virginia Mayo and videographer Mark Carlson in Leuven contributed to this report.",

  "latent_16246": "Every time someone mentions Cultural Appropriation when it comes to Video Games, I roll my eyes so hard that they might just roll right out of my skull. Haven’t these people heard of multicultural societies? Someone’s culture is not owned or copyrighted by a single group or persons. And it not like the human race has cultural borders, as a whole, every single culture on earth has conquered, assimilated, remixed, borrowed, and improved upon ideas between thousands of different groups of people for thousands of years. I grew up in South Africa, a country with over eleven official languages, and I was equally influenced by many other cultures. Including the indigenous African cultures, Europian, and American cultures. The general thought process that: “This is ours and you can’t do this because you’ll take it from us.” is a really retarded notion to me. Most examples of Cultural Appropriation we have been shown in Video Games are more akin to “assimilation” or “diffusion”. Taking ideas from other cultures and adapting them into your video game is generally healthy, and a sign of an open-mindedness by the developers. It is not a process that should be vilified. The alternative to risking some “assimilation” or “diffusion” in video games seem to be “everyone stays in their own box and does not step outside of it” if you do you will most certainly be killing all creativity found in Video Games today. I also think using other cultures in a video game can help enrich and inform gamers. Prime example being the Assasins Creed franchise, a franchise that actually piqued my interest when it came to European cultures and their history. Rather than simply defining myself narrowly as being a white male gamer.\n\nI like to think of myself as a human being first and foremost. That irrespective of my race, sex, beliefs or culture, we are at the core human beings after all. And avoiding other cultures because according to some we aren’t allowed to partake or enjoy certain aspects of a culture because we weren’t born into that cultural. And does the above not sound awfully like segregation based on race and culture? The fact that your culture originated something doesn’t give you eternal right to declare it off limits to Video Game developers and people who enjoy said video games. It also does not magically allow you to tell people whether or not we are allowed to enjoy it or not. And developers should be allowed free reign when it comes to designing and creating video games. Your “feelings” and political agendas should not be part of any of the creative processes in Video Games….",
  "latent_16263": "On September 26th, This American Life and Propublica revealed they had obtained 46 hours of secret tapes recorded inside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by then-examiner Carmen Segarra. The tapes lay bare the NY Fed showing extreme deference to Goldman Sachs, even as they investigate a “shady” Goldman deal. The tapes also reveal Segarra’s attempts to document the lack of a conflict of interest policy at Goldman, while her fellow employees insist she tone the report down.\n\nSegarra was ultimately fired by the NY Fed. She alleges that her firing was retaliation for refusing to soften her Goldman report. For their part, the New York Fed has maintained that the allegations by Ms. Segarra are inaccurate, and they note that Ms. Segarra lost her initial court case alleging wrongful termination (Ms. Segarra is appealing the decision).\n\nBut even if we ignore the facts surrounding Ms. Segarra’s termination, no one would dispute that the tapes humiliate the Fed, and fortify the public’s already dim view of the backbone of financial regulators.\n\nIn the wake of this bombshell story – and in the face of the Fed’s continued intransigence – it’s important to contextualize Ms. Segarra’s story and remind the public of the Fed’s long history of ignoring and abetting Wall Street failure. Here’s a brief look back.\n\nSecretly propping up the banks\n\nPerhaps the most egregious example of the Federal Reserve pursuing its mission of maintaining the “safety and soundness of the banking system” at any cost is their secret aid deployed in the heat of the financial crisis. From 2007–2010, the Fed provided loans and other liquidity programs not just to failing U.S. banks, but also to foreign-owned banks, and non-financial firms like Caterpillar and Toyota.\n\nThe Fed’s emergency assistance to troubled institutions peaked on December 5th, 2008, at $1.2 trillion\n\nThese programs were separate from the $700 billion TARP bailout, and its beneficiaries were undisclosed to Congress at the time. We only know the full details of these programs because of the diligence of the late Mark Pittman, and the rest of the Bloomberg News team.\n\nThe Fed fought hard to keep secret just how unstable hundreds of firms were during the worst parts of the financial crisis. When Bloomberg News filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to find out which firms the Fed was loaning money to through these programs, the Fed refused to disclose it. They argued most relevant documents were at the NY Fed, who they alleged wasn’t subject to FOIA law. So Bloomberg LP sued, prevailed in court, and carefully compiled their findings in 2011, including a stunning visualization.\n\nScreenshot of Bloomberg’s visualization of the The Fed’s Secret Liquidity Lifelines\n\nThe Fed’s secrecy during the crisis greatly benefited the biggest banks, enabling them to lie about their financial condition. As Bob Ivry, Bradley Keoun and Phil Kuntz noted for Bloomberg:\n\n“On Nov. 26, 2008, then-Bank of America (BAC) Corp. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis wrote to shareholders that he headed “one of the strongest and most stable major banks in the world.” He didn’t say that his Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm owed the central bank $86 billion that day.”\n\nWhat’s more, former Democratic Senator Ted Kauffman told Bloomberg that if Congress had known the extent of the help the Fed was providing, “he would have been able to line up more support for breaking up the biggest banks.”\n\nIgnoring Market Manipulation\n\nThe Fed’s approach to covering for banks is not always as overt as providing them with quick cash in times of crisis. Sometimes, the Fed just looks the other way when suspicious activity occurs.\n\nAs Shahien Nasiripour reported for FT, the New York Fed knew banks may be manipulating the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as early as 2008. Despite warnings from multiple employees at the time, the NY Fed did not act beyond then president Tim Geithner sending a milquetoast set of recommendations to Bank of England Governor Mervyn King.\n\nAnd as former Inspector General for the TARP program Neal Barofsky noted, Geithner effectively co-signed the LIBOR rigging by using the faulty rates in the Fed’s AIG bailout:\n\nSweeping the Foreclosure Crisis Under the Rug\n\nImage by Christopher Sessums, Creative Commons.\n\nIn order to answer the question “what went wrong during the foreclosure crisis?” the Fed undertook an exercise in 2011 with another banking regulator, the Office of the Comptroller for the Currency (OCC), called the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR). The review was also meant to find out which foreclosures from 2009–2010 had been fraudulent. Instead, the review became just another exercise in sweeping bank secrets under the rug.\n\nFlawed from the start, banks were allowed to hire their own consultants to conduct the reviews. Many, including Francine McKenna, highlighted the conflicts of interest inherent in this arrangement:\n\n“Allowing the banks to choose their own judge, jury, and jailer presents almost untenable conflicts of interest. All of the consulting firms that were initially being considered to do the work serve the banks already. The banks, and their mortgage servicing operations, are existing or prospective clients.”\n\nWhat’s worse, instead of seeing the process through to the end, the review was abruptly ended in 2013 with a $8.5 billion settlement. MSNBC’s All in With Chris dubbed it “a nationwide crimescene.”\n\nThe Fed and the OCC tried to downplay the harm to borrowers, with the OCC claiming that mortgage servicers made errors only 4.2% of the time. But news reports found those numbers to be bogus — Wells Fargo, for example, had up to an 80% error rate in foreclosure files reviewed. And an investigation into the review by the Government Accountability Office found a slew of problems with the review, including the fact that the 4.2% error rate was essentially made up. As I wrote for The Nation:\n\n“The OCC and the Fed allowed the banks’ captured consultants to define what constituted “harm” to the borrower — meaning that not only could findings of harm be minimized, but also that harm rates across the banks could never be aggregated to give a full picture of wrongdoing. Thus, the 4.2 percent error rate the OCC reported was compiled by mashing together incompatible data points, creating a statistic with no basis in reality.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, in the final settlement with wronged borrowers, the payout amounts to homeowners who lost their home at foreclosure were grossly inadequate: if you were granted a loan modification by your bank, but they foreclosed on you anyway, you got $500.\n\nIf you you did nothing wrong and were not in default, but were illegally foreclosed on anyway, you got a paltry $5,000 (but not your home back).\n\nTo demonstrate the extent of their inadequacy, in 2013 I created the tumblr What You Can Buy For Having Your House Stolen.",

Hit 32 (8d6 + 4) slashing damage.\n\n1\n\nAurumvorax\n\nDespite being only the size of a large badger, the aurumvorax, or golden gorger, is an incredibly dangerous creature. The animal is covered with coarse golden hair and has small silver eyes with golden pupils. It has eight powerful legs that end in 3-inch-long copper claws. The aurumvorax’s shoulders are massively muscled while its heavy jaw is full of coppery teeth. The creature weighs over 500 pounds. This incredible density provides the animal with much of its natural protection. This, combined with its speed, power, and sheer viciousness, makes it one of the most dangerous species yet known.\n\nThe aurumvorax makes its solitary home in light forests, hills, and at the timberline on mountainsides. An aurumvorax chooses a likely spot and then uses its powerfully clawed legs to create a burrow, sometimes into solid rock. Due to their unusual dietary needs, aurumvoraces make their lairs in spots that either contain rich veins of gold ore or are very near to an area where gold is readily available.\n\nThe aurumvorax is a solitary creature which jealously guards its territory, even from others of its kind. The only time adult aurumvoraces willingly meet is during mating season, which occurs approximately every eight years. The pair will stay together for a week or two before the male returns to his territory and the female prepares for the birth of her kits. A litter of 3 to 8 kits is born four months after mating. For the first two weeks of life, the kits are blind and hairless. They must be fed both meat and precious ores, including gold, in order to survive. It is unusual for more than two of the strongest kits to survive. If a kit is found and adopted before its eyes are open, it can be tamed and trained. Dwarves tend to dislike aurumvoraces, though some communities have been known to raise one or more of the beasts for use in sniffing out veins of ore.",
  "latent_16457": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Two off-duty Florida law-enforcement officers fatally shot an armed, naked woman who confronted them at a social gathering Saturday, authorities said.\n\nThe shooting occurred at about 1:15 p.m. Saturday in Hernando County, north of Tampa. The county sheriff's office said in a news release that the men were approached by an \"armed, naked and irrational female.\" The news release does not identify the weapon, but it says \"one or both of the law enforcement officers fired their weapons, striking the female.\" She died at the scene.\n\nBoth officers have been placed on administrative leave as the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigates the shooting in the Spring Hill community.\n\nAuthorities have identified the officers as Hernando County sheriff's Detective Rocky Howard and Tampa police officer William Mechler, who have served six and four years, respectively. Tampa police say Mechler was \"off duty and acting in the capacity of a private citizen.\"\n\nLt. Cinda Moore, a spokeswoman for the Hernando sheriff's office, said in an email late Saturday that she could not immediately identify the woman or disclose the weapon she was carrying. She said she also could not comment on what the woman specifically said or did or whether she was told to drop the weapon, explaining that the FDLE is leading the investigation.\n\nThe Hernando County sheriff's office does permit the carrying of service weapons when off-duty, she said.\n\nThe Tampa-area shooting comes two weeks after a naked, unarmed University of South Alabama freshman was fatally shot by a campus police officer after going to the police station there and pounding on the glass. The shooting has led to protests by students.\n\nPolice said 18-year-old Gil Collar had taken LSD and acted aggressively when an officer came outside carrying a gun. The officer repeatedly backed away from the student before firing. An attorney for the student's family says Collar never touched the officer and the fatal shooting never should have happened. Authorities have said a grand jury will review that shooting to determine whether charges should be filed.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Norman Gomlak contributed to this article from Atlanta",
  "latent_16476": "Two drivers. GPS tracking. Temperature sensors.\n\nShipping the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction from New York to the Portland Art Museum requires a few precautions.\n\nThe museum is on highest alert for the next three months as it exhibits Francis Bacon's recording-breaking triptych, \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud.\" The three paintings made world headlines last month when they sold in New York for $142.4 million.\n\nFrancis Bacon's \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\"\n\nPortland Art Museum\n\n1219 S.W. Park Ave.\n\nHours: Closed Monday. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tues, Wed, Sat;\n\n10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thurs-Fri; 12-5 p.m. Sun\n\nAdmission: $15; discounts for seniors/students; free admission fourth Friday of every month\n\nThe work, bought by an anonymous collector who lives on the West Coast, goes on view Saturday, Dec. 21 through March 30. While visitors enjoy it – keeping a proscribed 20 inches away – round-the-clock security will keep it safe. Cameras and guards will be on duty 24 hours a day. The museum will add security if larger-than-expected crowds show up.\n\nDespite intense interest in the art world, only one PAM staffer knows the owner's identity. And Bruce Guenther, chief curator, isn't talking. From Portland, the piece goes into to the owner's private collection.\n\nThe Portland Art Museum is familiar with handling irreplaceable works. It has previously shown single works by Rembrandt, Titian and Raphael under its \"Masterworks/Portland\" series.\n\nNo one has seen \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\" since 1999. Each panel has a warm, egg-yolk yellow background, and a green, textured foreground. In each, Freud sits on a chair inside a cage or room, right leg crossed over his left knee.\n\nTwo drivers transported the panels across the country, ensuring the truck was always on the move and never left alone. The truck had extra suspension and was climate controlled at 70 degrees and 45 percent humidity, the same as the gallery it will sit in.\n\nThe paintings traveled in three separate crates, each marked \"PROTECT FROM ALL ELEMENTS.\" Sensors attached to the crates would signal excessive movement or temperature changes. GPS tracked the truck's movement, in case it went off course.\n\nThe truck arrived at noon Friday, and the crates were immediately unloaded and moved into a secure space, says Donald Urquhart, who manages the museum's collections. Then, scrutinizers went to work. They examined every centimeter of the paintings, photographing and noting any nicks or scratches, like a rental car.\n\nJust before 3 p.m. Friday, two men wheeled the first two panels on a dolly down a ramp to the underground hallway that serves as an entrance to the museum's modern and contemporary galleries. Guenther, who chose \"dried burgundy\" for the color of the backdrop, watched the panels approach with a dozen other museum staffers. Within minutes, the barehanded men had measured, drilled and lifted the middle panel into place. They used a carpenter's level to adjust it.\n\nThe second panel was trickier. After they hung it, it sat 1/4-inch too high, so they adjusted the wall bracket and lowered it to the correct height.\n\nSafely installed, the yellow background glowed while Freud's body conveyed movement and impatience.\n\n\"I'm thrilled,\" Guenther said as the men finished hanging the last panel. \"This is going to be so wonderful for the city. This is a town that loves figurative art.\"\n\nGuenther didn't twist arms to land the Bacon triptych, he says. He called the owner soon after the auction, Nov. 11. \"This is an interesting notion,\" the owner said, according to Guenther. \"Why do you think we'd want to do that?\"\n\n\"That was an open door,\" Guenther said.",

Than just turn on your speakers and give me a click.\n\nThe name translates as \"St Mary's Church in the hollow of the white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St Tysilio of the red cave\".\n\nOriginally, the town was named Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, meaning \"The Mary church by the pool near the white hazels\". The village was renamed at the beginning of the 1850s when the railway was built between Chester and Holyhead. Of interest is the \"St Tysilio\" part of the name, which refers to the church of St Tysilio's, in Menai Bridge. This was once a chapel of ease belonging to St Mary�s church\n\nA local committee was formed to try and encourage trains, travellers and 19th Century tourists to stop at the village in order to help develop the village as a commercial and tourist centre. It is believed the name was conceived by a cobbler, or a tailor, depending upon what story you hear, from Menai Bridge. Little did they know at the time that they had invented one of the most successful tourist promotional plans of all time. Today the village is signposted as Llanfairpwllgwyngyll and is known by locals as Llanfairpwll or Llanfair. It is also known as Llanfair PG to differentiate it from other Welsh \"Llanfair\" villages. So many names for just the one place! Such a large name for such a tiny place!\n\nLocated off the north-west coast of mainland Wales, close by to the beautiful Snowdonia area, the Menai Strait separates the Isle of Anglesey from mainland Wales. Spanning the Menai Strait are two bridges, the Menai Bridge (Pont Grog y Borth), designed by Thomas Telford was completed in 1826 and the Britannia Bridge (Pont Britannia). The original Brittania Bridge, built by Robert Stephenson, opened in 1850 and was destroyed by fire in 1970. The Brittania bridge was rebuilt as a two-tier truss arch bridge and re-opened in 1972. Anglesey was known as Mam Cymru (\"Mother of Wales\") during the middle ages because its fertile fields formed the breadbasket for the north of Wales.",

  "latent_17118": "Typefaces are a funny thing: to the untrained eye, they can be difficult to tell apart, yet they can make a world of difference in the design and usability of a product. Apple recently swapped Helvetica for Helvetica Neue in iOS and Lucida Grande for Helvetica Neue in OS X Yosemite — but for the Apple Watch, it went a little deeper.\n\nThe Watch features a new typeface that Apple designed in-house \"to maximize legibility,\" it says — a noble and important goal when you're dealing with a particularly small display. Interestingly, Google's Roboto was designed with some of the same goals in mind when it rolled out with Android 4.0 almost three years ago.\n\nI almost immediately noticed similarities to Roboto when Apple showed the Watch on stage today, which makes sense: a simple, light, sans serif font lends itself to maximum legibility. With these looping GIFs comparing the Apple Watch against a theoretical version that uses Roboto, you can get a better sense of where these two modern font sets diverge and intersect.

  "latent_17219": "Two groups that say fear of airport security body scanners forces some would-be fliers to risk driving instead have challenged their use by the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nFiling suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Monday, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and the Rutherford Institute said that “because car travel is much riskier than air travel, the net result could be an ­increase in overall travel fatalities.”\n\nThe lawsuit stops short of calling for removal of all 789 full-body scanners now in use in 156 airports but demands that the TSA take into account the higher risk of driving for those too frightened to endure the machines. The TSA published a new rule for the use of full-body scanners last month.\n\n“Yes, we do want these machines ultimately out,” said Marc Scribner, a research fellow at the CEI. “We don’t believe they are cost-effective. We could put these security funds to much better use.”\n\nThe lawsuit comes at a time when the TSA thought it had resolved controversy over the use of airport body scanners.\n\nThe matter rose to a cause celebre, complete with Capitol Hill hearings at which members of Congress voiced outrage in 2010 when some people complained that a new generation of scanners revealed too much of their physical appearance. Though nearly two-thirds of American’s polled accepted their use, those who weren’t were vocal with their concern.\n\n[Nearly two-thirds of Americans support full-body scanners at airports]\n\nThe last of those revealing machines was removed three years ago, and the current machines use a stick figure to depict the location of anything a passenger might be carrying that needs TSA attention.\n\nThe TSA declined to comment Monday, because of the pending litigation.\n\nThere is scant research to support the central contention of the CEI lawsuit.\n\nScribner cited a Cornell University study published in 2007 — a year before body scanners were introduced at airports — that suggested that “substitution of driving for flying by travelers seeking to avoid security inconvenience likely led to over 100 road fatalities.”\n\nScribner said that TSA should be required to examine the risk that driving poses vs. flying for those who fear body scanners.\n\n“If there is a possibility that people are dying on the roads because they are deterred from flying, we believe that is an important factor that the agency has to consider,” he said. “We would like the agency to have to go back to do the proper analysis.”\n\n[TSA to pull revealing scanners from airports]\n\nScribner said that the more than 1 percent of passengers who opt for a TSA pat-down rather than a trip through the scanner is an indication that some people remain leery of the machines.\n\n“When John Mica was chairman of the [House Transportation Committee], he said on the record that if he could reveal the failure rate of these machines, the American public would be outraged,” Scribner said. “Unfortunately, the research and audits that have been done on these machines are made classified.”\n\nScribner wants the TSA to revert to exclusive use of walk-through metal detectors now still in use at airports.\n\n“We believe that most of what the TSA does is security theater,” he said.",
  "latent_17261": "Behold, the classic, “Insta-Girlfriend,” routine. Remember routines? Gambits? God I’m old. Well it’s guaranteed to make women giggle, ensuring acquiescence and immediate promise of breasts, nipples and moistened lips! Full money back guarantee. ***For entertainment purposes only***\n\nIt’s simple, fun, and effective. Terribly wonderful when employed by a fully developed Jedi. Best at sexually charged parties.\n\nWhen your girl is hooked, or even as an opener, inform her that she, the lucky lady, is now your woman.\n\n“You’re my new girlfriend.”\n\nYou ask her to change her mental frame, and pretend she’s your woman. If she plays along, she essentially gives you permission to escalate flirtation. Why would she reject her boyfriend’s affections? That would cause a breakup. So if either of you mess up, you get dumped. And it’s impossible to be needy by showing too much interest, because she’s your girlfriend.\n\nThe old champions preferred the line, “You’re my new girlfriend, for the next five minutes,” which was intended to be cocky, because you gasp…can’t show too much interest! I’ve tried it, and it’s alright. But if I want her to be my gf, why for five minutes? How about…for as long as it lasts? It’s lame to put a time limit on your relationship, even if it’s virtual. Like you have something better to do in the bar than show off your hot new girlfriend.\n\nDear Newbie, look, before you spazz and call me a jerk…realize this is ME, doing what I like to do. If you want to be James Bond, go ahead. Sometimes I feel like being Stiffler. And I’m an introverted, gamer, writer, and pickup artist. Pickup allows you to experiment with your identity. So sometimes I want to be a funny douchebag, and sometimes a Shiraz drinking poet. Be unpredictable, a spectacle, and an inspiration.\n\n“Let’s get married.” (Followed by a kiss. You can have a friend marry you.)\n\n“You’re my woman now.”\n\n“You’re my new wife. Provide me with strong babies.” (This is where she laughs and hits my arm, saying something like, “You’re crazy,” or, “You’re weird.” I don’t care. I’m amusing myself, and that’s attractive.)\n\nWith this roleplay, immediately ramp up the physical game. Put your arm around her shoulder, pull her onto your lap, pull her head towards you and scratch her scalp or kiss her cheek. Sit her in front of you and spoon her or hug her while standing with your bellies touching. Act like she’s your girlfriend and you’re in love. She said it’s ok. That’s what you do with your woman. You hold hands and kiss and caress in public.\n\nMost girls if they’re even a little attracted will say, “Ok, sure,” and play along. If she’s down, you basically have a free pass to escalate right to making out and sex. “You’re my gf now. We need to kiss.”\n\nYou can also use this to disarm her friends. With your arm around her, looking at her friends, “We’re married, right honey?” This way if they get lame and try to pull her away you can yell, “What the fuck are you doing to my wife! She’s my wife!” Then pull her back to you. This should be funny. But it’s better than just having a tug of war. Basically you are claiming ownership over your woman, and she’s complicit in the roleplay. Who wants to destroy a marriage? “I understand you guys are her friends, but you’re going to have to learn to love me too. She’s my wife!” Though, she may choose to break up with you if she prefers her friends. Or you could have a seperation. But it’s preferable to stay together.\n\nThe good thing about a breakup is the makeup sex, which you haven’t had yet. So your first bang could be makeup sex.\n\nBe creative. Girls like creativity. Be dominant. Don’t ask, tell. Full champ.\n\nIt also guards against other players who shark in on your woman. “Hey, that’s my girlfriend!” If the guy is experienced and tries to test this by asking her if it’s true, she should say yes and continue the roleplay. Well, hopefully. You can destroy him by pulling a makeout right in front of him. Or just take her hand and walk her away. She’s your girlfriend. Remind her of that! Bitch better show respect to her Daddy. (Sometimes I raise my pimp hand in threat and say, “Pappa don’t like yo attitude woman!” This should cause submission and joyous apology. Women in a role-play can’t help but submit to her alpha pimp. It makes them horny.)\n\n***Note. If the pretend pimp/woman beater jokes make you angry, it’s because you take yourself too seriously. It’s a playful game, and if you pull it off properly, women will laugh. Breaking rapport shows abundance and a carefree, socially free vibe. It also gives women a chance to reject you, which is good. If they take your sexist comments and laugh, you can be sure they don’t take themselves too seriously either.***\n\nYou can even create drama by having multiple girlfriends/wives in the bar.\n\nYou can keep the tension high by threatening to dump her. “I love you baby, but if you fuck this up, I’ll dump your ass for Cindy Lou Lou. At least she can cook! And she looooves giving bj’s.”\n\nMake her do things for you. “You’re my wife, scratch my back! Massage my neck. What kind of wife are you!? I only hit you because I love you darling. Pass the Earl Grey.”\n\nIt’s seriously the easiest and most effective roleplay around. It’s an old classic that I thought I came up with, but I’ve read about other guys doing this as well. Have fun with it.\n\nAdd me on Twitter. I need more friends like you. Real friends. Not trolls. I’m so lonely.\n\n***My daygame book is receiving great reviews. Pick up your copy at Smashwords.***\n\n***I’m available for bootcamps and mentorships.

  "latent_17300": "The bombshells dropping on the Trump presidency are coming at a fast and furious pace right now. I’d like to focus on the latest one from the New York Times.\n\nMichael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Mr. Flynn of the inquiry, Mr. Trump made Mr. Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Mr. Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies. Mr. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Mr. Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Mr. Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported.\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention to this story all along, the first thing that should grab your attention is that Flynn told White House Counsel Don McGahn that he was under federal investigation on January 4th. That was not only a full two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, it was three weeks before Sally Yates told him that Flynn could be compromised because of his lies about meetings with the Russian ambassador. That puts some of his reaction to her in a whole different context.\n\nAs the NYT notes, that information didn’t stop Trump from making Flynn his national security advisor or doing anything about it when Yates shared her concerns. It wasn’t until some of this information became public that he fired Flynn. After that, the president might have obstructed justice by asking the former FBI director to stop his investigation of Flynn.\n\nDonald Trump isn’t known for being loyal to people who make him look bad. So the question all this raises is, “Why did the president go to such lengths to both hire and protect a man like Flynn?” Another bombshell from Reuters this morning might give us at least a clue about that.\n\nMichael Flynn and other advisers to Donald Trump’s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, current and former U.S. officials familiar with the exchanges told Reuters… Six of the previously undisclosed contacts described to Reuters were phone calls between Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, and Trump advisers, including Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, three current and former officials said. Conversations between Flynn and Kislyak accelerated after the Nov. 8 vote as the two discussed establishing a back channel for communication between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could bypass the U.S. national security bureaucracy, which both sides considered hostile to improved relations, four current U.S. officials said.\n\nThe conversations between Flynn and Kislyak were therefore about more than lifting the sanctions on Russia. They were about setting up a back channel of communication between Trump and Putin “that could bypass the U.S. national security bureaucracy.”\n\nIn case that sounds familiar, a couple of months ago the Washington Post reported that Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, held a secret meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian close to President Vladi­mir Putin “as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump.”\n\nKeri Geiger and Michael Riley followed up on that report with the news that Prince had been a regular advisor to the Trump team – particularly Michael Flynn.\n\nIn the very public, post-election parade of dignitaries, confidantes and job-seekers filing in and out of Donald Trump’s marquee Manhattan tower, Blackwater founder Erik Prince was largely out of sight. And yet Prince was very much a presence, providing advice to Trump’s inner circle, including his top national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, according to people familiar with his activities.\n\nThere could be more to the story of why Trump was so determined to place Flynn in a critical foreign policy position that didn’t require Senate confirmation, keep him there despite all the warnings, and then ask the FBI director to end his investigation. But the fact that Flynn was working with the Russian ambassador (during the time that country was hacking and leaking information about Trump’s opponent) in order to set up a back channel line of communication between Trump and Putin that would bypass this country’s national security bureaucracy goes a long way towards explaining it all.\n\nI’ll leave it to others who are better versed in spy craft to elaborate. But this all reads to me like Putin setting up the President of the United States to be a Russian asset. That is as serious as it gets.",
  "latent_17332": "guest post by Mike Stay\n\nPrograms are an expression of programmer intent. We want the computer to do something for us, so we need to tell it what to do. We make mistakes, though, so we want to be able to check somehow that the program will do what we want. The idea of semantics for a programming language is that we assign some meaning to programs in such a way that we can reason about the behavior of a program. There are two main approaches to this: denotational semantics and operational semantics. I’ll discuss both below, but the post will focus for the most part on operational semantics.\n\nThere’s a long history of using 2-categories and related structures for term rewriting and operational semantics, but Greg Meredith and I are particularly fond of an approach using multisorted Lawvere theories enriched over the category of reflexive directed graphs, which we call Gph. Such enriched Lawvere theories are equal in power to, for instance, Sassone and Sobociński’s reactive systems, but in my opinion they have a cleaner categorical presentation. We wrote a paper on them:\n\nHere I’ll just sketch the basic ideas.\n\nDenotational Semantics\n\nDenotational semantics works really well for functional programming languages. The actual process of computation is largely ignored in denotational semantics; it doesn’t matter how you compute the function, just what the function is. John Baez’s seminar eleven years ago explored Lambek and Scott’s approach to the denotational semantics of lambda calculus, and there was extensive discussion on this blog. Lambek and Scott constructed a cartesian closed category of types and α \\alpha - β \\beta - η \\eta -equivalence classes of terms with one free variable, and then assigned meaning to the types and terms with a cartesian closed functor into Set.\n\nDenotational semantics gets a lot harder once we move away from functional programming languages. Modern programs run on multiple computers at the same time and each computer has several cores. The computers are connected by networks that can mix up the order in which messages are received. A program may run perfectly by itself, but deadlock when you run it in parallel with another copy of itself. The notion of “composition” begins to change, too: we run programs in parallel with each other and let them interact by passing messages back and forth, not simply by feeding the output of one function into the input of another. All of this makes it hard to think of such programs as functions.\n\nOperational Semantics\n\nOperational semantics is the other end of the spectrum, concerned with the rules by which the state of a computer changes. Whereas denotational semantics is inspired by Church and the lambda calculus, operational semantics is inspired by Turing and his machines. All of computational complexity lives here (e.g. P = ? NP P \\stackrel{?}{=} NP ).\n\nTo talk about the operational semantics of a programming language, there are five things we need to define.\n\nFirst, we have to describe the layout of the state of the computer. For each kind of data that goes into a description of the state, we have a sort. If we’re using a programming language like lambda calculus, we have a sort for variables and a sort for terms, and the term is the entire state of the computer. If we’re using a Turing machine, there are more parts: the tape, the state transition table, the current state, and the position of the read/write head on the tape. If we’re using a modern language like JavaScript, the state is very complex: there are a couple of stacks, the heap, the lexical environment, the this binding, and more.\n\nSecond, we have to build up the state itself using term constructors. For example, in lambda calculus, we start with variables and use abstraction and application to build up a specific term.\n\nThird, we say what rearrangements of the state we’re going to ignore; this is called structural congruence. In lambda calculus, we say that two terms are the same if they only differ in the choice of bound variables. In pi calculus, it doesn’t matter in what order we list the processes that are all running at the same time.\n\nFourth, we give reduction rules describing how the state is allowed to change. In lambda calculus, the state only changes via β \\beta -reduction, substituting the argument of a function for the bound variable. In a Turing machine, each state leads to one of five others (change the bit to 0 or 1, then move left or right; or halt). In pi calculus, there may be more than one transition possible out of a particular state: if a process is listening on a channel and there are two messages, then either message may be processed first. Computational complexity theory is all about how many steps it takes to compute a result, so we do not have equations between sequences of rewrites.\n\nFinally, the reduction rules themselves may only apply in certain contexts; for example, in all modern programming languages based on the lambda calculus, no reductions happen under an abstraction. That is, even if a term t t reduces to t ′ t' , it is never the case that λ x . t \\lambda x.t reduces to λ x . t ′ \\lambda x.t' . The resulting normal form is called “weak head normal form”.\n\nHere’s an example from Boudol’s paper “The π \\pi -calculus in direct style.” There are two sorts: x x or z z for variables and L L or N N for terms. The first line, labeled “syntax,” defines four term constructors. There are equations for structural congruence, and there are two reduction rules followed by the contexts in which the rules apply:\n\nCategory theory\n\nWe’d like to formalize this using category theory. For our first attempt, we capture almost all of this information in a multisorted Gph-enriched Lawvere theory: we have a generating object for each sort, a generating morphism for each term constructor, an equation between morphisms encoding structural congruence, and an edge for each rewrite.\n\nWe interpret the theory in Gph. Sorts map to graphs, term constructors to graph homomorphisms, equations to equations, and rewrites map to things I call “graph transformations”, which are the obvious generalization of a natural transformation to the category of graphs: a graph transformation between two graph homomorphisms α : F ⇒ G \\alpha:F\\Rightarrow G assigns to each vertex v v an edge α v : Fv → Gv \\alpha_v:Fv \\to Gv . There’s nothing about a commuting square in the definition because it doesn’t even parse: we can’t compose edges to get a new edge.\n\nThis initial approach doesn’t quite work because of the way reduction contexts are usually presented. The reduction rules assume that we have a “global view” of the term being reduced, but the category theory insists on a “local view”. By “local” I mean that we can always whisker a reduction with a term constructor: if K K is an endomorphism on a graph, then given any edge e : v → v ′ e:v\\to v' , there’s necessarily an edge K e : K v → K v ′ . K e:K v \\to K v'. These two requirements conflict: to model reduction to weak head normal form, if we have a reduction t → t ′ , t \\to t', we don’t want a reduction λ x . t → λ x . t ′ . \\lambda x.t \\to \\lambda x.t'.\n\nOne solution is to introduce “context constructors”, unary morphisms for marking reduction contexts. These contexts become part of the rewrite rules and the structural congruence; for example, taking C C to be the context constructor for weak head normal form, we add a structural congruence rule that says that to reduce an application of one term to another, we have to reduce the term on the left first:\n\nC ( T U ) ≡ ( C T U ) . C(T\\; U) \\equiv (C T\\; U).\n\nWe also modify the reduction reduction rule to involve the context constructors. Here’s β \\beta reduction when reducing to weak head normal form:\n\nβ : ( C ( λ x . T ) U ) ⇒ C T { U / x } . \\beta: (C(\\lambda x.T)\\; U) \\Rightarrow C T\\{U/x\\}.\n\nNow β \\beta reduction can’t happen just anywhere; it can only happen in the presence of the “catalyst” C C .\n\nWith context constructors, we can capture all of the information about operational semantics using a multisorted Gph-enriched Lawvere theory: we have a generating object for each sort, a generating morphism for each term constructor and for each context constructor, equations between morphisms encoding structural congruence and context propagation, and an edge for each rewrite in its appropriate context.\n\nConnecting to Lambek/Scott\n\nThe SKI combinator calculus is a formal system invented by Schönfinkel and Curry. It allows for universal computation, and expressions in this calculus can easily be translated into the lambda calculus, but it’s simpler because it doesn’t include variables. The SK calculus is a fragment of the SK calculus that is still computationally universal.\n\nWe can recover the Lambek/Scott-style denotational semantics of the SK calculus (see the appendix) by taking the Gph-theory, modding out by the edges, and taking the monoid of endomorphisms on the generating object. The monoid is the cartesian closed category with only the “untyped” type. Using Melliès and Zeilberger’s notion of a functor as a type refinement system, we “-oidify” the monoid into a category of types and equivalence classes of terms.\n\nHowever, modding out by edges utterly destroys the semantics of concurrent languages, and composition of endomorphisms doesn’t line up particularly well with composition of processes, so neither of those operations are desirable in general. That doesn’t stop us from considering Gph-enriched functors as type refinement systems, though.\n\nLet G G be the free model of a theory on the empty graph. Our plan for future work is to show how different notions of a collection of edges of G G give rise to different kinds of logics. For example, if we take subsets of the edges of G , G, we get subgraphs of G , G, which form a Heyting algebra. On the other hand, if we consider sets of lists of composable edges in G , G, we get quantale semantics for linear logic. Specific collections will be the types in the type system, and proofs should be graph homomorphisms mapped over the collection. Edges will feature in proof normalization.\n\nAt the end, we should have a system where given a formal semantics for a language, we algorithmically derive a type system tailored to the language. We should also get a nice Curry-Howard style approach to operational semantics that even denotational semantics people won’t turn up their noses at!\n\nAppendix\n\nGph\n\nFor our purposes, a graph is a set E E of edges and a set V V of vertices together with three functions s : E → V s\\colon E \\to V for the source of the edge, t : E → V t\\colon E \\to V for the target, and a : V → E a\\colon V \\to E such that s ∘ a = V s\\circ a = V and t ∘ a = V t \\circ a = V —that is, a a assigns a chosen self-loop to each vertex. A graph homomorphism maps vertices to vertices and edges to edges such that sources, targets and chosen self-loops are preserved. Gph is the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms. Gph has finite products: the terminal graph is the graph with one vertex and one loop, while the product of two graphs ( E , V , s , t , a ) × ( E ′ , V ′ , s ′ , t ′ , a ′ ) (E , V , s, t, a) \\times (E' , V' , s' , t' , a') is ( E × E ′ , V × V ′ , s × s ′ , t × t ′ , a × a ′ ) . (E \\times E', V \\times V', s \\times s', t\\times t', a \\times a').\n\nGph is a topos; the subobject classifier has two vertices t , f t, f and five edges: the two self-loops, an edge from t t to f , f, an edge from f f to t , t, and an extra self-loop on t t . Any edge in a subgraph maps to the chosen self-loop on t , t, while an edge not in the subgraph maps to one of the other four edges depending on whether the source and target vertex are included or not.\n\nA Gph-enriched category consists of\n\na set of objects;\n\nfor each pair of objects x , y , x, y, a graph hom ( x , y ) ; \\hom(x,y);\n\na graph for each triple of objects x , y , z , x, y, z, a composition graph homomorphism ∘ : hom ( y , z ) × hom ( x , y ) → hom ( x , z ) ; \\quad \\circ\\colon \\hom(y, z) \\times \\hom(x, y) \\to \\hom(x, z); and\n\na composition graph homomorphism and for each object x , x, a vertex of hom ( x , x ) , \\hom(x, x), the identity on x , x,\n\nsuch that composition is associative, and composition and the identity obey the unit laws. A Gph-enriched category has finite products if the underlying category does.\n\nAny category is trivially Gph-enrichable by treating the elements of the hom sets as vertices and adjoining a self loop to each vertex. The category Gph is nontrivially Gph-enriched: Gph is a topos, and therefore cartesian closed, and therefore enriched over itself. Given two graph homomorphisms F , F ′ : ( E , V , s , t , a ) → ( E ′ , V ′ , s ′ , t ′ , a ′ ) , F, F'\\colon (E, V, s, t, a) \\to (E', V', s', t', a'), a graph transformation assigns to each vertex v v in V V an edge e ′ e' in E ′ E' such that s ′ ( e ′ ) = F ( v ) s'(e') = F(v) and t ′ ( e ′ ) = F ′ ( v ) . t'(e') = F'(v). Given any two graphs G G and G ′ , G', there is an exponential graph G ′ G G'^G whose vertices are graph homomorphisms between them and whose edges are graph transformations. There is a natural isomorphism between the graphs C A × B C^{A\\times B} and ( C B ) A . (C^B)^A.\n\nA Gph-enriched functor between two Gph-enriched categories C , D C, D is a functor between the underlying categories such that the graph structure on each hom set is preserved, i.e. the functions between hom sets are graph homomorphisms between the hom graphs.\n\nLet S S be a finite set, FinSet be a skeleton of the category of finite sets and functions between them, and FinSet / S FinSet/S be the category of functions into S S and commuting triangles. A multisorted Gph-enriched Lawvere theory, hereafter Gph-theory is a Gph-enriched category with finite products Th equipped with a finite set S S of sorts and a Gph-enriched functor θ : FinSet op / S → Th \\theta\\colon FinSet^{op}/S \\to Th that preserves products strictly. Any Gph-theory has an underlying multisorted Lawvere theory given by forgetting the edges of each hom graph.\n\nA model of a Gph-theory Th is a Gph-enriched functor from Th to Gph that preserves products up to natural isomorphism. A homomorphism of models is a braided Gph-enriched natural transformation between the functors. Let FPGphCat be the 2-category of small Gph-enriched categories with finite products, product-preserving Gph-functors, and braided Gph-natural transformations. The forgetful functor U : FPGphCat [ Th , Gph ] → Gph U\\colon FPGphCat[\\Th, \\Gph] \\to \\Gph that picks out the underlying graph of a model has a left adjoint that picks out the free model on a graph.\n\nGph-enriched categories are part of a spectrum of 2-category-like structures. A strict 2-category is a category enriched over Cat with its usual product. Sesquicategories are categories enriched over Cat with the “funny” tensor product; a sesquicategory can be thought of as a generalized 2-category where the interchange law does not always hold. A Gph-enriched category can be thought of as a generalized sesquicategory where 2-morphisms (now edges) cannot always be composed. Any strict 2-category has an underlying sesquicategory, and any sesquicategory has an underlying Gph-enriched category; these forgetful functors have left adjoints.\n\nSome examples\n\nThe SK calculus\n\nHere’s a presentation of the Gph-theory for the SK calculus:\n\nobjects T T\n\nmorphisms S : 1 → T S\\colon 1 \\to T K : 1 → T K\\colon 1 \\to T ( − − ) : T × T → T (-\\; -)\\colon T \\times T \\to T\n\nequations none\n\nedges σ : ( ( ( S x ) y ) z ) ⇒ ( ( x z ) ( y z ) ) \\sigma\\colon (((S\\; x)\\; y)\\; z) \\Rightarrow ((x\\; z)\\; (y\\; z)) κ : ( ( K x ) z ) ⇒ x \\kappa\\colon ((K\\; x)\\; z) \\Rightarrow x\n\nThe free model of this theory on the empty graph has a vertex for every term in the SK calculus and an edge for every reduction.\n\nThe SK calculus with the weak head normal form reduction strategy\n\nHere’s the theory above modified to account for weak head normal form:\n\nobjects T T\n\nmorphisms S : 1 → T S\\colon 1 \\to T K : 1 → T K\\colon 1 \\to T ( − − ) : T × T → T (-\\; -)\\colon T \\times T \\to T R : T → T R\\colon T \\to T\n\nequations R ( x y ) = ( Rx y ) R(x\\; y) = (Rx\\; y)\n\nedges σ : ( ( ( RS x ) y ) z ) ⇒ ( ( Rx z ) ( y z ) ) \\sigma\\colon (((RS\\; x)\\; y)\\; z) \\Rightarrow ((Rx\\; z)\\; (y\\; z)) κ : ( ( RK x ) z ) ⇒ Rx \\kappa\\colon ((RK\\; x)\\; z) \\Rightarrow Rx\n\nIf M M is an SK SK term with no uses of R R and M ′ M' is its weak head normal form, then RM RM reduces to RM ′ .

  "latent_17359": "If Labour is weaponising the NHS, maybe it needs to sharpen its tools. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham had a difficult and ill-tempered interview on Newsnight yesterday about what he actually thinks about private sector involvement in the NHS. When asked about the role he sees for the private sector under his reshaped health service, Burnham said private companies would not be entirely excluded:\n\n‘There is still a role for private and voluntary providers but I also did say very clearly that the market is not the answer.’\n\nPresented with a graph (below) showing how private sector outsourcing grew to four per cent under Labour — but rose two per cent under the coalition — Burnham was unable to say what he thinks is the right level:\n\n‘There isn’t a right percentage. I’m very clear that the NHS should be our preferred provider so I don’t see a role for the private sector where it can replace core public provision at the heart of every community.’\n\nChart\n\nWark tried again, asking Burnham which operations he thinks are suitable for outsourcing. Varicose veins? Hernias? Chemotherapy? Again, he failed to give a clear answer and contracted himself by saying GPs should have a choice:\n\n‘The GP has got to be able to make the best decision for the patient…I said to you very clearly at the start of this interview, there is a role for the private and voluntary sector…it’s a supporting role, not a replacement role. It’s not so hard to understand.’\n\nBurnham eventually gave up any pretence of trying to answer the questions and resorted to platitudes. He ‘believes in a service that puts people before profits’ and said the coalition government is putting an ‘alien ideology at the heart’.\n\nBut the facts presented didn’t back that up and suggested Labour only cares about giving the private sector a kicking. The NHS needs reform and has structural problems but Burnham did not inspire much confidence that he is the man to solve those problems. He seemed to think that attacking markets was more important than pursuing what is best for patients, without an explanation of why he thinks markets are always bad for healthcare standards. There were two simple questions Burnham needed to answer:\n\nWhat per cent does Labour see as the right one for private sector outsourcing the NHS? What kind of operations does Labour think can be outsourced?\n\nHe is appearing again on the Daily Politics today so we’ll see if he has discovered the answers over night. Plus, he has to contend with an intervention from Alan Milburn, who has lambasted his ‘comfort zone strategy’.",

  "latent_17397": "IRS adopts state domestic-partner property law\n\nIn a significant move for same-sex couples, the Internal Revenue Service has decided to recognize California's community property law and treat the income earned by California registered domestic partners as community property income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe decision, which was issued in a private-letter ruling on Friday, reverses a position the IRS took in 2006, when it said California's registered domestic partners should each report on their own federal tax return only the income they personally earned, not one-half of their community income.\n\nThe new decision does not require or even allow California's registered domestic partners to file their federal tax return as married filing jointly or married filing separately, as they must do with their state tax returns. They must each still file a single federal return, but each should now report one-half of their community income.\n\nSuppose one partner earns $100,000 and the other earns $60,000. In the past, each reported only the income he or she earned. In the future, each would report $80,000, which is half their combined income. Each would also be entitled to half of the combined income tax withheld from their paychecks.\n\nSplit deductions\n\nItemized deductions get messy, but in general any deductible expense paid with community property funds should be split between the partners, says Chris Kollaja, a San Francisco CPA.\n\nThe new ruling could reduce federal taxes for some domestic partners, especially if one has a very large income and the other has little or none. A couple in this situation could even pay less than a married couple filing a joint return, Kollaja says.\n\nBut the ruling could hurt some couples, especially if one partner qualified for federal tax credits or benefits or college financial aid available only to low-income people. With a higher income, this person could potentially lose some benefits, says Pan Haskins, an Oakland CPA.\n\nPrivate-letter rulings are issued in response to a question from an unidentified taxpayer and can be relied on only by that individual. Although they do not have the same force as a public revenue ruling, \"tax preparers all the time look at them to understand the view of the IRS,\" says Don Read, a Berkeley tax attorney who requested this private ruling on behalf of a client.\n\nThe IRS reiterated its position in a chief counsel advice, a memo that provides guidance to IRS field personnel. The memo says, \"For tax years beginning before June 1, 2010, registered domestic partners may, but are not required to, amend their returns to report income in accordance with this\" memo.\n\n\"This gives registered domestic partners a real advantage for past years,\" Read says, because they can pick and choose which years to amend.\n\nHowever, if a couple pays a tax preparer, the cost of amending a return could exceed the tax savings, Haskins warns.\n\nAccording to attorneys, the new ruling applies only to domestic partners registered with the California secretary of state. Couples can register only if both partners are the same sex or at least one is 62 or older. It is not clear how the ruling will affect gay couples who married in California when it was legal to do so but did not register as domestic partners.\n\nSame-sex-marriage advocates welcomed the IRS decision. \"It is a positive development,\" says Jenny Pizer, an attorney with Lambda Legal.\n\nState property law\n\nBut it does not mean the IRS or the federal government recognizes same-sex marriages. It means the IRS is recognizing state property laws, as it usually does.\n\n\"All they are doing is reconfirming law that exists,\" says Jean Johnston, a San Francisco tax attorney.\n\nThat law says that in California, any income earned or assets acquired during a marriage, except for gifts and inheritances, is generally considered community property and equally owned by each spouse.\n\nA state law that took effect in 2005 gave registered domestic partners most of the same community property rights as married couples. But it said earned income could not be treated as community property for state income taxes.\n\nCalifornia later amended that law, and starting in 2007, it treated such income as community property for state income tax purposes. Since then, registered domestic partners have had to file their state tax returns like married couples.\n\nThe private-letter ruling asked whether the taxpayer must report on his individual federal return one-half of the combined income that he and his partner earned from both their jobs and their community property assets. The answer, essentially, was yes. It also stated that \"the vesting of half of taxpayer's earnings in his partner\" would not result in federal gift tax.\n\nIn another chief counsel advice, the IRS said it would consider the assets of a California taxpayer's registered domestic partner when determining the \"reasonable collection potential of a taxpayer's Offer In Compromise.\" That could make it harder for one partner who is trying to settle a federal tax debt to pay less than the full amount because the IRS, when determining his or her ability to pay, would look at the other partner's resources.",
  "latent_17407": "The Next Millennial Millionaire Is The Owner Of Ellis Island Tea\n\nBy Victor Ochieng\n\nA 28-year-old millennial is on her path to becoming a millionaire, and nothing is going to stop her, considering her drive, grind, ambition and courage. She owns Ellis Island Tea, a brand born from her family recipe, and is already on the shelves of major stores across the country.\n\nNailah Ellis started by using a portable ice cooler to sell $8 bottles of the tea before she landed groundbreaking deals with major brands such as Whole Foods, Meijers and major U.S. airports, getting some of the deals within a short period after starting her business.\n\nRolling Out spent some time with Ellis to learn how she started off. In the interview, she talked about her journey to success; how she dropped out of college and decided to pursue her desire of bringing her family tea recipe to the big shelves.\n\nEllis said she started her business almost eight years ago. She originally wanted to go to school, earn a degree, work her way to Wall Street, make and save some good money before quitting and delving into entrepreneurship, her true dream.\n\nHowever, during her first year in college, she got to understand how college loans work. She did her math and figured that by the time she would be graduating, she’d have a debt of between $80,000 and $100,000, a loan she’d have to repay for almost half her life. Her question then was: “Why not just go for my true dream?” Conscious of her age and the fact that she didn’t have so much responsibilities, she decided to drop out of school and go back to her home in Detroit. It was time for her to take a business risk. Ellis spent some time in her mother’s basement putting down some business ideas.\n\nThe beverage industry stood out since it didn’t require huge capital and she also had a unique family tea recipe that she was quite passionate about. The other business idea she considered was Adult Foster Care, but this needed much higher capital. With the tea idea, she only needed to walk into a store, purchase some tea bags and embark on her trial phase.\n\nThat’s how the journey began. To get the exact recipe, she’d to fly to New York to her father, since it’s him who knew it well. “It was my great-grandfather’s recipe. He gave it to my father before he died. My dad would make it for different family events and people would just go crazy over it.”\n\nEllis dream account was Whole Foods. “Like with the whole college thing, instead of taking a long route because I’m scared to go approach my dream account, I just walked into a Whole Foods and I said, ‘What is the process for getting on the shelves?’” After earnestly following the process, she finally got her tea on Whole Foods shelves. The tea did so well on the shelves that she “got a call from another Whole Foods saying they were interested.”\n\nEllis Island Tea has done so well over the years that now they’re “in Whole Foods all over the Midwest region and we are also in all of the Meijer stores across six states. We own our production operation and we are now in airports. We’re getting ready to be in six airports, including Atlanta, Texas, Detroit — we’re already in Detroit — New Orleans and Milwaukee. We’re being on-boarded as we speak.”\n\nSource",

  "latent_17496": "Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Ross County 1-1 St Johnstone\n\nRoss County moved off bottom spot as a controversial Alex Schalk penalty cancelled out Denny Johnstone's early opener.\n\nWith just 75 seconds on the clock, Johnstone guided a header low and under Scott Fox from six yards out.\n\nThe hosts earned a second-half spot kick when Chris Eagles was brought down, seemingly just outside the box, by Chris Millar.\n\nSchalk converted the penalty to take his side to 17 points and off bottom.\n\nTommy Wright's St Johnstone didn't manage to make it five wins from their last five trips to the Global Energy Stadium, but the Perth men are now unbeaten in three matches - against Rangers, Hearts and County - over the festive period.\n\nThat spell of fixtures has also proved a bountiful time for Johnstone, who notched his first Saints goal at Ibrox then provided the downward header that gave the visitors the perfect start in the Highlands.\n\nDavid Wotherspoon, back in the starting eleven, supplied the cross and although Johnstone's header appeared to be directed straight at County goalkeeper Fox, it bobbled its way into the back of the net to make Owen Coyle look at his watch in disbelief. Just 75 seconds on the clock.\n\nDenny Johnstone secured his second goal of the season, having scored in St Johnstone's 3-1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox\n\nThe Staggies' captain Andrew Davies nearly equalised in the ninth minute with a header that St Johnstone's Zander Clark saved in superb fashion.\n\nSt Johnstone almost made an equally effective start to the second half. Michael O'Halloran surged into the box and his low drive across goal was turned into the net by Steven MacLean, only for the assistant referee to raise his flag.\n\nThat key decision was followed by another. Referee Greg Aitken pointed to the spot on the 52nd minute when Chris Millar mistimed his tackle on the tricky Chris Eagles. Saints protested that it was not inside the box, but Schalk was not distracted as he put his fifth goal of the season low into the right corner.\n\nOwen Coyle's side have a better goal difference than Partick Thistle - both sides on 17 points\n\nFrom there on the game opened up. Johnstone and Wotherspoon were denied in quick succession by two equally brilliant last-ditch blocks by Jason Naismith and Chris Routis.\n\nAt the other end, County's top scorer Craig Curran failed to stretch enough to apply the finishing touch to Schalk's cross.\n\nThe introduction of Davis Keillor-Dunn caused all sorts of problems for St Johnstone.\n\nThe youngster's trickery started the most incredible sequence of goalmouth action that goalkeeper Clark emerged from with great credit. Naismith had the first effort from 12 yards, which Clark parried before Schalk knocked the rebound off the inside of the post. The ball then fell to Billy McKay and the Irishman was twice denied from point-blank range by the impressive Clark.\n\nKeillor-Dunn continued to be the star of the show. The 20-year-old curled one effort narrowly wide and went on to fire another one towards the far corner, but Clark got a palm to it.\n\nRight at the death, Liam Craig watched his free-kick nearly nick all three points for Saints.\n\nPost-match reaction\n\nRoss County manager Owen Coyle: \"We know the performances haven't been bad but it was a horrendous start. A minute into the game, a throw-in down the side and we've been caught cold and that's not acceptable, which was stressed to the players at half-time.\n\n\"For me, I thought we were a shadow of ourselves in the first half. We needed that intensity, the pace we play at. Second half I've got to say we were outstanding. Second half, we should have won the game. I think St Johnstone will feel very lucky to leave with a point - accepting St Johnstone are always dangerous on the counter-attack.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"It's a good point. I always feel if you come away with something here it's always a good point. I thought we played well. I thought it was a cracking game and both teams tried to win the game and were still trying to win the game at the end.\"\n\n\"I think the penalty decision, and I've seen it back, I don't see how he can be 100% that it's inside the box. Chris Millar shouldn't go to ground, he knows that, and he probably makes it easier for the referee. Chris' feet and body never go inside the box so I don't know how he can possibly have touched the player in there if his body and feet stay outside the box.\n\n\"Denny Johnstone's dragged to the ground inside the box. I went to see the referee about that. I think referees have got to be brave at times and make those decisions. It's a foul. There's no attempt by Naismith, I think it was, to win the ball and he just wrestles Denny to the ground. Again it's a decision that should have went our way.\"",
  "latent_17546": "The stay-at-home dad is becoming more common … and that’s a good thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Rebel Magazine.\n\n“More than 80 percent of those who were laid off during the Great Recession were men.” It’s the kind of statistic I had used a thousand times as a journalist.\n\nPut it in historical perspective. Trace its origins. Analyze its impact and personalize it by interviewing some of its victims.\n\nThat would have been my approach had an e-mail not appeared in my inbox requiring me to attend a meeting with other associates at my newspaper. I knew what this meant. I had been laid off.\n\nEverything that I accomplished in my professional life was now irrelevant. Every pride-inflating bullet point that helped define me was stripped away.\n\nI was fearful for my family’s financial future, and I had no idea what I’d do next. And yet, as odd is it seems, my most powerful sensation was clarity.\n\nI always wanted to be a part of something significant in the workplace—something that changed the world for the better through action. Journalism had fulfilled that need, but I knew with absolute certainty that this chapter in my life was over. I had no idea it had been the precursor to something even better.\n\nThe Changing Face of Parenting\n\nThe trend of stay-at-home fathers has grabbed recent headlines across the United States. Driven by the economic downturn, the increased presence and earning power of women in the workplace, and greater acceptance of new gender roles, more fathers are enlisting in the front lines of parenting.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the number of stay-at-home dads rose to 158,000 in 2009, a 13 percent jump from the previous year. The stay-at-home ratio for moms versus dads also continued to shrink year over year. Despite these trends, Stanford Knight Fellow Jeremy Adam Smith says the statistics can be misleading.\n\nDon’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\n\n“Discussions of fatherhood often peak during times of economic crises, but this has been building for decades,” says Smith, who founded the website Daddy Dialetic and wrote the book, The Daddy Shift: How Stay-at-Home Dads, Breadwinning Moms, and Shared Parenting Are Transforming the American Family.\n\nDr. Aaron Rochlen, associate professor of counseling psychology at the University of Texas-Austin, says the number of families in which the woman makes more money than the man has increased at a steady rate since the 1950s to its current all-time high of 29 percent.\n\nSmith believes the change is a product shift in attitudes from one generation to the next: “I asked my grandfather, who went through The Great Depression and fought in World War II, ‘Did you face any challenges as a father?’ He said, ‘No, your grandmother did all that.’ I asked him, ‘Did you ever change a diaper?’ He said, ‘No, your grandma did all that.’”\n\nSmith continues, “For my father, the greatest challenge was trying to be as involved as possible. He didn’t want to be remote or absent the way his father was, but my dad never questioned for a moment that he would be the primary bread winner and my mom would be the primary caregiver. When I got married, my wife and I never assumed any roles. We always assumed we’d negotiate them over time.”\n\nRochlen’s research found the factors that determine who stays at home are myriad, ranging from economic and workplace realities to simple social or value-based factors.\n\nBill Grason is a stay-at-home father of three who lives in suburban Chicago. Grason’s wife is a school principal.\n\n“It just made sense for us,” says Grason, who hasn’t worked full-time in more than a decade. “My wife is paid well, so we can make it work on her salary, and we have a strong belief that at least one of us should be present in our kids’ lives on a consistent basis.”\n\nGrason says he tried daycare for a short period after his son Jack was born, but he and his son were both unhappy with the arrangement.\n\n“It was so hard dropping him off each day and watching him cry,” Grason says. “After a while, my wife and I were like, ‘Why are we doing this?’ My job was enough to cover his daycare and commuting costs with just a little left over. It just made sense to sacrifice a little bit for our kids’ sake.”\n\nShifting Attitudes\n\nSeminal works in pop culture have helped call attention to shifting gender attitudes.\n\nHarry Chapin’s 1974 release “Cat’s in the Cradle” crystallized the angst baby-boomer dads experienced due to workplace realities that kept them away from their families.\n\nThe 1983 film, Mr. Mom, introduced the idea of stay-at-home dads, but Michael Keaton’s portrayal of a bungling, hapless house-dad is a classic example of the stereotypes toward stay-at-home dads that still exist two decades later.\n\nA 2008 study by Rochlen, Marie-Anne Suizzo (University of Texas at Austin), Ryan A. McKelley (University of Wisconsin at La Crosse) and Vanessa Scaringi (University of Texas at Austin) found a significant number of stay-at-home fathers face negative or ambiguous external attitudes toward their role choice.\n\nNearly 43 percent of the respondents to a survey reported being subject to jokes, teasing and reactions that were difficult to understand, confusing, awkward, or cautious.\n\nNotably, only 28.6 percent reported specific responses from women that were perceived as negative. But there are still practical realities that make being a stay-at-home dad sometimes awkward.\n\nGrason says he has a hard time setting up play dates for his kids with other children because their moms were either uncomfortable chatting with a man or distrustful of his motives.\n\n“I think some of them thought I was hitting on them,” Grason says, laughing.\n\nMuch like the difficulties women faced when first entering the workplace en masse in the ’50s and ’60s, men face intimidating obstacles in mother-dominated settings.\n\nI remember taking my daughters to a puppet show at the local library. Mind you, the thought of sitting through a puppet show was torture enough, but enduring the stares of scores of moms, who outnumbered the men at least 9-to-1, was equally unsettling.\n\nI could almost hear their individual voices:\n\nIs he divorced?\n\nIs he some unemployed loser?\n\nIs he gay?\n\nI’ve faced more than enough cold shoulders to let me know my role wasn’t accepted in all circles. But in many cases, the perceived reception was a product of my own insecurities or the internalization of traditional attitudes toward my new role.\n\n“No matter how revolutionary we are, we’re always haunted by the ghosts of traditional roles,” Smith says. “A lot of dads feel badly for not going to work every day, and a lot of moms feel badly for going to work every day.”\n\nDon’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\n\nRochlen says a variety of factors can negatively impact stay-at-home dads’ self-esteem including a lack of respect from outsiders or an outright challenge to their masculinity. These acceptance issues cross many cultural, demographic and regional lines.\n\nBut the Greatest Issue is Still Economically Driven\n\n“For guys who entered into this role as the primary caretaker only because they lost their job, it’s going to be a much harder emotional shift and challenge,” Rochlen says. “If they value one parent being at home, if they have shared beliefs with their partner or really view this through the lens of what’s best for the family, they have a much easier time.”\n\nSmith adds that family and peer support is essential to a feeling of self-worth. In other words, if the most important people in your life support and respect your decision, you will, too.\n\nBrian Reid is a writer and former stay-at-home dad who has maintained the highly influential website Rebeldad.com for eight years. A former Washingtonpost.com parenting blogger, Reid writes and speaks extensively on the new “involved fatherhood” and has been featured on the Today Show and in The New York Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nReid has waged an online war with several traditionalist writers over the years, most recently Penelope Trunk, who founded a website devoted to dispensing advice to Generation Y.\n\n“What makes Trunk so dangerous,” Reid writes, “is that she not only declares that moms (or would-be moms) need not even attempt entrepreneurship, but she suggests that men are willing accomplices in shunting kid and household stuff to women, keeping them down.”\n\nDon’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Trunk’s piece on Techcrunch.com:\n\nMen are more likely to settle when it comes to raising kids. The kids are fine. Men are more likely than women to think they themselves are doing a good job parenting. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Men have to trust that the kids will be okay so that they can leave and go get food or make more kids.\n\nBefore you tell me there are exceptions, I’m going to let you in on a secret: I’m a magnet for high-powered women with stay-at-home husbands. And when the men aren’t listening, the women always tell me that their men don’t pay enough attention and they (the women) are really running the household. They would never say this to the men. It would de-motivate them. So even the most child-oriented men are not as child-oriented as their wives.\n\nIgnoring for the moment that Trunk’s basis for opinion is purely anecdotal—utterly bereft of legitimate research—it’s also based on a social construct—an assumption that a woman’s way of raising children is the default or proper method.\n\nWomen have been doing this a lot longer and certainly have a glut of experience on which to draw, but that does not make their approach to caregiving the definitive and final word in Reid’s mind.\n\n“That’s not to say that there isn’t a lot of work to do in the area of gender equity,” Reid writes. “I just happen to believe that we’re moving in the right direction, and that it’s worth the effort.”\n\nDon’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\n\nThe Good News\n\nMany men would agree with Reid’s last assertion.\n\n“In a nutshell, I gained a lot more empathy, patience and confidence,” Smith says of his own stay-at-home experiences. “Whether it’s nature or nurture, when men take care of children they have their own way of doing it. The important thing to understand is that you can be a man’s man and still take responsibility for the care of children.”\n\nGrason agrees. “I expect to have a closer bond with my kids because I’ve been there from the start,” he says. “Maybe someday, when I’m old, they can return the favor and change my diapers.”\n\nThere is a dearth of research that analyzes the impact dads have on children as primary caregivers. But there is some. Research from the Center for Successful Fathering shows that kids who spend more time with dads post greater ambition, fewer anxiety disorders, and a reduced risk of delinquency or teen pregnancy. Other studies found that kids with involved dads have better verbal skills, higher academic achievement and better physical fitness.\n\nI don’t know yet if those findings will hold true for my two daughters. They are 5 and 3. It’s still too early to judge.\n\nMy own testimony comes more from the sense of fulfillment I’ve gained as a result of this role reversal. When I finally got past the fact that my old career had ended—aided in great part by a burgeoning freelance business—I started to focus on the obvious benefit that had been right in front of me all along—my girls.\n\nI’m not just a spectator at their soccer games or a chauffeur to the zoo on the odd weekend day. I’m an active participant in shaping two lives—the most important two lives my wife and I have ever known.\n\nYes, that means doing homework, laundry, and cooking, but I also hear about their daily struggles and triumphs. I watch their personalities flower, their creativity blossom and their minds expand to solve problems and answer questions.\n\nBecause of this newfound definition of employment, I also enjoy better balance in my life than I’ve ever experienced. I have creative outlets that I can explore around my girls’ schedules, making me a happier and healthier role model for those two lives I am charged with shaping.\n\nWhen I consider the myriad attitudes toward stay-at-home fathers I discover now that I just don’t care what others think. I don’t even define my choice as a role reversal any more. That’s just a social construct created by a variety of variables that can and are being altered with every passing year—a social construct that also can be challenged and deconstructed based on its series of false assumptions.\n\nAll that matters to me is that my wife and I made a life choice that was in the best interest of our family. When I see its impact every day in my girls’ faces, I know it was the right choice.\n\nCraig Morgan is a freelance writer based in Gilbert, Ariz.

  "latent_17691": "TORONTO — Alex Killorn reached out to Paul Ranger as soon as he could to apologize.\n\nRanger, a Maple Leafs defenseman, was wheeled off the ice on a stretcher wearing a head and neck restraint with 4.1 seconds left in the first period of Wednesday night's game after Killorn, a Lightning left wing, hit him from behind into the end boards at the Air Canada Centre.\n\nRanger was taken as a precaution to a hospital, where the Leafs reported he was \"stable, conscious and alert.\" Ranger played for Tampa Bay from 2005-10, and at least one of his former teammates had his phone number. Killorn said he got Ranger's voice mail.\n\n\"I'm going in to hit him, and he makes a quick turn,\" Killorn said. \"I'm already committed at that point. I'm trying to think of what else I could have done … to prevent that. It's just a tough, quick, bang-bang play.\"\n\nKillorn, 24, was given a five-minute boarding major and a game misconduct that carries an automatic $200 league fine and a likely appointment with league disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan.\n\n\"That's a tough one,\" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said after Tampa Bay's 5-3 win. \"I don't think there was any intent on (Killorn's) part to do that. That's not the way he plays.\"\n\nAs medical staff, including Lightning head trainer Tommy Mulligan, worked on Ranger — and former Lightning teammates Nate Thompson, Ryan Malone and Teddy Purcell, and former Toronto teammate Mike Kostka watched — the decision was made to play the final 4.1 seconds of the first period before the start of the second.\n\nTampa Bay C Valtteri Filppula won the faceoff in the Lightning zone. Tampa Bay also got a break when a tripping penalty on Joffrey Lupul negated two minutes of the final 2:34 of Killorn's penalty.\n\n\"A turning point in the game when we killed that off,\" Cooper said of preserving a 3-2 lead.\n\nSaid Maple Leafs coach Randy Carlyle of Ranger: \"You try to use it as motivation for the players and get (the win) for him, and we fell short.\"\n\nKillorn, who had only 54 penalty minutes in 106 career games entering Wednesday, said he is \"happy (Ranger) is okay,\" and noted there has been \"nothing dirty\" in his career.\n\nStill, captain Steven Stamkos said, \"Those are the plays we're trying to get rid of. 'Killer' didn't mean to do it, but it's a scary situation. We just hope that 'Range' is okay and he's doing all right.\"\n\nUP AND COMING: There is talk the Lightning might sign Cody Kunyk, 23, a forward out of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound senior, who last summer attended Tampa Bay's prospect camp, had 11 goals and 28 points in 37 games.\n\nODDS AND ENDS: Filppula has two goals, eight assists in a six-game points streak. … C Tyler Johnson's 22 goals are one off Stamkos' team rookie record. … LW Ryan Malone's two assists gave him 200 Lightning points. … LW Ondrej Palat's five-game points streak ended. … Forwards Nikita Kucherov and Richard Panik and defensemen Keith Aulie and Mark Barberio were scratched.",
  "latent_17848": "Researchers hope to send an experiment to the International Space Station (ISS) by the middle of the next decade that would pave the way for transcontinental transmission of secret messages encoded using the mysterious quantum property of entanglement.\n\nWhen two particles such as photons are born from the same event, they emerge entangled, meaning they can communicate instantaneously no matter how far apart they are. Transmitting entangled pairs of photons reliably is the backbone of so-called quantum key distribution—procedures for converting those pairs into potentially unbreakable codes. Quantum cryptography, as it is known, could appeal to banks, covert government agencies and the military, and was tested in a 2007 Swiss election.\n\nPhotons can travel perhaps 100 miles (160 kilometers) or so along today's fiber-optic cables before their quantum character breaks down. That limit vanishes aboveground. Last year, a team led by physicist Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna transmitted quantum keys up to 89.5 miles (144 kilometers) between a pair of telescopes in Spain's Canary Islands.\n\nNow Zeilinger and colleagues want to make the jump to hundreds of miles or more. The Vienna group is spearheading an international project, called Space-QUEST (Quantum Entanglement for Space Experiments), to prove that a system for generating pairs of entangled photons can fit the constraints imposed by the ISS.\n\nQuantum keys distributed from orbit could be transmitted to any two points in the station's line of sight, limited only by the ability of transmitters and receivers to keep a tight lock on one another and to distinguish entangled photons from background light. Earlier this year, Zeilinger and colleagues showed they could detect single photons reflected from an Italian satellite 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) above Earth.\n\nThe tools for the experiment would be an ultraviolet laser, a special type of crystal for splitting ultraviolet photons into pairs of infrared photons and equipment for keeping the two components aligned during the rigors of spaceflight. To make it into space, the instruments, including telescopes to transmit the photons, must weigh less than about 220 pounds (100 kilograms), consume no more than 250 watts of power and be no larger than 4.6 feet (1.4 meters) on its longest side.\n\nThe 10-country Space-QUEST group hopes to build a prototype device and gather preliminary data in time for a November meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA), where officials will decide which projects will receive funding and deserve a chance to fly in space, says Rupert Ursin, a postdoctoral researcher in Zeilinger's lab.\n\nUrsin says the team's proposal has scored high in preliminary assessments by European funding agencies including the ESA. \"We can do a lot of physics experiments with a relatively small budget\" of a few hundred million euros, he says.\n\nIn addition to the potential practical application, the Space-QUEST project would give researchers a chance to probe the reaches of entanglement in a new way. Theory says entangled should be unlimited in range, Ursin says, but to know for sure, \"we have to test it.\"",

  "latent_18132": "First Man on the Moon\n\nPBS Airdate: March 2, 2016\n\nNARRATOR: As Apollo 11 embarked on mankind's bold adventure to land on the moon, the world's hopes and dreams hung on the actions of its three-man crew, but in particular, Commander Neil Armstrong. With the skills that had made him one of America's finest aviators, Armstrong marked his place in history with these famous words:\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (NASA/First Man on the Moon / File Footage): That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\n\nNARRATOR: But what was it that had brought him to this historic moment? Armstrong had climbed to the pinnacle of his profession, tested in combat, in the skies over Korea; reaching to the limit of the atmosphere as an elite test pilot; and on into space, where his cool head saved lives; and finally, accepting a lifelong mantle of fame that didn't always sit well with him.\n\nANDREW CHAIKIN (Space Historian): We ask a lot of our heroes. We put a burden on them. We put a burden on Neil Armstrong that he didn't enjoy.\n\nNARRATOR: So who was Neil Armstrong? His story now told by those who lived, loved and worked with the First Man on the Moon, up next on NOVA.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY (President of the United States, 1960–1963 / File Footage): I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\n\nNARRATOR: When President John F. Kennedy articulated this bold vision, in 1961, he pinned American technological supremacy and national pride on winning a race to the moon. The stakes were huge.\n\nNASA APOLLO 11 MISSION CONTROL: Three, two, one, fire.\n\nANDREW CHAIKIN: It staggers the imagination, frankly, and there were plenty of people, even within NASA, who thought that Kennedy had lost his sanity.\n\nNARRATOR: Incredibly, just eight years, later three men were poised to achieve the President's goal. In command was Neil Armstrong.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Archive Interview): We, the crew of Apollo 11, are privileged to represent the United States in our first attempt to take man to another heavenly body.\n\nNARRATOR: At 38 years old, Armstrong was at the pinnacle of an impressive flying career. An innate steadiness, along with exceptional aviation skills, had seen him through the Korean War, allowed him to master the most unforgiving aircraft as a test pilot, and brought a crippled spacecraft safely back to Earth. Now, his ability as a pilot would be put to the ultimate test, attempting a landing on the moon.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Program alarm!\n\nNARRATOR: As the world held its breath, and with only seconds of fuel remaining, Neil Armstrong guided his fragile craft towards the surface of an alien world. He was about to complete a journey that, for him, had begun more than 30 years before, when he had first taken flight, as a young boy.\n\nBorn here, in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on August 5th, 1930, Neil Armstrong's love affair with flying began early, as his childhood friend recalls.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF (Neil Armstrong's Childhood Friend): When he was, like, five years old, his father took him on an airplane ride on a Tri-Motor. They had got sick, but Neil just absolutely loved it.\n\nNARRATOR: The mid-1930s was a golden age of flight in America, and like many other young children, Neil's first taste of being airborne left a lasting impression.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG (Neil Armstrong's Brother): This was the start. And the feeling of being airborne, and actually flying like a bird, it kindled his inspiration to fly. He absolutely loved everything about flight. He would have three or four model airplane projects going on all the time, mostly gliders, then he got into the rubber band type. And he just kept building bigger and bigger ones and better ones.\n\nMIKE COLLINS (Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot): We both made models early, and, of course, our desire then, as it was later in our careers, was to make these things go higher and faster. And my, my solution to higher and faster was you took a couple of extra turns on the rubber band. Neil's solution? He built a wind tunnel!\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: When we were ready for the test, he said “Go get Mom.” I said, “Neil wants you to see something.” So, and he turned it on.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN (Neil Armstrong's Sister): And, all of a sudden, the house shook, and I mean the house really shook.\n\nMIKE COLLINS: How many kids could build a wind tunnel in their basement? Not any I know, except Neil.\n\nNARRATOR: Neil's infatuation with flying was fuelled as America entered the Second World War, in December, 1941. He devoured the daring exploits of Allied pilots portrayed in popular wartime magazines. They inspired him, and, at just 15 years old, he learned to fly.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: He had his pilot's license before he had his driver's license.\n\nNARRATOR: During the war, developments in aviation were moving fast. After 1945, propeller planes were starting to be replaced by aircraft powered by jet and rocket engines.\n\nThen came an event that shook the whole of the aviation world.\n\nChuck Yeager breaking the speed of sound in his Bell X-1 rocket plane, in 1947, coincided with an ominous turn in East-West relations. And the implications for Armstrong would prove profound.\n\nEager to pursue a career in aeronautical engineering, Armstrong won a Navy scholarship to study the subject and enrolled at Purdue University. But his studies were soon interrupted, as the Cold War began to heat up.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: At the end of his second year, which would have been 1950, the Korean War started.\n\nNARRATOR: Backed by Communist China, North Korea invaded South Korea. When America responded by scrambling its armed forces, Armstrong found himself at war. He was 20 years old.\n\nHe joined Naval Fighter squadron VF-51 on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Essex. There was a lot to learn, and fast, as he recalls in this audio interview:\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): We had to become carrier-qualified in the jet aircraft. Doing a lot of practice with weapons delivery, instrument flying and so on. I was very young, very green.\n\nNARRATOR: But Armstrong quickly mastered carrier flying, one of aviation's most challenging jobs, and was soon showing his skill in combat.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: One of his jobs was to dive bomb and blow up bridges and railroads. And he said the North Koreans strung up wires.\n\nNARRATOR: For low-flying pilots, anti-aircraft cables were an ever-present danger. They were hard to spot, even for the sharp-eyed Armstrong.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): I actually ran through a cable, an anti-aircraft cable, and knocked off about six or eight feet of my right wing.\n\nNARRATOR: Battling to keep control, Armstrong needed to think fast and react quickly.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: As long as he could keep a certain speed, he could stay up, but as soon as he slowed down, the plane would drop. So, he knew that he could not land on the aircraft carrier. He'd have to bail out.\n\nNARRATOR: This close shave revealed Armstrong's uncanny ability to always remain calm under pressure.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: He never ever showed any fear or anything involving his close calls. He really loved what he was doing. It was a very meaningful time for him.\n\nNARRATOR: The Korean War sharpened the skills of many young pilots, including Armstrong. He'd flown 78 missions by the age of 22.\n\nHe returned to Purdue in 1952, where he received his degree and found a wife.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG (Neil Armstrong's First Wife): Oh, I met him at Purdue. He told someone that I was the one he was going to marry, but he never asked me out until he had graduated. We were married in January, 1956, and after that, in May, we went up to the desert.\n\nNARRATOR: Here at Edwards Air Force Base, in California, Armstrong would become a test pilot. Edwards was the mecca for America's elite aviators. But the work wasn't for the fainthearted. It required a cool head, quick thinking, and the ability to understand how an untested machine would react in an untried environment. Honing these skills would make test pilots top contenders for future space missions, and Armstrong was no exception.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): We were out at the edges of the flight envelope all of the time, testing limits. If memory serves, there were 17 aircraft, pretty much all different: a lot of X airplanes and fighters, B-47s a couple of B-29s, all kinds of exotic aircraft.\n\nThen, as they became more confident in my abilities, they gave me more and more jobs. I did a lot of test programs in those days.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: The kinds of flying that he did at Edwards really put him in the elite top of the test-flying fraternity.\n\nNARRATOR: But one machine at Edwards pushed Armstrong higher and faster than any other: the X-15.\n\nARCHIVE FOOTAGE: Heading uphill at 33,000 feet…\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: The X-15 was literally crossing the boundary from aviation into spaceflight, and it was an incredibly demanding vehicle to fly.\n\nNARRATOR: Half plane, half spacecraft, the rocket-powered X-15 was the cutting edge of aviation technology. It flew at hypersonic speeds, more than six times faster than sound, soaring over 50 miles in altitude. It still holds the record of the fastest plane ever flown.\n\nMIKE COLLINS: The X-15 was absolutely the top of the line. It was a whole supersonic zone above the rest of us, and, and therefore, all the people who flew the X-15 were held in the highest regard by the rest of us peasants. Neil, of course, was one of that group.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): That was a very exciting program; challenging goals. I think it was certainly one of the memorable parts of my life.\n\nNARRATOR: One flight almost got the better of him.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): I got the nose up above the horizon, and I found I was actually you know, skipping outside the atmosphere. I had no aerodynamic controls.\n\nNARRATOR: Soaring out of the atmosphere at almost a mile a second, Armstrong was unable to keep control.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): What I couldn't do is get back down in the atmosphere. I pulled over and pulled down, but it wasn't going down, ‘cause there was no air to bite into. So I just had to wait until I got back in with enough air to have aerodynamic control and some lift on the wings and immediately started making a turn back.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: He's the essence of the engineering test pilot, and what that carries with it is an intensity, a focus like you can't imagine.\n\nNARRATOR: The X-15 further challenged and sharpened Armstrong's flying ability, but his young family also faced challenges at Edwards.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: It was totally different, foreign, from anything I'd known in my life. That's where we lived when Rick was born, and then, shortly thereafter, Karen.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1961, aged two, Karen fell seriously ill.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: Karen was a precious thing, and she, she developed a tumor in her brain, and we could not save her.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: The death of Karen really hurt him. It was the only time that I'd ever see him really, really hurt, he couldn't talk about it.\n\nNARRATOR: Despite his loss, to all outward appearances, Armstrong remained focused on his duties as a test pilot. But beyond the skies at Edwards, the space race was on, opening up an entirely new set of opportunities.\n\nAmerica's manned space program began with Project Mercury, in 1961, six short flights, each carrying a single astronaut. But to meet Kennedy's challenge of a man on the moon by the end of the decade, NASA would require more astronauts.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: When NASA was looking, you know, Neil Armstrong was at the top of their list, because he'd had all of that flight-test experience at Edwards. And that just made him incredibly attractive to the Astronaut Selection Group.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: Curiously, the Milwaukee Journal gave me a call, and they said, “I understand your brother is one of the newest astronauts.” And I think I was speechless.\n\nNARRATOR: Along with Janet, Rick, and a new son, Mark, Neil began a new life in Houston, the home of America's manned space program.\n\nRICK ARMSTRONG (Neil Armstrong's Elder Son) : It was a nice house. It had, you know, we had a pool.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG (Neil Armstrong's Younger Son) : Because it was Houston, because it was often very hot, there was a lot of swimming.\n\nNARRATOR: The neighborhood was buzzing with trainee astronauts.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN (NASA, Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot) : There was this guy in the backyard, in front of the garage, where there's a lot of cement, and here's this guy roller-skating. I said, “Who's that?” And they said, “Oh, that's Neil Armstrong.”\n\nNARRATOR: By 1964, NASA's blueprint to reach the moon was taking shape. As this animated film of the time shows, it was called Project Apollo. The plan went like this…\n\nGuzzling 15 tons of fuel a second, at launch, the giant Saturn V rocket would send the Apollo spacecraft, both the command and lunar module, into space.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: After about sixty-nine hours, they go into orbit around the moon.\n\nNARRATOR: Once there, the spacecraft undock; the command module remains in orbit, while the lunar module attempts the landing. After exploring the surface, the two astronauts re-join their companion in lunar orbit.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: Finally, they leave lunar orbit and make the trip back to Earth. And the mission ends with the command module re-entering the earth's atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific.\n\nNARRATOR: It looked great on paper, but could it work? Finding out was the task of Project Gemini.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: The demands of a lunar mission were so great: you had to learn how to rendezvous in space; you had to keep people happy and healthy for up to two weeks in space; they had to be able to work in the vacuum of space in a spacesuit, a pressurized suit.\n\nED WHITE (NASA, Gemini Astronaut, Mission Audio): I feel like a million dollars!\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: So Gemini was really the way that NASA could learn to master these complexities in the relative safety of low-Earth orbit.\n\nNARRATOR: Armstrong's first spaceflight was Gemini VIII, in 1966; a daring mission to attempt the first docking in space with an unmanned spacecraft called Agena.\n\nHis co-pilot was Dave Scott.\n\nDAVE SCOTT (NASA, Gemini VIII Astronaut): Well, yes. I mean the whole program depended on docking. Docking needed to be proven or we couldn't go to the moon. So it was a critical mission, yes.\n\nNARRATOR: Squeezed into their tight-fitting Gemini capsule, the pair prepared for launch. Neither of them knew what lay in store.\n\nGEMINI VIII MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive): Three, two, one, zero, ignition. And we have a liftoff at three seconds. Three seconds. Neil Armstrong reports the clock has started. Roll program is in Armstrong says.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: Well, in our homes during the flight, we had air-to-ground communications. We called them the squawk box, because it squawked all the time.\n\nGEMINI VIII MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive): Roger. We have staging.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: When they talked air-to-ground you could update yourself. They started out just great.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): Okay, we've got a visual on the Agena, at 76 miles.\n\nGEMINI VIII MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive): Roger. Understand. Visual on the Agena at 76 miles.\n\nNARRATOR: Their docking target, the Agena rocket, had been launched earlier that day.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): Man, that's great!\n\nDAVE SCOTT (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): Man, that's really slick!\n\nNARRATOR: As Armstrong and Scott passed into the night side of the earth, they prepared for docking.\n\nGEMINI VIII MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive): Okay, Gemini VIII, you're looking good on the ground. Go ahead and dock.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: Neil eased it forward, and we moved right in.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): Flight, we are docked!\n\nNARRATOR: But within half an hour, Scott realized there was something wrong.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: You're supposed to fly straight and level, like an airplane, but, all of a sudden, I noticed that we were tilted.\n\nNARRATOR: They didn't know, but a small maneuvering thruster on their Gemini spacecraft had become stuck and was firing.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): We first suspected that the Agena was the culprit. We were on the dark side of the earth, so we really didn't have any outside reference.\n\nNARRATOR: Out of contact with the ground, the astronauts struggled to regain control.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: So I said, “Neil, we'd better get off.” He said, “Yeah, we'd better get off. Let's prepare to undock.” And then he says, “Ready,” and I put my hand on the switch. Neil says, “Undock.” And then things start really moving.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): We've got serious problems here. We're tumbling end over end. We've disengaged from the Agena.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: Then we go into a very rapid roll, which was almost a tumble, and at that point we realized that it wasn't the Agena, it must be the Gemini.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: They were spinning at maybe a revolution per second.\n\nNARRATOR: At home, a photographer from LIFE magazine captured Janet as she listened in to the unfolding drama.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: And there was a very strong concern that they would black out. And that would be, it, it would be over. And then NASA cut the squawk box. And I didn't like that. So, I went over to NASA, and I was refused entry.\n\nNARRATOR: Back in orbit, Armstrong kept his cool, figuring out his only remaining option: disengage all the maneuvering thrusters, including the one that was stuck, and use the re-entry thrusters to counteract the tumbling and regain control of the spacecraft.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: He had to reach up above his head and throw switches under this high-speed roll. That's amazing that he was able to do that. And he knew exactly where the switches were, exactly which ones to throw.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Gemini VIII Mission Audio): Okay, we're regaining control of the spacecraft, slowly.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: I mean, the guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well that he found the solution. He activated the solution under extreme circumstances. And I have to say it was my lucky day to be flying with Mr. Neil Armstrong.\n\nNARRATOR: Activating the re-entry thrusters meant aborting the mission, and a couple of hours later, the crew splashed down in the South China Sea. Armstrong had cut short the flight, but he'd saved their lives.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: He landed and came home, and we're…you know, he's telling me about the flight. We knew that they could have lost their life, and you knew that anyway, so there's no point in talking about it. You either do or you don't. That's the way it is, you know?\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: That was, sort of, NASA's baptism of fire, because it was the first time that astronauts had really come close to losing their lives on a spaceflight.\n\nI don't think there's any doubt that the people who were running the show in Houston saw Neil's performance on Gemini VIII as a real demonstration of what he was capable of under pressure, in a crisis.\n\nNARRATOR: The full risks of the space program hit home, less than a year later, in January, 1967, when the Apollo I spacecraft caught fire on the pad, killing its three man crew: Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.\n\nArmstrong found himself burying his friends.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: Everybody's attitude that I knew was, “This is a real disaster, but we go on, because we know Gus and Ed and Roger would want us to go on, wouldn't want us to stop.”\n\nNARRATOR: Overhauling Apollo took almost two years. Eager to make up for lost time, NASA launched Apollos 7, 8, 9 and 10, in quick succession. They were designed to rigorously test every aspect of Apollo in Earth and lunar orbit.\n\nArmstrong's next trip into space hinged on the success of these missions. NASA's flight roster called for him to be backup Commander of Apollo 8, in December, 1968, and it placed him in line to command Apollo 11.\n\nAs it turned out, this would be the first mission to attempt a landing on the moon.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: Nobody thought that all those preliminary flights would go as perfectly as they did. And nobody would have predicted that you would arrive at July, 1969, and Apollo 11 would actually be the first attempt to land on the moon.\n\nNARRATOR: Joining Armstrong was command module pilot Mike Collins, and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin would attempt the landing with Neil. If all went well, Commander Armstrong would be first out on the moon. But in characteristic fashion he played it down.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE (Apollo 11 Capsule Communicator):\n\nNeil's attitude is, “I'm not going to be number one on the moon.” What I saw in his attitude was that, “I'm training to be the first one to attempt the landing on the moon.”\n\nNARRATOR: Landing on the moon would be unlike anything anyone had experienced. To get a feel of flying in lunar gravity, Armstrong practiced in this, the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle, affectionately called the “flying bedstead.”\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: It was not the most stable flying machine that you could ever step into. If you tilted too far over, or if something happened to the rocket engines, you'd fall out of the sky, and you'd be dead.\n\nDAVE SCOTT: It was difficult to fly. But on the other hand, I think we all felt that it absolutely mandatory to be able to fly that type of vehicle before you go to the moon.\n\nNARRATOR: On one of Armstrong's flights, a failure of the fuel system meant he lost control. He was lucky to escape with his life, but he brushed it off as if nothing had happened.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: And that was so classic Neil Armstrong…that he wasn't going to let that get in the way of the rest of his day. He said there was work to do, and he did it.\n\nNARRATOR: Cape Kennedy, Florida: Over a million people came to watch Apollo 11 leave for the moon on July 16th, 1969. Among them was Armstrong's childhood friend.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: The day before the launch, we had a tour of the facilities there at Cape Kennedy, and we stood in front of the rocket, while my wife took our picture. And we shook our hands and said congratulations, that we finally got Neil on a good job, at last, and then we gave him a salute.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: We didn't say goodbye, it was more like, “Good luck” And it was just…he leaned over and gave me a little peck on the cheek, just a little bitty kiss. And then he turned around and was gone.\n\nAPOLLO 11 MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive):\n\nLaunch manager Paul Donnel wishes the crew Good luck and godspeed. Neil Armstrong reported back when he received the wishes “Thank you very much. We know it will be a good flight.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: My wife took the movies. I was taking 35-millimeter shots.\n\nAPOLLO 11 MISSION CONTROL (Audio Archive): Liftoff! We have a liftoff, 32 minutes past the hour, on Apollo 11.\n\nRICK ARMSTRONG: You feel it, you know? Your body feels it inside. It shakes in a way that nothing else does.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: I just kept saying, “Go Neil, go Neil, go Neil, go Neil, go Neil.”\n\nNARRATOR: Four days later, Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin would arrive at the moon. Then they'd attempt one of the most daring exploits in human history.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): We were certainly aware that the nation's hopes largely rested on us doing the very best job we could.\n\nMISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): And Armstrong and Aldrin within the L.M., that will be their home for the next 30 hours or so.\n\nNARRATOR: As they descended towards the surface in the lunar module, the Eagle, the world held its breath, as did Mike Collins orbiting above, in Columbia, the command module.\n\nMIKE COLLINS: I figured that our chances of 100 percent success were about 50/50. There were just so many things that could go wrong.\n\nNARRATOR: Collins was soon proved right.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): We've lost data with the Eagle.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE: As they went around the moon, looking at their trajectory, the bottom fell out. We started having communication problems and data dropout.\n\nMIKE COLLINS (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Eagle, Columbia. I'm reading you loud and scratchy. Neil's not coming through too well on his VOX.\n\nNARRATOR: Then Eagle's computer began to raise a series of alarms.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Program alarm!\n\nNARRATOR: With so many computations to make, it had become overloaded.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: The danger wasn't the big worry really, it was the complexity. I mean, nobody had ever tried a manned rocket landing before.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN: Neither of us knew what 1202 meant. We knew where we could find the answer, but it was in a document about that thick. And we'd have to leaf through it, and here we are halfway down, landing on the moon. But there's a bunch of guys back on Earth. They can look it up.\n\nNARRATOR: In mission control, the team found an answer in 23 seconds. Ignore the alarm. It's a computer glitch caused by overloading.\n\nBACKROOM MISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): We're go on that flight.\n\nGENE KRANZ (Flight director, Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Roger. We're go on that alarm?\n\nCHARLIE DUKE (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Roger. We've got you, we're go on that alarm.\n\nEagle, Houston. You're go for landing. Over.\n\nNARRATOR: Now just 3,000 feet above the surface, everything hinged on the skill of one man.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: Oh, I was in my bedroom. We were tracking it on a map, as they pointed out, verbally, where they were.\n\nNARRATOR: Low on fuel, Armstrong still needed a safe place to land.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): It was a fairly steep slope, and it was covered with very big rock, and it just wasn't a very good place to land.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Pretty rocky area.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE: The old Neil took over, and he was focused on doing a landing.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN: That was his one opportunity in a lifetime to make a landing on the moon.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Looks like a good area here.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): I wanted to make it as easy for myself as I could.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): I got a good spot here.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Oral History Interview): There was a lot of concern about coming close to running out of fuel.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE (Apollo 11 Mission Audio):\n\nThirty seconds! Thirty seconds!\n\nNARRATOR: Only 30 seconds of fuel remained. Everything depended on Armstrong.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Contact light. Okay, engines stop. We've had shut down.\n\nMISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): We copy you down, Eagle! Stand by for T-One.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: I just jumped up and down and, and screamed and cried and yelled and everything.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\n\nMIKE COLLINS: I was in orbit, of course, when they landed, and I gave a little sigh of relief.\n\nNARRATOR: For Armstrong, this was the culmination of a career that had constantly pushed his flying skills and his nerve to the limit.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: It's almost as if you, if you were going to design the career of somebody who was going to do the first landing on the moon, I can't imagine how you would put together a better mix of experiences than the ones Neil Armstrong had.\n\nNARRATOR: With the astronauts safely down, press attention turned to their wives.\n\nFrom Janet, everyone wanted to know what Neil would say when he first stepped outside.\n\nREPORTER (Clip): Do you have any inkling on what he's going to say? He wouldn't tell us. What he's going to say? He wouldn't tell us.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG (Clip): I've no idea what he's going to say, but whatever he says, I'm sure it will be worthwhile.\n\nNARRATOR: But Armstrong had given it some thought before, as his brother Dean remembers.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: Before he went to the Cape, he invited me down to be with him and to spend a little time with him. He said, “Why don't you and I, when the boys go to bed, play a little game of Risk?” And I said, “Well, I'd enjoy that.”\n\nWe started playing Risk. Then he slipped me a piece of paper and said, “Read that.” And I did, and on that piece of paper there was “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”\n\nHe says, “What do you think about that?” I said, “Fabulous.”\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: People have had so many different versions of when and how Neil thought up those words.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: It was, “That's one small step for a man,” okay?\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: What he said when he came back from the flight was that he had given some thought to it before the mission, but he didn't decide what to say until he and Buzz were on the surface of the moon, in the lunar module, before they got suited up to go outside.\n\nMISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): And we're getting a picture on the T.V.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: It was somewhat difficult to see. It's…I mean, we were watching our sets like this, because we weren't quite sure if he was coming down the step.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Okay, I'm going to step off the L.M. now.\n\nThat's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE: Perfect! It was pure Neil.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN: I was pretty close to him when he said that. He was really surprising in how would say just the right thing at the right time.\n\nDEAN ARMSTRONG: Oh I, it's a… overjoyed, you know? Unbelievable. I've never had such great feelings in my life.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Ain't that something! Magnificent sight out here.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN: Magnificent desolation.\n\nPAT COLLINS (Wife of Mike Collins): Finally, it began to sink in with me, “That really is another planet.”\n\nMISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they are setting up the flag now.\n\nNARRATOR: After years of preparation, the first two human beings on the moon simply marveled at what they were seeing.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): That looks beautiful from here, Neil.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): It has a stark beauty all of its own. It's like much of the high deserts of the United States. It's different, but it's very pretty out here.\n\nNARRATOR: Two and half hours later, the pair had both climbed back inside Eagle.\n\nMISSION CONTROL (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): We'd like to say, from all of us and all the countries in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Apollo 11 Mission Audio): Thank you…Couldn't have enjoyed it as much as we did!\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN: He got me there. He got me back safe. And I, I made a, a couple of mistakes. Fortunately, they, they were not that crucial, and I'm not going to tell you about them.\n\nNARRATOR: A brief period in quarantine would be the crew's only respite before madness erupted. Armstrong, an aeronautical engineer and test pilot from small town America, was suddenly a celebrity.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: We did New York, Chicago and L.A., all in one day. There was thousands and thousands of people, and people from windows above, and apartments and so on. It was fabulous! It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life or ever had done before in my life.\n\nNARRATOR: The schedule was punishing, with the astronauts placed into the role of international ambassadors. With their wives, they visited 23 countries in just 45 days. Their mission now was to shake hands with the world, and everyone was eager to meet the first man on the moon.\n\nPAT COLLINS: We went to each country, and it would be, of course, a huge welcome at the airport, which called for a speech; a huge luncheon or something, which called for a speech; and then there would be the major state dinner, which called for a speech! And I always felt that Neil had the responsibility, the burden, if you will, of always saying the perfect thing. He was the star. But I have to say he had a pretty darn good supporting cast.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: This was the beginning. This was the beginning of it all. But there was nothing you could do, these people were just happy to see you!\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: One of the other Apollo astronauts told me that when it comes to fame, it's like they're all a college football team, and Neil is the only guy in the N.F.L. I mean, he was on another plane.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: People wanted a piece of him, I either “want your autograph,” or “I want my picture taken with you.” And I think that it wasn't just anyone, it was everyone.\n\nNARRATOR: The intense level of intrusion into Armstrong's life would eventually start to take its toll on him and his family.\n\nRICK ARMSTRONG: To be out to dinner, and sort of minding your own business, and to have people coming up to you and going, “Oh, do you know who that is?” Coming over, and “May I have your autograph please?” After a while, even if they do it in the nicest possible way, which many of them did, still, it just wears you out, after a while.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: And he really didn't know what he wanted to do, also. That was a problem: “What am I going to do now?”\n\nNARRATOR: In 1971, Armstrong resigned from NASA. He chose, instead, to pursue his first love, aircraft design, and accepted a professorship at the University of Cincinnati, back in his home state.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: We were looking for a place to live, and he wanted to live out in the country. I guess he wanted to escape people. He wanted privacy.\n\nNARRATOR: The Armstrongs bought this secluded farm, in Ohio. It was a radical change of lifestyle, and not just for Neil.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG: I'm not sure that Mom really wanted the farm life, but she did very well, and she was a trouper.\n\nNARRATOR: Janet found herself managing the farm, as Neil concentrated on teaching, but escaping his fame was never going to be easy.\n\nRON HUSTON (University of Cincinnati): Whenever Neil Armstrong came onto the campus, there was a number of rather interesting reactions.\n\nRALPH SPITZEN (Former Student of Neil Armstrong): Well, the first day was rather chaotic. As class was letting out, the media was massed outside the classroom, and he did, in fact, push the students out of the classroom and then quickly close the door, with himself inside of the classroom.\n\nNARRATOR: Eventually, behind the closed doors of academia, Armstrong found refuge from the constant public spotlight.\n\nRON HUSTON: I began to think of him as simply “Neil,” not as “Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon.” I just thought of him as Neil.\n\nNARRATOR: But outside the university, the burden of celebrity still sat uncomfortably with him.\n\nJANET ARMSTRONG: He was given the credit, and he didn't think he deserved it all.\n\nNARRATOR: Armstrong eventually opted to ration his interview requests, creating, in some minds, the mistaken impression that he was a recluse.\n\nRICK ARMSTRONG: He just didn't feel the need to notify the media about what he was doing, you know, so a “media recluse” maybe, but that's a completely different thing.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1979, Armstrong left the university, becoming involved as a business spokesman and serving on many corporate and philanthropic boards.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: He was doing so many different things with his time, but they were the things that he chose to do, and that didn't include living out his life in front of a television camera.\n\nNARRATOR: And in 1986, he was appointed vice-chair of the Rogers Commission, the committee that investigated the tragic events that led to the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: His calendar was double parked all the time.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG: He was a workaholic, and that was just in his D.N.A. So it was Dad's strong work ethic and Mom's isolation on the farm that eventually came between them.\n\nNARRATOR: Janet and Neil separated in 1990, divorcing four years later.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG: I just think it sort of opened his eyes a little bit and made him aware that, that he didn't have to work all the time. And that was very good for him. It put him in a great position to meet other people.\n\nPAT COLLINS: All the men have certainly, as we say, quietly, “mellowed.” So that they are more relaxed, they are more ready to just spend time doing something just for fun.\n\nNICHELLE NICHOLS (Star Trek): Dr. Neil Armstrong, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (At Star Trek Convention): Thank you, so much! The method we used to descend from orbit to an alien world worked, but it would have been far more efficient and far less traumatic, if we could have just been beamed down!\n\nNARRATOR: But Armstrong was far less sanguine about the direction the real space program was taking and testified before Congress, in 2010.\n\nNEIL ARMSTRONG (Testifying Before Congress/File Footage): If the leadership we have acquired through our investment is simply allowed to fade away, other nations will surely step in where we have faltered.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: I saw in him and in the other Apollo astronauts a frustration that, here we are in the second decade of the 21st century, and we're still confined to those first couple of hundred miles above the earth. And I think it was a source of frustration to him.\n\nNARRATOR: Armstrong turned 80 in 2010, and, to mark the occasion, his second wife, Carol Knight, planned a celebration.\n\nCAROL KNIGHT (Neil Armstrong's Second Wife):\n\nI thought we could have a surprise party, and it would be a lot of fun. And I had about 250 people on the list.\n\nI think he was surprised. He put on a good act if he wasn't.\n\nKOTCHO SOLACOFF: After almost everybody had left and I went up to him and congratulated him on his birthday and everything, and, and he hugged me. And he says, “You know I love you,” and I said, “I do too, Neil. We go back a long way,” He said, “Yes, we do.” And that was the last time.\n\nNARRATOR: On the 7th of August, 2012, Neil Armstrong was admitted to the hospital for heart surgery. He remained there until his death on August 25th.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG: If there's a legacy, I think he may have left it already. He very much wanted the exploration of space to be an accomplishment that was important for, for this planet and everyone on it.\n\nCHARLIE DUKE: His inspiration to the generations that will follow is incalculable, I believe.\n\nRICK ARMSTRONG: It's overwhelming to think about how much has come from that inspiration.\n\nMARK ARMSTRONG: If there was something that he could pass along to, you know, future generations, I think it would be the conviction to do the right thing.\n\nANDY CHAIKIN: I mean, he went to the moon. He risked his life for the nation for a, a mission of national importance, and he did it superbly. And that would be reason enough to call Neil Armstrong a hero. But, for me, the thing that really stands out is how he handled this role that fate gave him of being a world icon.\n\nJUNE HOFFMAN: One thing, he was true to himself. He was the man that you saw. That was him.",
  "latent_18210": "Obituary Victor Poor, whose death was announced this weekend, isn’t one of the first names to come to mind among computing history, but he played a pivotal role in the development of Intel's early architectures that went on to dominate modern computing and is a legend in ham radio circles.\n\nPoor, along with fellow radio enthusiast and student Harry Pyle, designed what became Intel's 4004 chip, on Thanksgiving weekend in 1969 – sketching out the architecture in his living room in a marathon four-day session. He also played a key role in working with Intel on the 8008 chip, the world’s first 8-bit microprocessor.\n\nBorn in 1933, in the midst of the last Great Depression, Poor showed an early interest in technology, describing himself in a 2004 interview with the Computer History Unit's oral history division as a \"natural-born nerd\" who lived for ham radio.\n\nAfter a stint in the US Navy following World War II he qualified for naval electronic school before working on the first Univac systems and the Packard Bell 250 computer. He recalled that the Univacs, with their delicate construction of vacuum tubes and liquid mercury memory, were prone to breaking down every 90 minutes or so, so any programming had to be quick and correct. The team was working on a computer program for air traffic control at the time, which caused him some concern for the safety of passengers coming in to land.\n\nThe same reliability problems of analogue computing dogged his next job as a field engineer for Raytheon, fixing up the Sparrow III air-to-air missile. The missile's control systems relied on the analogue circuitry and vacuum tubes and \"didn't work very well,\" he recalls, particularly in tropical parts of the world.\n\nIn 1959 he left to start up what became Fredrick Electronics with $100,000 in VC funding. Much in the same way as Hewlett and Packard, Frederick was a radio and telecommunications engineering shop, working on military and commercial communications and building some of the first reliable telex systems capable of transmitting images and sound.\n\nOccasionally these products were accidental. Inspired by his ham radio systems, Poor built a machine to convert teletype into Morse code. This was just something he was noodling with, but a visiting US Navy officer saw it and insisted on ordering some, and eventually the company sold huge numbers of machines that could convert Morse code into teletype and vice versa, eventually achieving transmission speeds of 300 words per minute.\n\nBut these devices were still analog and weren't programmable, running purely off ROM memory. This led to significant reliability problems. While machine to machine communications were reasonably reliable, the tapping style (or fist) of a human Morse code operator could completely flummox the machines.\n\nAfter the company was bought out by Plantronics, Poor turned his mind to integrated circuitry, and joined Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), a startup by two NASA engineers. The company pitched Intel and Texas Instruments to build the 4004 processor design he and Pyles had developed and used it in a range of teletype machines based around integrated circuitry.\n\nPoor also worked with Intel on the next generation of processors, which became the 8008 line that helped spur Chipzilla's massive growth. CTC again asked Intel and TI to try and build the chip, eventually using most of Intel's offering but with its own tweaks. Intel bought the rights to the hardware in exchange for writing off its original $50,000 fee.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the design of early computer hardware Poor was very modest about his input, typically shifting the praise to fellow engineers who also worked on the project. Patenting such systems wasn't also something he had much time for and he appeared to regret the current mania for owning every new technology in a legally binding way.\n\nCTC was renamed Datapoint and developed its own processing systems under Poor's guidance. But the company decided not to follow IBM's move into the personal computer market, for fear that it would undercut its own highly- profitable business – a decision Poor personally disagreed with.\n\nHe retired in 1984, saying the company had got too big and he wasn't having fun anymore. For someone with more experience than most in the field, he described himself as still clueless about how to run a technology company efficiently, saying he felt too much like Dilbert's pointy-haired manager.\n\n\"I've often thought about what's the good way to organize a company and I've come to the conclusion there is no good way,\" he said. \"No matter what we did, you know, at Datapoint we tried all kinds of schemes, we did skunkworks projects and we had separate departments and we merged departments and we unmerged departments and no matter what we did there was always something wrong.\"\n\nHe professed irritation with management guru Tom Peters, who interviewed him and other Datapoint management for the book In Search of Excellence. Peters misrepresented the management process, he said, making it out to be easy.\n\n\"I didn’t even recognize myself in there. He made it look like we were geniuses and it just is not true. It’s just not true,\" he said.\n\nAfter stepping down from Datapoint, Poor and his family spent much of their time sailing in the US, Mexico and Europe. While on board he developed a communication system that married amateur radio stations transmissions and messaging servers to allow a basic email, graphics, and data transmission, which is still used by over 100,000 hams today.\n\nIn May, Poor was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer and he died on Friday in Florida. He is survived by Florence, his wife of 60 years, and their two children. ®",

  "latent_18231": "TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2012 — A man with a sparking smile can certainly lure the ladies, but a gentleman wishing to maintain his sex life should hold on to his toothbrush, according to a new study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, that finds a correlation between gum disease and erectile dysfunction.\n\nResearchers at the University of Malatya in Turkey looked at 160 men, ages 30 to 40 years old, half of whom had erectile dysfunction. Among the impotent men, 53 percent were also found to have inflamed gums, compared with 23 percent in the control group. The average age of men in this study was under 36.\n\nThe researchers used the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction, a questionnaire that assesses a patient's sexual behaviors and function.\n\nAfter adjusting the findings for weight, age, body mass index, household income, and education level, the researchers found that men with periodontal disease were 3.29 percent more likely to report problems maintaining an erection than those who had healthy gums.\n\n\"It's clear to us you're not healthy unless you're periodontally healthy,\" says Don Clem, DDS, past president of the American Academy of Periodontology and board-certified periodontist in Fullerton, Calif.\n\nChronic periodontitis — inflammation of gums caused by the accumulation of dental plaque — has been linked to cardiovascular disease. Late stages of periodontal disease include swollen and bleeding gums, chronic bad breath, and tooth separation and loss.\n\nNumerous studies and surveys have found men tend to slack off on oral hygiene, visit a dentist less frequently, and are more likely to develop gum disease. According to the Academy of General Dentistry, men are less likely than women to seek preventive dental care for years at a time, and may only visit a dentist when their oral health takes a turn for the worse. One study found that the average man will lose 5.4 teeth by age 72, while men who smoke may lose up to 12 teeth by age 72.\n\nBut Dr. Clem says good hygiene habits are only part of the picture, and not flossing regularly won't necessarily mean a low success rate in bed. He says some people may be more likely to develop dental problems because they are more susceptible to the oral bacteria and genetically disposed gum disease.\n\nSystemic Inflammation From Your Teeth\n\nAn ever-growing body research has found oral health greatly influences a person's overall health, and good oral hygiene can reduce one's risk for developing numerous chronic health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. Erectile dysfunction has also been linked to these chronic conditions, as well as low testosterone.\n\nThough researchers say they excluded men from their study who had a history of other serious diseases, Kevin Billups, MD, a urologist and director of the Men's Innovative Health Program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says most doctors agree it's impossible to ignore the relationship.\n\n\"Gum disease can be a sign of a more systemic disease caused by inflammation,\" says Dr. Billups. He added that he was most struck by the age of the study subjects, since a young patient who reports impotence is \"greatly at risk for having a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years.\"\n\nDentists like Clem pay attention to more than oral health. \"It used to be the mouth was something separate from the body, but lo and behold! It's connected. It's not one disease, it's a whole host of other diseases. These chronic diseases are not isolated, there's a connection between all of them,\" he says.",

Kidnapped or possibly killed.\"Assange also told the Times he fears he'll be killed if he ever leaves his shelter at the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has been since 2012, after seeking asylum to avoid extradition.After Snowden leaked an extensive cache of intelligence documents to British journalist Glenn Greenwald two years ago. WikiLeaks became involved in helping him evade U.S. authorities. One of Assange's most senior staff members, Sarah Harrison, was sent to Hong Kong to be with Snowden and to help him flee to Russia.Snowden's story differs with reports from the time, which called for bringing Snowden out of Russia and sending him to Ecuador. However, Ecuador President Rafael Correa said a temporary travel document that was issued in London in collaboration with Assange was invalid after other diplomats said they feared Assange would be perceived as being in charge.Assange told the Times that he also fears being targeted, and he's had bomb and assassination threats and fears he'll be kidnapped by the CIA.\"I'm a white guy,\" Assange said. \"Unless I convert to Islam it's not that likely that I'll be droned, but we have seen things creeping towards that.\"Assange also fears extradition to the United States and to Sweden.

  "latent_18258": "On Thursday, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Obama administration’s request to list the polar bear as merely threatened, not endangered, under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe decision was disappointing to both environmental groups who wanted the extra protections an endangered classification would afford, as well as industry interest who wanted the polar bear removed from the list altogether.\n\nIn his 116-page opinion (pdf), U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan of the District of Columbia wrote that he was “persuaded that the listing rule survives this highly deferential standard” and that the plaintiffs challenging the listing “have failed to demonstrate that the agency’s listing determination rises to the level of irrationality.”\n\nSullivan nevertheless made it clear in his opinion that he had some sympathy for environmental groups, such as the Center for Biological Diversity, which had argued that the science on global warming could have supported a finding that the bear was endangered.\n\n“Certainly, where global warming has been identified as the primary threat to the polar bear’s sea ice habitat and the agency has acknowledged that the global warming trend is unlikely to reverse itself, a conclusion that the species is … ‘in danger of extinction’ has undeniable appeal,” Sullivan wrote in a footnote.\n\nThe issue of polar bear protections is complicated by many political factors, including the effects of human-induced climate change and the petroleum industry’s desire to conduct offshore drilling operations in the delicate Beaufort and Chukchi seas. So far, these operations have been put on hold because there is currently no technology available to clean up a catastrophic oil spill in the icy Alaskan waters.\n\nAccording to Polar Bear International (PBI), “scientists have concluded that the threat to polar bears is ecological change in the Arctic from global warming. Polar bears depend on sea ice for hunting, breeding, and in some cases, denning. Summer ice loss in the Arctic now equals an area the size of Alaska, Texas, and the state of Washington combined.”\n\nUnfortunately, the decision to list the polar bear as threatened rather than endangered was one that Obama inherited from the Bush administration, including a strategic caveat which prevents any interpretation of the bears’ threatened status to trigger climate change pollution regulation.\n\nEarthjustice reports that the Obama administration is poised to make decisions in the coming months that threaten long-lasting and irreparable damage to the Arctic. It will decide whether to let stand Bush-era oil leases covering millions of acres in the Chukchi Sea. And it will decide whether to allow Shell Oil Co., the world’s second largest corporation, to embark on an aggressive oil drilling plan in Arctic seas starting in 2012.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nShell’s Arctic Drilling Plans Face Further Delays\n\nPolar Bear Swims For 9 Days Before Finding Ice\n\nPolar Bear Bones Weakened By Pollutants\n\nSource: NY Times",

  "latent_18676": "Statement from the Texas NORML Board\n\nWritten by David Bass\n\nThe ultimate goal of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) is to legalize marijuana in all fifty states. NORML’s mission statement is as follows: “NORML’s mission is to move public opinion sufficiently to legalize the responsible use of marijuana by adults, and to serve as an advocate for consumers to assure they have access to high quality marijuana that is safe, convenient and affordable.”\n\nTexas NORML shares this goal. Our ultimate goal is to legalize marijuana in Texas. Our mission statement is as follows: “Texas NORML’s mission is to move public opinion sufficiently to achieve the repeal of marijuana prohibition so that the responsible use of cannabis by adults is no longer subject to penalty.” Our goal is a system of licensed growers, licensed production facilities for marijuana products and licensed retail outlets for selling marijuana to consumers aged 21 and above strictly regulated by the state of Texas.\n\nTexas NORML also supports establishing a medical marijuana program in Texas that allows doctors to write recommendations for marijuana for qualifying medical conditions and licenses growers and medical dispensaries. We believe that patients with qualifying medical conditions and a recommendation written by a medical doctor should have legal access to medical marijuana. We believe that lawfully designated caregivers should be legally protected from prosecution for assisting patients with using medical marijuana.\n\nTexas NORML will achieve these goals by working within the political framework of the state of Texas. We will leverage our legal status as a 501(c)4 nonprofit to educate citizens in Texas about marijuana, recruit citizens to join our organization and lobby our legislators to change unjust laws. There should be no conflict between the goals of legalizing marijuana for recreational use by responsible adults and establishing a strictly regulated medical marijuana program. The recreational marijuana system would allow responsible adults who choose to use cannabis to purchase the product from safe, well-regulated sources licensed by the state of Texas. The medical marijuana system would allow patients with recommendations from doctors to have access to a legal source of cannabis for medical conditions designated by the state of Texas.\n\nWe welcome patients and recreational users of marijuana to Texas NORML. We will work together to establish a legally controlled market for marijuana in Texas where citizens can purchase marijuana from safe legal sources.",

  "latent_19445": "OTTAWA—Fewer Canadians are being turned away at the U.S. land border in recent months despite mounting concerns that Donald Trump’s immigration policies are making it much harder to cross, The Canadian Press has learned. Refusals of Canadians at American land crossings dropped 8.5 per cent between October and the end of February compared with the same five-month period a year earlier, according to U.S. government statistics.\n\nThis 2013 file photo shows the U.S. Border Station in Highgate Springs, Vt., seen coming from Canada. Despite recent anecdotal reports of Canadians being denied entry into the United States, new statistics show the number of travellers from Canada being refused at land borders has dropped. ( Glenn Russell / The Burlington Free Press via the Associated Press )\n\nThe total number of Canadian travellers denied entry also dropped: 6,875 out of 12,991,027 were refused entry, a refusal rate of 0.05 per cent. Between October 2015 and February 2016, 7,619 out of 13,173,100 Canadian travellers were denied entry to the U.S., a refusal rate of 0.06 per cent. Read the latest on U.S. President Donald Trump\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe figures, confirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, contrast with recent anecdotal reports of Canadians denied entry into the U.S., with many placing the blame on the policies of the Trump administration, including its controversial attempts to ban arrivals from several predominantly Muslim countries. A further breakdown of the border data shows a sharp drop in Canadian refusals at the U.S. border in the first two months of this year as 2,600 Canadian travellers were denied entry, compared with 3,500 for the same two-month period of 2016. But Canadian immigration and civil liberties advocates caution the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman said he is fielding more calls than ever from people planning a trip to the U.S. and wanting to make sure they have the paperwork they need. The decreased rate of refusal could be just that people are now better prepared than they used to be, and so fewer are being turned away as a result, he said. “People in Canada used to take it for granted that they could just go to the border ... but that’s no longer the case,” he said.\n\n“The heightened awareness because of all the publicity around immigration has led people to be much more cautious about crossing the border.” The new U.S. data doesn’t disclose the specific reasons for refusals; there are more than 60 reasons someone can be turned away and so it’s not clear whether there’s been a change in why people are being turned back. In the wake of Trump’s first executive order governing immigration, 200 Canadian participants in the Canada-U.S. trusted traveller program NEXUS did have their express-entry cards temporarily revoked, but it was never clear whether they were also denied entry to the U.S. or were allowed in after going through normal security screening measures.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe fact that the numbers overall of people crossing the border are also down suggests more are also just staying home, Waldman said, a fact born out in recent days as a number of groups announced they were cancelling cross border trips. Among them is Canada’s largest school board which said Thursday it would stop the planning of future field trips to the U.S. indefinitely because of uncertainty about possible border restrictions. The Toronto District School Board, which has 245,000 public school students, said it made the “difficult decision” because it believes students “should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border.” For now, the board said it would carry on with 24 U.S. previously planned trips, but says all students will turn back if any students with appropriate documentation are turned away. Earlier this month, Girl Guides of Canada said it would move pre-emptively to avoid uncertainty at the border by cancelling trips to the U.S. The organization said changes in U.S. travel regulations made it uncertain whether all Girl Guides will be able to enter the country, so it decided instead that none would travel. How many people are being turned away isn’t the only concern, said Brenda McPhail, director of the privacy, technology and surveillance project at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. “The other concern is that there’s been an increase in temporary detentions and increasingly invasive searches, including searches of electronic devices,” she said. “And so the numbers don’t say anything about whether or not the number of searches have increased, (or) whether or not the amount of time that people are being detained at the border before they are being let through has changed.” The new U.S. Homeland Security chief, retired general John Kelly, told The Canadian Press earlier this month that if a traveller is stopped for additional screening, or is turned away, it may be because his name has turned up on a watch list, or there is a problem with his credentials. “There is a reason why,” he said. “It’s not their race, it’s not their religion, it’s not the language they speak.”\n\nRead more about:",

But a new 7-minute documentary gives us an even more detailed (and terrifying) peek at just what happened that night on February 20, 1939.\n\nThe documentary, produced by Field of Vision and directed by two-time Oscar nominee Marshall Curry, collects for the first time all the known footage of the event. And it’s really quite fascinating to watch Nazis pledge their undying allegiance to the American flag one minute, and give a Nazi salute the next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When I found out that it had been filmed, I asked an archival researcher, Rich Remsberg, to see what he could find,” Curry says in a new Q&A about the film.\n\n“It turned out that short clips had been used in history documentaries before, but no one seemed to have collected together all of the scraps of footage—there was some at the National Archives, some at UCLA’s archive, some at other places,” Curry continued.\n\nThe entire 7-minute film, titled “A Night at the Garden,” is available for free on Vimeo. And it’s really quite a disturbing artifact from an era when far too many Americans were cozy with the Nazi regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documentary is simple, but there’s also a good deal of artistry in not only the music, but the ways in which the shots are presented.\n\nWhen a protester storms the stage the first thing you notice is the obvious savagery of the Nazis beating up the man. But the director zooms in on things to help focus your eye, and the less obvious becomes even more grotesque. Case in point, we see a young Nazi child mock the way that the man ran, clearly delighted that there was violence happening just a few feet away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the slow motion take of the protester being both beat up and carted away is devastating for those of us in 2017 who know that the brutal torture and murder of the Nazi concentration camps are well underway across the Atlantic.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\n“We’d like to think that when Nazism rose up, all Americans were instantly appalled,” Curry says about the era. “But while the vast majority of Americans were appalled by the Nazis, there was also a significant group of Americans who were sympathetic to their white supremacist, anti-Semitic message.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the video you can read an interview with director Marshall Curry here.",

The General Assembly has declared April 29 \"Missing Persons Day.\"\n\nToni Jacobs knows what it's like. She wants as many people as possible to see her daughter's picture.\n\n\"I'm looking for that one person. Just that one person to see it and be like, 'Hold on, I saw that girl,'\" she said.\n\nHer daughter, 21-year-old Keeshae Jacobs, was last seen in Richmond last September. She hasn't been heard from since.\n\nJacobs says a day like \"Missing Persons Day\" means a lot to her and others who are in the same situation.\n\n\"It just warms my heart because I know these other kids don't want to be forgotten,\" she said. \"I don't want nobody to know they went missing without anybody noticing.\"\n\nWhile grieving the disappearance of her daughter, Jacobs was hit with another blow. Her son, Deavon Jacobs, was murdered in January.\n\nIt's been a tough last seven months, but Jacobs has faith her daughter will come home.\n\n\"I had dreams about that. That I saw her and she walked through the door and I ran to her and cried and held her,\" she said. \"And then I was like, she's never leaving home! She's going to be sleeping in the bed with me until she's 50.\"\n\nThough this year will be the first \"Missing Persons Day\" in Virginia, the resolution states it is an annual declaration.\n\nThe nonprofit Help Save The Next Girl is hosting an event to mark the day. It will be in conjunction with the Roanoke Police Department, National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) and other organizations.\n\nThe event is at the Roanoke Police Training Academy on April 29 from 12 to 4 p.m. More information is available here.\n\nHelp Save The Next Girl was founded by Morgan Harrington's parents.

I’m just glad my friend Jennifer Bishop grabbed me and got me to join her.\n\nAs everyone knows (or if you don’t, I’ll quickly tell you) this is the annual ride to benefit Bike Maryland that showcases everything from local historical sites to old-time Baltimore neighborhoods to post-industrial toxic landscapes.\n\nWe got some of each, plus some pretty natural scenery, on the ride we chose out of the four available – the 31-mile “Port to Peninsula” route.\n\nIndustrial and Post\n\nIf you want to burn calories and get a crash course in Baltimore’s industrial history, this is the tour for you.\n\nThere was the hulking abandoned Seagrams distillery on Sollers Point Road in Dundalk, covered with graffiti and awaiting (apparently) demolition and a transformation into 187 townhouses.\n\nAlso massive, but new and thriving, was the Amazon warehouse on Broening Highway.\n\n(Could someone who works there please tell me if it’s true what I’ve heard: that you are supposed to box something every 10 seconds?)\n\nThere were neat-as-a-pin neighborhoods where you could hear the sound of backyard man-caves cranking up with pre-Ravens game coverage and catch the scent of pre-game meat grilling.\n\nAt historic North Point Park, we could look out on the windswept Patapsco River and munch the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, apples and bananas provided by tour organizers.\n\nAnd beyond all that, we whizzed through open country (fields of soybeans, their brown pods looking ready to harvest) and patches of dense forest at the Black Marsh Natural Area.\n\nFrom the end of Cuckold Point Road, you can get a good view of Hart-Miller Island. Back at Canton Waterfront Park there were food trucks dispensing burgers and bibimbap and frosty cans of Fat Tire amber ale.\n\nA Flattened Sparrows\n\nLooming large, though, on this ride was a chance to get a look at what remains of a place The Brew has covered extensively in its final years, the steel mill at Sparrows Point.\n\nOur route took us right behind the site of the old 68-inch strip mill and tinplate complex. Where grime-covered structures once spewed out endless coils of razor-thin steel today lies a plateau of weeds and bush bisected by railroad sidings.\n\nThe rail access has been preserved by the new owners, Sparrows Point Terminal LLC, for the peninsula’s re-purposing as an “advanced manufacturing” assembly area fed by semi-finished products coming from harborside docks that once handled boats bearing iron ore from Labrador and Venezuela.\n\n“The Point” operated for over 120 years until its longtime owner, Bethlehem Steel, went bankrupt and a series of opportunistic operators failed to stem the plant’s losses.\n\nIn May 2012, RG Steel declared bankruptcy, 2,000 employees were dismissed and the property was sold to Midwest salvage operators.\n\nThe latest owner, a group controlled by Jim Davis, a cousin and former business partner of Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, has high hopes for a new era at “The Point” as a manufacturing and distribution hub.\n\nHaving lost most of its steel underpinnings, the peninsula is now undergoing environmental remediation – yet another metamorphosis of the Baltimore harborfront that our bike-eye view made up-front and personal yesterday.\n\n– Mark Reutter contributed to this story.",
  "latent_20000": "Mapping “The Hunger Games”: Using location quotients to find the Districts of Panem\n\n|\n\n“…Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America.” –The Hunger Games (Scholastic Press)\n\nIn The Hunger Games, author Suzanne Collins never reveals the exact locations of the Districts of Panem. What if you could map them by using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)?\n\nFans of the popular The Hunger Games trilogy know that the stories are set in Panem, a futuristic area previously called North America, with a capital located somewhere in what was known as the Rockies. Panem is divided into districts, each of which has a primary industry. BLS employment data can help you solve the puzzle of where in North America those districts would be.\n\nKeep reading to learn how to use BLS data to identify 12 districts of Panem. Because BLS data cover the United States, this article uses clues from U.S. locations rather than from North America as a whole.\n\nFinding data: Total employment and location quotients\n\nEach district’s primary industry offers the best evidence of its geographic location. To find where an industry has a high concentration of workers, look at employment data by industry and occupation. Industry employment data tell you how many workers are in a particular type of firm or group of firms; occupation employment data tell you how many workers do a similar set of tasks.\n\nTwo BLS sources of employment data that will help in your analysis are the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) programs. QCEW data show industry employment and are provided here at the county level. OES data for occupation employment are shown here for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan statistical areas.\n\nTotal employment. Total employment can show you where lots of workers are in an industry or occupation. But the total number employed also may highlight areas where there are a lot of workers in every industry or occupation, such as large cities. Identifying a large number of workers doesn’t give you enough information for locating the districts.\n\nInstead, you want to find where there are high concentrations of workers in a particular industry or occupation compared with the nation as a whole. For that, you’ll need the location quotient.\n\nLocation quotient. The location quotient is a ratio of the percentage of workers in an industry or occupation in a certain area to the percentage of workers in that industry or occupation nationally. A location quotient greater than 1.0 indicates a higher-than-average concentration for an industry or occupation.\n\nFor example, according to the 2015 OES estimates, actors make up .0367 percent of national employment. However, more than one-third of all actor employment is concentrated in California and makes up .1103 percent of that state’s total employment. To calculate the location quotient for actors in California, you divide the percentage of the occupation’s employment in California (.1103) by the percentage of employment nationally (.0367) to get a ratio of 3.01—indicating a higher-than-average concentration of actors in California. (See illustration.)\n\nFinding District 12: Coal mining\n\n“Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here.” –The Hunger Games\n\nTo use data to find the districts of Panem, you’ll need to look for areas with the highest location quotients for the industries and occupations associated with each district. Begin with the district in which Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of The Hunger Games, lived.\n\nIndustry location quotients. Using QCEW annual averages for 2015, chart 1 ranks the counties with the highest location quotients for the coal mining industry. Mingo County, West Virginia, had the highest location quotient.\n\nIn the United States, there were 64,135 workers in the coal mining industry out of 139,491,699 total workers, or about .05 percent. In Mingo County, there were 1,216 workers in the coal mining industry out of 5,563 total workers. Thus, (1,216/5,563) × 100 percent, or about 22 percent, of the workers in Mingo County were employed in coal mining.\n\nView Chart Data Chart 1. Counties with the highest location quotients in the coal mining industry, 2015 County Location quotient Mingo County, West Virginia 475.42 Boone County, West Virginia 474.38 Campbell County, Wyoming 390.57 Greene County, Pennsylvania 386.95 Buchanan County, Virginia 320.3 Martin County, Kentucky 253.99 Logan County, West Virginia 244.36 Perry County, Kentucky 218.08 Leslie County, Kentucky 211.69 Carbon County, Utah 146.01\n\nTo get the location quotient, divide the percentage of workers in coal mining in Mingo County (22) by the percentage nationally (.05). The result is a ratio of 440. (The data used to calculate this number were rounded to simplify the math, so the value shown here differs from the value shown in chart 1.) In other words, Mingo County has more than 400 times the concentration of coal mining employment nationally.\n\nMapping the industry location quotients shows a concentration of coal mining in an area that encompasses Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. (See map.)\n\nView Chart Data Map 1. Location quotients by county for the coal mining industry, 2015 County Location quotient Mingo County, West Virginia 475.42 Boone County, West Virginia 474.38 Campbell County, Wyoming 390.57 Greene County, Pennsylvania 386.95 Buchanan County, Virginia 320.3 Martin County, Kentucky 253.99 Logan County, West Virginia 244.36 Perry County, Kentucky 218.08 Leslie County, Kentucky 211.69 Carbon County, Utah 146.01 Raleigh County, West Virginia 120.77 Letcher County, Kentucky 116.29 Bell County, Kentucky 107.4 Pike County, Indiana 85.7 Nicholas County, West Virginia 59.23 Warrick County, Indiana 45.27 Johnson County, Kentucky 40.15 Kanawha County, West Virginia 26.02 Clearfield County, Pennsylvania 19.47 Jefferson County, Pennsylvania 15.02 Knox County, Kentucky 9.68 Jefferson County, Alabama 7.99 Cambria County, Pennsylvania 6.16 Harrison County, West Virginia 5.64 Northumberland County, Pennsylvania 4.99 Luzerne County, Pennsylvania 3.96 Butler County, Pennsylvania 2.48 Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania 1.19 Stark County, Ohio 0.19 Centre County, Pennsylvania 0.19 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania 0.05 Harris County, Texas 0.01\n\nOccupation location quotients. In addition to using industry data to see where coal mining employment is concentrated, you can use occupation data to search for District 12. Occupation employment in the coal mining industry helps you find the occupation in which that industry is the largest employer.\n\nAs table 1 shows, nearly all mine shuttle car operators worked in the coal mining industry in 2015. Mine shuttle car operators use shuttle cars to transport materials in underground mines. Location quotients for mine shuttle car operators are a good indicator of where mining activity is concentrated.\n\nTable 1. Occupations in which the coal mining industry is the largest employer, 2015 Occupation Percent of occupation in coal mining Total employment Employment in coal mining Mine shuttle car operators 93.5 2,310 2,160 Roof bolters, mining 93.1 5,220 4,860 Loading machine operators, underground mining 60.7 3,210 1,950 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics.\n\nUsing the 2015 OES estimates, chart 2 ranks the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas with the highest location quotients for mine shuttle car operators. With a location quotient of 163.50, the Southern West Virginia nonmetropolitan area had the highest location quotient for mine shuttle car operators. This nonmetropolitan area comprises many counties, including Mingo County.\n\nView Chart Data Chart 2. Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas with the highest location quotients for mine shuttle car operators, 2015 Area Location quotient Southern West Virginia nonmetropolitan area 163.50 Beckley, West Virginia 129.21 West Kentucky nonmetropolitan area 115.49 East Kentucky nonmetropolitan area 108.35 Northern West Virginia nonmetropolitan area 72.26 Western Pennsylvania nonmetropolitan area 64.46 Eastern Utah nonmetropolitan area 43.92 Southwest Wyoming nonmetropolitan area 35.43 Southwest Colorado nonmetropolitan area 22.34\n\nConclusion. On the basis of statistical evidence, District 12 is most likely located in an area comprising parts of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. This tristate area is where employment in the coal mining industry and its associated occupations are concentrated.\n\nFinding other districts: Your turn\n\nEvery district of Panem has a dominant industry. Profiles for each district use QCEW and OES data; links to these industry profiles for each district are given below. The data may provide clues, but results are open to interpretation. Using these data, create your own map of Panem.\n\n“And may the odds be ever in your favor.” –The Hunger Games\n\nDistrict 1: Luxury goods\n\nDistrict 2: Rock quarrying\n\nDistrict 3: Electronic goods manufacturing\n\nDistrict 4: Fishing\n\nDistrict 5: Power generation\n\nDistrict 6: Transportation manufacturing\n\nDistrict 7: Lumber\n\nDistrict 8: Textiles\n\nDistrict 9: Grain\n\nDistrict 10: Livestock\n\nDistrict 11: Crops\n\nDistrict 12: Coal mining\n\nDistrict 1\n\nLuxury goods\n\nNote: The North American Industry Classification System groups this industry under “other miscellaneous manufacturing.”\n\nView Chart Data Chart 3.

The fancy mangoes flown in from India. I am not sure whether they will be coming to Houston, but it does not matter. There are cheap and plentiful Mexican Ataulfos to be found. Last week, we picked up a whole case for $5. (We split it with a friend to keep our eating crop fresh. I know we’ll be replenishing a few times, no worries)\n\nWe tend to keep the mangoes plain and unadorned (at least I do, Rob adds it to his breakfast granola) but used some frozen mangoes for this fun twist on chana masala. It kind of a combination of my Mango BBQ Beans combined with Indian flavours. While I have used amchoor powder (raw mango powder) to make a nice chana masala, this was a fun twist since it was hot and sweet, too. The heat came from our newest infatuation: roasted hatch chiles. The flavours complemented each other nicely, especially with the tang from the tomatoes and the earthy tones from the cumin, mustard seeds and garam masala, too. Not too overly spiced.\n\nRob actually made a double batch of this and we shared it with friends. We told them to give an honest opinion of the dish. It was the first time we tried it, so we could handle their feedback. Like us, they loved it! And I hope you do, too.\n\nHere’s to a prosperous mango season!\n\nThis is my submission to this month’s Bookmarked Recipes and this week’s Souper Sundays.\n\nMango Chana Masala\n\nAdapted from Peachy Palate\n\n1 tbsp coconut oil, or oil of choice\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\n1/2 tsp mustard seeds\n\n1 medium onion, chopped\n\n1/2 tsp minced fresh garlic\n\n1.5 tsp fresh ginger, grated\n\n1/2 tsp ground cumin\n\n3/4 tsp garam masala\n\n3/4 tsp ground coriander\n\n1/4 tsp ground turmeric\n\n1/4 tsp sea salt, or to taste\n\n14 oz can diced tomatoes, juices included\n\n1/2 4-oz can roasted hatch chiles\n\n1.5 tsp tomato paste\n\n2 cups cooked chickpeas, rinsed and drained if canned\n\n1/2 cup pureed mango\n\ncooked rice, to serve\n\n1. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Once hot, reduce heat to medium-low and add cumin and mustard seeds. Cover and shake occasionally, being careful the seeds to do not fly away or burn.\n\n2. Raise the heat to medium and stir in the onion, sauteing for 5 minutes, until softened. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, around 1-2 minutes. Add the ground cumin, garam masala, coriander, turmeric, salt, and cook for 2 minutes more.\n\n3. Deglaze with the tomatoes (including their juices) and stir to combine. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Add the chickpeas and hatch chiles, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes until slightly thickened. Stir in mango puree.\n\n4.

  "latent_20202": "Only four years ago – as if anyone can have forgotten – Rob Ford plunged Toronto into its biggest political scandal in memory when he admitted to smoking crack cocaine. City council stripped him of many of his powers. Now his successor as mayor, John Tory, backs naming a sports stadium after him. Seldom has history had such a rapid whitewash.\n\nWe name things after past leaders to honour them. Rob Ford does not remotely deserve such an honour. He brought disgrace to the city. His tragic death from cancer last year does not erase what he did.\n\nThe proposal to name Centennial Park stadium after Mr. Ford is backed by his family, still a big political force in the suburb of Etobicoke. Mr. Tory says the family was pushing for a decision. He decided that naming the stadium after his predecessor was the right thing to do, especially given Mr. Ford's years as a football coach.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nRead more: John Tory recommends Centennial Park stadium be renamed to honour Rob Ford\n\nAnd the scandal? \"We all have things that may or not have been, you know, our best days, but he gave a big part of his life to public service,\" the mayor said on Thursday. He said he wants to \"put politics to one side\" and acknowledge Mr. Ford's contribution.\n\nBut it is not political to believe that Mr. Ford did wrong. It is factual. Mr. Ford used drugs while preaching to youth about the dangers of drug use. He associated with gang members while vowing to crack down on crime. He was caught making a series of ugly slurs. He refused to admit his crack use for months after the scandal broke. He said that those who pressed him for answers about his behaviour were nothing more than vultures.\n\nThe world wasn't \"out to get\" Mr. Ford. He brought his troubles on himself.\n\nThis was not just a matter of having a few bad days. Mr. Tory's forgiving tone has echoes of the line taken by many Ford supporters: that all of us have our flaws. To them, their hero was no less heroic because of his slip ups, which simply made him more human.\n\nIt is understandable that Mr. Tory wants to strike a note of reconciliation. There is nothing wrong with trying to see the good in others. But remember that Mr. Ford's brother Doug has announced he is running for mayor against Mr. Tory next year. He is running at least in part on the memory of his late brother. Burnishing that memory is part of the game.\n\nIt is one thing for Ford supporters to ask others not to harp on what the late mayor did, now that he is gone. It is quite another to ask city hall to slap his name on the side of a public stadium. That suggests that all is forgiven and forgotten. It shouldn't be. Toronto shouldn't entertain a revisionist version of Mr. Ford: the hard-working, well-meaning regular guy who just happened to have a weakness. The truth, as usual, is rawer than that.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPerhaps Mr. Tory's advisers wanted to avoid giving ammunition to the Fords. Perhaps they felt that denying the family's request to name the stadium after Mr. Ford would anger Ford followers and hurt the Tory campaign. Easier, some might say, just to go along with the renaming and head off a fight on the issue. What harm can it do to name a suburban stadium after a popular local boy who made it all the way to the mayor's office, even if he strayed from the straight and narrow?\n\nThe harm is to history. The Ford scandal happened. It is a mistake to minimize it. It is wrong to honour the dishonourable.",

Tuesday was no different.\n\nWhile the rest of the country ousted incumbents and took out its rage against Democrats generally, Californians voted resoundingly for experience - and for Democrats. A three-term Democratic senator, Barbara Boxer, beat back a strong challenge from Republican Carly Fiorina. Voters said yes to Jerry Brown - who's not just a Democrat but also a former governor with a political history that stretches back for decades. While the rest of the country threw the dice on Tea Party upstarts and political newbies, Californians chose stability and longevity.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about California's outlier status is that the voters weren't swayed by plays on fear - even though the state's unemployment rate, nearly 13 percent, is one of the highest in the nation. Voters were unmoved by the argument that the state's landmark climate-change law is a \"job-killer,\" and they said no to Proposition 23 with a resounding 59.2 percent of the vote.\n\nThe rejection of Proposition 23 is no shocker - appreciating the environment is a bedrock California value. As for the other, more surprising results? California always goes its own way, and 2010 was no exception.",

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIt’s a party right out of his nightmares, and Bill Kristol can’t even find a way in.\n\n“It’s the last gasp of civilization, it’s the end of the Roman Empire,” he said, standing outside Quicken Loans Arena more than three hours before the Republican National Convention kicked off its celebration of Donald Trump. “Oh my, is this the line of people to get in?”\n\nA sweaty, impatient crowd of people snaked its way through a fenced-off swath of downtown Cleveland alive with cops, bright lights, protesters and a general circus atmosphere. (Is that a polar bear walking toward the CNN Grill?) Kristol, shorter than you ever realized from his many TV punditry spots, craned his neck to see how far back the line went.\n\n“David Gregory is in there,” said a colleague walking with him. “I think it’s our best bet.”\n\nKristol, a ring leader in what he calls the “beat down” Never Trump movement, had been melancholy ever since his first glimpse of the arena early Saturday.\n\nUnruly delegates tried to force a roll call vote during the first day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Here's how they failed. (Peter Stevenson,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\n“Going through my mind on the convention floor: This is a bad day for the Republican Party,” he said, for once not smiling or making a joke. (He generally relies on a healthy dose of “gallows humor” as a coping mechanism, he said). “Whatever the limitations the other candidates had, they weren’t an embarrassment or a disgrace. I was upset.”\n\n[Bill Kristol knows his predictions have been bad but he’s going to keep making them]\n\nHe paused. Collected himself. Restored his natural grin to his face. “But I did get to stand on the spot where LeBron stood.”\n\nOkay, but what was Kristol even doing here? As it is for so many Trump equivocators or Trump loathers in his party, the GOP convention is all about business. They don’t care to cheer for the nominee, but there are still clients here to meet, sponsors to schmooze, networking to be done. And so they are gamely splitting hairs, letting it be known they’re “in Cleveland” for the events surrounding the convention, but not “at the convention.” (Ohio Gov. John Kasich is in the milieu but has made it clear he won’t set foot in the arena.) Kristol, meanwhile, has a contract to go on air for ABC here this week. Plus: It’s always a good opportunity to catch up with friends.\n\n[The secret life of delegates: The convention may get ugly — but it’s still a party]\n\nKristol isn’t exactly Mr. Popular here in Cleveland. He spent the first several months of the GOP primary adamantly predicting Trump’s imminent demise, and the last desperate weeks trying to recruit a conservative independent to run against him. (His pick, an obscure lawyer-pundit, didn’t take the bait.) On the light rail trail to downtown on Monday morning, he said, a fellow commuter looked him straight in the eye and told him: “You don’t turn me on.”\n\n“I was polite and didn’t tell him I was sick of people like him,” Kristol said. He gets it, he said; he knew he wasn’t going to be greeted here with “adulation” and “flower petals.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean he’s without fans. Here came one now! A man in a dapper suit pulled Kristol by the arm and thanked him for coming and for being true to himself. Then he went to get in line with everyone else.\n\n“The Democratic county executive now likes me,” Kristol exclaimed, playfully rolling his eyes. “Is there any other way to get into this thing?”\n\nAn old friend of a friend, a former Republican fundraiser, spotted Kristol and reached to shake his hand.\n\n“What are you doing here?” Kristol asked.\n\n“Oh, you know, I’m kind of wandering,” the man said.\n\n“Oh, you’re like all of us,” Kristol says. He looked again at the line. “This is getting ridiculous. I’m going to get a Coke.”",

No sooner does Iran get a seat on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women than it uses it with tragicomic predictability:\n\n[The] U.N. policy-making body dedicated to “gender equality and the advancement of women” adopted a resolution accusing Israel of holding back the advancement of Palestinian women, but it took no action on the emergency in Libya or the legally enshrined discrimination faced by women in Iran. The only country-specific resolution passed by the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) at its recent session in New York was one condemning Israel over the Palestinian issue.\n\nIranian prison guards rape female dissidents before executing them, lest their victims go to heaven as virgins. Iranian men get to avail themselves of temporary marriages, de facto legalizing the institutionalized slavery and rape of prepubescent girls. Iranian women are consigned to the backs of buses, have to shroud their bodies from head to toe, and can’t wear anything bright or shiny.\n\nThat’s just what’s happening in a single CSW member state.\n\nThe greater hypocrisy is what was ignored globally so that the Commission could spend time demonizing Israel. It’s not necessary to belabor the second-class status that women are consigned to throughout the Muslim world, except maybe to note two things that diverge from the quotidian misery.\n\nFirst, it’s worth noting what’s happening to women in ostensibly egalitarian Turkey, and for that Michael Rubin’s recent post is mandatory reading. Second, not calling out what’s happening to women in Egypt right now is simply unconscionable. A body charged with promoting women’s freedom can’t ignore when freedom in general comes at the expense of women’s physical security, even if horrific gender apartheid has been woven into Egyptian society for centuries. Nina Burleigh is instructive on that last part.\n\nTurkey and Egypt have horrific records on women’s rights. Iran, a CSW member state, is worse than both of them. And yet again Israel got singled out for condemnation, because it’s the UN so why not?",

When Bush was elected in 2000, he inherited a budget surplus, but it took only a year for the federal government to have a budget deficit and have to borrow money to finance its debt. Former president Bush described the tax cuts as a way to give federal funds back to US taxpayers.\n\n“We recognize, loud and clear, the surplus is not the government’s money. The surplus is the people’s money. And we ought to trust them with their own money,” said Bush during the signing ceremony which took place in the White House’s East Room.\n\nThe Bush tax policy was supposed to stimulate the economy but, in fact, the years following the signing of the cuts in 2001 saw the slowest economic growth in the United States since World War II. The taxes were cut without even an attempt to cut spending. As matter of fact, federal spending was dramatically increased in the following ten years-and still is in 2011. Back in 2001, a majority of Democrats voted against the Bush tax cuts bill. However, last December, at the expiration of the cuts, a majority of Democrats voted with Republicans to extend the bill for two more years. Unfortunately for the American people, this fiscally irresponsible and unsustainable tax policy has a wide bipartisan support in the US Congress. In other words, what were the Bush tax cuts back in 2001 have now really become the Bush-Obama tax cuts.\n\nToday, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, which is a non-partisan organization, said that “We can’t afford another ten years of deficit financing the tax cuts”. According to the committee, extending all of these tax cuts beyond 2012 would cost $2.4 trillion. “We can’t afford to put another $4 trillion on the nation’s credit card,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget.",
  "latent_20720": "by Walter Block\n\nRecently by Walter Block: Long Thin Things\n\nI may have missed something in my c.v., but I don't think I have ever written a critique of any leftist economist. In searching through my own publication records, my targets have almost always been scholars perceiving themselves as, or widely being seen as, right wing supporters of free markets, but who either are really no such thing, or who fall short of this honorific mark. For example, my past targets have included Tom Bethell, James Buchanan, Ronald Coase, Harold Demsetz, William Easterly, Richard Epstein, Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Deirdre McCloskey, Elinor Ostrom, Richard Pipes, Ayn Rand and Andre Shleifer. I am a strong advocate of product differentiation, and these people are improperly interpreted, I contend, as uncompromising advocates of free enterprise, private property rights and laissez faire capitalism. They are not.\n\nBut today I am embarking on a new mission: putting lefties in their place, starting with Paul Krugman. I had long eschewed this sort of thing, thinking it akin to taking candy from babies, intellectually speaking. I was glad that “child-molesters” like Robert Murphy and William Anderson have long been doing this sort of dirty work. I am of course speaking tongue in cheek here; I greatly admire all of Bob's and Bill's work, particularly their willingness to step down into the trenches with the likes of Paul Krugman. But today, thanks to Murphy's and Anderson's example, I am entering this bog. However, my sense of disgust must be more finely honed than Bob's (who has publicly challenged Krugman to a debate). The thought of actually debating with this creep, coming face to face with him, really gives me the willies. These people really have no brains, and it is really unfair to debate them. But, what the heck; Krugman has won the Nobel Prize in economics, and is a Princeton professor, so, maybe, it is not exactly like criticizing a mentally handicapped person to take him on.\n\nMy target is Krugman's \"The iPhone Stimulus\" which recently appeared in his regular New York Times column of September 14, 2012. In this essay he looks forward to the release of the Apple iPhone 5, as a way of stimulating the economy. He states: \"What I'm interested in … are suggestions that the unveiling of the iPhone 5 might provide a significant boost to the U.S. economy, adding measurably to economic growth over the next quarter or two.\"\n\nBut wait. This doesn't sound so crazy at all. If the expectations of this new improvement are even partially met, this item will indeed give a boost to the economy along the lines of other breakthroughs such as increasing the quality of cars, oil drilling, air conditioners, marketing, retailing, etc. If communications can now be even somewhat improved with the release of this new initiative, it must enhance our economic well being. Have I entirely misjudged the acumen of this economist? Has my prejudice against socialist and Keynesian economists blinded me to the veracity of his argument?\n\nNo.\n\nKrugman is not looking to Apple iPhone 5 to improve the economy through ease of communication. Rather, very much to the contrary, he sees its benefits as stemming from the obsolescence of already existing plant and equipment of the same type. He says: \"Yet depressions do end, eventually, even without government policies to get the economy out of this trap. Why? Long ago, John Maynard Keynes suggested that the answer was u2018use, decay, and obsolescence': even in a depressed economy, at some point businesses will start replacing equipment, either because the stuff they have has worn out, or because much better stuff has come along; and, once they start doing that, the economy perks up. Sure enough, that's what Apple is doing. It's bringing on the obsolescence. Good.\"\n\nI am glad you are sitting down as you see these words, gentle reader, otherwise you would topple right over as I did when first encountered them, while mistakenly standing up on my two feet. The economic benefits of the Apple iPhone 5 do not come from its merits, merely from the fact that the introduction of this item embodies obsolescence? My goodness gracious. If this were true, then wouldn't it be even better if the rate of capital destruction were even greater? And wouldn't it help the economy even more if this devastation were not confined to communication implements like the Apple iPhone 5 but ranged widely over the economy, poisoning everything in its path including housing, factories, pipelines, mines, etc. In the extreme, we might as well just bomb our capital, buildings, etc., so that we are left with no food, no clothing, no shelter, no anything. Think of all the aggregate demand we would have then!\n\nIt used to be, many moons ago, that critics of the market would attack the free enterprise system for purposefully imbedding obsolescence in their products. The charge was that more profit could be earned that way, as if Mercedes Benz, Volkswagon, Toyota and Honda owed their splendid reputations to the unreliability of their automobiles. But now Krugman actually calls for the undermining of quality in order to help the economy. This man never should have been given the Nobel Prize in economics. MIT, which awarded this economic illiterate a Ph.D., ought to engage in a recall. After all, if commercial firms commonly do so for defective products, the same ought to hold true for academia.\n\nAt least the old critics of the market were correct in citing needless obsolescence as a flaw (their mistake was thinking this could be profitable in the long run, given people's experiences, and private rating agencies such as Consumer's Reports, Good Housekeeping Seals of Approval, etc.) But Krugman does them one better: he actually calls for the faster breakdown of capital goods. For shame.\n\nIn Economics in One Lesson, an entirely uncredentialled Henry Hazlitt correctly labeled the economic fallacy now being peddled by Krugman as \"the broken window fallacy.\" When the hoodlum throws the brick though the baker's window, he does no economic favor to anyone (well, the juvenile delinquent probably enjoys this destruction of other people's property). Yes, there will be new business for the glazier from the baker, but the latter would have spent the money on something else anyway. And, even if he did not, if he stuck this money into his mattress, everyone else's currency would have been worth a bit more. Spending would not have suffered with an intact window. But throwing the brick is economically indistinguishable from have a weak pane of glass in the first place, one that is likely to fall apart on its own due to obsolescence. And the latter is precisely what Krugman is calling for!\n\nMaybe I had better get back to criticizing right wing critics of the market. They are far more of a challenge. I really feel somewhat ill in having to instruct an obviously very bright man like Paul Krugman on one of the most basic elements of microeconomics, the broken window.\n\nThe Best of Walter E.

  "latent_21376": "Voyage to Vaccine Discovery Continues with Space Station Salmonella Study\n\nby Jessica Nimon\n\nInternational Space Station Program Science Office\n\nNASA's Johnson Space Center\n\nAny scientist can tell you that research is a time-consuming pursuit. In fact, it can take decades to show results, as the knowledge compounds and inspires additional studies. This building of information is what led to the Recombinant Attenuated Salmonella Vaccine or RASV investigation, which launched to the International Space Station on July 8, 2011.The investigation combines decades of expertise between two Arizona State University research teams. One team, led by Cheryl Nickerson, Ph.D. specializes in the use of the spaceflight platform to provide insight into how microbial pathogens cause infection and disease in the human body. The other team, led by Roy Curtiss III, Ph.D. focuses on the design and clinical testing of next generation vaccines to protect against diseases caused by pathogenic microbes. In addition, the Arizona State University researchers partnered with Mark Ott, Ph.D., at NASA's Johnson Space Center to strengthen the team's core expertise of space microbiology.The vaccine samples that were flown on STS-135 are a genetically altered strain ofthat carries a protective antigen against-- a bacteria that causes life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. This organism is responsible for more than 10 million deaths annually and is particularly dangerous for newborns and the elderly, as they are less responsive to current anti-pneumococcal vaccines. \"We have the opportunity,\" commented Nickerson, \"to utilize spaceflight as a unique research and development platform for novel applications with potential to help fight a globally devastating disease.\"Nickerson and Curtiss designed the RASV experiment to use the unique microgravity environment of the space station National Laboratory to increase the vaccine's anti-pneumococcal effectiveness by maximizing its ability to induce a protective immune response. Already a promising oral vaccine candidate that is in human clinical trials, RASV has many advantages over vaccines delivered by a needle. This includes activation of an additional arm of the immune system that cannot be engaged by vaccines that are administered as a shot. Thevaccine strain is genetically modified not to cause disease in humans, but instead carries an antigenic protein from. This addition stimulates a protective immune response without actually causing the disease.According to Nickerson, the initial clinical trials indicated a need for additional enhancement to the vaccine's ability to induce a potent protective immune response. By sending samples back to the space station for continued microgravity research, scientists hope that they will be able to better genetically engineer the vaccine strain to enhance its immunogenicity, while reducing or eliminating any unwanted side effects.To accomplish this goal, special growth chambers containing the vaccine strain traveled to the station aboard the shuttle Atlantis, where crew members activated the samples. Scientists simultaneously are growing a control sample on the ground for comparison under otherwise identical conditions. The spaceflight cultured RASV strain returned to Earth with STS-135 on July 21, 2011.Researchers will now evaluate the space-flown strain against the control sample for its ability to protect against pneumococcal infection and changes in gene expression. Molecular targets identified from this work hold promise for translation to develop new and improve existing anti-pneumococcal RASVs to prevent disease for the general public. Moreover, because RASVs can be produced against a wide variety of human pathogens, the outcome of this study could influence the development of vaccines against many other diseases in addition to pneumonia.Early work that laid the foundation for the microgravity RASV investigation began in 1998 when Nickerson initially was funded by NASA. This was the first of what would be multiple studies from this team onbacteria grown in true microgravity or ground-based analogues of microgravity. The goal was initially to see how the bacteria would respond to a microgravity environment.The ground study led to 2006's Effect of Spaceflight on Microbial Gene Expression and Virulence or Microbe investigation. The findings for Microbe were surprising, as scientists discovered thatcultured in the spaceflight environment became more virulent -- meaning there was an increase in its disease-causing potential. This study also showed that spaceflight globally alteredgene expression in key ways that were not observed during culture on Earth, leading to the identification of a master switch that regulates this response.The Nickerson team followed Microbe with 2008's Microbial Drug Resistance and Virulence or MDRV investigation. This study both reproduced the increased virulence effect in spaceflight-grownand identified a way to turn off the increased virulence. Collectively, these investigations enabled researchers to devise the RASV flight experiment in an effort to develop a better vaccine against pneumonia. \"The key to this research is the novel way that bacterial cells adapt and respond to culture in the microgravity environment,\" said Nickerson, \"as they exhibit important biological characteristics that are directly relevant to human health and disease that are not observed using traditional experimental approaches.\"The current investigation is not the final chapter in this journey towards vaccine development. Thanks to the recent signing of a Space Act Agreement between NASA and the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, Nickerson and her team are now users of the space station as a National Laboratory. Scientists participating in this study plan to fly a continuing series of experiments to the space station. This streamlined access will help to accelerate progress for this lifesaving vaccine.",

However, three of the turbines can run on diesel fuel in an emergency if natural-gas service is disrupted, and the diesel fuel is stored in two 50,000-gallon tanks, one of which was damaged by the device.\n\nOn Thursday, law-enforcement officials said the FBI was looking at past suspicious incidents in the area, citing one near Sahuarita, north of Nogales. In that incident, someone was reported to be trying to cut power lines, law-enforcement officials said.\n\nOn Feb. 9, target shooters near a substation in that area were seen on security cameras, causing alarm. Police and the utility's security officers traveled to the site to ask the shooters to move along, but they were gone when police arrived, Salkowski said.\n\n\"We don't believe and neither does law enforcement believe there was any intended threat,\" he said. \"We wanted to avoid any accidental damage to our facilities.\"\n\nArizona's counterterrorism fusion center sent no bulletins warning of a possible attack before Wednesday, nor did it send any intelligence briefings about the attack afterward, Jimenez said.\n\nBut Arizona officials have been on increased alert to the risk to power facilities in recent months.\n\nThat's largely because of a sophisticated attack on a large plant south of San Jose in April 2013. The Wall Street Journal publicized a detailed account of the assault in February describing how saboteurs cut telephone lines into the plant. Then they \"surgically knocked out 17 giant transformers\" by shooting at them with sniper rifles for 19 minutes, the Journal reported.\n\nIt took 27 days to return the substation to normal, and the attack was described by Jon Wellinghoff, then-chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as \"the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred.\"\n\nIn March, Arizona Corporation Commission Chairman Bob Stump and Commissioner Bob Burns sent a letter to Arizona utilities asking about security changes they were making in the wake of the San Jose attack.\n\n\"The incident in Nogales is a troubling development that highlights the pressing need to focus our state and nation's attention and resources to increasing utility security at all levels,\" Stump said Thursday.\n\n\"Physical attacks against critical facilities will, I fear, become a staple of domestic and foreign terrorist attacks over the coming years. The potential of shutting down an entire city or even the entire Eastern Seaboard will be enticing to our enemies.\"\n\nThe Nogales incident was not isolated.\n\nIn 2007, a worker driving into the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station 50 miles west of Phoenix was stopped at a checkpoint leading to the reactors, and security found a 5-inch pipe packed with firework explosives.\n\nThe discovery sent the facility into a nearly seven-hour lockdown, confining almost 3,000 workers on site while security teams searched for additional explosives. None were found, and the worker was eventually released and allowed to return to the job when law enforcement determined that he had not placed the explosives in his truck.\n\nThe FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security set up an advisory program in 2000 for Arizona owners and operators of critical infrastructure, including power plants and substations. Under the Arizona Infragard program, the government shares information about emerging security threats and how to combat them.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1pQ7VfB",
  "latent_21702": "A BELATED happy International Women’s Day. Rarely has the day seemed more necessary than in 2015, as debate rages about the ethics and timing of the BBC documentary on the Delhi rape case, India’s Daughter. In this documentary, Mukesh Singh, one of the accused rapists, damns himself through his own mouth. Troublingly, his interview was broadcast before the case has gone to appeal.\n\nLest India’s Daughter tempts us to think that violence and sexual abuse against women is a South Asian problem, a campaign was launched by the Salvation Army, capitalising on the optical illusion dress that went viral recently. It shows a badly bruised white woman wearing the dress in white and gold (the colours that many of us saw in the badly lit original photograph), with the caption, “Why is it so hard to see black and blue”. This indicates that violence against women cuts across all cultures.\n\nIn this column I examine some of the key feminist essays of the last four decades in order to explore the productive overlap that exists between postcolonial studies and feminism.\n\nJulia Kristeva’s ‘About Chinese Women’ (1977) is in some ways an example of a Western feminist making universalising, even racist assumptions. The psychoanalytic critic wrote her essay in the context of leftist politics in France, wherein China was held up as a model society. However, the piece suffered when it was digested by a wider audience, many of whom felt Kristeva was homogenising the Chinese women under study, and after the late 1970s it mostly disappeared from view.\n\nKristeva seems progressive on difference, warning against looking for answers in Chinese society to solve Western problems. She shows awareness of the symbiotic relationship between knowledge and power, claiming that she wants to create “open-ended” research. This is praiseworthy, but in a sense she does precisely these two things, imposing a knowledge system on others and projecting Chinese culture as a blank screen on which to resolve Western women’s dilemmas. She idealises male-female relations in China, associating the Chinese woman stereotypically with “an inexhaustible yin essence” and portraying the man as “the delicate artisan” of the woman’s jouissance, or sexual pleasure. Readers may wonder how Kristeva could have known this from a short visit and without speaking Mandarin or Cantonese.\n\nPostcolonial feminism helps to identify and correct the blind spots of Western feminist theory which, according to Chandra Talpade Mohanty, often produces a “singular ‘Third World woman’” as a byword for “underdevelopment, oppressive traditions, high illiteracy, rural and urban poverty, religious fanaticism and overpopulation”. Mohanty argues that such negative assumptions about the Third World woman do not capture the complexity and fluidity of the lives of these women, plural. A ‘Third World woman’ isn’t automatically oppressed. If she is from a powerful class or family, she may have more power and agency than a working-class woman or even a man in ‘the West’.\n\nFollowing Mohanty’s critique, Anna Rutherford and Kirsten Holst Petersen tried to unite postcolonialism and feminism through recognition of the overlap between colonialism and patriarchy in their idea of “double colonisation”. However, this suggests that racism and sexism function in the same way and only highlights two forms of oppression.\n\nGayatri Spivak extends double colonisation through her reinterpretation of subalternity. She writes about the difficulty of non-elite people — tribals, peasants, women, low castes and the working class — having their voices heard in an undistorted way: “Clearly, if you are poor, black, and female you get it in three ways. […] As a product of these considerations I have put together the sentence ‘White men are saving brown women from brown men’.”\n\nHere Spivak, whose writing can be impenetrable, gives us two lovely phrases. Firstly, the idea that poor, black women “get it in three ways” indicates that a person can experience more than singular or double oppressions. This anticipates the 1990s theory of intersectionality, to which I will return. Secondly, the famous slogan “White men are saving brown women from brown men” is heavily ironic and anticipates 2000s thinking about saviours, rescue, and assumptions of superiority.\n\nLila Abu-Lughod wrote her essay ‘Do Muslim Women Really Needs Saving?’ in 2002 against the backdrop of the war in Afghanistan’s initial phase. She takes as her point of departure the toxic but hilarious George W. Bushism “women of cover”, which conflates the politically sensitive American term “person of colour” with the issue of modest Muslim dress. By contrast, Abu-Lughod provides a textured reading of the veiling debate. Rather than the universal symbol of oppression that many Americans assume it to be, the burqa is a Pakhtun garment and there can be empowerment in it — one anthropologist describes it as “portable seclusion”. Abu-Lughod disagrees with any enforcement of the wearing of burqas, but observes that many women wear these outfits voluntarily and don’t wish to discard them.\n\nAbu-Lughod next challenges (George W. Bush’s wife) Laura Bush’s November 2001 speech in which the latter implicitly assumes that Afghan women will automatically be delighted to be rescued by American troops. Abu-Lughod writes: “It is deeply problematic to construct the Afghan woman as someone in need of saving. When you save someone, you imply that you are saving her from something. You are also saving her to something. What violences are entailed in this transformation, and what presumptions are being made about the superiority of that to which you are saving her?”\n\nAbu-Lughod encourages us to think about women who may or may not want to be rescued, but more importantly deserve justice. Finally, she advocates respect for difference while not endorsing cultural relativism — the idea that everything can be understood and justified in the context of its culture. She shows that it is no self-contradiction to dislike the Taliban, while simultaneously rejecting crude online petitions about “Muslim men oppressing Muslim women”. What we should say is: a plague on both their houses.\n\nWhereas Rutherford and Petersen talk about “double colonisation”, Spivak turns this into a triumvirate, saying if you are poor, black, and female you get it in three ways. From a postsecular perspective, Abu-Lughod and the Turkish-American scholar Esra Santesso show that if you are poor, black, Muslim and female you get it in four ways. The progression from single issue feminism or postcolonialism, to double, triple, and quadruple approaches shows there is a need for a theory which takes into account multiple oppressions.\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw’s 1993 concept of intersectionality fills this gap. It was further developed by Avtar Brah in a South Asian diasporic context. Intersectionality is the idea that you can have multiple identity components and grounds for oppression at once. As well as race and gender, there is class (and caste), religious background, age, disability, sexual orientation, and so on. As Mohanty delineated in the 1980s, it is important not to see a woman as an ahistoric, monolithic subject. Rather, we have to see women in context. Intersectionality assumes that sexism and racism, rather than being separate and aberrant phenomena, actually inform each other.\n\nPerhaps intersectionality provides the best psychological scaffolding for global 21st-century women. We need to think about and resist different oppressions together without reducing differences between them or decanting one into the other.\n\nCLAIRE CHAMBERS teaches global literature at the University of York and is the author of British Muslim Fictions: Interviews with Contemporary Writers.",
  "latent_21770": "Research into early stages of process follows reports of girls and women travelling to Syria to join Isis fighters and have children\n\nBritish Muslim women and girls are just as vulnerable to becoming radicalised as their male peers, according to the author of a study into the early stages of the process.\n\nThe news comes amid reports of girls as young as 14 travelling to Syria from the west, to marry Islamist fighters, bear their children and join their communities.\n\nA study from the Queen Mary University of London has found that suffering from depression, being financially comfortable, well-educated and socially isolated were common factors among those sympathetic to acts of terrorism, identified by researchers as the first of two stages of early radicalisation. The second, it said, was contact with radical, unorthodox beliefs.\n\nThose whose families had lived in the UK for generations were more vulnerable than migrants, the report found.\n\nAs many as 500 British fighters have travelled to Syria and Iraq, it has emerged, while academics say as many as 10% of them could be women.\n\nProfessor Kamaldeep Bhui, professor of cultural psychology and epidemiology at Queen Mary University, said that gender did not play a significant role in the risk of radicalisation: “Women are no less likely in our analysis to have sympathies” with terrorism, Bhui said. If anything, they were more likely to show such sympathy, but “not significantly so” he said. “There is an increasing epidemic of girls” he added.\n\nAcademics said as many as 60 British females have fled to Syria to join Islamic State (Isis), mainly between the ages of 16 and 24. They include Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a woman from Glasgow who fled to Syria in November last year. Twin sisters Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, in July without their parents’ knowledge to follow their brother to Syria. And in August, Amal El-Wahabi, 27, a mother of two from north London, and wife of a fighter, became the first Briton to be convicted under terror laws of funding jihadi fighters in Syria. Her friend, Nawal Msaad, 27, who tried to smuggle £15,000 in rolled-up banknotes in her underwear, on a flight to Turkey form Heathrow, was cleared of the same offence.\n\nAt a briefing organised by the Science Media Centre, at the Wellcome Collection in London, Bhui said that parents worried about their children should look out for signs of depression or disaffection and warned that those who indulged in fantasy worlds or alternative identities were more at risk.\n\nHe interviewed 600 Muslims aged 18-45 from the Bangladeshi and Pakistani community in Bradford and London and asked detailed questions about their lives and their views on terrorism, in order to find out what drives Britons to go abroad to fight. He calculated their risk of radicalisation according to a score of sympathy or condemnation of a series of protests against injustice, from non-violent to terrorism and suicide bombing.\n\n“The group who sympathised were younger, in full-time education and generally wealthy,” he said. “They were more likely to be depressed and socially isolated.”\n\nHe found that those who expressed sympathy with terrorist ideologies were more likely to be middle class, with a household income of £75,000, and likely to be disaffected or depressed, with a smaller social network than those who condemned terrorist acts, he said.\n\nBhui said that these individuals, when they come into contact with “unorthodox thinking, connect with it”. He said that mosques could act as a “protective factor”. Those in the Bangladeshi community were more likely to condemn terrorism, in the group he surveyed, he said.\n\nInterestingly, Bhui said that migrants were less likely to become radicalised because they are poorer, busier with the need to earn money and they remembered the problems of their homeland. “Those who are having a hard life, who are migrants, are too busy to have fantastic thoughts about attacks,” he said.\n\nThe numbers of those who had sympathy with terrorism were small, he said, with 2.5% showing sympathy and 1.5% having sympathy for the most extreme acts of violence and terrorism.\n\nHe described government moves to strip Britons who travel Iraq or Syria to join Isis of their citizenship as a disaster. He said: “My personal view is that it would be a disaster, because you are criminalising them. Some of those kids are 15 to 18, young and probably inexperienced and police in Wales took a different stance. They didn’t want to criminalise. I would be happy to work with them.”",
  "latent_21859": "That requirement, known as the individual mandate, is one of the more unpopular features of the law, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama. But insurance companies like it because it requires people to buy their product, bringing in healthy people who pay premiums and do not use much care.\n\nAnalyzing the Republican strategy, Joel L. Michaels, a health lawyer at the firm McDermott Will & Emery, said there was “a tension” between efforts to repeal the health law and shore up its insurance marketplaces, where more than 10 million people obtained coverage last year.\n\n“A political agenda premised on the Affordable Care Act being unworkable could conflict with efforts to support the A.C.A. exchanges, even on an interim basis,” Mr. Michaels said. “How far do you go with short-term fixes, which could make the law work better in the long term? It’s a delicate political dance.”\n\nInsurers are seeking immediate governmental action because they must decide by early May what kinds of health plans they will offer on the exchanges in 2018.\n\nThe proposed rule drafted by the Trump administration and one of the bills drafted by House Republicans would make it more difficult for consumers to obtain insurance outside the annual open enrollment period. Consumers would have to provide documents to show they were eligible for a special enrollment period.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), for having a “nonexistent” record as an office holder. Bachmann’s campaign fired back at her fellow 2012 contender with an email later that day citing her efforts to end cap and trade as one bullet point on her record.\n\n“I have fought the cap-and-trade agenda, rather than implement it, and I will work to end cap-and-trade as President of the United States,” Bachmann wrote in the email, referring to the policy initiative developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem? This doesn’t exactly count as a resume builder, considering the fact that a federal cap and trade program is currently nonexistent.\n\nTrue, Bachmann grabbed some headlines in 2009 after she called upon citizens to get “armed and dangerous” to stop the climate bill. But the bill ended up passing the House (which was under Democratic control at the time) before it died in the Senate. Cap and trade is not a national policy, and probably won’t be one any time soon, so it would be pretty hard for her to “end” it.\n\nThe list of accomplishments she sent around is almost entirely things she has “fought,” rather than anything she proactively accomplished. And considering that a cap and trade bill, Obamacare, and the bailout all passed in the House, she wasn’t particularly effective on that front, either.",
  "latent_22156": "by Real Python advanced flask web-dev\n\nThis tutorial takes a test-first approach to implementing token-based authentication in a Flask app using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n\nUpdates:\n\n08/04/2017: Refactored route handler for the PyBites Challenge.\n\nObjectives\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to…\n\nDiscuss the benefits of using JWTs versus sessions and cookies for authentication Implement user authentication with JWTs Blacklist user tokens when necessary Write tests to create and verify JWTs and user authentication Practice test-driven development\n\nFree Bonus: Click here to get access to a free Flask + Python video tutorial that shows you how to build Flask web app, step-by-step.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJSON Web Tokens (or JWTs) provide a means of transmitting information from the client to the server in a stateless, secure way.\n\nOn the server, JWTs are generated by signing user information via a secret key, which are then securely stored on the client. This form of auth works well with modern, single page applications. For more on this, along with the pros and cons of using JWTs vs. session and cookie-based auth, please review the following articles:\n\nNOTE: Keep in mind that since a JWT is signed rather than encrypted it should never contain sensitive information like a user’s password.\n\nGetting Started\n\nEnough theory, let’s start implementing some code!\n\nProject Setup\n\nStart by cloning the project boilerplate and then create a new branch:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/realpython/flask-jwt-auth.git $ cd flask-jwt-auth $ git checkout tags/1.0.0 -b jwt-auth\n\nCreate and activate a virtualenv and install the dependencies:\n\n$ python3.6 -m venv env $ source env/bin/activate (env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThis is optional, but it’s a good idea to create a new Github repository and update the remote:\n\n(env)$ git remote set-url origin <newurl>\n\nDatabase Setup\n\nLet’s set up Postgres.\n\nNOTE: If you’re on a Mac, check out Postgres app.\n\nOnce the local Postgres server is running, create two new databases from psql that share the same name as your project name:\n\n( env ) $ psql # create database flask_jwt_auth ; CREATE DATABASE # create database flask_jwt_auth_test ; CREATE DATABASE # \\ q\n\nNOTE: There may be some variation on the above commands, for creating a database, based upon your version of Postgres. Check for the correct command in the Postgres documentation.\n\nBefore applying the database migrations we need to update the config file found in project/server/config.py. Simply update the database_name :\n\ndatabase_name = 'flask_jwt_auth'\n\nSet the environment variables in the terminal:\n\n(env)$ export APP_SETTINGS = \"project.server.config.DevelopmentConfig\"\n\nUpdate the following tests in project/tests/test__config.py:\n\nclass TestDevelopmentConfig ( TestCase ): def create_app ( self ): app . config . from_object ( 'project.server.config.DevelopmentConfig' ) return app def test_app_is_development ( self ): self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'DEBUG' ] is True ) self . assertFalse ( current_app is None ) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' ] == 'postgresql://postgres:@localhost/flask_jwt_auth' ) class TestTestingConfig ( TestCase ): def create_app ( self ): app . config . from_object ( 'project.server.config.TestingConfig' ) return app def test_app_is_testing ( self ): self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'DEBUG' ]) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' ] == 'postgresql://postgres:@localhost/flask_jwt_auth_test' )\n\nRun them to ensure they still pass:\n\n(env)$ python manage.py test\n\nYou should see:\n\ntest_app_is_development (test__config.TestDevelopmentConfig) ... ok test_app_is_production (test__config.TestProductionConfig) ... ok test_app_is_testing (test__config.TestTestingConfig) ... ok ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 3 tests in 0.007s OK\n\nMigrations\n\nAdd a models.py file to the “server” directory:\n\n# project/server/models.py import datetime from project.server import app , db , bcrypt class User ( db . Model ): \"\"\" User Model for storing user related details \"\"\" __tablename__ = \"users\" id = db . Column ( db . Integer , primary_key = True , autoincrement = True ) email = db . Column ( db . String ( 255 ), unique = True , nullable = False ) password = db . Column ( db . String ( 255 ), nullable = False ) registered_on = db . Column ( db . DateTime , nullable = False ) admin = db . Column ( db . Boolean , nullable = False , default = False ) def __init__ ( self , email , password , admin = False ): self . email = email self . password = bcrypt . generate_password_hash ( password , app . config . get ( 'BCRYPT_LOG_ROUNDS' ) ) . decode () self . registered_on = datetime . datetime . now () self . admin = admin\n\nIn the above snippet, we define a basic user model, which uses the Flask-Bcrypt extension to hash the password.\n\nInstall psycopg2 to connect to Postgres:\n\n(env)$ pip install psycopg2 == 2 .6.2 (env)$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\nWithin manage.py change-\n\nfrom project.server import app , db\n\nTo-\n\nfrom project.server import app , db , models\n\nApply the migration:\n\n( env ) $ python manage.py create_db ( env ) $ python manage.py db init ( env ) $ python manage.py db migrate\n\nSanity Check\n\nDid it work?\n\n( env ) $ psql # \\ c flask_jwt_auth You are now connected to database \"flask_jwt_auth\" as user \"michael.herman\" . # \\ d List of relations Schema | Name | Type | Owner --------+-----------------+----------+---------- public | alembic_version | table | postgres public | users | table | postgres public | users_id_seq | sequence | postgres ( 3 rows )\n\nJWT Setup\n\nThe auth workflow works as follows:\n\nClient provides email and password, which is sent to the server\n\nServer then verifies that email and password are correct and responds with an auth token\n\nClient stores the token and sends it along with all subsequent requests to the API\n\nServer decodes the token and validates it\n\nThis cycle repeats until the token expires or is revoked. In the latter case, the server issues a new token.\n\nThe tokens themselves are divided into three parts:\n\nHeader\n\nPayload\n\nSignature\n\nWe’ll dive a bit deeper into the payload, but if you’re curious, you can read more about each part from the Introduction to JSON Web Tokens article.\n\nTo work with JSON Web Tokens in our app, install the PyJWT package:\n\n(env)$ pip install pyjwt == 1 .4.2 (env)$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\nEncode Token\n\nAdd the following method to the User() class in project/server/models.py:\n\ndef encode_auth_token ( self , user_id ): \"\"\" Generates the Auth Token :return: string \"\"\" try : payload = { 'exp' : datetime . datetime . utcnow () + datetime . timedelta ( days = 0 , seconds = 5 ), 'iat' : datetime . datetime . utcnow (), 'sub' : user_id } return jwt . encode ( payload , app . config . get ( 'SECRET_KEY' ), algorithm = 'HS256' ) except Exception as e : return e\n\nDon’t forget to add the import:\n\nimport jwt\n\nSo, given a user id, this method creates and returns a token from the payload and the secret key set in the config.py file. The payload is where we add metadata about the token and information about the user. This info is often referred to as JWT Claims. We utilize the following “claims”:\n\nexp : expiration date of the token\n\n: expiration date of the token iat : the time the token is generated\n\n: the time the token is generated sub : the subject of the token (the user whom it identifies)\n\nThe secret key must be random and only accessible server-side. Use the Python interpreter to generate a key:\n\n>>> >>> import os >>> os . urandom ( 24 ) b\"\\xf9'\\xe4p(\\xa9\\x12\\x1a!\\x94\\x8d\\x1c\\x99l\\xc7\\xb7e\\xc7c\\x86\\x02MJ\\xa0\"\n\nSet the key as an environment variable:\n\n(env)$ export SECRET_KEY = \"\\xf9'\\xe4p(\\xa9\\x12\\x1a!\\x94\\x8d\\x1c\\x99l\\xc7\\xb7e\\xc7c\\x86\\x02MJ\\xa0\"\n\nAdd this key to the SECRET_KEY within the BaseConfig() class in project/server/config.py:\n\nSECRET_KEY = os . getenv ( 'SECRET_KEY' , 'my_precious' )\n\nUpdate the tests within project/tests/test__config.py to ensure the variable is set correctly:\n\ndef test_app_is_development ( self ): self . assertFalse ( app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] is 'my_precious' ) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'DEBUG' ] is True ) self . assertFalse ( current_app is None ) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' ] == 'postgresql://postgres:@localhost/flask_jwt_auth' ) class TestTestingConfig ( TestCase ): def create_app ( self ): app . config . from_object ( 'project.server.config.TestingConfig' ) return app def test_app_is_testing ( self ): self . assertFalse ( app . config [ 'SECRET_KEY' ] is 'my_precious' ) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'DEBUG' ]) self . assertTrue ( app . config [ 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' ] == 'postgresql://postgres:@localhost/flask_jwt_auth_test' )\n\nBefore moving on, let’s write a quick unit test for the user model. Add the following code to a new file called test_user_model.py in “project/tests”:\n\n# project/tests/test_user_model.py import unittest from project.server import db from project.server.models import User from project.tests.base import BaseTestCase class TestUserModel ( BaseTestCase ): def test_encode_auth_token ( self ): user = User ( email = 'test@test.com' , password = 'test' ) db . session . add ( user ) db . session . commit () auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) self . assertTrue ( isinstance ( auth_token , bytes )) if __name__ == '__main__' : unittest . main ()\n\nRun the tests. They all should pass.\n\nDecode Token\n\nSimilarly, to decode a token, add the following method to the User() class:\n\n@staticmethod def decode_auth_token ( auth_token ): \"\"\" Decodes the auth token :param auth_token: :return: integer|string \"\"\" try : payload = jwt . decode ( auth_token , app . config . get ( 'SECRET_KEY' )) return payload [ 'sub' ] except jwt . ExpiredSignatureError : return 'Signature expired. Please log in again.' except jwt . InvalidTokenError : return 'Invalid token. Please log in again.'\n\nWe need to decode the auth token with every API request and verify its signature to be sure of the user’s authenticity. To verify the auth_token , we used the same SECRET_KEY used to encode a token.\n\nIf the auth_token is valid, we get the user id from the sub index of the payload. If invalid, there could be two exceptions:\n\nExpired Signature: When the token is used after it’s expired, it throws a ExpiredSignatureError exception. This means the time specified in the payload’s exp field has expired. Invalid Token: When the token supplied is not correct or malformed, then an InvalidTokenError exception is raised.\n\nNOTE: We have used a static method since it does not relate to the class’s instance.\n\nAdd a test to test_user_model.py:\n\ndef test_decode_auth_token ( self ): user = User ( email = 'test@test.com' , password = 'test' ) db . session . add ( user ) db . session . commit () auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) self . assertTrue ( isinstance ( auth_token , bytes )) self . assertTrue ( User . decode_auth_token ( auth_token ) == 1 )\n\nMake sure the tests pass before moving on.\n\nNOTE: We will handle invalid tokens by blacklisting them later.\n\nRoute Setup\n\nNow we can configure the auth routes using a test-first approach:\n\n/auth/register\n\n/auth/login\n\n/auth/logout\n\n/auth/user\n\nStart by creating a new folder called “auth” in “project/server”. Then, within “auth” add two files, __init__.py and views.py. Finally, add the following code to views.py:\n\n# project/server/auth/views.py from flask import Blueprint , request , make_response , jsonify from flask.views import MethodView from project.server import bcrypt , db from project.server.models import User auth_blueprint = Blueprint ( 'auth' , __name__ )\n\nTo register the new Blueprint with the app, add the following to the bottom of project/server/__init__.py:\n\nfrom project.server.auth.views import auth_blueprint app . register_blueprint ( auth_blueprint )\n\nNow, add a new file called test_auth.py within “project/tests” to hold all our tests for this Blueprint:\n\n# project/tests/test_auth.py import unittest from project.server import db from project.server.models import User from project.tests.base import BaseTestCase class TestAuthBlueprint ( BaseTestCase ): pass if __name__ == '__main__' : unittest . main ()\n\nRegister Route\n\nStart with a test:\n\ndef test_registration ( self ): \"\"\" Test for user registration \"\"\" with self . client : response = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully registered.' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( response . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 201 )\n\nMake sure to add the import:\n\nimport json\n\nRun the tests. You should see the following error:\n\nraise JSONDecodeError(\"Expecting value\", s, err.value) from None json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n\nNow, let’s write the code to get the test to pass. Add the following to project/server/auth/views.py:\n\nclass RegisterAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" User Registration Resource \"\"\" def post ( self ): # get the post data post_data = request . get_json () # check if user already exists user = User . query . filter_by ( email = post_data . get ( 'email' )) . first () if not user : try : user = User ( email = post_data . get ( 'email' ), password = post_data . get ( 'password' ) ) # insert the user db . session . add ( user ) db . session . commit () # generate the auth token auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'message' : 'Successfully registered.' , 'auth_token' : auth_token . decode () } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 201 except Exception as e : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Some error occurred. Please try again.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'User already exists. Please Log in.' , } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 202 # define the API resources registration_view = RegisterAPI . as_view ( 'register_api' ) # add Rules for API Endpoints auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/register' , view_func = registration_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] )\n\nHere, we register a new user and generate a new auth token for further requests, which we send back to the client.\n\nRun the tests to ensure they all pass:\n\nRan 6 tests in 0.132s OK\n\nNext, let’s add one more test to ensure the registration fails if the user already exists:\n\ndef test_registered_with_already_registered_user ( self ): \"\"\" Test registration with already registered email\"\"\" user = User ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = 'test' ) db . session . add ( user ) db . session . commit () with self . client : response = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'User already exists. Please Log in.' ) self . assertTrue ( response . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 202 )\n\nRun the tests again before moving on to the next route. All should pass.\n\nLogin Route\n\nAgain, start with a test. To verify the login API, let’s test for two cases:\n\nRegistered user login Non-registered user login\n\nRegistered user login\n\ndef test_registered_user_login ( self ): \"\"\" Test for login of registered-user login \"\"\" with self . client : # user registration resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' , ) data_register = json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully registered.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_register . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_register . status_code , 201 ) # registered user login response = self . client . post ( '/auth/login' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully logged in.' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( response . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 200 )\n\nIn this test case, the registered user tries to log in and, as expected, our application should allow this.\n\nRun the tests. They should fail. Now write the code:\n\nclass LoginAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" User Login Resource \"\"\" def post ( self ): # get the post data post_data = request . get_json () try : # fetch the user data user = User . query . filter_by ( email = post_data . get ( 'email' ) ) . first () auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) if auth_token : responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'message' : 'Successfully logged in.' , 'auth_token' : auth_token . decode () } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 except Exception as e : print ( e ) responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Try again' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 500\n\nDon’t forget to convert the class to a view function:\n\n# define the API resources registration_view = RegisterAPI . as_view ( 'register_api' ) login_view = LoginAPI . as_view ( 'login_api' ) # add Rules for API Endpoints auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/register' , view_func = registration_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] ) auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/login' , view_func = login_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] )\n\nRun the tests again. Do they pass? They should. Don’t move on until all tests pass.\n\nNon-Registered user login\n\nAdd the test:\n\ndef test_non_registered_user_login ( self ): \"\"\" Test for login of non-registered user \"\"\" with self . client : response = self . client . post ( '/auth/login' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'User does not exist.' ) self . assertTrue ( response . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 404 )\n\nIn this case, a non-registered user attempts to log in and, as expected, our application should not allow this.\n\nRun the tests, and then update the code:\n\nclass LoginAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" User Login Resource \"\"\" def post ( self ): # get the post data post_data = request . get_json () try : # fetch the user data user = User . query . filter_by ( email = post_data . get ( 'email' ) ) . first () if user and bcrypt . check_password_hash ( user . password , post_data . get ( 'password' ) ): auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) if auth_token : responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'message' : 'Successfully logged in.' , 'auth_token' : auth_token . decode () } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'User does not exist.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 404 except Exception as e : print ( e ) responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Try again' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 500\n\nWhat did we change? Do the tests pass? What if the email is correct but the password is incorrect? What happens? Write a test for this!\n\nUser Status Route\n\nIn order to get the user details of the currently logged in user, the auth token must be sent with the request within the header.\n\nStart with a test:\n\ndef test_user_status ( self ): \"\"\" Test for user status \"\"\" with self . client : resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) response = self . client . get ( '/auth/status' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer ' + json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'data' ] is not None ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'data' ][ 'email' ] == 'joe@gmail.com' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'data' ][ 'admin' ] is 'true' or 'false' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 200 )\n\nThe test should fail. Now, in the handler class, we should:\n\nextract the auth token and check its validity\n\ngrab the user id from the payload and get the user details (if the token is valid, of course)\n\nclass UserAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" User Resource \"\"\" def get ( self ): # get the auth token auth_header = request . headers . get ( 'Authorization' ) if auth_header : auth_token = auth_header . split ( \" \" )[ 1 ] else : auth_token = '' if auth_token : resp = User . decode_auth_token ( auth_token ) if not isinstance ( resp , str ): user = User . query . filter_by ( id = resp ) . first () responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'data' : { 'user_id' : user . id , 'email' : user . email , 'admin' : user . admin , 'registered_on' : user . registered_on } } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : resp } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Provide a valid auth token.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401\n\nSo, if the token is valid and not expired, we get the user id from the token’s payload, which is then used to get the user data from the database.\n\nNOTE: We still need to check if a token is blacklisted. We’ll get to this shortly.\n\nMake sure to add:\n\nuser_view = UserAPI . as_view ( 'user_api' )\n\nAnd:\n\nauth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/status' , view_func = user_view , methods = [ 'GET' ] )\n\nThe tests should pass:\n\nRan 10 tests in 0.240s OK\n\nOne more route to go!\n\nLogout Route Tests\n\nTests valid logout:\n\ndef test_valid_logout ( self ): \"\"\" Test for logout before token expires \"\"\" with self . client : # user registration resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' , ) data_register = json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully registered.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_register . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_register . status_code , 201 ) # user login resp_login = self . client . post ( '/auth/login' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data_login = json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully logged in.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_login . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_login . status_code , 200 ) # valid token logout response = self . client . post ( '/auth/logout' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer ' + json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully logged out.' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 200 )\n\nIn this first test, we register a new user, log them in, and then attempt to log them out before the token expires.\n\nTest invalid logout:\n\ndef test_invalid_logout ( self ): \"\"\" Testing logout after the token expires \"\"\" with self . client : # user registration resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' , ) data_register = json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully registered.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_register . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_register . status_code , 201 ) # user login resp_login = self . client . post ( '/auth/login' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data_login = json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully logged in.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_login . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_login . status_code , 200 ) # invalid token logout time . sleep ( 6 ) response = self . client . post ( '/auth/logout' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer ' + json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Signature expired. Please log in again.' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 401 )\n\nLike the last test, we register a user, log them in, and then attempt to log them out. In this case, the token is invalid since it has expired.\n\nAdd the import:\n\nimport time\n\nNow, the code must:\n\nvalidate the auth token blacklist the token (if valid, of course)\n\nBefore writing the route handler, let’s create a new model for blacklisting tokens…\n\nBlacklist\n\nAdd the following code to project/server/models.py:\n\nclass BlacklistToken ( db . Model ): \"\"\" Token Model for storing JWT tokens \"\"\" __tablename__ = 'blacklist_tokens' id = db . Column ( db . Integer , primary_key = True , autoincrement = True ) token = db . Column ( db .

DateTime , nullable = False ) def __init__ ( self , token ): self . token = token self . blacklisted_on = datetime . datetime . now () def __repr__ ( self ): return '<id: token: {} ' . format ( self . token )\n\nThen create and apply the migrations. Once done, your database should have the following tables:\n\nSchema | Name | Type | Owner --------+-------------------------+----------+---------- public | alembic_version | table | postgres public | blacklist_tokens | table | postgres public | blacklist_tokens_id_seq | sequence | postgres public | users | table | postgres public | users_id_seq | sequence | postgres ( 5 rows )\n\nWith that, we can add the logout handler…\n\nLogout Route Handler\n\nUpdate the views:\n\nclass LogoutAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" Logout Resource \"\"\" def post ( self ): # get auth token auth_header = request . headers . get ( 'Authorization' ) if auth_header : auth_token = auth_header . split ( \" \" )[ 1 ] else : auth_token = '' if auth_token : resp = User . decode_auth_token ( auth_token ) if not isinstance ( resp , str ): # mark the token as blacklisted blacklist_token = BlacklistToken ( token = auth_token ) try : # insert the token db . session . add ( blacklist_token ) db . session . commit () responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'message' : 'Successfully logged out.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 except Exception as e : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : e } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : resp } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Provide a valid auth token.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 403 # define the API resources registration_view = RegisterAPI . as_view ( 'register_api' ) login_view = LoginAPI . as_view ( 'login_api' ) user_view = UserAPI . as_view ( 'user_api' ) logout_view = LogoutAPI . as_view ( 'logout_api' ) # add Rules for API Endpoints auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/register' , view_func = registration_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] ) auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/login' , view_func = login_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] ) auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/status' , view_func = user_view , methods = [ 'GET' ] ) auth_blueprint . add_url_rule ( '/auth/logout' , view_func = logout_view , methods = [ 'POST' ] )\n\nUpdate the imports:\n\nfrom project.server.models import User , BlacklistToken\n\nWhen a users logs out, the token is no longer valid so we add it to the blacklist.\n\nNOTE: Often, larger applications have a way to renew blacklisted tokens every now and then so that the system does not run out of valid tokens.\n\nRun the tests:\n\nRan 12 tests in 6.418s OK\n\nRefactoring\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that a token has not been blacklisted, right after the token has been decoded - decode_auth_token() - within the logout and user status routes.\n\nFirst, let’s write a test for the logout route:\n\ndef test_valid_blacklisted_token_logout ( self ): \"\"\" Test for logout after a valid token gets blacklisted \"\"\" with self . client : # user registration resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' , ) data_register = json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully registered.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_register [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_register . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_register . status_code , 201 ) # user login resp_login = self . client . post ( '/auth/login' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) data_login = json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'status' ] == 'success' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'message' ] == 'Successfully logged in.' ) self . assertTrue ( data_login [ 'auth_token' ]) self . assertTrue ( resp_login . content_type == 'application/json' ) self . assertEqual ( resp_login . status_code , 200 ) # blacklist a valid token blacklist_token = BlacklistToken ( token = json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode ())[ 'auth_token' ]) db . session . add ( blacklist_token ) db . session . commit () # blacklisted valid token logout response = self . client . post ( '/auth/logout' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer ' + json . loads ( resp_login . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Token blacklisted. Please log in again.' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 401 )\n\nIn this test, we blacklist the token just before the logout route gets hit which makes our valid token unusable.\n\nUpdate the imports:\n\nfrom project.server.models import User , BlacklistToken\n\nThe test should fail with the following exception:\n\npsycopg2.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"blacklist_tokens_token_key\" DETAIL: Key (token)=(eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUyMDgyOTUsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTIwODI5MCwic3ViIjoxfQ.D9annoyh-VwpI5RY3blaSBX4pzK5UJi1H9dmKg2DeLQ) already exists.\n\nNow update the decode_auth_token function to handle already blacklisted tokens right after the decode and respond with appropriate message.\n\n@staticmethod def decode_auth_token ( auth_token ): \"\"\" Validates the auth token :param auth_token: :return: integer|string \"\"\" try : payload = jwt . decode ( auth_token , app . config . get ( 'SECRET_KEY' )) is_blacklisted_token = BlacklistToken . check_blacklist ( auth_token ) if is_blacklisted_token : return 'Token blacklisted. Please log in again.' else : return payload [ 'sub' ] except jwt . ExpiredSignatureError : return 'Signature expired. Please log in again.' except jwt . InvalidTokenError : return 'Invalid token. Please log in again.'\n\nFinally, add the check_blacklist() function to project/server/models.py in the BlacklistToken class:\n\n@staticmethod def check_blacklist ( auth_token ): # check whether auth token has been blacklisted res = BlacklistToken . query . filter_by ( token = str ( auth_token )) . first () if res : return True else : return False\n\nBefore you run the test, update test_decode_auth_token to convert the bytes object to a string:\n\ndef test_decode_auth_token ( self ): user = User ( email = 'test@test.com' , password = 'test' ) db . session . add ( user ) db . session . commit () auth_token = user . encode_auth_token ( user . id ) self . assertTrue ( isinstance ( auth_token , bytes )) self . assertTrue ( User . decode_auth_token ( auth_token . decode ( \"utf-8\" ) ) == 1 )\n\nRun the tests:\n\nRan 13 tests in 9.557s OK\n\nIn a similar fashion, add one more test for the user status route.\n\ndef test_valid_blacklisted_token_user ( self ): \"\"\" Test for user status with a blacklisted valid token \"\"\" with self . client : resp_register = self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' ) # blacklist a valid token blacklist_token = BlacklistToken ( token = json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode ())[ 'auth_token' ]) db . session . add ( blacklist_token ) db . session . commit () response = self . client . get ( '/auth/status' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer ' + json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Token blacklisted. Please log in again.' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 401 )\n\nSimilar to the last test, we blacklisted the token before the user status route gets hit.\n\nRun the tests for one final time:\n\nRan 14 tests in 10.206s OK\n\nCode Smell\n\nFinally, take a look at test_auth.py. Notice the duplicate code? For example:\n\nself . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = 'joe@gmail.com' , password = '123456' )), content_type = 'application/json' , )\n\nThere are eight occurrences of this. To fix, add the following helper at the top of the file:\n\ndef register_user ( self , email , password ): return self . client . post ( '/auth/register' , data = json . dumps ( dict ( email = email , password = password )), content_type = 'application/json' , )\n\nNow, anywhere you need to register a user, you can call the helper:\n\nregister_user ( self , 'joe@gmail.com' , '123456' )\n\nHow about logging in a user? Refactor it on your own. What else can you refactor? Comment below.\n\nRefactor\n\nFor the PyBites Challenge, let’s refactor some code to correct an issue added to the GitHub repo. Start by adding the following test to test_auth.py:\n\ndef test_user_status_malformed_bearer_token ( self ): \"\"\" Test for user status with malformed bearer token\"\"\" with self . client : resp_register = register_user ( self , 'joe@gmail.com' , '123456' ) response = self . client . get ( '/auth/status' , headers = dict ( Authorization = 'Bearer' + json . loads ( resp_register . data . decode () )[ 'auth_token' ] ) ) data = json . loads ( response . data . decode ()) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'status' ] == 'fail' ) self . assertTrue ( data [ 'message' ] == 'Bearer token malformed.' ) self . assertEqual ( response . status_code , 401 )\n\nEssentially, an error is thrown if the Authorization header is formatted incorrectly - e.g., no space between Bearer and the token value. Run the tests to ensure they fail, and then update the UserAPI class in project/server/auth/views.py:\n\nclass UserAPI ( MethodView ): \"\"\" User Resource \"\"\" def get ( self ): # get the auth token auth_header = request . headers . get ( 'Authorization' ) if auth_header : try : auth_token = auth_header . split ( \" \" )[ 1 ] except IndexError : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Bearer token malformed.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401 else : auth_token = '' if auth_token : resp = User . decode_auth_token ( auth_token ) if not isinstance ( resp , str ): user = User . query . filter_by ( id = resp ) . first () responseObject = { 'status' : 'success' , 'data' : { 'user_id' : user . id , 'email' : user . email , 'admin' : user . admin , 'registered_on' : user . registered_on } } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 200 responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : resp } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401 else : responseObject = { 'status' : 'fail' , 'message' : 'Provide a valid auth token.' } return make_response ( jsonify ( responseObject )), 401\n\nRun the tests one final time.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we went through the process of adding authentication to a Flask app with JSON Web Tokens.

  "latent_22236": "Of the 30 million pending court cases in India as of December 2014, over 80% are in district and subordinate courts, which are short of about 5,000 (23%) judges.

Yet, despite the constraints, some courts manage to perform better than others, sometimes significantly so.

I did, however, already have a small pre-packed kit that I purchased over 7 years ago, way before I owned a home or had children, from the American Red Cross.\n\nBig storms, earthquakes and crazy weather give me a good excuse to get our kit updated!\n\nI decided to focus on building our 72-hour home emergency supply kit first before worrying about a car and/or work kit. The challenge felt a bit overwhelming in the beginning but after a few clicks on Amazon, a trip to the store, a good dig around our basement pantry and some deep breathing, I had a well-stocked kit in no time.\n\nIf disaster strikes, the federal government expects everyone to be self sufficient for at least 3 days. And in catastrophic circumstances, it might take that long for rescue or help to arrive. Having enough food and water in the house will be key in an emergency. I plan to keep a 72 hour supply of emergency ration food in our kit while also supplementing with some other tastier food options, like the big jar of peanut butter I bought at Costco. My plan is to bulk up our emergency food supply over the next few months by grabbing a few cans of extra food during my weekly grocery store runs.\n\nIn the case of a large emergency, there may not be any electricity or gas which means there will be no way to cook or refrigerate your food. Having a large selection of canned, ready-to-eat food will be a huge help. You want to make sure to get canned food that can be eaten directly out of the can and are also calorically dense so items like beans, chili, tuna fish and canned meat are great items.\n\nMy tip is to buy an extra can or two of food when they are on sale. Canned food does have an expiration date so you'll want to check your emergency food stash at least once a year and rotate out items that are nearing their expiration date. Donate or eat those items and remember to replenish your supply! I also purchased Emergency Food Rations and Emergency Water from the American Red Cross which each last 5 years before they expire. They are not necessarily tasty items but they do provide your body with dense caloric nutrition while having a long expiration date.\n\nI also updated my Red Cross kit with a hand crank radio that triples as a flashlight and phone charger while adding some emergency blankets, extra clothing and important documents. In the Seattle area, the Official Emergency Station is KIRO 710 AM or KOMO 1000 AM. If you have children in your home, I found a great article on stocking Go Bags for each member of your family from babies to adults.\n\nI was storing my kit in our basement but after some discussion with my husband, we've decided to move it upstairs to an area where we are more likely to be in an emergency. I've separated our items into a storage bin and a Go Bag. The storage bin holds most of our food and water while the Go Bag has important documents, some food and water and first aid supplies. The Go Bag will be important if we need to leave quickly.\n\nHere is what the Red Cross suggests that everybody has in their emergency kit to last at least 72 hours. For those extra prepared people, check out this list from FEMA.\n\n72 hour Emergency Kit\n\nBasic Supplies\n\nWater: One gallon per person, per day.\n\nFood: Non-perishable, easy-to-prepare items\n\nFlashlight\n\nExtra Batteries\n\nFirst Aid Kit\n\nMedications\n\nMulti-purpose tool\n\nSanitation and personal hygiene items\n\nCopies of personal documents - birth certificates, social security cards, real estate contracts, insurance contracts, bank records and passports, immunization records and any other important personal documents\n\nCell phone with chargers\n\nFamily and Emergency Contact Information\n\nExtra Cash (Small Bills and Coins)\n\nEmergency Blanket\n\nMaps of the area\n\nHand-Crank Radio\n\nExtras",
  "latent_22298": "The Federal Communications Commission is an independent agency of the United States government with the sole purpose of regulating cable, satellite, radio and television, as well as wired and wireless communications. According to the commissioner of the FCC, that role does not include ensuring that all Americans have access to the Internet.\n\nDON’T MISS: Changing the Game: Study Reaffirms the Massive Impact Netflix is Having on Pay TV\n\nSometimes you just have to stop for a moment and wonder if this is all just a crazy reality TV show. Sadly, Americans were not being Punk’d by comments made recently in a speech by FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly.\n\nIn remarks made by O’Rielly in front of the Internet Innovation Alliance late last week, the Commissioner explained his position on America’s right to Internet access. His position, as it turns out, is fairly frightening.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from O’Rielly’s speech:\n\nIt is important to note that Internet access is not a necessity in the day-to-day lives of Americans and doesn’t even come close to the threshold to be considered a basic human right. I am not in any way trying to diminish the significance of the Internet in our daily lives. I recognized earlier how important it may be for individuals and society as a whole. But, people do a disservice by overstating its relevancy or stature in people’s lives. People can and do live without Internet access, and many lead very successful lives. Instead, the term “necessity” should be reserved to those items that humans cannot live without, such as food, shelter, and water.\n\nRight about now is an appropriate time to insert a facepalm.\n\nCan a human being survive without food and water? No. Can a human survive without the Internet? Of course. The question that should always be on the FCC’s mind, however, is should an American have to survive without the Internet?\n\nWhether or not you believe Internet access to be a “basic human right” or a “necessity,” there is absolutely no question that everyone’s lives stand to be improved dramatically by having Internet access.\n\nWhether you live in an urban region or one of the most rural areas in the country, the Internet gives you access to a wealth of information you would not be able to access otherwise. And the issues goes much, much further. The Internet makes searching and applying for jobs much easier, allows people to attend college remotely, allows people to communicate with loved ones across the world, and puts an endless array of technologies at the user’s fingertips.\n\nThe Internet might not be a “basic human right,” but the FCC’s job isn’t to regulate food, shelter or water. It’s to regulate communications and, perhaps, to help ensure that Americans have access to them.\n\nO’Rielly’s full speech can be read in this PDF.",

  "latent_22872": "The US Army has put out a call for proposals from companies for wearable camouflage that has the ability to shift its colour according to the background, making the wearer invisible. It wants to test the best designs in just 18 months.\n\nThat doesn't seem far away at all, but actually we're closer to that kind of technology that most people realise. Metamaterials that can bend light around an object were first demonstrated nine years ago, and since then many researchers have showed off their own invisibility cloak designs.\n\nThe tricky thing is that their invisibility usually only works in the lab from certain angles or at specific wavelengths. The US Army has specified that prototype uniforms submitted must work from all angles, in all terrain and weather conditions, across a wide range of temperatures.\n\nThat's a big ask, especially as any power source required by the camouflage must last at least eight hours and weigh less than half a kilo. But some firms have said that they're on their way there - most notably a Canadian company called Hyperstealth Biotechnology, which supposedly demonstrated camouflage technology to the US army in 2014.\n\nAt the end of the day, any technology that gets commissioned isn't going to allow for total invisibility - instead it'll be compared with existing camouflage patterns. Any improvement will almost certainly be grounds for research to continue.",
  "latent_22915": "As publisher and editor of the Times-Gazette, a small daily newspaper in this southwest Ohio town (pop. 6,600), I thought our endorsement of Donald Trump for president last year seemed innocuous enough. Then someone said to me, “Did you see that Rachel Maddow mentioned the Times-Gazette last night?”\n\nSeriously?\n\nNext Politico called. I soon discovered that our two-sentence endorsement was being reported — and often ridiculed — far and wide. The nearby Cincinnati Enquirer produced a post headlined “This Ohio paper is one of only six to endorse Donald Trump.” Not one of six in Ohio — one of six in the entire nation.\n\nHillsboro is the seat of Highland County, which has voted for the Republican candidate for president for decades but was particularly enthusiastic about Trump. He ended up winning 75 percent of the vote here, compared with 64 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nInterestingly, the conservatives I speak with do not really consider Trump one of them. Rank-and-file Republicans tend to view Trump more as an independent who ran under the Republican banner.\n\nBut for the most part they’re still with him. They appreciate Trump’s “America first” agenda, not because they believe in isolationism, but because they believe the United States and its citizens should be the government’s top priority.\n\nThe president’s tweets can be as annoying to his supporters as to his opponents, and if there is a common criticism, it is that he should tweet less. But his inability so far to overhaul health care, enact tax reform, destroy the Islamic State or “drain the swamp” is largely blamed on overreaching courts and the open “resistance” that appears dedicated to opposing anything Trump wants.\n\nWhat Trump’s supporters also appreciate about him are the very attributes for which he is relentlessly criticized in the media. People here — a farming community supplemented by modest-paying retail jobs and a few factory opportunities — are frank and plain-spoken. They’re weary of politicians whose every statement seems carefully crafted to say nothing and offend no one.\n\nI understand that. Years ago, I took a break from journalism to work in politics. I know what candidates and politicians are supposed to say and how they are supposed to say it. I sometimes find myself cringing at things Trump says, wishing he would behave more like a typical politician. But then I remind myself that if he did, he would likely lose the support of the grass-roots movement that put him where he is.\n\nThe negativity that permeates Trump coverage is a frequent subject of conversation here. Matters that are not frequently discussed: James Comey, tax returns, the Paris climate accord and the Russians. Instead, we talk about the heroin overdose epidemic ravaging our community.\n\nYes, Hillsboro is a rural setting with a majority-white population. But that doesn’t equate to its citizens or its Trump supporters being racist, homophobic or Islamaphobic.\n\nLast weekend I covered the opening of an exhibit at our historical society that pays tribute to a school desegregation saga that unfolded here in the 1950s; the event honored surviving members of the African-American community who lived through a chapter in local history too long ignored. A big crowd, white and black, was on hand. Steps toward racial harmony happen even in Trump country.\n\nWhile Trump carried Highland County heavily, there are people here who did not vote for him and who do not care for him. But overall, despite the avalanche of negative news stories, Trump’s support remains firm. Hillsboro’s mayor mentioned recently that he has noticed Trump yard signs popping up again, either in a show of support or a sign of defiance.\n\nI’m an editor who happens to be a conservative on most issues. But I’m not a conservative editor. I strive to practice and teach solid, unbiased reporting regardless of what we are covering, doing our best to demonstrate respect, accuracy and fairness to all sides. Our political leanings are reserved for the opinion page. I wish more of my liberal colleagues would acquit themselves similarly.\n\nI’m still astounded that our brief endorsement of Trump garnered such attention. In the end, Trump won the state by a solid 8-point margin. Consider the fact that Trump won the popular vote in 30 states, but in most of those states not a single newspaper endorsed him. Could there be better evidence of the gulf that exists between what is called the “mainstream media” and millions of Americans?\n\nAfter the election, some news media leaders pledged to re-examine their approach. If they are even slightly successful in retooling political coverage, perhaps by 2020 a small southern Ohio newspaper’s endorsement of a major-party candidate for president won’t qualify as national news, no matter which candidate it chooses.\n\nWashington Post\n\nGary Abernathy is publisher and editor of the (Hillsboro, Ohio) Times-Gazette, a Civitas Media newspaper.",
  "latent_23012": "BEAUMONT, Texas — Flood-weary Beaumont has a new resident — and if that 8-pound, 10 ounce baby boy could only talk, he’d have a heck of a birthday story to tell.\n\nBeaumont has endured an awful week. Tropical Storm Harvey dumped several feet of rain in the region, leaving sections of this southeast Texas community both inundated and isolated. As of Tuesday, clean water service had not been entirely restored here.\n\nBut Kallen and Dru Wheeler’s expectant baby boy wasn’t interested in waiting out the rains. Dru went into labor last Tuesday morning even as the storm was raging across Beaumont.\n\nLabor pains are stressful for families under the best of circumstances. But Dru’s contractions began “even as the flood waters in our home were just starting to rise,” said Kallen, a Beaumont dentist.\n\nThe Wheelers, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, knew the baby was on its way. “When we saw the water coming in it was a shock, so we said a quick prayer,” said Dru. “I knew I needed to get to the hospital.”\n\nKallen called 911 in hopes of securing an ambulance to transport Dru to the hospital. No luck. The only available vehicle at that treacherous moment was a high-clearance emergency truck. With an EMT riding shotgun, the truck driver navigated across flooded streets to the Wheeler’s home.\n\nDru was carefully lifted into the cab of the truck, but there was no room for Kallen, and their 2-year-old son, Jonas. The young father and son returned to their home to move as many valuables above the rising waterline. Then they jumped into the family SUV, intent on joining up with Dru at Beaumont’s Baptist Hospital.\n\nThe SUV never made it. During their drive storm waters flooded the vehicle and the engine gave out. With the help of a few strangers, Kallen was able to push the stalled SUV to a reasonably dry spot, but it still wouldn’t start.\n\nUndeterred, Kallen lifted Jonas atop his shoulders and started walking in the direction of the hospital.\n\n“A guy pulled up, told me he wouldn’t let us keep walking, and picked us up,” said Kallen. “He was a stranger — just a Good Samaritan.”\n\nKallen and Jonas went to the man’s house where they were given dry towels and something to eat. Then Kallen called a friend who owns a high-clearance truck and asked for a ride to the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Dru had arrived safely at the hospital. She hadn’t planned on delivering the baby without her husband at her side. But she was comforted to learn Kallen and Jonas were safe and dry. “And the nurses at the hospital were awesome,” she added.\n\nBy the time the friend arrived to pick up Kallen, Baby Noah was ready for his own arrival. No time to wait. But with the help of the nursing staff, the Wheeler’s connected on their cell phones via FaceTime. Moments later, Kallen witnessed, electronically, the birth of his second son.\n\n“I consider us to be pretty blessed,” he said. “And I was ecstatic to be a part of that experience.”\n\nBoth mom and baby made it through the delivery in great shape — and the family was reunited at the hospital about 30 minutes later.\n\nDru and the baby were discharged two days later, just moments before Baptist Hospital had to be evacuated. The Wheeler home suffered some water damage, but not enough to force them out. They’re using fans around the house to dry everything.\n\nAnd the little flood survivor's name? Noah Harvey Wheeler.\n\nThe couple had planned to name their baby Noah long before the rains came down and the floods came up across Beaumont. Any connection between the newborn and an ancient, flood-savvy prophet is purely coincidental, laughed Kallen.\n\nBut the child’s middle name Harvey was a stormy birthday surprise. It will forever serve as a reminder of a remarkable day of floods and blessings.",

The camp’s museum houses an eclectic collection of odds and ends salvaged from the camp’s buildings. Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nThis week, women’s social club The Wing launches No Man’s Land, its first print magazine, with stories rolling out exclusively on the Cut.\n\nWe are sitting in the library of the Camp Etna Spiritualist Association, a 141-year old community for clairvoyants, mediums, psychics, and Spiritualists located in a small, rugged hamlet deep in the woods of central Maine. Diane Jackman, the camp’s historian, is in her mid-sixties — aqua blue eyes and flowing silver hair, dressed in a purple, moth-nibbled sweater — but she speaks with the vivacity of a teenager. Her late third husband, Fiddlin’ Red, was a former band member for Captain and Tennille. “Red and I had been making love for 30 minutes when he gasped then stiffened and all of a sudden I heard this big oomph!” Diane lifts her hands in the air to motion what happened next. “I felt his spirit fall through me. It felt like the spirit of the bird I had hit with my truck and killed just a few weeks before.” She screamed his name but Red was gone. Though, to hear Diane tell it, he wasn’t gone completely — she swears part of him still lingers inside of her.\n\nDiane began hitchhiking up the coast, working her way through Maine, content to spend her fifties as a volunteer carpenter. After Red passed, she felt his spirit guiding her on a pilgrimage. One day she saw an old, dilapidated church along the side of the road, covered in sunflowers, and just beyond she spied a purple wrought-iron entrance with white, bold letters: CAMP ETNA. She stepped through it, just as so many women had done before, and lifted the veil of her new life.\n\nThe temple at Camp Etna.

Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nEtna, Maine (population 1,246) is a town better seen on a map than on the ground; stay on the highway and it is easily passed through like an apparition. It’s a town with a single clapboard post office, a goat farm, an apple orchard, a barn converted into the community gym, and properties with lawns and broken-down cars scattered in driveways. But turn left off the main drag of town, drive down a small gravel path, through the graceful iron gate announcing your arrival into the camp, and the road opens onto a grassy knoll surrounded by a bungalow community of one-room cottages. Many are painted purple, the camp’s preferred color, some are pink and purple, and nearly every one has a porch. Dream catchers, Buddha figures, and fairy statues decorate the windows of occupied bungalows, while the other structures slowly fade away or rot. Those still in business hang out their tin shingle to attract visitors: MEDIUM.\n\nA photograph of the camp’s entrance in 1918. Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nIt was the Fox Sisters who introduced America to this new kind of public woman. On the night of March 31, 1848, 11-year-old Kate Fox made contact with the spirit world at a farmhouse in Hydesville, New York. The Fox family had been tormented by strange noises, bumps, and knocks, like someone was moving furniture around. That evening, according to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his History of Spiritualism, Kate “challenged the unseen power to repeat the snaps of her fingers.” The knocking responded.\n\nThe rappings followed the sisters wherever they went, and within a year they began to perform séances in Rochester, New York City, and eventually across the country. Even if their spectators didn’t believe what the Fox sisters claimed to be true, it was likely the first time they had ever witnessed women — young, confident women at that — speak so passionately, so assuredly in public.\n\nKelly Dawn Purington, a medium psychic, practices table tipping, an old method of channeling spirits. Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nThe same year, the Seneca Falls Convention, held over two days in July 1848, brought participants from all over to discuss the state of women in society.\n\nThe atmosphere was “alive with angels,” writes historian Ann Braude in her book Radical Spirits, which weaves together the parallel rise of Spiritualism and women’s rights in America. Many of the women who attended the convention praised the Fox sisters for their progressivism in resisting their roles as politically, financially, sexually, and socially repressed second-class citizens. Some even reported hearing raps on the small mahogany desk where Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucrecia Mott signed the Declaration of Sentiments. “Not all feminists were Spiritualists,” writes Braude, “but all Spiritualists advocated for women’s rights.”\n\nCamp Etna planted its roots in 1858, when a local farmer began to hold Spiritualist meetings in a grove on the banks of a large, shallow pond. Today there are 15 women living full-time at the camp. Arlene Grant, one of the year-round residents, moved here in the 1960s, a time when Spiritualism the religion came into conflict with Spiritualism, the concept: the practice of free will and free love. For women to communicate a will to power, death no longer need to be breached. But to the women who had spent so long speaking to the dead, it was an affront to their very existence.\n\n“Back then, you had to jump through hoops to prove that you were the real deal as a Spiritualist,” Arlene told me. “You couldn’t just say you were a medium — you had to prove it.”\n\nBarbara Williams occasionally uses tools like candles and crystals in her mediumship work. Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nMemorablia from the camp’s museum and library. Photo: Greta Rybus Photographs from the camp’s museum and library. Photo: Greta Rybus\n\nTo the hippies, Spiritualism fit in nicely to the appealing new movements they were experimenting with: self-guidance, communal living, meditation, mysticism, a life of pleasure and less paint, a close relationship with the environment, living by the golden rule. I ask Arlene about the ebbs and flows of the camp. She is angry, and not afraid to show it, about the “new agey” stuff coming into Camp Etna since the 1960s. “Now we have all this ghost hunting, paranormal crap. Tarot cards and angel painting and all that crap when used to be just straight-up Spiritualism. And mediums proved they were real. Now, anyone can come here. It’s bullshit,” she says, sitting in a dark cabin at the edge of camp.\n\nDiane tells me otherwise. That all are welcome; their population is on the rise. I’d been beginning to worry about the fate of Spiritualism and Camp Etna, sentimental that its purpose was expired. But looking around, not only at the women at the camp but at the women in my life, I realized that Spiritualism had done what it had meant to do — it gave women power. It gave women an opportunity and safe place to use their voices, and made it acceptable for women to speak from their gut, from their intuition and instinct, from their minds as well as their hearts. The feminist spirit of Spiritualism wasn’t dead; it was a ghost living among us. It hadn’t shriveled up. It lingered on.\n\nPhoto: Greta Rybus\n\nMira Ptacin is writing a book about Camp Etna entitled The In-Betweens, which is forthcoming by Liveright Publishing.",
  "latent_23219": "Indian stock markets rebounded sharply on Friday, with the BSE Sensex gaining 506 points, its best one-day gain in four months. The broader Nifty jumped 134 points and the rupee also rebounded from 20-month lows. The Sensex closed at 27,105, while the Nifty ended at 8,191.50. The rebound in stock markets comes after three days of selloff in which the Sensex has shed nearly 900 points.\n\n1) The rebound is being attributed to short covering, a strategy where traders buy stocks to cover open short position. Short covering happens after every major selloff.\n\n2) Other factors that are helping sentiments include Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's announcement to form a panel that will suggest ways to resolve the Minimum Alternate Tax dispute. (Read)\n\n3) Gains across global markets and a 3 per cent drop in crude oil prices led to a positive impact on domestic markets, traders said.\n\n4) The rupee rebounded from 20-month lows, pulling back below the key 64 per dollar mark. It ended at 63.94, up 46 paise from Thursday's close of 64.23 per dollar.\n\n5) So, is the selling finally over? That will depend on fund flows, traders said. Foreign investors have been selling domestic equities aggressively, primarily because of concerns about tax demands on capital gains made during previous years. If selling by foreign funds subsides, markets are likely to stabilize in the near term, analysts say.\n\n6) On Thursday, FIIs sold cash shares worth Rs 1,361 crore. Over the last 15 sessions, they have sold shares worth over $2 billion or nearly Rs 14,000 crore.\n\n7) Corporate earnings will also play a major role in market recovery. Analysts say until corporate profitability improves, a sharp rise in equities is unlikely. On Thursday, two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp and jewellery maker Titan posted disappointing results for the March quarter. On Friday, state-run Punjab National Bank disappointed the Street, reporting a sharp rise in bad loans.\n\n8) The sharp selloff in stock markets has damaged confidence of retail investors, analysts say. Market expert Ambaressh Baliga told NDTV that earlier dips were bought in to, but now a lot of investors are waiting on the sidelines despite a sharp correction. He expects the Nifty to consolidate around 8,000.\n\n9) Technical analysts such as Ruchit Jain of Angel Broking told NDTV that a rebound to 8,300-8,320 is likely, but markets are likely to correct after the pullback.\n\n10) Investors will also be eyeing the reform process, which seems to have hit a dead end.

Wow, what a vocal and proud city. Pride well-earned. Thanks to all for the responses — Laura Dimon (@LauraDimon) December 27, 2013\n\nThe T-shirt pitch comes from a Ferndale business called Midwest Lint -- \"3 guys born and raised in #Flint producing positive t-shirts about our beloved city. We will gladly send you one.\" In several tweets, they suggest:\n\nMaybe you can wear one of our t-shirts for your next essay to make it seem like you visited the city.\n\nIf you're going to stay on #Flint as a topic, we can point you towards some positivity. It's not all blight.\n\nUse this opportunity and attention to turn a (-) into a (+).\n\nBefore the article sparked a firestorm, Dimon fished for a celebrity RT the day it was posted:\n\n@Eminem an article i wrote about Flint you might like/want to share http://t.co/n1uDvjLdjX. would mean a lot. — Laura Dimon (@LauraDimon) December 27, 2013\n\nFriday night article:\n\nFlint 's \"story of depression and decay,\" as New York journalist Laura Dimon describes it in an online article, is far different from her experience as a child of privilege and wealth.\n\nDimon, a columnist at a Manhattan digital media start-up called PolicyMic, is one of three daughters of Judith Kent and Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase -- one of the \"too big to fail\" banks. The career-starting Dimon has a 2009 psychology degree from Barnard College and a seven-month-old master's from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nNone of that means she can't report sensitively and insightfully on Flint -- if two-year-old Policy Mic gave writers the time and budget for field reporting. That isn't how Dimon covers \"the hell that has become of much of America's Rust Belt\" for a site that's much closer to Upworthy and BuzzFeed than to Atlantic Cities or National Journal.\n\nDimon's piece about \"Detroit's failing and forsaken neighbor 66 miles to the northwest\" is largely a compilation of facts, figures and material published elsewhere -- what pre-digital journalists called \"a clip job,\" referring to clippings from other publications and their paper's library. The Flint report has 21 external links in just 26 paragraphs, including four each to articles in Forbes and The New York Times.\n\nOne of four people quoted is a filmmaker whose comments are from a July 2012 article in Wired. Another is a photographer whose sentence is from a blurb at his online portfolio. The others are an author who says he was interviewed for 45 minutes by phone and a second photographer who also apparently was contacted by phone or email.\n\n'Vestiges of a Bygone Era'\n\nWith no on-site descriptions, street interviews or comments beyond those from four fellow media creators, Dimon contributes sweeping statements such as this:\n\nFlint is emblematic of a deeper story in America, only one of the many similar tales to emerge from the once thriving, now deteriorating Rust Belt of the United States. These manufacturing and industrial hot spots, spanning from Albany, New York, west across Ohio, Indiana, and through Michigan, were once the great symbols of American innovation and economic prosperity. Today, they're mere vestiges of a bygone era that's been eclipsed by new economic power centers like Wall Street and Silicon Valley.\n\nGordon Young, author of a June book titled \"Teardown: Memoir of a Vanishing City,\" tells Dimon: \"Locals hate that the only story told about Flint is a negative one.\"\n\nThen they'll hate the headline atop her text: \"This is America's Most Apocalyptic, Violent City — And You’ve Probably Never Heard Of It.\"\n\nThis is Shimshon Hagibor street in Ramla, Israel, according to Google Street View. PolicyMic posted it more than a day as Flint.\n\nOh yes they did: PolicyMic tries to lure readers by suggesting the piece is about a surprising, obscure, under-the-radar urban nightmare -- rather than a place Dimon describes as \"the birthplace of General Motors\" and the focus of \"the 1989 documentary 'Roger and Me' about the city, which was recently inducted into the National Film Registry.\"\n\nSaturday update: Nine photos accompany the article, including a top one from AP that actually shows a deteriorating commercial block of Chene at Palmer in Detroit, as Deadline reader Joe Manzella of Clinton Township notes Saturday morning in a comment below this article.\n\nNine photos accompany the article, including a top one from AP that actually shows a deteriorating commercial block of Chene at Palmer in Detroit, as Deadline reader Joe Manzella of Clinton Township notes Saturday morning in a comment below this article. Sunday update: That photo was rep;laced late Saturday after an email exchange about it between Deadline Detroit and Dimon.\n\nAn uncredited photo of a street in Ramla, Israel, accompanied the article until after 10 p.m. Friday. A Redditor named Sam first noted that incongruity Friday afternoon in this thread. He proves the error with the Google Street Maps image at right and posts:\n\nI thought I was hallucinating at first, but this picture is not actually from Flint. I know this because I lived in the place pictured almost my entire life. It's a city in Israel called Ramla. I'm really confused as to why this picture is featured in the article and I'm a little creeped out.\n\nIn other words, this article about Flint is about as substantive and reliable as JPMorgan Chase subprime mortgage credit derivatives.\n\nThe apple apparently doesn't fall far.\n\nUpdate: The Israel photo was yanked after 10 p.m. Friday.\n\nBut wait, there's more -- or more with less substance actually. A 10-paragraph sidebar is headlined \"16 Portraits of Everyday People Who Refuse to Let Their Hometown Be Defeated.\"\n\nThe number of photo portraits is accurate. But they and 10 quote-free paragraphs by Dimon are all we get.\n\nCooking Without Ingredients\n\nLaura Dimon, who didn't visit Flint residents, says they have \"resilience and loyalty [that are] a testament to the true spirit of this city.\"\n\nHere's part of what she whips up like a chef with imagination as the main ingredient:\n\nSome people have not left. Their resilience and loyalty is a testament to the true spirit of this city: one that's about identity, pride, and a refusal to be defeated. The photos below depict some of these stories, the stories of the everyday people who are fighting for a better Flint. The stories of the very real Americans who never get recognized, but will carry on the fight regardless. The stories of the people who inspire us all.\n\nA Texas reader, Sara Munoz of Arlington, finds the serving notably light. At Policy Mic's Facebook page, commenting on a link to the sidebar, she wonders Friday where \"these people's stories or even their NAMES\" are.\n\nUpdate: In a comment below this article, interviewee Gordon Young says in part: \"I wish the author would have devoted less space to all the negative statistics and old news about Flint’s decline, and more to the inspiring residents of my hometown who are using innovative approaches to improve the city. That's what I tried to do in my book..\"\n\nPolicyMic, founded in June 2011 by two childhood friends, casts itself on the About Us page as \"our generation’s platform to make our voices heard . . . [through] high-quality, personal analysis on the news, policy, and pop culture that’s changing our world.\"\n\nWe handpick the best and brightest voices of our generation to provide fresh, expert analysis and perspectives you won't find anywhere else. Traditional media has failed to engage, inform, and inspire us. We want to be part of the solution.\n\nOld-school publishers and broadcasters are derided as \"divisive, opaque media conglomerates.\"\n\n'Studying the Tricks' of Traffic\n\nThat's their spiel. Here's an outsider's view from media reporter Hamish McKenzie of PandoDaily, who wrote about the brash startup in August:\n\nBased in New York, it shares a similar ethos to BuzzFeed and Upworthy, both of which have mastered the art of traffic generation through social sharing. Indeed, much of its traffic success can be attributed to its ability to make its content go viral, a combination of science and art that PolicyMic has learned through studying the tricks of its senior siblings. . . . PolicyMic’s viral team . . . is responsible for assigning story ideas, determining angles, and coming up with headlines for PolicyMic’s writers to work with.\n\nGot that? McKenzie writes that \"a behavioral analyst\" leads a group whose tasks include \"coming up with headlines for PolicyMic's writers.\"\n\nThat cart-before-horse reversal -- \"do a clip job on Flint as America's most apocalyptic, violent city\" -- is not how things typically work at new media or those with print roots.\n\nBut while traditional editorial practices may point the way to an ethical high road, they're not necessarily the route to a high-traffic path in journalism's reshaped landscape.

You can follow him on Twitter at @JustinRobbins15\n\nI’ll offer the obvious disclaimer that “I wasn’t there”, but not without the qualifying claim that I didn’t need to be. The revolution, such that it was, was televised; or streamed, as the case may be.\n\nThat said, and having watched the armed occupation of the Mahleur National Wildlife Refuge unfold in real time, it was not surprising to learn that Robert “LaVoy” Finicum had to be put down, nor to watch the reaction of those who mistook these men as patriots. The Bundy family Facebook page reacted by basically claiming this armed defender of Liberty died at the hands of an oppressive government to which he was trying to surrender. Maybe…but, I doubt it.\n\nWatching these clowns perform for the past three weeks, several things became clear. Primarily, that these men are, and were self-aggrandizing, hypocritical fanatics; disgruntled with bureaucracy for a variety of reasons (who isn’t), and brandishing the type of entitlement rarely held outside of Caucasian circles. The kind of delusional malcontents who reap all the benefits of this great country, yet insist they are victims. They swear an oath to their pocket copies of the Constitution and think the too common act of owning an AR-15 with a 30 round magazine is the equivalent of freedom.\n\nHere’s what gets missed. This is a country taken by force, under the convenient authority of Manifest Destiny, from its indigenous and otherwise current occupants. While far…very far…from perfect, it has always strived to be better, and to make things better for all of its people. To that end, our governments at all levels provide roads, education, protection, water (outside the greater Flint, Michigan, area), recreation spaces and myriad lifestyle opportunities for its 319 million citizens.\n\nIt is all made possible by the consent of the governed and the process by which it may be changed, and it is all subject to change, is spelled out in black and white (honest…check your pocket). So, if “The Government” does something you don’t like, you…like everyone else…follow the process to change it.\n\nIf you think owning a firearm and having like-minded friends makes you somehow unique; you ain’t from around here. If you think brandishing it makes you brave; you are a stranger to courage. If you think the willingness to die for your personal ideals somehow engenders nobility, you are simply foolish.\n\nThe men who commandeered a bird sanctuary and used threats and intimidation in an effort to enforce their interpretation of the Constitution, have no moral claim to the label of “patriot.” In fact, I’d argue quite the opposite. Their actions were criminal in the extreme, and they served only to seize their fifteen minutes of fame at the expense of the citizens whose interests they first fabricated, then claimed to champion.\n\nThis is the unedited FBI video of the roadblock incident from Oregon. At about 9:00, you see the truck driven by Finicum speed away from the first stop and nearly hit an officer while trying to skirt a roadblock. You may judge for yourself whether these are the actions of a surrendering patriot.\n\nLaVoy Finicum was no hero; nor was he a victim. He neglected his duties as a foster parent in order to strut and preen in a masturbatory wild west fantasy role-playing game. Unlike his peers, he failed to recognize an actual well-regulated force when one approached. His legacy is not that of martyr, but rather a symbol of the danger and craven stupidity of the radical ideologue. He died needlessly and senselessly, proving only that Cabella’s camouflage can neither conceal arrogance, nor reckless folly.",
  "latent_23700": "More options: Share, Mark as favorite\n\nReuters U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder answers question at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 6, 2013.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder is defending the decision to read Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect, his Miranda warning, telling CNN that cutting off his questioning “was totally consistent with the laws that we have.”\n\nThat may be true. But three years ago, Holder admitted that “the laws we have” are insufficient for questioning suspected terrorists, and he promised to a major push to change them.\n\nIn May 2010, the Obama administration was under fire after delivering Miranda warnings to both the underwear bomber and the Times Square bomber. Initially, Holder defended the decision to Mirandize these suspects after 50 minutes and three hours respectively. But then, suddenly, the attorney general reversed course. In a series of coordinated Sunday show interviews, Holder announced a change in policy: The Obama administration would work with Congress to change the Miranda law to give interrogators greater flexibility in questioning suspected terrorists.\n\nOn ABC’s “This Week” Holder declared, “I think we have to give serious consideration to at least modifying that public safety exception,” which gives interrogators time to question suspects without a Miranda warning. “And that’s one of the things that I think we’re going to be reaching out to Congress to do, to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional, but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face.”\n\nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Holder called his proposed Miranda changes a “new priority” and “big news,” declaring, “We’re now dealing with international terrorists, and I think that we have to think about perhaps modifying the rules that interrogators have and somehow coming up with something that is flexible and is more consistent with the threat that we now face.”\n\nSo what happened?\n\nApparently nothing. Congress held some hearings. The effort sputtered. Despite the fact that the Democrats then controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, the Obama administration failed to make Miranda reform the “new priority” Holder promised it would be. The “big news” became old news. And now here we are, three years later, and once again we’ve got a suspected terrorist in custody whose interrogation has been stopped by a premature Miranda warning.\n\nIn October 2010, the FBI issued revised guidelines on how the “public safety exception” to Miranda could be applied, but those guidelines did not change current law, which Holder said was insufficient for dealing with the threat.\n\nWhy are we still operating under the same flawed legal framework for questioning of suspected terrorists that Holder pledged to fix three years ago? Why didn’t the Obama administration follow through on Holder’s promise to work with Congress to change the law? Why are we once again reading a suspected terrorist his Miranda rights before intelligence officials are done questioning him for national security purposes?\n\nSome congressional Republicans are calling for Dzhokhar Tsarsaev to be questioned as an enemy combatant. Speaking on the Senate floor, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that “the surviving suspect — due to the ties that these two have to radical Islamic thought and the ties to Chechnya, one of most radical countries in the world — that the president declare preliminarily that the evidence suggests that this man should be treated as an enemy combatant.”\n\nUnfortunately, ties to “radical Islamic thought” and “ties to Chechnya” are not enough. Hard evidence linked the man who tried to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight over Detroit by carrying a bomb in his underwear to a foreign power engaged in an armed conflict with the United States, but we do not yet have such evidence on Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev and his brother may well have been working for al-Qaeda or one of its affiliates, but without proof it would be very difficult to justify holding him as an enemy combatant.\n\nCases like this are precisely why we need Miranda reform. If Holder is insistent that we use the criminal justice system to deal with terrorists captured here in the United States, then it is his responsibility to fix the flaws in that system. He promised to do so, and he failed to deliver. Now, because of that failure, another suspect has stopped talking.",
  "latent_23723": "Trailer for Sinister.\n\nSinister is a frightening new thriller from the producer of the Paranormal Activity films and the writer-director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Ethan Hawke plays a true crime novelist who discovers a box of mysterious, disturbing home movies that plunge his family into a nightmarish experience of supernatural horror.\n\nThe idea for the film came to writer Robert Cargill, in a nightmare he had after watching the film, The Ring.\n\nThe film contains very little blood, strong language, and no sexual content, as the filmmakers were hoping for a PG-13 rating. However, the film still received an R-rating due to its disturbing content. The rating did not hurt the Box-Office, however, as the film turned a $3 million budget into $87 million worldwide.\n\nEthan Hawke plays a writer in the film. In real life, Hawke is a writer too. He has written the novels, The Hottest State, Ash Wednesday, and Rules for a Knight.\n\nIt is rare for a movie trailer to be completely terrifying but somehow in just two and a half minutes, the trailer for Sinister manages to muster some surprisingly real jolts and an unsettling feeling afterwards. Ethan Hawke is his dreamy self as a writer who moves his family to a new house while he writes a new book. The new house is cool and all until he finds some old film reels that feature the family who died in the house years before. Come on people, even if you need some good material for a book, stop moving into houses where people were murdered or haunted by a demonic entity! Think about the children.\n\nAs we see in other films, the kids are always the target of these ghosts and demons. If there is one thing that is more frightening than demonic creatures, it is children being possessed by said creatures. Hawke’s character continues to do a little research and finds out from Vincent D’Onofrio that he should probably just ditch the house because his kids are clearly going to be leaning toward the dark side soon. Even if they leave, they are pretty much screwed because that seems to be what happens in horror films now, the entity just follows them.\n\nThe trailer for Sinister is legitimately scary and Ethan Hawke is just the absolute best, but that may be a bias opinion. There are plenty of similar horror movies that have been released, but the trailer for Sinister makes it feel like a worthy terrifying experience above the rest.",
  "latent_23788": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and its allies are discussing a worst-case scenario that could require tens of thousands of ground troops to go into Syria to secure chemical and biological weapons sites following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government, according to U.S. and diplomatic officials.\n\nA man uses binoculars as he looks towards Syria from part of an abandoned military outpost near the Druze village of Buqata in the Golan Heights July 24, 2012. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nThese secret discussions assume that all of Assad’s security forces disintegrate, leaving chemical and biological weapons sites in Syria vulnerable to pillaging. The scenario also assumes these sites could not be secured or destroyed solely through aerial bombings, given health and environmental risks.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to explain the sensitive discussions, said the United States still had no plans to put boots on the ground in Syria. President Barack Obama’s administration has, in fact, so far refused to provide lethal support to the rebels fighting to oust Assad’s regime and the Pentagon has played down the possibility of implementing a no-fly zone anytime soon.\n\n“There is not a imminent plan to deploy ground forces. This is, in fact, a worst-case scenario,” the official said, adding U.S. forces would likely play a role in such a mission.\n\nTwo diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said as many as 50,000 or 60,000 ground forces may be needed if officials’ worst fears are realized, plus additional support forces.\n\nEven a force of 60,000 troops, however, would not be large enough for peacekeeping and would only be the amount required to secure the weapons sites - despite some of the appearances of a Iraq-style occupation force, the diplomatic sources cautioned.\n\nIt is unclear at this stage how such a military mission would be organized and which nations might participate. But some European allies have indicated they are unlikely to join, the sources said.\n\nThe White House declined comment on specific contingency plans. Spokesman Tommy Vietor said that while the U.S. government believes the chemical weapons are under the Syrian government’s control, “Given the escalation of violence in Syria, and the regime’s increasing attacks on the Syrian people, we remain very concerned about these weapons.\n\n“In addition to monitoring their stockpiles, we are actively consulting with Syria’s neighbors - and our friends in the international community - to underscore our common concern about the security of these weapons, and the Syrian government’s obligation to secure them,” Vietor said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nPOTENTIALLY DOZENS OF SITES\n\nWhile there is no complete accounting of Syria’s unconventional weapons, it is widely believed to have stockpiles of nerve agents such as VX, sarin and tabun.\n\nThe U.S. official said there were potentially dozens of chemical and biological weapons sites scattered around the country.\n\nSecuring them could not be left to an aerial bombing, which could lead to the dispersion of those agents, the official said.\n\n“There could be second-order effects that could be extremely problematic,” the official said of aerial bombing.\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta said last month that it was important that Syrian security forces be held together when Assad is forced from power, citing, in particular, their ability to secure chemical weapons sites.\n\n“They do a pretty good job of securing those sites,” Panetta said in an interview with CNN in July. “If they suddenly walked away from that, it would be a disaster to have those chemical weapons fall into the wrong hands, hands of Hezbollah or other extremists in that area.”\n\nThe United States, Israel and Western powers have been discussing the nightmarish possibility that some of Assad’s chemical weapons could make their way to militant groups - al-Qaeda style Sunni Jihadi insurgents or pro-Iranian Shi’ite Lebanese fighters from Hezbollah.\n\nSome Western intelligence sources suggested that Hezbollah and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, both close allies of Syria, might try to get hold of the chemical weapons in the case of a total collapse of government authority.\n\nSyria began to acquire the ability to develop and produce chemical weapons agents in 1973, including mustard gas and sarin, and possibly also VX nerve agent.\n\nPrecise quantities and configurations of chemical weapons in the Syrian stockpile are not known. However, the CIA has estimated that Syria possesses several hundred liters of chemical weapons and produces hundreds of tons of agents annually.\n\nThe Global Security website, which collects published intelligence reports and other data, says there are several suspected chemical weapons facilities in Syria.\n\nAnalysts have also identified the town of Cerin, on the coast, as a possible production site for biological weapons.",
  "latent_23869": "Terrorism in the Middle East knows no limits. The ancient monastery of St. Catherine in Egypt's Sinai desert was attacked, with 40 worshipers slaughtered. This is the same religious shrine that has a decree of protection issued by the Prophet Muhammad himself until the end of days.\n\nA bus carrying Coptic Christians on a prayer vigil was attacked, killing 26 people, including ten children.\n\nAs these incidents indicate, the challenge for Middle East leaders is the maintenance of religious beliefs within limits imposed by modernity along with secularization that doesn't trample religious observance.\n\nThe terrorists had clear goals in mind. One: They wanted to demonstrate that the government does not have the ability to deter terrorism. Two: The attack was a way to discourage tourism, the major source of revenue in the country. Three: Making this incident distinctly religious is believed to cause defections from the secular impulse in the nation.\n\nReligious freedom is clearly being threatened in Egypt, a condition that goes back 50 years to the publications of Sayyid Qutb, Islamic theorist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood. This trend applies throughout the Levant, where secular nationalism has had to compete with the orthodox stance of radical Islam. Gamal Abdel Nasser walked a fine line between the two positions by evoking a sense of national pride, but when his regime descended into pan-Arabism and economic collapse, secularism suffered as well.\n\nIn the Middle East, it is apparent that what is dormancy is not death. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is a pious Muslim who cautions against the extremism within his faith. Those who want to weaken him do not fully understand the political alternatives. Removing loathsome dictators, as was the case in Iran, Libya, and Iraq, does yields the blossoming not of a new spring, but rather of extremist forms of religions far more destructive than the regimes replaced. Radical elements do understand the meaning of replacement. A pathway to an Islamized Egypt lies in the \"bulls-eye\" on Sisi's back.\n\nWestern goals in the region invariably refer to Ataturk's secularization program in Turkey. But while Ataturk's influence was profound, President Erdoğan has disinterred religious ideas, imposing them in a manner that would have been unthinkable before 2002, when he was first elected. Religion may have been in a long slumber in Turkey, but it is now awakened and playing a profound role.\n\nSisi, to his credit, understands the need to balance religion and modernity; perhaps that explains why he is a threat to Islamists. In his case, dedication to his faith is real, but it is not a faith imposed on the Egyptian people. Surely, his critics contend that the blasphemy laws are not applied fairly to non-Muslims. This may be true. Nonetheless, the balance his government has achieved, however imperfect, is a veritable model for the region and the best hope for stabilization.\n\nHerbert London is president of the London Center for Policy Research.",

The clean white finish on the 3 inflatable rings contributes to a classic look and feel, and the saturn ring around the top maximizes stabilization and yaw.\n\nThe bowl has been made deep enough to provide a solid feeding from, but still fit ergonomically between your legs within the special drop crotch design. The BPA free material lets you know its good, and the bowl can even be removed and put in the dishwasher.\n\nEvery bowl needs a good pump.

The velcro on the flap has been chosen to attach securely but not be cumbersome to detach. The flap can either be tucked down and inward, or up and into the band to be used as something of a pant hanky.\n\nThe waist is hugged by a 1.5\" stretchy band, designed to let loose when you need it and tuck you in when you don't.

(Photo11: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)\n\nFLINT, Mich. —Michigan's attorney general announced new criminal charges against four defendants Tuesday — including two former emergency managers appointed by the state — in his ongoing criminal investigation of the Flint drinking water crisis and lead poisoning of city residents.\n\nAttorney General Bill Schuette brought felonies that could result in 20 years in prison against defendants that he alleged conspired to operate the Flint Water Treatment Plant when it wasn't safe to do so and used a phony environmental order to allow the city to borrow money to proceed with the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline while tying Flint to the Flint River for its drinking water in the interim.\n\nOfficials pushed ahead in April 2014 with taking the city's drinking water from the Flint Riverdespite knowing that the Flint Water Treatment Plant was not ready to deliver safe drinking water, Schuette and his investigators alleged at a news conference.\n\n\"So many people knew that that plant was not ready — and yet it was done,\" said Andrew Arena, former special agent in charge of the FBI in Detroit, and now Schuette's lead investigator. \"That's the thing that shocked me.\"\n\nIn 67th District Court, a judge authorized charges against former Flint emergency managers Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose and city officials Howard Croft, who was public works superintendent, and Daugherty Johnson, the utilities administrator.\n\n“We're much closer to the end than we are to the beginning, but we're not at the end. There are some people out there who know they've done wrong, and they know we're coming after them.” Andrew Arena, Flint water investigator\n\nFlint Mayor Karen Weaver said she sees the charges as a broader indictment of the state's emergency-manager system for financially distressed cities, in which an appointed official from outside takes powers stripped from the elected mayor and council.\n\n\"It's taken the voice of the people and taken our democracy,\" Weaver told reporters after the charges were announced.\n\nJeff Seipenko, a special agent with the Attorney General's Office, told Judge William Crawford II that his office's investigation showed that the former emergency managers conspired with Croft and Johnson to enter a contract based on false pretenses that bound the city of Flint to use the Flint River as its drinking water source, \"knowing that the Flint Water Treatment Plant was unable to produce safe water.\"\n\nAfter being advised to switch back to water treated that the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department treated, Earley and Ambrose failed to reconnect to the city's former water supply, Seipenko said. The result: Flint residents had prolonged exposure to lead and Legionella bacteria.\n\nAll four defendants face felony charges of false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses. In addition, Earley and Ambrose also were charged with willful neglect of duty and misconduct in office.\n\n\"We're back in Flint — the city where so many things went terribly wrong, but where those who broke the law will be held accountable.

As a result, lead leached from pipes, joints and fixtures into Flint households.\n\nOfficials are also investigating links between the water switch and outbreaks of deadly Legionnaires' disease in the Flint area.\n\nThough lead levels in the water have come down significantly since the state acknowledged the contamination around Oct. 1, 2015, residents still are advised not to drink tap water without a filter.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 8, 2017, 3:45 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 9, 2017, 8:14 PM GMT By Tracy Connor\n\nAfter his election, Donald Trump quickly settled a series of business disputes — but just days before his inauguration, the president-elect's company is still waging a legal battle against a Florida shop owner over an unpaid bill.\n\nThe matter could have been settled for what amounts to pocket change for a billionaire, but the Trump Organization decided to take its chances in court.\n\nNow Trump stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if he wins, it could force a small businessman — one of hundreds who say they were stiffed by Trump over the years — possibly into bankruptcy.\n\nThat businessman, Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, won the first round of the legal skirmish last summer when a judge found a lien he slapped on the Trump National Doral golf resort was valid.\n\nThe court ordered Trump to pay for $32,000 worth of paint, plus nearly $300,000 in legal fees. Trump's company appealed, and barring a last-minute resolution, the case will be pending when he takes office; the deadline for final briefs is two days before he becomes the most powerful person in America.\n\nEnriquez's lawyer, Daniel Vega, said he is not surprised it has gone this far.\n\n\"The Trump litigation team litigated this case from day one like lions on fresh meat and continue to do so now on appeal,\" he told NBC News.\n\nThe matter dates back to the fall of 2013 when Enriquez, who owns three Miami paint stores, was tapped by a subcontractor to supply paint for a major remodeling project at the Doral resort, owned and operated by a Trump company called Trump Endeavor.\n\nThe Trump National Doral clubhouse March 7, 2016 in Doral, Florida. Wilfredo Lee / AP\n\nThere is no dispute that the paint was delivered and used on the property, according to court records. But after the subcontractor walked off the job weeks before completion, Enriquez didn't get a final payment.\n\nIn a deposition, a project manager for general contractor Straticon testified that he failed to get the Trump Organization to pay the balance.\n\n\"Were you trying to pay him,\" Vega asked the manager, Jamie Gram, during the sessions.\n\n\"I was,\" Gram replied.\n\n\"And what happened?\"\n\n\"Somebody chose not to,\" Gram said.\n\n\"Who?\" the lawyer asked.\n\n\"The Trump Organization,\" Gram said.\n\n\"Who at Trump?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Gram said. \"Mr. Trump. Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Enriquez filed a lien — a legal tool that can be used to recover a debt by tying up a piece of property — against Doral.\n\nEight months later, Enriquez filed a lawsuit against Trump Endeavor, seeking to foreclose on the 800-acre resort.\n\nThen-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drives himself around the golf course on March 6, 2016, in Doral, Florida. Luis M. Alvarez / AP\n\nThe Trump team's defense was largely technical.\n\nIt turned out that when Enriquez took the job he submitted paperwork called a Notice to Owner, which would allow him to file a lien against the property if a bill wasn't paid.\n\nA Trump official gave him a form to work off — but it listed the general contractor for a different part of the project, and Enriquez repeated the mistake on his notice.\n\nGram later noticed and flagged the error. Enriquez said he would fix it but never did, court documents show.\n\nAt trial, though, Gram testified that the decision not to pay Enriquez \"had nothing to do with a defective notice to owner.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that the bill went unpaid because the Trump Organization had already paid \"a decent amount of money\" to the subcontractor, M&P, before it abandoned the job. The resort used any money left over, plus additional funds, to complete the unfinished paint job, he said.\n\nGram's testimony appeared to distress Trump's legal team, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Jorge Cueto noted in his June 2016 ruling.\n\n\"When Mr. Gram made that admission, Trump's trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily and attempted to make eye contact with him,\" the judge wrote.\n\nThe judge found that Enriquez had made \"diligent efforts\" to comply with the lien law and that being given the wrong paperwork by the Trump official was the root of the mistake. He also dismissed Trump clams that the bill was fraudulent, subtracting only $76.39 for a stepladder from the bottom line.\n\nCueto then dealt the Trump team a bigger blow, ruling that they had to pay Enriquez's legal costs. Because Vega had taken the case on contingency, meaning he would not get paid if they lost, the judge tacked on a multiplier to compensate him for the risk he took, nearly doubling the award to $283,949.91.\n\n\"Trump elected to fight this case 'tooth and nail' instead of resolving it for a reasonable amount, driving up Paint Spot's litigation fees and costs,\" the judge explained.\n\nThe Trump trial attorneys did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the Trump Organization's general counsel. The attorney handling the appeal, Bruce Rogow, did not respond to a question about who should have paid Enriquez for the paint used at Doral.\n\n\"Florida Statutes on liens are very specific and the appeal seeks to enforce those statutes which would mean that there was no valid lien to begin with and therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief,\" he wrote in an email. \"That really is all that is at issue.\"\n\nRogow did not respond to a question about whether the president-elect was personally involved in the decision to appeal the judgement. A spokesperson for Trump also did not respond to questions from NBC News.\n\nVega said he is confident The Paint Spot will win the appeal. But if he loses, he said, Enriquez could be saddled with Trump legal fees and might face bankruptcy. Trump's attorney declined to say whether they would seek to recoup the legal fees.\n\nDespite the stakes, Vega said he and his client were not afraid to take on the litigious billionaire.\n\n\"The Paint Spot is also owned by a proud small business owner... and he felt and we agreed that he was right factually and legally and therefore, we both decided to take on the risk,\" Vega said.",

  "latent_24472": "Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit has been ridiculed by European ministers after he told Italy it would have to offer tariff-free trade in order to sell its prosecco in the UK.\n\nCarlo Calenda, an Italian economics minister, said it was insulting that Johnson had told him during a recent meeting that Italy would grant Britain access to the EU’s single market “because you don’t want to lose prosecco exports”.\n\n“He basically said: ‘I don’t want free movement of people but I want the single market,’” he told Bloomberg. “I said: ‘No way.’ He said: ‘You’ll sell less prosecco.’ I said: ‘OK, you’ll sell less fish and chips, but I’ll sell less prosecco to one country and you’ll sell less to 27 countries.’ Putting things on this level is a bit insulting.”\n\nThe Guardian view on Boris Johnson: he is causing too much needless chaos | Editorial Read more\n\nThe Italian also attacked the whole government’s approach to the Brexit negotiations, saying the demand by Johnson and others for access to the single market was incompatible with curbs on free movement of people.\n\n“Somebody needs to tell us something, and it needs to be something that makes sense,” he told Bloomberg. “You can’t say that it’s sensible to say we want access to the single market but no free circulation of people. It’s obvious that doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.”\n\nCalenda, a former Italian envoy to Brussels, said: “There’s lots of chaos and we don’t understand what the position is. It’s all becoming an internal UK debate, which is not OK. The British government needs to sit down, put its cards on the table and negotiate.”\n\nA second attack was delivered by the Dutch finance minister and Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who said Johnson’s aims of leaving the customs union at the same time as securing immigration controls and maintaining access to the single market were not achievable.\n\nDijsselbloem told the BBC’s Newsnight: “I think he’s offering to the British people options that are really not available. For example, to say we could be inside the internal market but be outside the customs union, this is impossible, it just doesn’t exist. The opposite does exist. We have a customs union with Turkey but Turkey is not part of the internal market.\n\n“He’s saying things that are intellectually impossible, politically unavailable, so I think he’s not offering the British people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these negotiations.”\n\nDescribing Brexit as a lose-lose situation, Dijsselbloem added: “It would be in my country’s interests and in European and British interests if the Brits would stay in the EU but I don’t think it’s going to happen. The next best option is to have as good an agreement as possible but the UK will be outside the single market and there will be some hindrances.”\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, also appeared to be standing firm on defending the fundamental principle of free movement within the EU on Tuesday but conceded there could be room for further discussion around whether welfare benefits should be immediately available for life if an EU citizen moved to another member state.\n\nTheresa May, the prime minister, has refused to elaborate on her plan for Brexit beyond saying she wants a bespoke deal, curbs on immigration and as much free trade for UK businesses as possible.\n\nShe told the House of Commons on Wednesday that being in or out of the EU customs union was “not a binary decision” as her Labour and SNP critics attacked her lack of a strategy for Brexit.\n\nMay repeatedly insisted she and her ministers were devising a coherent plan for exiting the EU but would not share details before negotiations began.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, focused his questions almost entirely on Brexit and argued that the government was “making a total shambles” of it.\n\nThe prime minister plans to trigger article 50, notifying the EU of the UK’s intention to leave the bloc, by the end of March but there are growing concerns that her timetable is too ambitious, after a note by a consultant at Deloitte suggested the government lacked a plan for Brexit and may need to employ up to 30,000 more civil servants to deal with the process.\n\nSir Simon Fraser, the former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, told the House of Commons Brexit committee on Wednesday that the note appeared to exaggerate the problems but agreed there was not yet a central plan for leaving the EU.\n\n“My understanding is that it is indeed proving to be a very considerable challenge in Whitehall to do this [drawing up a Brexit plan], that the government has not yet reached the point where … it is still in information-gathering mode and is not yet at the point of integrating that into a central plan. And that, I assume, will have to happen before the triggering of article 50 next year.\n\n“And I agree that this is a huge burden, a huge additional load, for the civil service. This is an extraordinary complex range of activity across a wide range of domestic and international policies and it will definitely impose a great burden on the civil service.”\n\nIn response, Michael Gove, the former cabinet minister and leading Brexit campaigner, pressed for the UK to achieve a “quickie divorce” with the EU regardless of the economic consequences, as he raised concerns that civil servants were overcomplicating the process.\n\nThe former justice secretary, who led the Vote Leave campaign with Johnson, questioned why the UK could not just leave the EU without having settled its future relationship with the bloc after having sorted out “housekeeping” related to outstanding payments.\n\n“Can we simplify?” Gove said. “What if I were to determine to simply leave the European Union, to trigger article 50 and to conclude the bare minimum in order to leave? What would article 50 actually require me to agree?\n\n“For the purposes of this question, I am not worried about transitional arrangements, I am prepared to take the economic hit or to secure the economic benefits of not being inside the single market and being outside the customs union. I simply want the divorce on the quickest possible terms. What do I need in that quickie divorce?”",
  "latent_24504": "How Could The Lions Improve Their Offense This Offseason?\n\nWhen viewing Detroit’s needs for the 2016 offseason, the offense is rarely mentioned as a place that the team needs to target for upgrades and young talent. While the defense is certainly a priority, there are still crucial needs on the offensive side of the ball that cannot be ignored, and key talent that needs to be retained.\n\nMatthew Stafford and his late game runs had some viewing the Lions offense as a perfectly competent machine with room to grow, but their showings also displayed some vital flaws. The most prominent fault of all was the lack of a power run element. Blocking suffered tremendously without a credible inline tight end, holes weren’t opening up on a regular basis in the middle with injuries along the offensive line, and no runner proved capable of pushing the pile to pick up tough yards when it mattered.\n\nIf the proper role players are found, this issue can be fixed quite easily, and with little in the way of draft investment. So with that lets take a trip through the best case Detroit Lions offseason.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nObviously there is not a lot of change planned here. Stafford is the present and future of the franchise, just barely entering his prime with many good years surely left ahead of him. While he certainly needs a new contract sooner rather then later, that is more of a matter of time in my mind and not pertinent in this discussion. He will be resigned by Detroit, it will be long term, and it’s going to be close to the largest dollar figure signed in league history. Nobody with a decent football IQ should think that’s a bad idea.\n\nThe real question is what will occur behind him. Dan Orlovsky has been the backup for several years now, but he’s getting up in age at this point and has limited upside at this stage in his career.\n\nThe main reason for keeping him in the past was to help Stafford grow and develop as a player. With Stafford becoming an elite player though there’s no need for someone to fill that role and it’s time to start looking at grooming a young player to have around as a developmental piece. Jake Rudock seems to have the potential to be that guy.\n\nDetroit was forced to bring him up to the active roster when teams tried to swipe him off the practice squad this season and clearly like his development thus far. While it’s typically a good idea to roll with three QB’s in case of injury, if you’re certain about your #2 you can get away with dropping the third man.\n\nEven in an ideal offseason though it’s tough to see Bob Quinn roll with just Rudock behind Stafford. They probably keep Dan on one more year as a veteran backup plan should a code red emergency arise.\n\nNew Depth Chart: Matthew Stafford, Jake Rudock, Dan Orlovsky\n\nTotal Investment: None\n\nhttp://gty.im/607563858\n\nRunning Backs\n\nThis position group struggled mightily with injuries all year so it’s a bit tough to evaluate. Ameer Abdullah is the clear lead back here so long as he stays healthy but he’s now suffered two significant injuries in two seasons. He should definitely retain his #1 role but he needs to be used in smarter ways to avoid further damage.\n\nTheo Riddick is still arguably the best receiving threat out of the backfield in the NFL but again proved he cannot be anywhere near a threat running between the tackles. Those two are solidified on the roster as the top two options but beyond them things get murky.\n\nZach Zenner is the next guy on the depth chart but still has yet to show definitely that he is an NFL quality power back. Sure he does a lot of good things but he’s not really solid in any one area. Outside of two noticeable performances against the Packers abysmal defense and the Cowboys backups, Zenner had 198 yards on 56 attempts for 3.5 yards per carry.\n\nThat’s right around Minnesota’s league worst rushing unit’s numbers. The obvious fact that nobody wants to mention because Zenner is so well liked among the fan community, and rightfully so, is that he simply cannot push the pile on a regular basis. He needs a clear hole to be productive and if you’re going to be the power back of an effective rotation with a hugely important role on the team, you need to be able to generate yards when that isn’t available.\n\nZenner is a great #4 to have as a backup and special teams guy but thats about his extent. Dwayne Washington looked interesting in spurts early but quickly died off, becoming more and more hesitant as the season went on and was awful in pass blocking. While it’s not time to pull the plug at this point he’s going to be fighting for his roster spot this offseason.\n\nFinally fullback Michael Burton is undoubtably a really solid player and one of the better players at his position. The problem is Jim Bob Cooter has yet to find a way to use him effectively and he’s just wasting away on the bench for no good reason. In fact he was one of the least used full time Fullbacks in the NFL last year playing less then 10% of Detroit’s offensive snaps.\n\nhttp://gty.im/459423812\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done here is address the power back position. While Abdullah is the clear top dog, a role player that can pick up tough yards between the tackles is simply a must get for the Lions in order to lengthen Ameer’s career.\n\nSamaje Perine in the 4th round of the draft offers absurd value for Detroit and highlights the crazy depth of this class. He’s a dominant bruiser that also happens to have deadly agility, great hands, and solid pass protection skills combining to form the perfect package for the type of guy Detroit needs in the backfield.\n\nHe could have the potential to develop into a workhorse every down guy should Abdullah’s Lisfranc injury be more serious then previously thought, but he has a bit of a durability issue and some speed concerns. That being said if you grab Perine here the Lions offense instantly becomes significantly more dangerous and efficient and that type of piece is extremely rare to find in the mid to late fourth.\n\nHe would take Washington’s roster spot while Dwayne slides down to the practice squad. The only other player to note in changes is Michael Burton. As previously mentioned, there is no sense in keeping a quality talent on the bench when his role could be filled much more efficiently.\n\nHe still has two years left on a very team friendly contract and there are several teams that either have a need or could use an upgrade at the postition. Detroit could rather easily get a mid 6th round pick for him on the open market.\n\nNew Depth Chart: Ameer Abdullah, Theo Riddick, Samaje Perine, Zach Zenner\n\nTotal Investment: A third round pick, got a 6th round pick back (for Burton)\n\nWide Receivers\n\nA lot has been invested into the wide receiver position over the last few years between Golden Tate a few seasons ago, and Marvin Jones last year. Those two provide a very solid 1A/1B pairing with Jones providing a more traditional outside receiver role, and Tate working as more of a gadget guy lining up all over the field.\n\nBeyond that though, as with the running backs, there are questions and concerns. Anquan Boldin had an extremely important role last year for Detroit but he was essentially serving as a receiving TE since Detroit had nothing after Ebron at the position. At 37 next October, he’s certainly lost a step and its uncertain at this point if he is worth the price tag. Especially considering Ebron should be taking on a larger role at this stage.\n\nAndre Roberts was a nice surprise as the WR4, hauling in some big catches and playing quite well overall. He also proved to be one of the best punt return men in the league last year and an alright kick returner as well. That should get him resigned for a few more years at the right price. After that between TJ Jones and Jace Billingsley there isn’t a whole lot to write home about.\n\nIn the best case scenario, Boldin just doesn’t represent enough upside to keep around when combined with his dollar value and upgrades which will be referred to later on. Instead a cheaper option could fill the void in free agency through Brian Quick.\n\nThe Rams receiver has shown spurts of really solid play over his time with the Rams and should be had for a relatively affordable price after dealing with the ineptitude of the Rams organization for years, pushing his production down. He will be able to do enough in the third wide reciever role and comes with the flexibility to work all over the field on a short term deal.\n\nTo address the future, the Lions could look for another value pick in the 5th round with great potential: Travin Dural. At LSU he was in a run first offense with terrible quarterback play, which will hold back his draft value, however he has clearly illustrated ability over the course of his time in college ball. He has a great size/speed combination that can be used to help stretch the field opposite Marvin Jones, and could develop into a significant asset after some polish and work with a quality signal caller. The shedding of the fullback allows the Lions to go back to a traditional five wide receiver unit.\n\nNew Depth Chart: Golden Tate, Marvin Jones, Brian Quick, Travin Dural, Andre Roberts\n\nTotal Investment: a 5th round pick, and $3.5 million dollars in signings/resignings\n\nhttp://gty.im/459081366\n\nTight Ends\n\nWithout question tight end was the most talent poor position on the Lions offense last year. Eric Ebron has had his ups and downs since getting to Detroit, and isn’t the most popular Lion out there, but he’s developed into a fairly solid option as a receiving tight end. Perhaps he is not as great as everyone had hoped he would be when he was drafted out of North Carolina, but he has gotten progressively better every season and showed flashes last year of borderline top five TE potential.\n\nHe most likely will have his option picked up and hopefully continues to grow as a player. The better he gets the more effective the Lions offense will be. Beyond Ebron though was a complete mess due to Brandon Pettigrew’s injury which eventually led to his release. The combination of Cole Wick, Mathew Mulligan, Cole Harbour and whoever else the Lions inserted into the lineup was the equivalent of scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel and needs to be upgraded on extensively going forward.\n\nhttp://gty.im/460872282\n\nFirst to resolve the TE2 slot, you need a versatile in line player that is equally comfortable blocking and receiving the ball. The best option for that in either the draft or free agency without question is Dion Sims.\n\nHe’s well regarded as a great blocker and lately with injuries to Jordan Cameron, and with Charles Clay’s departure for Buffalo, he’s gotten more and more opportunities to show off his receiving skills. He has experience in an H-back role from his earlier time in Miami, which gives him the ability to replace Michael Burton’s limited snaps out of the backfield. Also can take over the rest of Anquan Boldin’s responsibilities from last year that Ebron doesn’t pick up in an expanded role.\n\nAt only 25 years old, Detroit could bring Sims back to his home town on a long term deal. Providing them with a little bit of insurance incase Ebron departs in free agency in coming years, should he demand too much money on the open market. Sims without question improves Detroit’s run game through versatile blocking ability, and pass game as a more deceptive option from an in line stance.\n\nAfter that though the TE3 slot still needs to be addressed, and that can be handled with a late draft pick. Since the position was addressed already in free agency it takes the need down from a significantly earlier pick. A developmental prospect is still important for depth behind the starting two and special teams.\n\nWith one of their possible three 6th round picks (based on my scenario), Detroit could target Antony Auclair out of Laval, the 6′ 6, 254 pound receiver convert out of Canada. Auclair has a lot to like about him: a great size speed combo, good hands, and great toughness. He can be left to special teams duty and some limited action while he refines his technique and adjusts to the NFL level of competition, and can be ready in a few years should Ebron be lost as a potential #2 option behind Sims.\n\nNew Depth Chart: Eric Ebron, Dion Sims, Antony Auclair\n\nhttp://gty.im/624816360\n\nOffensive Line\n\nAn area of concern entering the year, the offensive line had good and bad moments in 2016 but was generally quite good when healthy behind a great rookie season from 1st round pick Taylor Decker. Rookies Decker and third rounder Graham Glasgow anchored the left side of the line surprisingly well in their first season and look like long term pieces to build around.\n\nSo to does Travis Swanson at center who had an amazing comeback season turning from a bottom five into a top five player at his position before suffering a concussion toward the end of the year.\n\nThe real question marks come on the right side of the line, where right guard Larry Warford and right tackle Riley Reiff are both primed to hit the free agent market and test their value. Both Reiff and Warford looked very good at times last year, Reiff especially in his first year on the right side, and should be the top two priorities for Detroit heading into the offseason.\n\nKeeping continuity along a young o-line can only help grow the strength of the starters as they play together over time. While it is fair to be concerned about potentially overpaying for those two guys, when you factor in that the left side of the line still has four years left on their rookie contracts, you can afford to overspend on the right side in the short term.\n\nFor the first time in a while the team has also started to develop some pretty decent depth along the offensive line as well. Laken Tomlinson is a huge disappointment thus far but will be fighting for his job this summer but after that Joe Dahl has looked pretty good in limited time along with Corey Robinson coming off the bench for injured starters. Brandon Thomas, the third round mauling guard acquired in a trade with San Fransisco will also be added to the mix to compete for a spot.\n\nIdeally the best case scenario for the offensive line is resigning Reiff and Warford and locking them up for the next four to five years. Offering a longer contract with more guaranteed money should in theory keep the costs down enough that they can both be retained without issue. Beyond that, getting another tackle to take the 4th OT spot should be considered as well with Cornelius Lucas hitting free agency and Corey Robinson with only two years left on his rookie deal. Don Barclay comes to mind as a great primary depth lineman if they can steal him from Green Bay off the free agent market.\n\nNew Depth Chart: Decker, Glasgow, Swanson, Warford, Reiff, Barclay, Dahl, Robinson, Tomlinson\n\nTotal Investment: $17 million dollars in signings/resignings\n\nSummary\n\nThe Lions offense certainly doesn’t need major fixes this offseason, but bringing back the right guys with a couple additions would be huge for the unit. With these changes the run game has been thoroughly addressed through both blocking improvements and a better rotation, creating a group that is deeper and stronger then ever.\n\nThe tight end position goes from being a liability to being a strength of the team, providing an immense amount of more flexibility for Jim Bob Cooter and Stafford in their formations and play deception. The offensive line is kept in tact improving protection for the franchise QB, and the receiving options are diversified, adding both size and speed to the unit for Stafford to spread the ball around to.\n\nWhen combined with defensive improvements necessary to help turn the other side of the ball around, these moves definitively take Detroit to the next level skill wise for the 2017 season.\n\nFinal Offensive Roster\n\nQB: Matthew Stafford, Jake Rudock, Dan Orlovsky\n\nRB: Ameer Abdullah, Theo Riddick, Samaje Perine*, Zach Zenner\n\nWR: Marvin Jones, Golden Tate, Brian Quick*, Andre Roberts, Travin Dural*\n\nTE: Eric Ebron, Dion Sims*, Antony Auclair*\n\nOT: Eric Decker, Reilly Reiff, Don Barclay*, Corey Robinson\n\nOG/C: Larry Warford, Travis Swanson, Graham Glasgow, Joe Dahl, Laken Tomlinson",

Ebola causes massive bleeding and kills up to 90 percent of its victims.\n\n“The epidemic is not under control. On the contrary the situation is very, very serious,” Eugene Kabambi, a WHO spokesman in Congo’s capital Kinshasa, told Reuters by phone.\n\n“If nothing is done now, the disease will reach other places, and even major towns will be threatened,” he said, adding that an estimated $2 million (1.2 million pounds) had to be urgently found to pay for measures to tackle the disease.\n\nThe outbreak, which is believed to have been caused by tainted bush meat hunted by local villagers, has so far struck in the towns of Isiro and Viadana in the north-eastern province of Orientale.\n\nSome 16 people in neighbouring Uganda died of the disease last month, though the WHO said the two epidemics were not connected.\n\nThe latest WHO figures show there are now 65 probable or suspected cases of Ebola in Congo, with 108 people under surveillance.\n\nKabambi said one suspected case in Kinshasa had come back negative. Congo’s ramshackle capital is home to at least 9 million people and its health sector is crumbling.\n\nCongo’s infrastructure has been devastated by decades of corruption, conflict and misrule.

It’s hard to support a family. And there are a lot of young people who are really talented who want to go into teaching,” Obama said in a town hall meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday.\n\n“In places like Korea and Finland, where the education system is really doing well, teachers are paid at the level that doctors and engineers are paid, and it is respected as a profession,” he said.\n\nObama has lauded Korea’s education zeal and system many times since taking office in 2009.\n\nBut Wednesday’s statement about teachers’ pay is far from reality.

  "latent_24898": "Republican legislative leaders have voted to hire private attorneys to appeal a court ruling that found Wisconsin’s legislative districts are unconstitutional.\n\nThe GOP plan would hire the law firms Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Bell Giftos St. John LLC, \"and any other firms, entities or counsel deemed necessary for services related to the matter of Whitford v. Gill and legislative redistricting and all ancillary matters.\" The plan would not specify how much the law firms would cost taxpayers.\n\nThe proposal passed state Senate and Assembly committees on party-line votes with all Republicans in support and Democrats opposed.\n\n\"There is absolutely no reason why taxpayers should hand over another blank check to high-priced Republican attorneys,\" said Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling in a statement. \"Republicans have already wasted too much time and taxpayer money trying to justify their unconstitutional election rigging efforts.\"\n\nAccording to the proposal, the private firms would answer to Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. Vos defended the move in a statement issued after the vote.\n\n\"On behalf of the Legislature, we are exercising the right to retain counsel to defend a law that was constitutional when adopted and meets every traditional principle of redistricting,\" Vos said. \"We must ensure that every essential argument is heard before the court to make clear that Wisconsin has legislative maps that are constitutional.\"\n\nUnlike typical committee votes that are conducted in-person, this vote was conducted by private ballots. Notice of the vote, which was first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was not posted online, which is standard practice for committees. A copy of the proposal was not made public until after 2 p.m. The vote was scheduled to be completed by 4:30 p.m.\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, who voted against the plan, noted judges in an earlier challenge to Wisconsin’s legislative map had scolded GOP leaders for making decisions out of the public’s eye.\n\n\"It's ironic that today is Groundhog Day,\" Barca said. \"It's like we're reliving the exact same circumstances that they had six years ago.\"\n\nThe state Legislature itself is not named as a party in this lawsuit, and the state is already being defended by Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican. Schimel’s office has said he’ll likely appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe case in question led to a first-of-its-kind decision in redistricting cases that could potentially set a national precedent.\n\nUnlike other lawsuits that challenge redistricting plans based on criteria like how maps treat minority voters, this was a partisan gerrymandering claim brought by Democratic voters who argued the map diminished their voice in state government. In a 2-1 decision, a federal court agreed, and last week, the court ordered the state Legislature to draw new maps by Nov. 1 so they’d be ready in time for the November 2018 election cycle.\n\nEditor's Note: This story will be updated as WPR learns more.

  "latent_25216": "Only candidates seeking nomination by a political party to the office of President are eligible to receive primary matching funds. A presidential candidate must establish eligibility by showing broad-based public support. He or she must raise more than $5,000 in each of at least 20 states (i.e., over $100,000). Although an individual may contribute up to $2,700 to a primary candidate, only a maximum of $250 of each individual’s contribution is counted in determining whether a candidate has met the $5,000 threshold in each state. This means that a candidate must receive contributions from a minimum of 20 contributors in each of at least 20 states in order to establish eligibility for primary matching funds.\n\nPresidential candidates also must agree to:\n\nLimit campaign spending for all primary elections combined to $10 million plus a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This national spending limit was $48.07 million in 2016 .\n\nLimit campaign spending in each state to $200,000 plus COLA, or to a specified amount based on the number of voting age individuals in the state (plus COLA), whichever is greater. In 2016, state limits ranged from $961,400 in Wyoming to $23,092,100 in California .\n\nLimit spending from personal funds to $50,000.\n\nThe campaign finance law exempts the payment of some expenses from the spending limits. Certain fundraising expenses (up to 20 percent of the expenditure limit) and legal and accounting expenses incurred solely to ensure the campaign's compliance with the law do not count against the expenditure limits.\n\nEven if they no longer campaign actively in primary elections, candidates may continue to request public funds to pay off campaign debts until the first Monday of March of the year following an election.

  "latent_25244": "The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program is behind schedule, hundreds of millions over budget, and incapable of conducting most of the basic missions it was intended to carry out. Senators on Thursday said they wanted to know why.\n\n\"Like so many major programs that preceded it, LCS's failure followed predictably from an inability to define and stabilize requirements, unrealistic initial cost estimates, and unreliable assessments of technical and integration risk, made worse by repeatedly buying ships and mission packages before proving they are effective and can be operated together,\" said Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., told Pentagon witnesses during a hearing.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was more blunt. \"The process is completely broken. If you want this to stop, somebody needs to get fired.\"\n\nThe current fleet of eight ships \"have a near-zero chance of completing a 30-day mission, the Navy's requirement, without a critical failure of one or more seaframe subsystems essential for wartime operations,\" Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test And Evaluation.\n\n\"The miracle of the LCS didn't happen,\" said Paul Francis of the Government Accountability Office. \"We are 26 ships into the contract and we still don't know if it can do its job.\"\n\nOriginally scheduled to begin service in 2008 at a cost of $220 million per ship, its cost has doubled to $478 million each. And although ships have been commissioned and deployed, they are yet to be equipped with the systems that would allow them to perform their primary missions, and won't be until 2020.\n\nWhen the LCS was conceived in 2004, it was envisioned as a state-of-the-art combat vessel with a revolutionary flatted hull design that would allow a speedier, more lethal ship designed to operate in the littoral (close to shore) regions. It would contain plug-and-play mission modules to take out surface threats, hunt mines or go after enemy submarines.\n\nBut senators say the ships have a dismal record of reliability because of frequent mechanical breakdowns, and can't even defend itself.\n\nWhile admitting substantial shortcomings in the performance of the ships, the Navy insisted it is on track to fix the problems.\n\n\"We are doggedly pursuing solutions that will improve operational availability of the ships and you have my assurance that these are never far from my mind,\" said Vice Adm. Thomas Rowden, head of Naval Surface Force Pacific.\n\nFrancis said that while Congress also failed to exercise proper oversight on the program while it was spinning out of control, it still has a chance to inject some discipline into the next phase of the program by not approving a \"block buy\" of future ships.\n\n\"You are going to be rushed again, you are going to be asked to put in upfront approval of something where the design isn't done, we don't have independent cost estimates, and the risks are not well understood,\" Francis said. \"You'll be told 'it's a block buy, we're getting great prices, and the industrial base really needs this.'\"\n\nFrancis recommended Congress not approve a block buy and instead demand that the Navy have a design competition in which it can downselect from two alternatives, and he further recommended hard questions be asked about whether continuing the program is worth the estimated $14 billion cost. Lockheed Martin and Austal USA are each building separate classes of the ship.\n\nMcCain admitted Congress was part of the problem. \"We could have intervened more forcefully and demanded more from the Department of Defense and the Navy. We did not. But as long as I am chairman, this committee will.\"\n\nThe GAO also found that once the LCS program matured, too much emphasis was placed on supporting America's shipbuilding industry.\n\n\"Haven't we done enough for the industrial base? Isn't it time for the industrial base to come through for us? Can we get one ship delivered on time? Can we get one ship delivered with cost growth? Can we get one ship delivered without serious reliability and quality problems?\"\n\nGraham said the service secretaries and chiefs are responsible for knowing what's happening with the big programs under their control. \"Hopefully in the future, someone will be held accountable and get fired, if this happens again, and if nobody ever get's fired, nothing's gonna change,\" Graham said.",
  "latent_25586": "Welcome to the 21st-century lab, where hormones, brain pacemakers and magnetic coils can treat and cure depression, even treatment-resistant depression.\n\nWe've come a long way. Some psychiatrists used to think you could cure depression by removing a patient's colon or teeth. In the late 1800s, there was a doctor who observed his anxious patient become calm on a bumpy train; thereafter treatment consisted of shaking the poor man for greater and greater lengths of time.\n\nIn an attempt to cure the ancient malady of melancholia, we have resorted to scads of strategies, some of them plainly stupid or cruel, others, like Prozac (Fluoxetine), that work. But an estimated 30 percent of depressed patients are what's called treatment-resistant; they don't respond to pills or talk or even electroshock therapy. The good news is that there are new treatments for depression making their way into the 21st-century world; depression treatments that offer hope for the newly diagnosed or for someone who has been suffering without, so far, a cure in sight.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Gold Standard of Treating Depression\n\nWe want to urge you to read our special depression treatment section: \"The Gold Standard for Treating Depression.\" It's an in-depth, authoritative examination of the best treatments for depression (covering all aspects of treatment for depression, from getting a correct diagnosis to antidepressant medications, therapy and lifestyle changes.) written by award-winning author, Julie Fast, exclusively for HealthyPlace.com. This section includes depression videos; interviews with Julie Fast.\n\nMiracle Medications for Depression\n\nIt used to be that psychiatrists would try a patient on one antidepressant medication, wait eight weeks and, if it didn't work, switch to another one. While this is still a viable (if frustratingly slow) tactic, psychiatrists are relying more and more on secondary, and even tertiary, drugs to boost the primary player. One of those booster drugs is Cytomel, a thyroid stimulator. Even women with normal thyroid levels can, under a psychiatrist's supervision, take Cytomel in addition to an antidepressant. About 50 percent of the time, it helps the primary drug work more effectively. Other popular booster medications are lithium (Eskalith) and .\n\nHormone Therapy As A Treatment for Depression\n\nScientists have spent years and years investigating chemicals like serotonin and their effects on mood, while neglecting to study brain chemicals still more common, and abundant, like estrogen and progesterone. Andrew Herzog, M.D., a neuroendocrinologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, treats many women who don't respond to Prozac (Fluoxetine) and its chemical cousins with sex steroids. \"The future of psychiatry lies largely in the realm of using hormones to regulate brain states,\" Herzog says.\n\nHe believes many women become depressed either because they have a measurable imbalance of estrogen and progesterone or because their brains are too sensitively tuned to normal fluctuations. \"Hormones are psychoactive,\" Herzog says, \"and there's no doubt that they can have huge effects on our feelings.\" Progesterone, claims Herzog, is seven times stronger than your average barbiturate, and it exerts a strong calming, even sleepy, effect. Estrogen, the opposite, provides pep just as well, if not better, than that Prozac (Fluoxetine) pill you're taking. For women with agitated depressions that make them nervous and jumpy, Herzog might prescribe progesterone to calm with a bit of estrogen to brighten, in the form of a cream the woman rubs into her skin. For lethargic depressions, Herzog emphasizes the estrogen instead, and he's had remarkable success treating women who were deemed \"untreatable.\" \"These hormones gave me my life back,\" says one of his patients, who became depressed in her 40s and was incapacitated by her 50s.\n\nHormone treatment for depression requires that you see a knowledgeable neuroendocrinologist and that you undergo a hormone profile, having your levels of progesterone and estrogen measured at the beginning and end of the month. The procedure is new but so far highly promising.\n\n\"Get Happy\" Pacemakers\n\nThe vagal nerve connects your brain stem with your upper body, specifically your lungs, heart and stomach. The nerve is a critical conduit for relaying information to and from your central nervous system, carrying electrochemical signals up its tubing and depositing them directly into your cortex.\n\nSome years ago, researchers began implanting a small pacemaker into the vagal nerves of epileptics to see if tiny pulses might help stop the seizures. The pacemakers did indeed reduce or eliminate seizures in some epileptics, but they did something else, as well, something surprising and critical. Epileptics with vagal-nerve pacemakers got happy. Their moods improved. That's when researchers decided to try using them in people with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nNo one quite knows how or why they work. Some doctors hypothesize that vagal-nerve stimulation (VNS) instigates changes in norepinephrine and serotonin, two neurotransmitters closely associated with mood. John Rush, M.D., at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and colleagues did a study of 30 people with treatment-resistant depression. They implanted the pacemakers into those people and, over a two-week period, gradually increased the amount of stimulation current to levels the patients could tolerate comfortably.\n\nForty percent of these patients showed a substantial decrease in depression as measured by a verbal test asking them about their thoughts and feelings; 17 percent had a complete remission.\n\nAfter one year of VNS, more than 90 percent of the patients who benefited from the initial treatment continued to show a decrease in depression.\n\nMagnetic Healing of Depression\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may someday replace electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) altogether. In TMS, an electrical current passes through a handheld wire coil that a doctor then moves over your scalp. The electrical current makes a powerful magnetic pulse, which passes straight through your scalp and stimulates nerve cells in the brain.\n\nTMS is in part remarkable because of its specificity. Researchers now believe they can target brain structures that they know are involved in the creation and maintenance of depression and anxiety.\n\nMany studies indicate that magnetic brain stimulation once daily for two or more weeks may relieve depression (a typical patient's symptoms are reduced by almost 30 percent). Although TMS is still considered an experimental form of treatment, various hospitals and clinics offer it. Within five to ten years, TMS may become a common form of treatment for people with depression.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. Twenty years ago we had only the crudest psychiatric drugs; in the space of two short decades, we've developed an arsenal, and more important than that, we've shown we're capable of ever more complex and innovative treatment strategies. The next few decades will bring as-yet-unheard-of kinds of cures, for us, for our children and so on down the line.\n\nnext: Overcoming Depression and Finding Happiness\n\n~ depression library articles\n\n~ all articles on depression",

It wasn’t that long ago that I was completely disillusioned at the fact that while all the other moms were rejoicing that their kids were (finally, finally!) back in school, it was life as usual for us year round.\n\nIt was the oddest thing, I realized, as I wrote back to her: there has been no other time in my entire life that I have been more fulfilled – as a person, as a woman, a wife, a mother, and – yes – as a writer.\n\nHomeschooling gives you what other careers can only dream of – the ability to have fun while you work, the potential to see your hard work pay off right in front of your eyes, to see a specific project to the end, to pour the best of your intellect, creativity and every aspect of your personality into your own children.\n\nHomeschooling is also the only career in the world that gives you the freedom to use the raw material of your experience however you would like and not a few writers have made it the springboard for their books, their small businesses and their side jobs.\n\nThere is a myth – partially created by the teaching community and partially by older homeschooling moms (who followed school curricula because they taught their children at home at a time when they couldn’t buy curricula unless they were a traditional school), I think – that teaching is hard.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nWhat’s hard about opening a book and reading it to your child? What’s hard about following written instructions? Children are curious, they ask lots of questions, they learn some stuff along the way. That’s not hard. What’s hard is discipline.\n\nWhat’s hard is trying to keep everyone in lock-step with their public schooled peers.\n\nConformity is hard, not homeschooling.\n\nThe real concern I had when I began, the concern my friend who wrote to me now has, the real concern of all homeschooling moms when they begin – whether they realize it or not – is conformity. It’s all those little what-ifs that constantly claw at us. What if I fail my child? What if he’s old enough to go to college and can’t add 2 + 2? What if she has no friends? What if he turns out, you know, weird?\n\nBut if you’re a writer, aren’t you already a non-conformist to some degree? You see things others don’t. Take heart, fellow mom. You’re on the right track.\n\nLike this post? Share it with your friends!",
  "latent_25938": "US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos came into the Education Department with a bold vision: that parents should be able to send their kids to school wherever they wanted, by way of government-funded vouchers.\n\nNine months later, she’s made little progress on that goal. But her Education Department has made other, quieter changes that affect millions of students.\n\nMany of those changes involve rolling back Obama-era regulations. It’s now harder for recent graduates of for-profit colleges to get their loans forgiven. Transgender students know the federal government isn’t backing them up as they fight to use the facilities that match their gender identity rather than the sex assigned to them at birth. And on college campuses, survivors of sexual assault wonder how seriously the Education Department is taking their claims.\n\nSo while Congress rejected DeVos’s proposed cuts of $9 billion to the Education Department, and with it, her strategy to implement school choice programs nationwide, it doesn’t mean she’s powerless. By rescinding Obama-era policies, DeVos has made an immediate mark.\n\nA lack of protection for transgender students\n\nM.S. is a 13-year-old girl from Virginia who loves makeup, hanging out with her friends, and keeping up her Snapchat streaks. She considers Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Clinton her role models, calling them “boss ladies,” and dreams of someday moving to California, going to UCLA, and becoming a makeup artist like her favorite YouTube and Instagram stars.\n\nM.S., who is transgender and is identified by her initials to protect her privacy, has been living as a girl since she was in fourth grade. It’s never been an issue among her classmates or friends, she said: “They don’t see me as trans; they see me as their best friend.”\n\nSome of the parents at her school feel differently. That started a local battle that echoed a bigger national debate, a debate in which the Obama administration sided with transgender kids like M.S. and the Trump administration with the parents of her classmates.\n\nSince the fourth grade, M.S. has been advocating for the right to use the girls’ bathroom. For about three weeks after she transitioned, she was allowed to, until a group of parents found out.\n\nWhat happened next was a school board meeting that her mother, Amy, still remembers vividly: Parents wearing “Save Our School” badges went up to the podium, calling her then-10-year-old daughter an abomination and a predator. One suggested that the school was opening the door for “bullying, rape ... and possibly death.”\n\n“It was awful; it’s probably the most alone I ever felt, being in that room that night,” Amy said. Then the board hastily voted to keep her daughter from using the girls’ restroom.\n\nAs transgender kids gained more visibility nationwide, the Obama administration released federal guidance on this issue in May 2016. Obama’s Education Department declared that Title IX, which forbids sex discrimination in education, protects trans students, and told schools that trans students should be called by their preferred pronouns and names and be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponded to their gender identity.\n\nBut the guidance was short-lived — 11 states sued the administration, claiming the directive wasn’t lawful and would be too disruptive for school districts. A federal judge agreed in August 2016, halting it nationwide.\n\nThen, about a month into Betsy DeVos’s tenure, the Education Department and Justice Department sent out a joint letter to school districts rolling back the guidelines, which they characterized as federal overreach. (DeVos herself reportedly opposed the move, but the department she leads still signed on to the letter.)\n\nNeither the guidance nor its reversal really changed anything day to day in M.S.’s school. Her district is still waiting for a court decision in the case of another transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, who sued nearby Gloucester High School in 2015. His case is still ongoing. But for M.S., knowing President Obama was on her side made all the difference.\n\n“When Obama was president, I knew I had someone that was rooting for me and supporting me,” M.S. said. “All Trump is going to do is nothing, or say no.”\n\nAcross the country, protections for trans students are growing at the local level; Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy for the National Center for Transgender Equality, estimates that just under half of US schools now have policies in place spelling out transgender students’ rights. But only 13 states and the District of Columbia have anti-discrimination laws on the books protecting transgender students.\n\nRescinding the Obama guidance isn’t going to take anything away from the schools and districts that have already implemented their own policies. But it makes things more difficult for students like M.S.\n\n“What the Trump administration did I think was to send a message that discrimination against trans students might be okay,” said Tobin.\n\nThose students’ best hope lies with the courts. A federal appeals court recently decided a transgender boy from Wisconsin should be permitted to use the boys’ restroom. Grimm, the transgender student from Gloucester, is still fighting his case in the lower courts, after the US Supreme Court said it would not hear the case this year.\n\nThat decision will matter a lot for M.S., who says she wants to advocate for the trans community when she grows up. For Amy, it’s heartbreaking, especially given how much M.S. has flourished since she transitioned. Amy had braced herself for the possibility that her daughter would be bullied by classmates after she transitioned, but the opposite happened. Initially, the kids had questions, but the teasing M.S. had endured stopped. And Amy noticed something else right away — M.S. was happy.\n\n“As a mom, I can see it now,” she said. Looking back at old pictures, “she looks so unhappy. Now the smile takes over her entire face. It was like a puzzle piece shifted for her.”\n\nAt the Office for Civil Rights, goals have changed\n\nThe Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights is often associated with sexual harassment and transgender cases, but the scope of its work is much broader. It’s charged with enforcing the 1964 Civil Rights Act in public schools, which is supposed to make sure harassment doesn’t interfere with any student’s right to learn.\n\n“It’s a beautiful mission; it’s a broad mandate,” said Catherine Lhamon, the chair of the US Commission on Civil Rights. Lhamon formerly served as the assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education under Obama.\n\nOfficials at the Office for Civil Rights did not respond to a request for an interview.\n\nOne of OCR’s main duties is to investigate harassment complaints from students, faculty, or families. But the Obama administration had a two-pronged approach. It tried to look for patterns with harassment and target systemic problems, and issued guidance on how schools should treat students who were gay, transgender, disabled, or had experienced sexual assault and investigate allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nUnder DeVos, OCR is closing out a backlog of more than 1,000 investigations at a record-setting pace. They have said they are focused less on systemic problems, to give individual cases a faster resolution. Students sometimes wait years to get their cases investigated, and staff cuts proposed by Trump could drag this out even further. Understaffing has always been an issue at the office; Lhamon said OCR investigators had about 26 cases per person under Obama, which could go up to 45 cases per person under Trump.\n\n“I am still sick about the length of time that it took for us to solve cases,” Lhamon said. “The office was wildly understaffed the entire time I was there. Everybody was working as fast as they could.”\n\nCritics, including conservatives and some legal experts, saw the approach from the Obama administration as heavy-handed. In rescinding it, DeVos said she was correcting federal overreach. But Lhamon said the guidance was supposed to provide schools with answers, after her department fielded many questions from schools about their responsibilities.\n\n“Our view was that we needed to be responsive to the people that were asking questions,” Lhamon said. “The guidance is the job of the office because it tells people what the law is and how to satisfy it.”\n\nLhamon said she fears that by simultaneously rescinding guidance and closing out investigations, the Trump administration is sending a message to students that they won’t be taken seriously.\n\n“The clearest message in this administration is that student civil rights will not be protected by the federal government,” she said.\n\nSchools uncertain about professional development funding\n\nAt the Decatur City School District in Alabama, teachers and administrators are anxiously awaiting news about the fate of a federal program called Title II.\n\nThe district gets the vast majority of its teacher professional development funds from this program, about $347,000 in federal money each year, compared to $42,828 from the state. That money is used to keep teacher training current on everything from class planning to technology to helping English language learners.\n\nSchool districts across the country get $2.1 billion in Title II grants that help pay for professional development and reduce class size. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the grants entirely, and the House Budget Committee also supports the cut.\n\nThe program isn’t dead yet, as the Senate appropriations subcommittee for education rejected the cuts. Title II’s fate won’t be decided until December, when Congress is set to vote on the budget. In the meantime, the uncertainty alone is making school districts nervous.\n\n“Across our state, everyone’s just saying there’s no way to replace that,” said Melanie Maples, chief finance officer for the Decatur school district. “We would have to eliminate a lot of the teacher training we would provide. I think for most school districts, that has been their main source of professional development for their teachers.”\n\nAdded up, the proposed cut to Title II could impact the professional development of 2.4 million teachers. Cuts to the class size funding would result in more than 8,500 teachers across the nation losing their jobs, according to analysis from the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union.\n\nTitle II has not been without criticism over the years; many people, including Obama Education Secretary Arne Duncan, have said the program needs more data to show that professional development benefits teachers.\n\n“If you can’t answer that question in a clear and cogent way, you’ve got a problem,” said Mike Soules, president of Corwin, an education publishing company that provides professional development materials to many of the nation’s schools. “It’s an absolutely critical moment — it’s the moment of what do you believe in, where do you think dollars should be spent and why.”\n\nNational Education Association director of teacher quality Andrea Prejean said professional development programs help mentor young teachers struggling to adjust. The nation is experiencing a teacher shortage, especially in science and math, in part due to low pay and the high demands of the job.\n\nIf the proposed cuts go into effect, “we’re not going to be able to shift almost $2.1 billion from other pots in professional learning,” Prejean said. “Every state is going to lose significant amounts of money.”\n\nSchool lunch nutrition standards are relaxed\n\nPlanning a weekly school lunch menu is like putting together a puzzle. School lunch directors and cafeteria workers have federal nutrition guidelines they must follow to make sure kids eat balanced meals, but they also want to make the food tasty enough for kid to eat it.\n\nWhen it’s burrito day at the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in Ohio, the district’s executive director food and child nutrition services Chris Burkhardt has to plan things out carefully. The premade salsa has a lot of sodium, so his staff cut it with diced tomatoes and pair it with low-sodium taco meat, to make sure the burritos aren’t too salty. Then he has to make sure he’s not putting too much fat or sugar into a meal to compensate for the lack of salt.\n\n“You could get one side correct, but you could get other side wrong,” he said. “A lot of times we hit the mark, and sometimes we don’t.”\n\nBurkhardt and school lunch directors around the country have a lot of flexibility from the federal government to plan meals. That’s because in early May, new US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that he would put a pause on school lunch standards passed by Congress in 2012 that lowered the amount of sodium and refined grains in school lunches.\n\nUnder regulations the Obama administration wrote to implement the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, public schools were required to make their school lunches more nutritious by getting rid of trans fats, setting limits on the amount of sodium, and making sure foods like pizza, bread, and pasta contained 50 percent or more whole grains. Schools were also asked to provide kids more fruit and vegetables.\n\nBurkhardt said the whole-grain pasta was fine if it was served right after it was cooked, but “if you hold it for any length of time, it becomes a gelatinous mess. Whole grains tended to be more mealy; they had a different mouthfeel.”\n\nWhen kids don’t like school lunches, districts lose money. For instance, in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second-largest, students threw out at least $18 million worth of food per year, the district’s food service director told the LA Times in 2014.\n\nThe Obama administration started granting school district waivers to have the flexibility to use enriched pasta again. When Perdue became secretary, he also halted the standards to lower sodium before they went into full effect.\n\nMany public health experts opposed the move. Doctors and nutritionists pointed to the fact that rates of childhood obesity have tripled since the 1970s, with about one in five schoolchildren considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And public health advocates were optimistic that the new school lunch standards could help put a dent in the alarming trend; one study by researchers at Harvard, Columbia, and George Washington University estimated that the healthier school lunch standards could help prevent another 1.8 million children from becoming obese.\n\nA friendlier climate for for-profit colleges\n\nEnrollment at for-profit colleges exploded in the decade before Obama took office. So did the debt those students held — loans they often struggled to pay back. About one in every 10 federal student loans issued went to a student at a for-profit college. But among the loans that ended up in default, or with about nine months of missed payments, 44 percent had been taken out by for-profit college students.\n\nSo in 2009, Obama’s Education Department began an ambitious effort to try to close for-profit college programs, as well as vocational programs at all kinds of colleges, if their students didn’t earn enough after graduation to pay back their loans.\n\nThey ended up with a regulation known as the gainful employment rule. Vocational and for-profit college programs were judged on whether their students earned enough money to be able to repay their debts. Programs that couldn’t hit the federal government’s benchmarks would eventually be cut off from student loans.\n\nAfter several court challenges, the final version of the regulation went into effect in July 2015. (In the meantime, the for-profit sector began to struggle, and several major colleges closed their doors.) DeVos plans to overhaul them, and is already dismantling key provisions — part of an overall shift in attitude at the department to be friendlier toward for-profit colleges.\n\nIn July, the department announced a one-year delay on the requirement that institutions disclose their graduates’ debt and earnings. On August 8, the department reported to Senate Democrats that it had “no timetable” for sending institutions data necessary to calculate those figures. More than 2,000 programs in trouble under the rule are also able to repeal their results.\n\nStudents in debt left in limbo\n\nThe new regulations the Obama administration wrote for for-profit colleges, though, didn’t do much for the students who had already attended them and were paying back their loans. Even if the college itself was in trouble, students were still saddled with their debt.\n\nBut after the collapse of two major for-profit college chains — Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institutes — this started to change.\n\nFormer students turned to a little-known provision of federal law known as “defense to repayment.” It allows borrowers to apply for loan forgiveness if they were the victims of fraud or misrepresentation by their college or university. After former for-profit college students began using that provision to argue they shouldn’t have to repay their loans, the Obama administration wrote new rules, set to go into effect on July 1, 2017, that laid out exactly when students would be able to have their debts forgiven.\n\nThe regulations also required schools that might be at risk of closing to put up financial collateral and banned arbitration agreements, which have kept many students from suing schools they believe defrauded them.\n\nBut DeVos has begun efforts to roll back loan forgiveness policies by freezing the regulation, leaving thousands of students in limbo. In addition, the US Department of Education has not approved any borrower defense applications since the beginning of the Trump administration, leaving thousands of students uncertain about the status of their loans.\n\n“They’re just sitting and the department isn’t processing them,” said Eileen Connor, the director of litigation for Harvard Law School’s Project on Predatory Student Lending.\n\nConnor said that while the Trump administration has been noticeably warmer toward the for-profit college industry, predatory for-profit schools have been around for years, and many administrations have been slow to address the issue.\n\n“I think it’s really far past time for the department to take seriously that students have rights, they’re in their loan contracts, and they can’t turn a blind eye to the fact the law has been broken,” Connor said. “It’s leaving the status quo in place, and the status quo is hurting students of for profit colleges.”\n\nA step back on sexual assault guidelines\n\nLast week, DeVos suddenly announced the Education Department would rescind the Obama-era guidelines that spelled out how universities should respond to allegations of campus sexual assault. The interim guidelines DeVos put in their place gives colleges the option to put a greater burden of proof on the accusers in such cases. It also gives colleges an indefinite amount of time to conduct their investigations and allows some cases to be resolved through mediation.\n\nOne of the impacts was confusion among students about what their rights were.\n\nElizabeth Boyle is a sophomore at Notre Dame University and a student representative for Know Your IX, an organization that advocates for survivors of sexual assault and harassment. After DeVos’s initial speech in early September, Boyle said many Notre Dame students were asking if this meant they were no longer protected under federal law.\n\n“More confusion, more hysteria; it caused students to not know where to turn,” she said. “Knowing a lot of friends who had been assaulted themselves, it caused me great concern.”\n\nIn 2011, the Obama administration implemented strict guidelines for how schools should investigate and handle sexual assault allegations, when it sent out a “Dear Colleague letter” that urged universities to deal with allegations of sexual harassment and assault through the proper channels.\n\nIt wasn’t just a request; the Obama administration said sexual assault fell under the federal Title IX, which was passed in 1972 as part of a broader education law that prohibited discrimination in education based on sex. Though it mostly applied to women’s college athletics in the beginning, the Obama administration made Title IX the main line for tackling campus sexual assault; if schools didn’t comply with the guidelines, they risked losing their federal funding.\n\nOne of the most important and controversial parts of the letter established a new standard of evidence colleges were to use when finding students responsible for sexual assault. In a criminal court, someone accused of a crime has to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Many colleges, in sexual assault cases, had used a slightly lower standard of “clear and convincing evidence.” The Obama administration told colleges to instead use the “preponderance of the evidence” — a greater chance that someone is guilty than not — in their student justice systems, which is the standard of proof in a civil trial.\n\nThis lower standard of evidence and other changes prompted many in the legal and higher education communities to sound the alarm, saying the Obama administration was not giving accused parties due process and forcing schools to overreach with rules that were too broad. For instance, in 2014, a group of 28 Harvard Law School professors took the unprecedented step of writing a letter pushing back on the Obama guidance, saying it had caused Harvard’s administration to overcorrect to the extreme.\n\n“I think they created an environment where schools felt in order to keep their federal funding, they had to change their policies to ones stacked against anybody accused,” said Elizabeth Bartholet, one of law professors who signed the letter and faculty director of Harvard Law School’s Child Advocacy Program.\n\nBut Obama’s initiative also won the support of many sexual assault victims and advocates, who believed they finally had a presidential administration taking them seriously and said the guidelines actually made it easier for schools to know the concrete rules they had to follow. That was reflected in the number of investigations into how schools were handling assault cases. Since 2011, a total of 439 investigations were opened into whether colleges were mishandling cases; 79 cases have been resolved, while another 360 remain open.",

'We know nothing about this agency and have never had any contacts with it,' said Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov\n\nThis glass and concrete building at 55 Savushkina Street on the edge of St Petersburg is the hub of Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine, claim whistleblowers who have worked inside its high security doors\n\nBut now Lyudmila Savchuk, a civic activist, who worked undercover there for two months, is threatening to open up its Pandora's box of secrets.\n\nIn an extraordinary employment tribunal which has gripped Russia, Ms Savchuk has gone to court to try and get The Agency for Internet Studies, its official name, closed down.\n\nThreatening to reveal what really goes on there, Ms Savchuk told how she created three different fictional characters to post comments online praising Putin.\n\nAt the same time, she said was ordered to criticise Ukraine, the US and the European Union.\n\nShe described how armies of online foot soldiers pose as ordinary Russians to write hundreds of biased comments on social media.\n\nIf Joseph Goebbels was alive today, he'd be proud of this operation. It is sinister, powerful and skewing democracy\n\nThey comment on topics such as sanctions, the Ukraine conflict, the seizure of Crimea, the shooting down of flight MH17 and assassinations of Putin enemies - like Boris Nemtsov -\n\nThe case has led one Russian PR executive to call it sinister, powerful and skewing democracy' - adding: 'If Joseph Goebbels was alive today, he'd be proud of this operation.'\n\nThe Kremlin officially denies all knowledge of the 'troll factory', even disputing its existence.\n\n'We know nothing about this agency and have never had any contacts with it,' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n'We couldn't have contacted with it, since we don't know what it is and what it does. And even if it exists indeed.'\n\nMs Savchuk, 34, did 12-hour stints posting diatribes she describes as 'very dangerous' due to their extremism.\n\nMany of the trolls are students, but they take on other identities for their postings. One posed as a fortune teller, she said.\n\n'From the beginning I was an agent, not a troll,' she told Der Spiegel.\n\n'I only played the role of an employee. It was interesting. But every day I was in shock, realising what large-scale work is done and how many trolls exist, even if we take only this factory.'\n\nThere is an atmosphere of 'utmost secrecy' inside the plant and she 'never saw the bosses' in overall charge, she said.\n\nShe added she had seen staff posting comments onto Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Livejournal.com as well as the Russian networks like VK.com and Odnoklassniki.\n\nMother of two Lyudmila Savchuk went undercover and worked at Vthe Kremlin's troll factory for two months. She is now exposing its work which she sees as fanning hatred in Russia\n\nWhistleblower, Marat Burkhart, 40, who worked there said internet trolls were set quotas of having to write 135 pro-Kremlin comments per 12-hour shift\n\nAnd she warned that there are more offices in Russia.\n\n'A few colleagues reported about work trips to a Moscow office. There is also information about a further, highly secretive building in St. Petersburg.'\n\nIn the building offices are separated into different departments.\n\nThere is the 'Administration of Bloggers and Commentators,' 'Rapid Reaction Department,' and an office for 'Journalists', among others.\n\nJob adverts for the agency - where there is no talking, staff are fined for being just a minute late and personal relationships are frowned upon - first emerged in 2013.\n\nPotential recruits were told their responsibilities of 'the placement of comments on target Internet sites, writing on-topic posts, blogs, social networks'.\n\nMs Savchuk, a mother of two, revealed that one group of trolls 'masquerades as journalists'. She said it has fake news portals that pretend to be Ukrainian news sites, with names like 'Kharkiv News' or the 'Federal News Agency.'\n\nBosses are said to have ordered trolls to refer to Ukrainians opposed to Putin as Nazis.\n\nIn another shocking claim, a second whistleblower Marat Burkhart said he was asked to refer to Barack Obama as a 'monkey'.\n\n\"The worst was when we had to humiliate Obama, comparing him with a monkey,\" he said. \"I wrote it, I had to.'\n\nMs Savchuk, who earned up to 50,000 roubles (£585) a month, said she was ordered 'to write about how terrible things are in the European Union'.\n\nAnother time she was supposed to praise Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\n'You sit there and write things like: 'Yesterday I went for a walk and the idea came to me about how bad the situation is in Europe'.'\n\nShe said she felt 'sickened' when Nemtsov was gunned down close to the Kremlin and she was ordered to smear him on the web, claiming that he was probably killed by friends who turned on him.\n\nEntrepreneur Yevgeniy Prigoshin - said to be a personal friend of Putin's - is rumoured to be behind the scheme. He has declined to comment.\n\nPrigoshin runs a major catering business which has won major state contracts, including from the army.\n\nThe agency is seeking to avoid public scrutiny by offering to compensate Ms Savchuk, who is seeking the symbolic sum of 10,000 roubles (£116).\n\nLawyer Yekaterina Nazarova, defending, this week told Petrogradsky district court judge the agency is willing to settle with Ms Savchuk.\n\nYet the case has exposed what goes on there, her supporters claim.\n\nMs Savchuk made clandestine videos and copied documents before being sacked when she leaked her revelations to a local newspaper.\n\nShe revealed how staff were told to turn on proxy servers to obscure their IP addresses and avoid detection.\n\nThen they began posting 'patriotic' comments, monitored by their chiefs, using key words chosen each day by their bosses to fit the news agenda.\n\n'I want to get it closed down,' she said.\n\n'These people are using propaganda to destroy objectivity and make people doubt the motives of any civil protest.\n\n'Worst of all, they're doing it by pretending to be us, the citizens of Russia.'\n\nSince her name was disclosed, she has faced a backlash from online trolls.\n\nRecruits to the four-storey plant are sought by headhunters.\n\nMs Savchuk said some staff realise they are part of 'a pro-Kremlin troll factory' - but turn a blind eye for the money.\n\nThe second whistleblower, Mr Burkhart, 40, recalled of his time: 'First they make you write something neutral - Vegetarianism: the Pros and Cons.\n\n'After that, the assignments start to get more to the point - for example, what do I think about humanitarian convoys in Donetsk?'\n\nHe claimed he had to mask his true beliefs to get a job.\n\n'I'm pro-Western. That's natural for me and for them, of course, it's not.\n\n'I didn't write anything about my views. Otherwise, they wouldn't have hired me; they would have thrown me out immediately.'\n\nMr Burkhart said bosses constantly ran ideological checks on all comments - and that trolls were paid according to their output.\n\n'It's a real factory. There are production quotas,' he said. 'The quota is 135 comments per 12-hour shift.'\n\nStaff at Putin's propaganda hub pose as housewives and soldiers to post pro-Kremlin comments on news websites, and social media like Facebook and Twitter\n\nWhistleblower Lyudmila Savchuk said: 'You sit there and write things like: 'Yesterday I went for a walk and the idea came to me about how bad the situation is in Europe'.'\n\nMarat Burkhart, 40, (pictured) said he felt uncomfortable criticising Putin's enemies online. He claimed he had to mask his true beliefs to get a job.'I'm pro-Western. That's natural for me and for them, of course, it's not.'\n\nA typical task was to post comments claiming NATO troops were embedded with Ukrainian forces onto 35 forums.\n\nHe claimed had an unsuccessful interview with the troll factory's English department - because during the interview he told them he was apolitical.",

(Photo: Courtesy photo.)\n\nThe call came in from PGA Tour official Shane Suber early lthis week, and the first thing Web.com Tour golf pro and Pensacola native Nick Rousey heard Suber say gave him pause.\n\n\"We need you to keep this to yourself,\" Suber told Rousey, an Escambia High product who went on to play for Central Alabama Community College and the University of Alabama.\n\n\"You think 'Uh-oh,' the first time you hear something like that,\" Rousey said.\n\nMore: Justin Gatlin beats Usain Bolt to win the 100-meter world title\n\nWhat came next would drastically alter Rousey's plans for the week.\n\nSuber was relaying a request that had come in to find a practice partner for a player about to make his debut at the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic at TPC Stonebrae that week in Hayward, California — where Rousey was also scheduled to play.\n\nThe player, it turned out, was two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and two-time NBA champion Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nCurry, it turned out, was the thing Rousey needed to keep to himself.\n\n\"I just said 'Sure, I can do that,'\" Rousey said, laughing. \"I mean, of course you want to go to do that.\"\n\nMore: Divot Derby is Pensacola's 60-year link to some of golf's greatest names\n\nRousey, who is also the Director of Instruction at Lost Key Golf Club, flew from Kansas City to California, and after fulfilling an obligation with some junior golfers, caught up with Curry on Tuesday about midway through the first hole, where he joined a group that included Curry, Ellie Mae president Jonathan Corr and Golden State Warriors Director of Player Programs Jonnie West, the son of legendary NBA player Jerry West.\n\n\"(Rousey) gave me a lot of information ... I need to write it all down, because my head was spinning a bit,\" Curry said. \"Just to hear his expectations, what he thought about the swing throughs and write down little tidbits of info I wouldn't have known otherwise.\n\n\"Just figuring out how to execute what he was telling me. He's such a nice guy and he doesn't have to be worried about my game because he's playing this week, too.\" \\\n\nOne of the tidbits Rousey, who shot a 73 both days at the Ellie Mae Classic, told Curry was about one piece of golf etiquette that only pros could probably pass on to other pros.\n\n\"Just little stuff, like there's a moving scorekeeper that follows the holes, and you usually sign a ball for them at the end of the hole,\" Rousey said. \"They're volunteers, so you want to do something extra for them.\"\n\nRousey's round on Tuesday with Curry wasn't the only thing the NBA superstar — or the Warriors — would ask of him before the tournament started. Rousey ended up playing in a celebrity tournament with two other Golden State stars, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, on Tuesday and had a follow-up practice round with Curry on Wednesday.\n\n\"I guess you have this idea of what big-time stars or celebrities are like, as in they're mostly unapproachable,\" Rousey said. \"What I saw was a group of guys who were kind, classy, approachable and incredibly down-to-earth. I mentioned something to (West) about it and he said that was who they wanted in their organization, guys like that.\n\n\"The only thing I can compare it to would be the Blue Angels, as far as how they act and how they carry themselves. Klay, Iguodala, Curry ... all just like that.\"\n\nCurry ended up shooting back-to-back rounds of 74 at the Ellie Mae Classic. Rousey also received a tour of the Warriors' practice facility on Wednesday, along with some gear sent over by Curry.\n\nAnd Rousey wasn't immune from a little good-natured ribbing from Curry, who has 17.2 million followers on his Instagram account.\n\n\"He was making fun of how few followers I had on my Instagram account,\" Rousey said. \"I think I had like 45 followers, he tagged me in a picture and the next time I checked it had gone up to over 200 and he said something like 'Well at least now you're in triple digits.'\"",

  "latent_26282": "Is the BBC guilty of sexist double standards in the way its presenters speak about men, asks Glen Poole?\n\nCan you imagine if Mary Berry turned to an Asian contestant on the Great British Bake Off who was licking freshly whipped meringue mixture off the end of her finger and quipped: \"I know, Pakistanis have a lot of perverted desires but yours is the sickest\"?\n\nThe BBC switchboard would light up with disgruntled calls from unamused cake fans quicker than you could say \"my spotted dick has got a soggy bottom\".\n\nHow about Bruce Forsyth turning to Bruno Tonioli, the gay Italian judge on Strictly Come Dancing, and responded to a comment about \"loving a nice tight rumba\" with the words: \"Darling, I know homosexuals have a lot of perverted desires but yours is possibly the sickest\"?\n\nThe liberal media would be calling be for his toupéed scalp long before he'd grabbed Tess Daly to close the show with the words \"keep dancing\".\n\nHas political correctness gone mad?\n\nSo what about if The Fixer, Alexi Polizzi, said to one of the struggling business owners she was trying to rescue, after he had showed her his shiny new plant machinery: \"I know, darling, I mean, men have a lot of perverted desires but yours is possibly the sickest\".\n\nWhat would happen then? Well this is exactly what Polizzi said to the male owner of a Devon microbrewery this week and nothing happened. The BBC broadcast this comment on 1st September 2014, during the opening episode of the latest series of The Fixer and I have yet to spot a single raised eyebrow amongst the nation's self-appointed guardians of moral correctness.\n\nLet me pin my colours to the mast here. I'm not an anti-liberal traditionalist who thinks that political correctness has gone mad and needs to be chucked in a straightjacket and locked in a padded cell for its own safety. I happen to have great respect for the good intentions (you know, those things the road to hell is paved with) behind attempts to promote worthy concepts like equality, diversity and tolerance.\n\nWhat I can't tolerate is hypocrisy.\n\nI'm not a fan of UKIP, for example, but if Godfrey Bloom had said to a female acquaintance \"women have a lot of perverted desires but yours is possibly the sickest\" it would have been front page news. Yet when a woman says it about men, nobody bats their hypocritical little eyelashes.\n\nI'm not a regular Top Gear view, but if Jeremy Clarkson had travelled to Mexico to meet a collector of Triumph Dolomites and told him: \"Mexicans have a lot of perverted desires but yours is possibly the sickest\", there'd have been complaints from the Mexican embassy, opinion pieces in the liberal press and left-wing comics would be performing acerbic satire about the issue. Yet there are no ambassadors, columnists or comedians talking about the woman who labelled men as perverts.\n\nI'm no apologist for sexist sports commentators like Andy Gray and Richard Keys, but if they interviewed a gay couple from Fulham who supported Fleetwood Town and concluded: \"lesbians have a lot of perverted desires but yours is possibly the sickest\", they'd be in for the high jump, the sack an the firing squad all in the same day. Yet when a woman says it about a man, she's not even subject to a gentle verbal warning.\n\nDoes equality mean treating people equally?\n\nIf you believe in people being treated equally then one of two things is happening here, either we're being oversensitive about what we can say about women, black people, gay people and so on, or we're being under-sensitive about what we can say about men.\n\nTaking the view that it's the latter, let's consider why it wouldn't be appropriate for a BBC presenter to say that women or blacks or gays \"have a lot of perverted desires\". The reason, quite simply, is that while \"some women\", \"some blacks\" and \"some gays\" may well \"have a lot of perverted desires\", it clearly isn't the fact that \"all women\", \"all blacks\" or \"all gays\" are perverts and to say so is not only inaccurate, it's also offensive.\n\nSo why is it okay for the BBC to suggest that all men are perverts? It can only be for one of two reasons. Either the BBC believes it is factually accurate to say \"men have a lot of perverted desires\" or they simply don't think it's offensive because men and boys, unlike women, gay people, black people and every other \"special interest\" group you can imagine, are not worthy of protection or concern.\n\nUnder the Equality Act, the category \"sex\" (and that includes men as well as women) is a \"protected characteristic\" and the BBC has a duty to protect men from being treated unfairly because of their sex and to foster good relations between people of different characteristics, eg men and women, different ethnic groups and people of all sexualities.\n\nIt may never be possible or desirable to treat all people equally, but we should expect the BBC to treat all people equitably. By tolerating the inequitable treatment of a group as large as men and boys (which includes males of all ages, ethnicities, sexualities, religions and disabilities), the BBC is fundamentally failing in its duty to foster good relations between men and women (both those who have perverted desires and those who do not).\n\nHave your say:\n\nReaders who have access to BBC iplayer, can view the comment here (it's at the nine minute mark) and decide if you want to notify BBC complaints.

  "latent_26290": "Recent studies in geographical psychology have demonstrated regional variations in personality—people with similar personality traits are more likely to be found in some regions than others. What is the psychological significance of such spatial clustering? Our study was motivated by the person–environment hypothesis, which postulates that the match between people’s personality and neighborhood characteristics is important for people’s life satisfaction. The results showed that personality traits were differently related to life satisfaction in different postal districts of London metropolitan area, and these varying associations were related to specific neighborhood characteristics, such as population density and ethnic heterogeneity. These findings demonstrate how individuals with different personality dispositions derive life satisfaction from different aspects of their social and physical environments.\n\nAbstract\n\nResidential location is thought to influence people’s well-being, but different individuals may value residential areas differently. We examined how life satisfaction and personality traits are geographically distributed within the UK London metropolitan area, and how the strength of associations between personality traits and life satisfaction vary by residential location (i.e., personality–neighborhood interactions). Residential area was recorded at the level of postal districts (216 districts, n = 56,019 participants). Results indicated that the strength of associations between personality traits and life satisfaction depended on neighborhood characteristics. Higher openness to experience was more positively associated with life satisfaction in postal districts characterized by higher average openness to experience, population density, and ethnic diversity. Higher agreeableness and conscientiousness were more strongly associated with life satisfaction in postal districts with lower overall levels of life satisfaction. The associations of extraversion and emotional stability were not modified by neighborhood characteristics. These findings suggest that people’s life satisfaction depends, in part, on the interaction between individual personality and particular features of the places they live.",

For other uses, see Joco (disambiguation)\n\nNot to be confused with Jonathan Moulton\n\nJonathan Coulton (born December 1, 1970), often called \"JoCo\" by fans, is an American singer-songwriter, known for his songs about geek culture and his use of the Internet to draw fans. Among his most popular songs are \"Code Monkey\", \"Re: Your Brains\", \"Still Alive\" and \"Want You Gone\" (the last three being featured in games developed by Valve: Left 4 Dead 2, Portal, and Portal 2 respectively). He has been the house musician for NPR weekly puzzle quiz show Ask Me Another since 2012.\n\nHis album Artificial Heart was the first to chart, eventually reaching #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers and #125 in the Billboard 200.\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nCoulton's music tends to fit a folk rock style, with elements of pop and indie rock.\n\nEarly career and geek culture [ edit ]\n\nCoulton graduated in 1993 from Yale, where he was a member of the Yale Whiffenpoofs.[1] In the 1990s, Coulton was in a short-lived band, the ironically named SuperGroup, with television producer Eric Salat and best-selling author Darin Strauss.[2] A former computer programmer employed at Cluen, a New York City software company,[3] and self-described geek, Coulton tended to write quirky, witty lyrics about science fiction and technology: a man who thinks in simian terms, a mad scientist who falls in love with one of his captives, and the dangers of bacteria. Rare topical songs include 2005's \"W's Duty\", which sampled President George W. Bush, and 2006's \"Tom Cruise Crazy\". Most of Coulton's recordings feature his singing over guitar, bass, and drums; some also feature the various other instruments Coulton plays, including accordion, harmonica, mandolin, banjo, ukulele, zendrum and glockenspiel.[4]\n\nSeveral early podcasters discovered and made regular use of Coulton's music, notably Adam Curry of the Daily Source Code and The Wizards of Technology.[5] In April 2006, he lent his voice to one such podcast, The Spoilers, in which he and hosts Rick Yaeger and Bill Douthett provided a 2-hour fan commentary for Raiders of the Lost Ark.[6][7]\n\nHe was the Contributing Troubadour at Popular Science magazine, whose September 2005 issue was accompanied by a five-song set by Coulton called Our Bodies, Ourselves, Our Cybernetic Arms.[8] He was also the Musical Director for The Little Gray Book Lectures.[9]\n\nThing a Week [ edit ]\n\nFrom September 16, 2005, to September 30, 2006, Coulton ran \"Thing a Week\", during which he recorded 52 musical pieces in an effort to push his creative envelope via a \"forced-march approach to writing and recording\"; to prove to himself that he could produce creative output to a deadline; and to see whether a professional artist could use the Internet and distribution via Creative Commons to support himself. In a September 2006 interview, he said of the experiment, \"In some parts of the country, I'd be making a decent living\".[10] In a February 25, 2008, interview with This Week in Tech, he said that he made more money in 2007 than he did in his last year of working as a programmer, 40% of it from digital downloads and 40% from merchandise and performances.[11]\n\n\"Still Alive\" and album hiatus [ edit ]\n\nCoulton wrote and performed a song titled \"Still Alive\" for the ending credits of Valve's 2007 video game Portal, with vocals by Ellen McLain. On April 1, 2008, Harmonix made this track available as free downloadable content for the game Rock Band.[12] A version with Coulton's vocals was also included on the Orange Box Original Soundtrack,[13] in addition to the one heard at the end of the game. \"Re: Your Brains\" made an appearance as an easter egg in Left 4 Dead 2.[14] The song has been called \"the most influential game music\".[15] In 2011, Coulton followed up the success of \"Still Alive\" with a new song at the end of Portal 2, \"Want You Gone\". He also wrote the song \"You Wouldn't Know\" for Lego Dimensions.\n\nCoulton is also known for original pieces such as \"Code Monkey\", which was featured on Slashdot[16] on April 23, 2006, and linked from the webcomic Penny Arcade.[17] It was also the theme song for an animated show on G4 called Code Monkeys.\n\nHis work has been featured on NPR's All Things Considered. Good Morning Silicon Valley featured a link to a video set to his song \"Re: Your Brains\".\n\nCoulton accompanied John Hodgman on his \"700 Hobo Names\" promotional track for Hodgman's book The Areas of My Expertise as the guitarist (he was credited as \"Jonathan William Coulton, the Colchester Kid\"). Coulton also can be heard throughout the audiobook version of the same book, playing the theme song to the book, playing incidental music, and bantering with Hodgman, who reads the audio version of his work. Hodgman has also mentioned Coulton on The Daily Show: a Jonathan Coulton of Colchester, Connecticut, was Hodgman's pick to win an essay contest on overpowering Iraqi resistance to American invasion.[18] Coulton wrote and performed \"the winning entry\", a song about dropping snakes from airplanes. Coulton appeared on the tour for Hodgman's second book, More Information Than You Require.\n\nCoulton composed the title music for the show Mystery Diagnosis, and also has contributed other songs under \"The Little Gray Book Lectures\", a series of audio releases from John Hodgman.\n\nIn 2006, Coulton began touring with comedy duo Paul and Storm. Coulton initially opened the concerts, but as his popularity grew, he began headlining.\n\nA DVD & CD of a concert performed February 22, 2008, at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, entitled Best. Concert. Ever. was released in 2009. At the concert, Coulton played \"Still Alive\" along with guest \"musicians\" and geek/celebrities Leo Laporte, Merlin Mann and Veronica Belmont.[19]\n\nCoulton opened for They Might Be Giants for a few shows of their March 2010 tour.[20] He toured with them again in February 2012.\n\nThe Aftermath and Artificial Heart [ edit ]\n\nCoulton had been working on his follow-up to the Thing a Week albums, tentatively titled The Aftermath. He said the title was an umbrella term for non-album tracks released after Thing a Week. On May 25, 2010, Coulton said on his official site that he would work on a new album, to be produced by John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants,[21] and for the first time ever with a full band, including Marty Beller of They Might Be Giants,[22] in a professional recording studio. The resulting album, Artificial Heart, was released on September 2, 2011.\n\nSolid State, The SpongeBob Musical and other projects [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2012, Coulton became the house musician for the NPR game show Ask Me Another. Coulton performs some of his own songs on the show, as well as covers of other songs related to the trivia and puzzle challenges.[23]\n\nOn April 15, 2013, Coulton announced that he was working with comic book writer Greg Pak on a graphic novel based on the characters in his songs, called Code Monkey Save World.[24] The project was funded on Kickstarter, and reached its goal within 12 hours.[25]\n\nOn August 31, 2013, it was announced that Coulton would be contributing lyrics to The SpongeBob Musical, which premiered in Chicago on June 2016.[26] Coulton composed the opening number \"Bikini Bottom Day\", which is reprised multiple times throughout the show as Spongebob's main theme. Coulton also contributed to additional lyrics for other musical numbers featured in the show. Along with other musical contributors to the show, Coulton won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Score, and was nominated for Best Original Score for the 72nd Tony Awards.\n\nIn June 2016, Coulton started doing a one-minute \"Previously On\" song at the beginning of the CBS TV series BrainDead, a summer series with a planned run of 13 episodes.[27]\n\nIn April 2017, Coulton released a new album Solid State which is for sale through his website and iTunes as well as being available for streaming on SoundCloud[28]\n\nCoulton co-wrote the songs \"Good for Me\", \"Patient Zero\" and \"Rollercoaster\" with Aimee Mann for her 2017 album \"Mental Illness\", for which he also contributed acoustic guitar and backing vocals. He joined Mann as opening support act on the European and North American tour of \"Mental Illness\", contributing additional guitar and vocals to her main set.\n\nOn April 15, 2018, The Good Fight episode \"Day 450\" featured a song by Coulton, set to a short Schoolhouse Rock-style animation. The song echoed the episode's plotline around efforts to impeach Donald Trump and was later shared by the show's Youtube channel.[29]\n\nLicensing [ edit ]\n\nCoulton releases his songs under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license, allowing others to use them in their own noncommercial works. As a result, a number of music videos have been created using his songs, including such machinima as the ILL Clan's video for \"Code Monkey\" and a kinetic typography video for the song \"Shop Vac\".[30]\n\nIn May 2011, Coulton was interviewed on NPR's popular economics-related program Planet Money. He disclosed that he makes about $500,000 a year from his music despite lacking a record label contract. He expressed gratitude towards his fans for his surprise success, the degree of which he called \"absurd\". In a broader discussion of whether or not the internet is good for musicians, Coulton answered in the affirmative, while journalist Frannie Kelley described his success as a \"fluke,\" comparing it to the unexpected popularity of the Snuggie.[31] Coulton posted a tongue-in-cheek response on his blog about the comparison, saying \"to which I say: snarkity snark snark!\"[32]\n\nGlee dispute [ edit ]\n\nOne of Coulton's best-known works is his 2005 light-acoustic cover of the Sir Mix-a-Lot hit song \"Baby Got Back\". Coulton wrote a new melody for the song which was copied without permission (including his original line \"Johnny C's in trouble\") in 2013 by the American TV series Glee.[33][34][35] Like Coulton's other work, he released his cover version of the song under a Creative Commons 3.0 license, which requires users to attribute the work to him, and forbids all commercial use of it.[36] The show's lawyers contended that they were within their legal rights, and that Coulton should be happy for the exposure,[citation needed] though Coulton received no acknowledgement or credit.[37][34] Coulton's own lawyers told him that as he only used a compulsory license to make the cover, it would be difficult to sue for damages using the argument that he retained copyright over his own version.[34]\n\nInstead, Coulton released the single \"Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)\", a \"cover of Glee's cover of my cover of Sir Mix-a-Lot's song, which is to say it's EXACTLY THE SAME as my original version\". Coulton said he would donate the proceeds from all sales until the end of February 2013 to two Glee-related charities: The VH1 Save the Music Foundation, and The It Gets Better Project.[38]\n\nIn January 2014, the CBS drama The Good Wife based its fifth season episode \"Goliath and David\" on the incident.[39]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nCompilations [ edit ]\n\nOther releases [ edit ]\n\nMost of Coulton's songs are published on his website as MP3 and FLAC downloads. Some of them are free, and none of them are subject to digital rights management. All of his original songs fall under the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial 3.0 License. \"Still Alive\", \"Want You Gone\" and \"Wikipedia Chanukah\"[40] are the only exceptions to this, as Coulton assigned all rights for the former two songs to Valve and \"Wikipedia Chanukah\" is under a BY-SA license to comply with Wikipedia's similar license. Along with \"Still Alive,\" Coulton's song \"Re: Your Brains\" appears in jukeboxes in Left 4 Dead 2. \"Want You Gone\" also features in the end credits of Portal 2. All three of these games were designed by Valve.[41]\n\nOther versions and covers [ edit ]",
  "latent_26386": "Ezra Klein has a generally reasonable analysis of the Obama administration’s failure to respond with sufficient force to the economic crisis. Broadly speaking, he’s saying that the eurovenn applied: an economically adequate response lay beyond the bounds of the politically feasible.\n\nIn general, I’m trying not to do too much looking back; the question is what to do now. Still, I guess this needs addressing.\n\nThere’s certainly a lot to Ezra’s thesis. Yet I think he lets Obama and company off the hook too much. A few specific points:\n\n1. I think too much is being made of the fact that subsequent revisions have shown that the economy was in even worse shape in early 2009 than we knew at the time. There was already plenty of evidence that it was in terrible shape and needed a much bigger boost than the administration proposed. And as regular readers know, this isn’t 20-20 hindsight: I was frantic about this at the time.\n\n2. The forecast that assumed rapid recovery even without stimulus has been a deep source of embarrassment, and remains inexplicable to me. We had lots of reason to believe that this was going to be a prolonged slump — not just Reinhart Rogoff, but also the evidence of the last two US business cycles. Again, I was warning about this at the time.\n\n3. This in turn means that the focus on fast-acting policies was misplaced. Shovel-ready wasn’t as important as it was made out to be. And the stimulus would have been a lot closer to adequate if more of it had consisted of infrastructure spending rather than tax cuts.\n\n4. Politically, the administration was wildly naive in believing that it could easily come back for more if the initial stimulus proved inadequate. Again, this isn’t hindsight; I was frantic about this too, right from the beginning. If they thought this likely — as they should have — they should have laid the legislative groundwork for a second round, through reconciliation if necessary, right at the start.\n\n5. Even without that groundwork, my sense is that there was a window for additional action in the fall of 2009, and that the administration sheered off from even trying.\n\n6. Relatedly, the insistence of the administration that the stimulus was just right, long after it was obvious that it had been too small, did a lot of political damage. Remember the “summer of recovery”?\n\n7. The political response to the new jobs bill has been pretty good — which in turn strongly suggests that the “pivot” from jobs to deficit reduction in early 2010 was a big mistake. Maybe — probably — nothing could have passed; but the White House might have been able to make a better case by accusing Republicans of blocking job creation rather than adopting their rhetoric.\n\nNow, Ezra may be right that none of this would have made much difference. But the White House was weak and confused in the face of a political and economic debacle, when it should have gone all out.\n\nAnd you know what? It should still go all out. The chances of success are lower than they would have been if it had taken a strong position two years ago, but it ain’t over until it’s over.",
  "latent_26461": "July 7, 2014\n\nThe Bulgarian government is trying to weather a political crisis that was sparked by speculation over the stability of the banking system and questions regarding the legality of its handling of the South Stream project. On 29 June, Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev announced that he would dissolve the parliament on 6 August, which will pave the way for early elections to be held on 5 October. Plevneliev said that an interim government will be appointed to govern the country until elections are held.\n\nThe news followed a run on Corpbank (CCB) and First Investment Bank (FIB)—two of Bulgaria’s biggest banks. On 20 June, the Central Bank took over CCB after its customers withdrawing over 20% of their deposits in just a week caused a liquidity crunch. On 29 June, FIB’s depositors withdrew an equivalent of EUR 400 million from their accounts in a matter of hours. FIB was able to resume normal activity shortly thereafter, but CCB will remain closed until 21 July. Both of the banks’ owners have strong political connections, which has led some to conclude that a battle between oligarchs caused the run on the banks.\n\nAccording to the authorities, the banking system has fallen victim to media speculation, which drove customers to withdraw their money under allegations that the system was on the verge of collapse. Lack of confidence in the government, along with fears that there would be a repeat of what occurred during the 1997–1998 financial crisis in which 14 banks went bankrupt, drove Bulgarians to pull their money out of the banks. Authorities have urged people to stay calm while reassuring them that the banking system is sound and well capitalized. As a precautionary measure to ensure sufficient liquidity in the banks, the European Commission approved a EUR 1.7 billion credit line on 30 June.\n\nThe situation in the banking system has added to the government’s already weak and unstable position. On 13 June, the cabinet of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski survived a no-confidence vote—the fifth since he took office last year—following his party’s poor performance in May’s European Parliament elections.\n\nAdding to the political turmoil, the EU raised questions recently about the legality of the construction of Bulgaria’s part of the South Stream project pipeline as Bulgaria granted construction rights to a Russian company that is sanctioned by the United States. The EU’s questioning of the project prompted Oresharski to announce that Bulgaria would freeze construction, which sparked an internal government conflict, thus contributing to the events that led Plevneliev to dissolve the Parliament.\n\nDemand for foreign currency has escalated due to the banking distress and could call into question the stability of the currency board. Lars Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank, says:\n\n“In our view, the currency board is not currently threatened and there is a strong commitment on the part of the authorities to defend the board and by construction the central bank has the currency reserves to defend the peg. That said, an escalation in demand for foreign currency would lead to an automatic tightening of monetary conditions, which in itself could increase stress in the banking sector and cause a further contraction in economic growth.”\n\nThree-quarters of Bulgarian banks are foreign-owned and the run was only on domestically-owned banks.

How kids are more fluid than you think\n\nThey also wanted to help doctors understand, so they wouldn’t assume women had only had partners of the same gender in their lives.\n\n“We know of a number of women who have been in perfectly happy marriages with men, they raised a family, and at some point—in their 40s or so—they find themselves unexpectedly falling in love with a woman, without ever having thought that was possible,” said Kingsberg.\n\nRelated: Comment – It turns out male sexuality is just as fluid as female sexuality\n\nKingsberg argues there’s evolutionary evidence for this – that when women go through menopause they no longer have a biological imperative to mate with a male, and so their body becomes attuned to same-sex attraction.\n\nDr Lisa Diamond, one of the study’s researchers, also believes her theory has scientific support.\n\nOver time, sexual fluidity can be influenced by “a complicated dynamic between hormonal changes, physical experiences, and sexual desires,” she told the Daily Mail.\n\nIn 2008, Diamond released a study in which she had followed 79 lesbian, bisexual and ‘unlabelled’ women for a decade and found that two-thirds of them changed the label they identified with during that time period.\n\nThey particularly wanted to emphasise awareness of sexual fluidity for doctors, so that they could support “later-in-life-lesbians.”\n\n“Women should always be encouraged to have an open dialogue with their healthcare providers about a wide array of health concerns and also feel comfortable in discussing any lifestyle changes,” Dr JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director, said.\n\n“This presentation should remind us that we need to ask questions and not assume a patient’s sexual orientation when discussing their concerns.”\n\n“Don’t be so presumptive that the woman you’ve been caring for for 20 years is automatically always going to have the same partner or the same gender of partner,” Kinsberg told healthcare professionals.\n\nThey also want women to be aware that fluidity is common, and “not feel like they’re alone or that they’re an outlier.”\n\n“If they discover, heading toward midlife, that they have shifted their love interest and are falling in love with a woman, they should know that it’s not unusual,” Kinsberg said.\n\nHowever, some call into question the way this research interacts with research on bisexuality. Diamond herself suggests that bisexuality may be “a heightened capacity for sexual fluidity,” and many agree that the two identities have overlap.\n\nRelated: Everything you’ve always wanted to ask a bisexual person but were always too scared\n\nHowever, although they don’t deny that sexual fluidity exists, some bisexual activists point out that much of the debate in favour of it has tendencies towards biphobia, for example, this study’s claims that sexual fluidity has gained media attention because celebrities are “making it fashionable to change sides.”\n\nSome worry that, although studies into sexual fluidity could open up the LGBT umbrella, it could also deny agency to gay people and demonise bisexuals, ultimately undermining the community that identity and labels bring.",
  "latent_26632": "The Rays have designated left-hander Dana Eveland for assignment in order to clear a spot on the 40-man and 25-man rosters for right-hander Dylan Floro, per a club announcement (links to Twitter via Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times). Additionally, the team announced that Ryan Webb has cleared waivers and been released following his DFA late last month.\n\n[Related: Updated Rays Depth Chart]\n\nEveland, 32, has surrendered 19 runs in 20 innings with the Rays this season. He’s punched out 18 hitters in that time, but he’s surrendered a troublesome 27 hits and 15 walks, leading to his bloated earned run average. The Rays will have 10 days to trade, outright or release the left-hander. If outrighted, he’ll have the ability to reject the assignment in favor of free agency, although he’s already been designated for assignment and accepted an outright assignment once this season. Eveland has a 5.42 ERA in parts of 11 seasons at the big league level, though he’s totaled just 443 1/3 innings in that time.\n\nIn his place, the Rays will turn to the 25-year-old Floro, who has put up strong numbers in Triple-A this year. While Floro doesn’t come with the gaudy strikeout totals that are often associated with up-and-coming relief prospects, he’s demonstrated stellar control throughout his minor league career since being selected in the 13th round of the 2012 draft. He’s saved seven games for the Rays’ Triple-A affiliate in Durham this season, posting a 2.81 ERA and averaging 7.1 K/9 against 1.5 BB/9 along the way. Floro didn’t rank among the Rays top prospects on the lists put out by Baseball America, MLB.com or Fangraphs this season but has emerged as an intriguing bullpen option for Tampa Bay.\n\nAs for Webb, he’ll hit the open market in search of a new opportunity. The 30-year-old signed a one-year, $1MM contract with Tampa Bay this winter but totaled just 17 1/3 innings of 5.19 ERA ball before being designated. Webb’s ground-ball rate dipped to a still-solid 48.4 percent, but he displayed strong control during his time with the Rays (two unintentional walks) and has a track record of limiting walks and racking up ground-balls. Webb doesn’t light up the radar gun, but he’s been a solid middle relief option for a number of years, as he’ll carry a 3.43 career ERA with per-nine-inning averages of 6.2 strikeouts and 2.8 walks to the open market along with his career 56.1 percent ground-ball rate.",
  "latent_26634": "CLOSE The U.S. Department of Justice has instructed officials to decline or reduce contracts with those who operate private prisons. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates (Photo: Pete Marovich, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON — The Justice Department will end its use of private prisons, declaring that the facilities are less safe and \"compare poorly'' with government-run institutions in the country's largest prison system.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates, in a Thursday memo to the federal Bureau of Prisons, directed officials to start the process of reducing and \"ultimately ending'' the government's reliance on private lock-ups that at its peak in 2013 housed nearly 30,000 of the 220,00 inmates in custody.\n\n\"They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources,'' Yates wrote. \"They do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the department's Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.''\n\nEarlier this month, a review by the inspector general found that incidents involving inmate discipline, the recovery of contraband, including cell phones and the frequency of facility lock-downs were more common in contract prisons than in government-run facilities.\n\n\"For example, the contract prisons confiscated eight times as many contraband cell phones on average as the BOP institutions,'' the inspector general reported. \"Contract prisons also had higher rates of assaults, both by inmates on other inmates and by inmates on staff.''\n\nThe federal government began to rely on contract prisons to keep pace with a population that soared by nearly 800 percent between 1980 and 2013. The rate of increase during that time, Yates noted Thursday, accelerated faster than the BOP could manage.\n\nBut with inmate population now declining for the first time in decades, following adjustments in federal sentencing policies largely directed at non-violent drug offenders, Yates said the government is moving to end its dependence on contract detention.\n\n\"I am directing that, as each contract reaches the end of its term, the bureau should either decline to renew that contract or substantially reduce its scope in a manner consistent with law and the overall decline of the bureau's inmate population,'' Yates wrote. The overall population now stand at less than 195,000.\n\nBy next spring, Justice has projected that less than 14,200 inmates would be held in contract prisons.\n\nAlthough Yates credited the work of bureau personnel for making the transition possible, the federal prison system continues to struggle with staffing shortages.\n\nEarlier this year, USA TODAY reported that bureau officials had been assigning prison medical personnel — nurses, physical therapists, pharmacists and others — to guard duty shifts to fill gaps in its security coverage.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who have sought to ban all forms of contract prisons, said Thursday's announcement was overdue.\n\n\"It is an international embarrassment that we put more people behind bars than any other country on earth,'' Sanders said. \"Due in large part to private prisons, incarceration has been a source of major profits to private corporations...We have got to end the private prison racket in America.''\n\nGrijalva has seized on the use of contract prisons for holding illegal immigrants, saying substandard medical care has plagued such dentention centers.\n\n\"This isn't simply unjust detainment,'' Grijalva said, \"this is the exploitation of human captivity.''\n\nDavid Fathi, director of the ACLU's National Prison Project, described the Justice action as \"groundbreaking.''\n\n\"The Justice Department has made clear that the end of the Bureau of Prisons’ two-decade experiment with private prisons is finally in sight,'' Fathi said, urging states to follow the federal government's lead.\n\nCorrections Corporation of America, a longtime contractor, pledged to assist the government with its \"evolving needs.''\n\nSpokesman Jonathan Burns said the company has increasingly expanded its role in operating residential re-entry facilities or half-way houses for newly released prisoners, a function that is not altered by the Justice announcement.\n\n\"It’s important to note that today’s announcement relates only to BOP correctional facilities, which make up 7 percent of our business,'' Burns said.\n\nThe Justice announcement, however, sent shares of publicly-traded prison operators sharply lower early Thursday. Corrections Corporation of America (CXW) fell 37% while GEO Group lost 39%.\n\nContributing: Laura Mandaro\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bEF3ZF",

They save lives.\n\nBut, firing up the engine of a medical transport helicopter will cost you about $25,000 before the bird ever leaves the ground. After that, it could be $300 per mile.\n\nJodi Lopresto of Lexington, Oklahoma almost died when a DUI driver slammed into her, head on last year.\n\nMediflight rushed Lopresto to the trauma center in Oklahoma City.\n\nThen, within 24 hours, while Lopresto was still in ICU, the parent company to Mediflight, Air Methods, started calling about the bill.\n\n\"They want to jump and take advantage of you as soon as they can because that's when you're at your weakest,\" Lopresto said.\n\nLopresto has great medical insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield. She paid her premiums, and she was up to date on her car insurance with an extra policy for uninsured motorist. She did everything right.\n\n\"I never thought it would be me,\" Lopresto said. \"You never think, that's going to be me.\"\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield paid a reasonable amount, $5980.08. Air Methods billed Lopresto for the balance, $32,979.67.\n\nLopresto tried to fight the bill with some help from attorney Noble McIntyre but billing practices for medical chopper services are un-regulated in Oklahoma.\n\nThey're considered out-of-network for most insurance policies.\n\n\"It's just not right,\" said McIntyre. \"They're going after a victim for $32,000 she doesn't have for an injury she didn't cause for a 25 mile helicopter trip. It's just unconscionable.\"\n\nSo far Jodi Lopresto has refused to pay on her $32,979.67 balance from Air Methods.\n\nLopresto said the company has threatened to send her to collections over the bill.\n\nShe has joined a class action lawsuit against the company.\n\nCLASS ACTION LAWSUIT\n\nAlbert Strubhar of Perkins, Oklahoma was speechless when he got the bill from Air Methods.\n\nHis wife, Miriam flew 15 miles from Edmond Regional Hospital to OU Medical Center after a serious complication from the delivery of their daughter Debora.\n\n\"Wow. I never imagined,\" said Strubhar about the $32,330.34 bill. \"I never imaged it would be that much.\"\n\nThe Strubhars are Christian missionaries who live primarily in Nicaragua. They cannot afford medical insurance.\n\nAir Methods offered the family a cash price of $8,000 to pay the bill outright, a 75 percent discount.\n\nTheir church raised the money to cover the bill.\n\n\"God's people, people all over the country I have never heard of are helping out,\" said Strubhar.\n\nAir Methods was unable to discuss the details of Jodi Lopresto or Miriam Strubhar's cases because of HIPAA guidelines.\n\nAir Methods' Director of Corporate Communications, Christina Brodsly provided this statement:\n\nEveryone deserves access to lifesaving care. And much like an emergency room, Air Methods cares for those in need regardless of the their ability to pay. That means we sometimes don’t receive payment for our services, and the payments we receive for Medicare or Medicaid patients don’t come close to covering the actual cost we incur for providing our service. Those who can demonstrate a diminished ability to pay, Air Methods has a charity care application to bring the costs down and reduce the patient’s bill based on individual financial circumstances. In addition, Air Methods has a membership program called OmniAdvantage. For $49 a year, OmniAdvantage provides members and their entire household with the security of knowing that they are covered for any balance due after insurance, if transported via an Air Methods air ambulance. We seek every efficiency and innovation to keep our costs down, but 80 percent of our costs for operating an air medical base are fixed, meaning we incur those costs just by staying ready at all times. The cost to maintain readiness 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year include a 24/7-ready aircraft, flight crew, clinical crew, certifications, maintenance, training, logistics, safety and quality. These costs are by and large fixed in nature and a portion of which must be allocated to each flight. The Company has invested more than $100 million over the past five years in advancing safety and technologies in our operations, and became the first air medical provider and helicopter company to enter the FAA’s voluntary Safety Management System (SMS) program. In addition, Air Methods is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) and vetted in critical care treatment and transport. At Air Methods, safety and quality is our highest priority. And we believe that every life is worth saving.\n\nIn Oklahoma, most medical helicopter companies are considered out-of-network providers.\n\nIn some cases, commercial health insurance policies will have a provision to pay for a portion of the transport, but it is a fraction of the total bill.\n\nIn those cases, the helicopter company bills the patient for the remaining $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to this Air Evac Lifeteam patient, who has asked NewsChannel 4 to protect his identity.\n\nThe bill from Air Evac Lifeteam was $37,106.69. The patient's commercial medical insurance offered to pay Air Evac $10,067.93 to take care of the bill. According to the insurance company, that is ten percent higher than Medicare reimbursement.\n\nAir Evac Lifeteam refused the deal, taking only $5000 from insurance in order to bill the patient for the remainder, $32,106.69.\n\nThe patient is on a plan to pay $50 a month for the next 53 years.\n\nAccording to Air Evac Lifeteam, they are unable to discuss details about this patient because of federal privacy guidelines.\n\nAir Evac Lifeteam Public Relations Manager, Shelly Schneider provided the following information:\n\nAir Evac Lifeteam has the lowest charge of any air medical service in the state of Oklahoma. The average Air Evac Lifeteam charge is $32,000. Nationwide, the average charge for an air medical transport is $34,000. In general, if the patient has commercial insurance that does not pay close to the billed charges, the patient will have a balance bill due. Medicaid patients have no balance bill and typically, Medicare patients are only required to pay the 20 percent co-pay and deductible. If the patient has medical insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Oklahoma, or is an AirMedCare Network member, he or she will not receive a balance bill. Air Evac Lifeteam is In Network with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Oklahoma. Those insured under that plan would only pay the co-pay and deductible. We also encourage individuals to proactively purchase an Air Evac Lifeteam membership – a participating provider in the AirMedCare Network. If Oklahoma residents have an AirMedCare membership and are flown for a life- or limb-threatening injury or illness by an AMCN participating provider, the member has no further out-of-pocket expenses for the flight. An AirMedCare Network membership is $65 per year, and covers the entire household. There are 130,521 AirMedCare Network members in the state of Oklahoma, and more than 1.75 million AMCN members across the country. There are 245 AMCN participating locations across 32 states. Air Evac Lifeteam is called by an EMS provider, first responder or hospital, we do not ask for insurance information before accepting a flight. We provide access to a higher level of care, and the cost to provide that access is 87 percent fixed. The costs include the lease and maintenance of the aircraft, and staffing a base 24 hours a day, seven days a week with professionally trained and credentialed flight nurses, flight paramedics, pilots and mechanics.\n\nCongress is currently working on a solution to the problem of unaffordable charges for air ambulance service.\n\nH.R. 822 would amend the Social Security Act to require more extensive date reporting by air ambulance companies in order to increase reimbursements for medical flight service under the Medicare program.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the State Insurance Department confirms they have received complaints about air ambulance company billing practices.\n\nThe complaints are nearly identical to those of the patients featured for this report.\n\nA spokesperson for the commissioner told NewsChannel 4 the department's hands are tied.\n\nIf the citizens of Oklahoma want change in this industry, they need to call their state legislator.",
  "latent_26764": "A couple of months ago I stumbled upon a discussion board that talked about and showed a small, lightweight reusable container made out of the necks and lids of two plastic soda bottles. I haven't been able to find that same post ever since, but remember enough about it to want to give it a shot for myself.\n\nHow to Make a Plastic Soda Bottle Lid Capsule\n\nI started with two identical plastic soda bottles to make sure that they would match in size. I cut the necks of the bottles off using a small hacksaw making sure that I kept the large flange that would be used to glue the two necks together later.\n\nI used a vice to hold the bottles still while I cut through them. If you don't have a vice you can still do the same thing by hand,but be very careful and take your time.\n\nOnce I had cut off the neck of each bottle I used a flat file to smooth down the rough saw marks and left over plastic. The idea is to remove all the rough edges until you have a flat surface level with the large flange as this will be where you will glue the two pieces together.\n\nOnce I had filed the rough edges down and made sure that the edges were level it looked like this (below). I used a little 600 grit sandpaper to smooth the edges a little more than what I was able to do with the file.\n\nHere are the two sections of bottle necks ready to be glued together. I made sure that they were both clean and free from any rough edges that would stop good contact.\n\nI applied a small amount of super/crazy glue to the flat edges and then, using a small clamp, squeezed them tightly together to set. This type of glue only takes a minute or two to set, so after five minutes and a fresh cup of coffee I released the clamp to inspect my handiwork.\n\nThe final result is a small water-tight container with two ends that can be open via the lids. The total weight of the container is 0.5oz and it took about 10 minutes to make including the time to let the glue set.\n\nIt was a quick little project and a lot of fun to make. My six-year-old son, Jack, helped me with some of the steps and watched throughout the entire process. He thought it was pretty cool to make a little piece of gear out of something else. I probably won't be making a lot of these or using them for everything, but it is a useful little container and is very strong. I could see this being used as a container and float for a small fishing kit.\n\nIf you have some time and a few spare plastic soda bottles laying around, give it a try. After making this one I made another one with an additional flat piece of plastic sandwiched between the two necks that created a dual compartment container. I think I'll use it for salt and pepper!\n\nWhat other uses can you think of for this neat little capsule? Or can you think of any ways to improve on it? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nFeatured in MAKE Magazine\n\nMy simple little plastic soda bottle lid capsule project was recently featured in MAKE Magazine and made into a 4-panel illustration by Tim Lillis. I was given permission to reproduce it here, check it out.\n\nRelated Posts You Might Like:\n\n[cf]amazonnative[/cf]",

Demetrick Pennie, a black 17-year-veteran of the Dallas police force, filed the suit in a Dallas federal court Friday. According to the Dallas Morning News, the suit seeks more than $500 million in damages. In addition to the Black Lives Matter movement and Obama, the lawsuit also lists Al Sharpton, Louis Farrahkan, George Soros, the New Black Panther Party and even Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as defendants. “Defendants incite people to violence and cause violence by telling those people that they are under attack. Defendants are encouraging disaffected blacks, Black Muslims, Muslims and others allied with them including certain whites to ignore, disrespect, and assault law enforcement officials, and commit violence and lethal force,” the 66-page suit reads, according to the Morning News.\n\nThis is a really interesting lawsuit because it would set a precedent for suing on behalf of police officers. On the other hand it seems like it might infringe on the free speech rights of those people, no matter how deplorable. On the other hand, there is actual proof that George Soros has given money that has been funneled to “Black Lives Matter” protests.\n\nI doubt the lawsuit will go very far, but it’ll be fascinating to see if it does.",
  "latent_26982": "The Senate and House defied Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday night by overriding his veto of a bill raising Kansas income taxes by $1.2 billion over two years to fill a gaping hole in state revenue and bank money to improve funding of public education.\n\nBoth chambers adopted the landmark tax legislation, but Brownback wasted no time in rejecting their work on the 109th day of the annual session. The Republican governor issued a veto message declaring Senate Bill 30 the largest tax increase in state history, clearly damaging to businesses’ job growth and destructive to the well-being of families.\n\nThe Senate, which contains 31 GOP members and nine Democrats, voted 27-13 for the two-thirds majority necessary to reverse the governor’s action. The threshold was attained when Sen. Rick Wilborn, R-McPherson, agreed to support the override after previously voting against the tax bill.\n\n\"The Legislature has the power to override the veto. I see no other path,\" said Senate Vice President Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia.\n\nThe House put together a coalition to complete an override of the governor’s veto, striking that bell by a modest four-vote margin — 88-31. The GOP dominates the House numerically 85-40 over Democrats. More than two dozen representatives who voted against the tax bill one day earlier fell in line behind the override.\n\n\"This wasn’t an easy vote,\" said Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"This does move the state of Kansas forward.\"\n\nThe bill rejected by Brownback will eliminate large pieces of a 2012 law that dramatically lowered state income tax collections and was championed by the governor as an adrenaline shot to the heart of a Kansas economy hammered by recession. The bill due to become law will delete a state income tax exemption awarded to lawyers, farmers, doctors and owners of 330,000 businesses. It will return Kansas to a three-tier personal income tax model and boost rates across the board.\n\n\"I don’t want to be disrespectful to the governor. He still believes in it. I don’t,\" said Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, an Overland Park Republican who voted for the 2012 law.\n\n\"It would have been much easier,\" said Rep. Stan Frownfelter, D-Kansas City, \"for me to vote for Senate Bill 30 if it had contained a full-fledged repeal of the governor’s tax cuts.\"\n\nSen. Tom Holland, D-Baldwin City, said the Legislature made a tragic decision four years ago to remove $750 million from the state’s income tax revenue and promise it would drive job growth. It made no sense to adopt a business-owner income tax exemption that granted 43 percent of the tax benefit to 0.67 percent of filers, Holland said.\n\n\"The so-called small businesses. I guess under that definition Georgia-Pacific is a small business,\" said Holland, who ran for governor against Brownback in 2010. \"I firmly believe this wasn’t about creating jobs. We should have got off this crazy train a long time ago.\"\n\nRep. Larry Hibbard, R-Toronto, said constituents of legislators would likely be conflicted about the tax law. Some will think it too large of an increase and some will consider it as too small, he said. It is time to erase the smirk from the faces of people who joke about Kansas’ financial condition, he said.\n\n\"This tax bill starts us on the road to recovery. It’s going to be a long process. Let’s put this Capitol in the rearview mirror,\" he said.\n\nIn the governor’s formal veto message, Brownback said he vetoed a bill increasing taxes in February and the larger tax bill Tuesday because they \"threatened to crush the Kansas economy\" by punishing Kansas families with large income tax hikes. Both bills irresponsibly implement a state income tax on business owners retroactively to Jan. 1, the governor said.\n\n\"Instead of imposing draconian tax increases on Kansas families, we must enact a pro-growth tax policy. Many alternative ideas have been discussed, and I believe there is a better solution,\" Brownback said.\n\nSen. Vicki Schmidt, a Topeka Republican who voted in favor of the override, said the governor set the stage for a substantial tax increase by suggesting to the Legislature in January a budget that resembled a house of cards. He talked about closing a $900 million deficit over two years by selling off future tobacco settlement payments to Kansas in exchange for a one-time infusion of cash and recommended the state delay government contributions to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System.\n\n\"The governor has refused to lead at every turn. The budget that he proposed required securitization of the tobacco funds, not making our KPERS contributions and many other bad ideas,\" Schmidt said.\n\nSen. Caryn Tyson, chairwoman of the Senate Assessment and Taxation Committee, said the tax increase stiff-armed by Brownback was an ill-advised response to the failure of lawmakers to bring state expenditures in line with evolving revenue reality.\n\n\"We continued to spend more than we took in,\" said Tyson, a Parker Republican. \"We are in a situation, but this bill is not the answer. This bill increases income tax on individuals making as low as $20,000 a year. That means something. We need to consider those people.\"\n\nRep. Willie Dove, R-Bonner Springs, said the profound increase in state taxes sent the wrong message to people who aspire to secure a good job, pay taxes, raise a family and start a business.\n\n\"The tax bill does not include any growth so far as putting individuals to work,\" Dove said.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business and other political allies of the governor lobbied against an override, while public education and child advocate organizations pressed lawmakers to thwart Brownback.\n\n\"We think the Legislature can learn a lesson from small business and start living within its means. Small businesses understand you can’t spend money you don’t have,\" said Dan Murray, state director of the independent business group.\n\nMurray said imposition of an annual tax increase of $600 million would \"reset the clock on Kansas’ economic recovery.\"\n\nContact Tim Carpenter at (785) 393-2621 or @TimVCarpenter on Twitter.",

  "latent_27474": "A police report leaked last week from China's Xinjiang province describes Internet censorship circumvention tools as “second class violent and terrorist software.”\n\nThe leak raises serious questions about the consequences of using VPNs, web proxies and other tools that help Internet users get around censorship and other obstacles (like slow speeds) in online networks. While some companies offering these services are banned or disrupted in China, others are fully licensed to operate. It has been estimated that 1-3% of China's internet users use circumvention tool to visit overseas websites.\n\nThe leak, which first appeared on mainland Chinese social media but was deleted quickly, has made waves in a number of overseas Chinese news outlets, prompting widespread concern about the legalities of using such tools. As one user on Reddit put it:\n\nI understand this isn't in all of China but if I travel to China with a VPN already installed on my laptop could I technically get arrested?\n\nThe report (below) was filed by a prefecture police inspection team on October 13 in Changji City, a Muslim autonomous area in Xinjiang, where the majority of population belongs to the politically marginalized Uyghur ethnic group. The report solicits help from the county-level police to follow up on the case.\n\nAccording to a report from Solidot.org [original post was deleted, content has been republished on Letscorp], the circumvention tool described in the report is a VPN (virtual private network), which allows users to access censored websites. The report calls it a “violent and terrorist software”.\n\nFiled under the category of “online violent and terrorist acts,” the report's subject line reads: “a netizen in Changji city is suspected of downloading violent and terrorist circumvention tool.”\n\nThe descriptive text of the report reads as follows:\n\nA netizen in Changji (online account number: XXXXX IP: XXXXX) is suspected of downloading a violent and terrorist circumvention software at 12:42:21 on October 13. The software can run on mobile for sending different types of documents. Once installed, the software can be operated on the mobile management tool set for searching documents, games, backing up photos and sending text messages. This software has been classified by Public Security Bureau as second class violent and terrorist software.\n\nInitial inspection: Phone number: XXXXX, Name: XXXX male, ID number XXXXX, Home address: XXXXX Active in Changji city.\n\nThe exact downloading time marked in the “crime report” suggests that the suspect’s communications have been under surveillance for irregular online activities. The report does not describe any actual crime taking place, but rather it anticipates a crime merely because the suspect attempted to access censored web content with a circumvention tool.\n\nJudging by the “function” described in the case report, the circumvention tool is merely giving its user access to overseas search engines and cloud storage. While the document explicitly states that the circumvention tool has been classified by the public security bureau as a type of “second class violent and terrorist software”, there is no public information describing how it was classified as such, or what other products share this classification. This leaves Internet users with no way to know if their software or other tools are legal or not.\n\nTargeting an ethnic minority region for VPN use\n\nThis is not the first time that Xinjiang police have targeted netizens who use circumvention tools.\n\nSince the terrorist attack that killed 29 in Kunming Station in early 2014, government leaders in Xinjiang have begun to cast blame on circumvention tools for the spread of violent and terrorist messages. In 2015, Xinjiang residents were told that the use of VPNs would lead to the suspension of mobile phone services. In some cases, the netizens have had to report to the police in order to restore suspended mobile connections.\n\nAs former Xinjiang Communist party chief Zhang Chunxian put it:\n\n90 percent of terrorism in Xinjiang comes from jumping the wall. Violence and terrorism keep happening due to the videos on the internet.\n\nZhang's mention of “jumping the wall” refers to the use circumvention tools like VPNs to access overseas sites blocked by China's domestic network filter, the so-called Great Firewall.\n\nThough Chinese authorities have attempted to crack down on unlicensed VPN services, particularly when political tensions run high, use of VPNs is still fairly common in China. Institutions and corporations with overseas links have to rely on VPNs to connect to their business clients and partners. Even the Chinese authorities sometimes encourage their online civilization armies to circumvent the Great Firewall in order to influence certain political events such as the Taiwanese presidential election in 2015.\n\nOnline, some have expressed optimism that the labelling of circumvention tools as violent and terrorist software will remain limited to Xinjiang. As an American expat pointed out on Reddit:\n\nAs an American living in China for the past 2 years, I call bullshit. Everyone here uses a VPN. Even Chinese people who work for international companies use them. It's openly talked about. I have a VPN for my work to access my email, google, and youtube. I have a personal VPN for my home computer. I have one installed on my phone to get on facebook. I do it openly in public and no one bats an eye. I agree with other comments about this only being in Xinjiang, but I'm guessing there were other problems happening as well. Bottom line, no one is really afraid to use VPNs in China.\n\nThis is certainly the case in much of mainland China right now. But a source from the China Electronics Technology indicates that these pre-crime surveillance software, among other “anti-terrorist” technologies, are simply being tested in Xinjiang and Tibet, and will later be introduced throughout the country. Once passed, China's pending draft cybersecurity law may provide a firm legal basis for unrestricted access to user information online and facilitate the nationwide launch of such techniques.\n\nSurveillance of “pre-criminal” activities\n\nThe leaked document also provides more details about the development of pre-crime technology and crime prevention enforcement in China.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg in March 2016, the Chinese government began investing in pre-crime detection technology in 2014. A major antiterrorism technology development project which had an operating budget of US $25 billion was contracted out to a company called China Electronics Technology. The company’s engineer told Bloomberg that:\n\n…he said the software would be able to draw portraits of suspects by cross-referencing information from bank accounts, jobs, hobbies, consumption patterns, and footage from surveillance cameras. The program would flag unusual behavior, such as a resident of a poor village who suddenly has a lot of money in her bank account or someone with no overseas relatives who makes frequent calls to foreigners.\n\nAccording to this logic, a person with no overseas business using circumvention tool to communicate with people outside the country can be viewed as suspicious. And in the case of Xinjiang, where the authorities see 90% of the violent and terrorist crimes are related to getting access to censored information, detecting the downloading and usage of circumvention tool is part of the pre-crime crackdown.\n\nChina’s new anti-terrorism laws, which went into force in January 2016, have empowered the authorities to gain access to bank accounts, telecommunications, and a national network of surveillance cameras called Skynet. The leaked document suggests that the use of circumvention tools may also be documented as part of this program.\n\nOn China's Twitter-like Weibo, a Chinese public security agency boasted about its success in pre-crime crackdowns:\n\n去年，中国的杀人案每10万人0.7起，与世界上最安全的国家——瑞士相当；98%以上的境内暴恐事件，都在萌芽阶段就被警方打掉了。一个最直观的体验是：无论白天黑夜，你脚下的土地，几乎都可以让人安心漫步。这是很多西方国家做不到的。\n\nLast year, Chinese homicide rate is 0.7 case in 100,000 population. The figure is similar to Switzerland, the safest country in the world. 98% of the violent and terrorist incidents have been deterred at the pre-crime stage. Either in day time or at night, you can feel safe walking in this land. This is something that many other western countries cannot accomplish.\n\nWhile the pre-crime indicators would likely vary from region to region, it appears that both the law and technology will soon be working in sync to watch Chinese netizens, in the name of crime prevention.",
  "latent_27493": "A controversy is brewing in Saudi Arabia over a new fatwa issued that advocates, er, adult breastfeeding. From AOL News:\n\nSheikh Al Obeikan, an adviser to the royal court and consultant to the Ministry of Justice, set off a firestorm of controversy recently when he said on TV that women who come into regular contact with men who aren't related to them ought to give them their breast milk so they will be considered relatives.\n\n\"The man should take the milk, but not directly from the breast of the woman,\" Al Obeikan said, according to Gulf News. \"He should drink it and then becomes a relative of the family, a fact that allows him to come in contact with the women without breaking Islam's rules about mixing.\"\n\nObeikan said the fatwa applied to men who live in the same house or come into contact with women on a regular basis, except for drivers.\n\nAl Obeikan, who made the statement after being asked on TV about a 2007 fatwa issued by an Egyptian scholar about adult breast-feeding, said that the breast milk ought to be pumped out and given to men in a glass.\n\nBut his remarks were followed by an announcement by another high-profile sheik, Abi Ishaq Al Huwaini, who said that men should suckle the breast milk directly from a woman's breast.",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap\n\nBulls-Pelicans Preview\n\nBy ALAN FERGUSON\n\nPosted Apr 10 2016 9:58PM\n\nWith their playoff hopes dashed, the Chicago Bulls are left to try to wrap up their disappointing campaign in the most positive fashion possible.\n\nThe Bulls can at least avoid their first losing record in eight seasons by winning at least one of their final two games against fellow eliminated teams. They'll play the first of those at the severely depleted New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night.\n\nChicago's postseason hunt ended with Indiana's 129-105 rout of Brooklyn on Sunday, a bitter end for a franchise that once held championship aspirations. The consistency that was a hallmark under hard-driving former coach Tom Thibodeau was lacking at times in Fred Hoiberg's first season at the helm.\n\nThe Bulls (40-40) had one of their better efforts Saturday and a 105-102 victory against Cleveland gave them a 7-1 mark against the top two teams in the Eastern Conference - 3-1 vs. the Cavaliers and 4-0 against Toronto. That was offset by losses to lowlier competition like New York, Minnesota, Orlando and Phoenix.\n\n\"(The win over Cleveland) shows character. It shows pride,\" center Pau Gasol said. \"But it's also very frustrating because if we showed this type of edge and competitiveness every single night, we wouldn't be talking about this.\"\n\nThere are likely changes coming for the Bulls in the offseason but Cristiano Felicio might work his way into the rotation if he can continue to perform like he did Saturday. The Brazilian rookie had a career-high 16 points on 7-of-7 shooting.\n\n\"He can play as everyone saw tonight,\" guard Jimmy Butler said. \"I think if you give anybody confidence - and he's a very confident player - they can show that they can play. He's here to stay. He works really hard, and I'm happy for him.\"\n\nFelicio will try to build on that performance while helping the Bulls officially avoid their first losing mark since going 33-49 in 2007-08, the last season in which they failed to make the playoffs. They were 41-41 in each of the following two seasons and have experienced five straight winning campaigns.\n\nTo extend that streak, Chicago will need to top New Orleans and Philadelphia. The Pelicans (30-50) reached the 50-loss mark for the third time in franchise history with a 121-100 loss to Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nThey used nine players in their rotation for that defeat. Chicago native Anthony Davis, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon and Jrue Holiday - brother of Bulls guard Justin Holiday - are among the bevy of New Orleans' missing players.\n\nToney Douglas had a season-high 23 points in the Pelicans' fourth game in five days and is averaging 20.7 in his last three games.\n\n\"We played hard but we just didn't have it tonight, energywise,\" Douglas said. \"At the end of the day, no excuses. We lost tonight. We've got to learn from it and get ready for Monday against Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bulls have won three straight against the Pelicans, including a 98-94 home victory Dec. 12, and have prevailed in six of their last seven trips to New Orleans.\n\nThey likely won't have Taj Gibson (bruised rib) or E'Twaun Moore (hamstring) for this visit. Both players are considered doubtful.\n\nCopyright 2016 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Everyone wants to be liked. Everyone wants to have friends.\n\nSure, most of us probably don’t try to buy our friends. And most of us probably don’t react as poorly as John du Pont does when our friends go their own way.\n\nI don’t want to be reductive here. A need for friendship is just one of the things that drives John du Pont (Steve Carell) in “Foxcatcher”.* There are so many layers to his character, and they are all so fascinating that I wanted to use this space to try to organize my thoughts about Du Pont, to try to make sense of it all.\n\n* When I talk about du Pont, I’m strictly talking about how he is presented in the movie.\n\nHe’s entitled. Born into a wealthy family, money has always gotten du Pont everything he ever wanted. From train sets to cocaine to actual human beings, money was never an obstacle for him. So naturally, he expects things to go his way.\n\nHe’s lonely. Money could never make him friends, real ones at least. As he told Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), his mother once paid for a child to befriend him when he was younger. To have that seemingly actual friendship exposed as a lie seemed to really screw with his head. But can you blame him? How can you ever trust anyone to really be your friend after that?\n\nHe desperately wants to be liked. Not only that, but he wants to know that he is liked. He wants to know that he is appreciated. He seems to make a point to say “you’re welcome” anytime Mark thanks him for his generosity. It’s as if he really wants Mark to know that he is thanking the right person. His sense of entitlement and loneliness seem to be natural precursors to this desperate need to be liked, appreciated and admired.\n\nHe’s an idealist. Sure, John du Pont is kind of creepy, but he seems to truly want America to be successful again and bring home Olympic gold medals. He may have some severe athletic deficiencies, but he has a passion for competitive wrestling. If he can’t do it, he wants one of his wrestlers to succeed. But does he really care about “America”, or does he just want to be the one responsible for America’s revitalization?\n\nHe wants to have power over people. Du Pont struggled to get people to see things his way his entire life, to make friends, to make his mother proud of him. Naturally, this leads to a need for respect and admiration, to be feared. If he can feel like he has power, his life can feel worthwhile. That’s why he leads Mark around a philanthropic dinner event with the introduction “Have you ever met an Olympic gold medalist?” He wants to own Mark.\n\nNaturally, these motivations and desires begin to make life difficult. And at the point when du Pont most begins to feel his power slipping away, he takes matters into his own hands.\n\nCarell’s chilling performance has really stuck with me almost a week after seeing this movie. I never thought I would be seeing Steve Carell in my nightmares, but man…is this really the same guy?\n\nA Few Stray Thoughts (SLIGHT SPOILERS):\n\nI thought this movie was about as good as it could be. When you’re tied to a true story, it can force a narrative direction that may not really work. The film sets up to be a Channing Tatum movie, and after becoming strongly invested in his character, he kind of vanishes for the last half-hour or so. Don’t get me wrong, I’m fascinated by the character of John du Pont (I mean, I just wrote like 500 words about him), but Mark’s arc felt unfinished because of the way things unfolded.\n\nThe character of Mark Schuldt is set up very well in this movie. It feels a little slow at the start, but the way everything happens (sad, lonely training with a brother who’s better than him, taking $20 to speak at an elementary school, talking about what winning a gold medal for America means to him) informs his decision and willingness to follow a man like John du Pont.\n\nI love the look Carell shoots Mark Ruffalo in the scene in the hotel room where Dave Schultz is playing with his children. You can see the disgust in his eyes as he sees a man who has everything du Pont himself has ever wanted, and you can see how little his presence means to Dave. That look alone changed the way I looked at their relationship for the rest of the movie.\n\nThe lack of music in this film makes everything so creepy and unbelievably eerie.\n\nBennett Miller has become an expert at making sports movies that are not at all about the sport. He seems to have a way into his characters and the deepest, darkest parts of their being.\n\n“Most of my friends will call me Eagle, or Golden Eagle.”\n\nWhat did everybody else think? Has this movie come to a theater near you yet?\n\nTaylor Gaines can be contacted on Twitter @GainesTaylor.\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_27666": "BRADFORD is “heading towards disaster” and the Council has allowed racial hatred and the perception of fear to “become a real problem”, the chairman of a scrutiny committee has warned.\n\nCouncillor Arshad Hussain, who chairs Bradford Council’s corporate overview and scrutiny committee, said there were”many areas in this city” where people were afraid to go, depending on their ethnicity.\n\nCllr Hussain (Lab, Toller) branded the situation a “horrible state of affairs” as the committee discussed a new report on community cohesion and how the Council’s diversity and cohesion team was working to strengthen community relations. The report said the team was working with all religious groups and other organisations in its response to the Louise Casey report on opportunity and integration, which gives recommendations to the government.\n\nBut Cllr Hussain said the work being done by the team was not enough and said too many people were “scared to speak up in case they caused offence”.\n\nHe said: “Community relations in this city were a lot better 25 years ago. Are we really achieving what we are supposed to be achieving? I don’t think so. Last month on Bonfire Night in my ward, three pubs were stoned by Asian youths.”\n\nThe Red Lion and Round Thorn pubs, in Thornton Road, were among those targeted on November 5.\n\n“These were the only white businesses in the area. No Asian businesses were attacked. They were targeted because they were white.” he added.\n\n“I am really cheesed off with things like this. There are so many areas in this city where white people are scared to go into. Likewise there are other areas where Asian people are scared to go into. That is a horrible state of affairs and it should never have got to this stage. Perhaps you should start to do things in a different way. You tend to use the same organisations time and time again. Perhaps you should start delivering on the doorstep and getting new groups on board because I think we are heading towards disaster.\n\n“There has been a huge increase in Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Hate crime has risen threefold but the majority still is not reported. The biggest challenge for you is to acknowledge there is a problem, rather than being in denial and then work accordingly.”\n\nCllr Simon Cooke (Con, Bingley Rural) said: “At a recent event at the synagogue there were armed police posted outside. Is that an example of community cohesion that a Jewish event needed police protection? I think we are kidding ourselves. I represent thousands of people who never come into Bradford and I am only five miles up the road. They say they don’t feel safe. That’s the reality. And I am sure there are people who live in Girlington who would prefer not to come to Cullingworth and I don’t like that. The perception of what Bradford is like is the problem. Mention danger drivers and who comes to mind?\n\n“And integration. Both sides don’t want to integrate.”\n\nCouncillor Vanda Greenwood (Lab, Windhill and Wrose) said: “There is a real problem of people’s perception of Bradford. My daughter is 23 and she and her friends say they will not come into Bradford for a drink or night out because they say there are gangs of Asian males hanging around. They say they do not feel safe and instead go to Leeds. You are working here on high level stuff, but it is mostly with religious people and their ethos is to be caring anyway. You need to get into the streets.”\n\nCouncillor Cath Bacon (Lab, Keighley West) added: “It is the xenophobic and racial section of society that you need to reach. We have people goose-stepping outside the asylum seekers’ centre in Keighley centre.”\n\nPresenting the report, Ian Day, the Council’s assistant director for neighbourhood and customer services, said there was work going on with the communities and there was funding for that work. He said: “I do recognise that there is more work to do. Funding resources are being put into areas where there are entrenched views.”\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, Councillor Abdul Jabar, executive member for neighbourhoods and community safety, said: “Much of the discussion (at the meeting) was around perceptions and that’s something we all, as councillors, and as Bradford district residents have a responsibility to change.\n\n“If crimes are committed that’s a different matter. Working with the police, we will always act regardless of anyone’s faith or cultural background if they have committed a crime.”\n\nHe said, in general, people agreed that Bradford district was a welcoming city where people get on with each other and added that the report outlined some amazing work taking place by a wide range of groups and individuals.\n\nMembers voted to welcome the report and asked officers to make a note of the comments made.\n\nSupt Alisa Newman, partnerships lead at Bradford District Police, said: “Police in Bradford District are committed to maintaining public safety and work with Bradford Council and other agencies to make sure that any tensions within communities are closely monitored and where offences have been committed appropriate action will be taken.\n\n“Our neighbourhood teams have built excellent links with their local communities and work hard to make sure these relationships are maintained and developed, so that people whether living, working or visiting Bradford, can feel safe in their respective areas.”",

  "latent_27730": "Weekly Video with Editor Must-Read Picks, and more new features — with the Washington Examiner Magazine, Digital Edition.\n\nTwo key senators move to ‘yes,’ GOP tax bill that repeals mandate looking more likely. The Senate Republican tax bill got a major boost this morning ahead of planned votes as holdouts Ron Johnson and Steve Daines said they would vote \"yes.\" Their support would appear to bring the GOP to the 50 votes needed to pass the major tax overhaul. Johnson and Daines said Friday morning that they had received a deal from leadership to add about $100 billion in tax cuts for small businesses, a priority for them that had previously led them to oppose the bill. “I’m planning to vote ‘yes’ today on the tax bill,\" Daines, from Montana, said on Fox News. \"This is a historic moment for our nation.\" \"It looks like we have 50 votes,\" Johnson in an interview with Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber. Republicans were regrouping Friday morning on the tax bill to try to rework the details to gain the support of Tennessee's Bob Corker and others, who said they wanted the tax cut to add less to deficits. No deal had been announced yet to change the bill to appease Corker, Arizona's Jeff Flak, and others who are worried about the debt. Others in the conference have yet to say whether they will support the bill, including Susan Collins of Maine, who has sought to add a deduction for state and local property taxes to the bill. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have called for expanding the increased child tax credit to low-income families. If passed, the tax bill would nix the Obamacare individual mandate fine in time for coming tax season.\n\nWhat health amendments are in today’s vote-a-rama? The vote-a-rama will feature some healthcare items including:\n\n*Repeal of the health insurance tax. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., submitted an amendment that would repeal Obamacare’s tax on insurance plans sold on the individual market. The insurance industry has been clamoring for getting rid of the unpopular tax. But missing from the latest round of amendments is a repeal of the other unpopular tax in Obamacare: an excise tax on certain medical device makers such as manufacturers of MRIs.\n\n*Changing the medical expense deduction. Collins has an amendment that changes to the medical expense tax deduction. Currently a person can claim a medical tax deduction if his or a family member’s medical expenses exceed 10 percent of gross income. Collins’ amendment would change that from 10 percent to 7.5 percent. The House tax bill that passed last month fully eliminates the medical expense tax deduction.\n\n*Retroactive Obamacare penalties. Some people who paid the penalty for being uninsured in 2014 and 2015 would be reimbursed under an amendment filed by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.\n\nWelcome to Philip Klein’s Daily on Healthcare, compiled by Washington Examiner Managing Editor Philip Klein ( @philipaklein), Senior Healthcare Writer Kimberly Leonard ( @LeonardKL) and Healthcare Reporter Robert King ( @rking_19).

If signing up doesn’t work, shoot us an email and we’ll add you to our list.\n\nWhat about the medical device tax? The industry hasn’t given up on repealing Obamacare’s device tax this year. It believes that it stands a better chance at passage if it is part of a continuing resolution, rather than turned into an amendment as part of a partisan tax bill. Government funding runs out Dec. 8.\n\nKombucha tea may avoid alcohol tax. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is proposing an amendment to exempt the fermented tea Kombucha from alcohol sales taxes. Kombucha has gained popularity for its possible health effects, which are not backed by scientific studies. The drink is a fermented tea with a strong vinegar flavor. Back in 2015, the Alcohol, Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau warned five manufacturers that their Kombucha contained too much alcohol, according to a 2015 CNN article. Kombucha makers warn that alcohol could result from the fermentation process, but told CNN that it would be impossible to get drunk on the yucky tea.\n\nCollins, Murkowski defend opposition to individual mandate. Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski helped doom the GOP's efforts to repeal Obamacare over the summer by voting against a bill that would have repealed the law’s individual mandate. Now Alaska's Murkowski and Maine's Collins are backing a repeal of the mandate's penalties. Collins and Murkowski said separately that the “skinny” repeal bill included more than just repeal of the individual mandate, which requires everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. The senators joined Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said Thursday he would back the tax legislation, and all Senate Democrats to defeat the measure in late July. They also opposed a last-ditch effort in September to repeal and replace Obamacare. “The skinny repeal bill had many other provisions in it,” Collins said. “It repealed the employer mandate, eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood and had many other provisions and so it is not comparable at all [to mandate repeal].”\n\nWill states implement their own individual mandates? The District of Columbia is the only locality that has begun considering such a change, but questions about this possibility surfaced in Twitter chatter among legal and health policy experts Thursday. Massachusetts already has its own mandate, as much of Obamacare was built around its model. “Dear States: Now would be a very good time to consider adopting your own individual mandates,” tweeted Nicholas Bagley, an administrative law expert from the University of Michigan Law School. In an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, Bagley said Democrat-controlled states such as California, Connecticut, New York, Washington and Oregon may opt to pass legislation that would replace the individual mandate at the state level.\n\nRepublicans not concerned tax bill would trigger Medicare cuts. Several Republican senators doubted their tax reform legislation would raise the deficit enough to trigger $25 billion in mandatory cuts to Medicare next year, despite a new estimate that it would. A major concern from Collins is that the bill would trigger a 2010 law that installs mandatory spending cuts if the deficit reaches a certain threshold. Collins said she recently received assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would pursue a waiver to the 2010 law’s deep cuts. But Republicans said there would be enough growth from the tax bill to prevent a major spike in the deficit that triggers the cuts. “We are presupposing it is going to cause a deficit and I am not sure that is a correct presupposition,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nTrump donates third-quarter salary to HHS to help tackle opioid epidemic. President Trump wrote a check to the Department of Health and Human Services that will go toward a public information campaign about the opioid crisis, fulfilling part of his pledge not to take a salary in his role in the Oval Office. The donation is part of Trump's pledge to give his $400,000-a-year presidential salary away. His first-quarter salary went to the Department of the Interior and his second-quarter salary went to the Department of Education. The latest check will go toward a public awareness campaign that will detail the dangers of opioid addiction, which involves prescription painkillers and illegal drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. The awareness campaign was one of the recommendations that Trump's opioid commission made this month. Eric Hargan, acting secretary for HHS, made the announcement during the press briefing Thursday. \"His decision to donate his salary is a tribute to his compassion, his patriotism and his sense of duty to the American people,\" Hargan said.\n\nHHS adds context to reports about Trump shortening open enrollment period. In an email sent Friday morning to reporters, the Department of Health and Human Services pointed out that the Obama administration had issued a final rule for the open enrollment period to be shorted to 45 days by 2018, writing that “as the exchanges grow and mature, a month-and-a-half open enrollment period provides sufficient time for consumers to enroll in or change [qualified health plans] for the upcoming coverage year.” The Trump administration moved the planned change up a year, saying that aligned the provision more with Medicare enrollment and noting that if people buy plans by Dec. 15 their coverage can begin Jan. 1. The move also would help improve the risk pools, they said, because it would prevent people from waiting to sign up later. Democrats have cited the shortened open enrollment as evidence that the Trump administration is working to “sabotage” Obamacare, and they point to cuts the administration made to advertising and outreach.\n\nReporters press White House for update on Trump's health. The White House said Thursday it is looking into whether Trump plans to get a physical, and whether he will publicly report the findings, as some predecessors in the Oval Office have done. The review certifies from a physician whether the president is \"fit for duty\" and includes information about medical history and past tests, as well as information about new testing like a colonoscope. A 2010 exam for former President Barack Obama concluded that he was \"fit for duty\" and noted that he was using nicotine replacement therapy, which helps curb the urge to smoke cigarettes. An exam in 2001 for former President George W. Bush also concluded he was \"fit for duty\" and included information about his medical injuries in the past, some of which were sports-related. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she didn't know what Trump's plans were for reporting his health outcomes, but said she would check on it.\n\nCollins: 'No reason to be concerned' about Trump's mental state. Collins on Thursday brushed aside a Washington Post reporter’s question about Trump’s mental health. Collins, who has spent hours with the president discussing and negotiating tax reform, said, “First of all, let me say, my conversations with the president recently have given me no reason to be concerned in that regard.” She was answering a question from the Post’s Jonathan Capehart at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “I’m wondering how concerned you are about the mental health of the president?” asked Capehart. Collins did, however, said that Trump is wrong to raise conspiracy theories and to have tweeted questionable anti-Muslim videos this week. “Do I think that it’s helpful that he raises these conspiracy theories or puts out a tweet of an anti-Muslim video that turns out to not even be accurate? No. I don’t,” she said.\n\nRUNDOWN\n\nWashington Post Obamacare’s centerpiece is hanging by a thread.\n\nThe Hill House dems introduce bill to provide $45 billion for opioid epidemic\n\nSTAT News FDA approves Indivior’s monthly injection to treat opioid addiction\n\nBloomberg ‘Pharma bro’ Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang Album could be seized by federal prosecutors\n\nKaiser Health News Desperate for coverage: Are short-term plans better than none at all?\n\nNew York Times Without Obamacare mandate ‘you open the flood gates’ for skimpy plans\n\nReuters U.S. health regulator Seema Verma eyes new method for drug pricing\n\nLos Angeles Times National science panel calls for aggressive steps to control drug prices\n\nAssociated Press Health nominee Azar is no stranger to management controversy\n\nCalendar\n\nFRIDAY | Dec. 1\n\nNov. 30-Dec. 1.

The Times clearly wants those who see the tweet to believe that scores of Patriots players and front office personnel stayed away this year rather than be seen at the mean, evil Trump White House.\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nThe Patriots had to go on Twitter to correct the record.\n\nHere's the Times's Wednesday afternoon tweet (HTs to several center-right blogs):\n\nOh my.

The Times clearly wants those who see the two photos to believe many people associated with the Patriots didn't want to be seen anywhere near Donald Trump and his White House.\n\nAs seen in the number of retweets, lots of people took the bait. One of them was alleged comedian Stephen Colbert, who tweeted: \"Doesn’t look like a lot of Patriots visited the White House.

  "latent_28028": "Some of you may be familiar with using the client-side Google Maps API in your site’s javascript. It’s easily the top-of-the-line API for rendering geographical images and data, and so easy to use. Google even provides you with a developer-friendly tool to style your maps – no prior CSS knowledge necessary. As web pages become more interactive, including these types of maps into your sites will become more and more ubiquitous (even for plain static sites).\n\nTo show you how simple it is, let’s just create a basic html page:\n\nmap.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <div id = \"map_canvas\" style = \"display: block; height: 100%;\" > </div> <script src = \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false\" > </script> <script> // Set basic map attributes var mapOptions = { zoom : 5 , center : new google . maps . LatLng ( 39.16 , - 100.72 ) } ; var map = new google . maps . Map ( document . getElementById ( 'map_canvas' ) , mapOptions ) ; </script>\n\nAnd wallah, we’ve built and are rendering a Google Map.\n\nYou can even add markers on to the map, which would allow you to indicate specific data points at certain geographic locations. These markers can be any shape too, and if you’re an artist, then you can specify SVG-like paths to get a really fancy marker. We won’t go into markers though, as that’s all well documented by Google.\n\nWhile the Google Maps API is certainly awesome though, it has its limitations – specifically with coloring or highlighting plots of land that you would like to ‘stand out’ from the rest. Maybe you want to show which US states are more Republican vs Democratic, or maybe you want to show which countries in Europe you’ve visited, or perhaps you even want to show which provinces in China you purchase tea from (yes, I am guilty here). By just using the naked Google Maps API libraries, this is impossible. But we don’t like to accept the word ‘impossible,’ and lo and behold, there is in fact a way to do this using some vary fancy files dubbed as GeoJSON.\n\nWhat are GeoJSON files?\n\nI’m glad you asked. Per Wikipedia, GeoJSON is an open standard format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial attributes using JSON. What this means is that you can specify collections of lat/long points in a JSON file that is representative of a plot of land. Since they’re usually written in lat/long values, you can be sure that you’ll get the same result no matter what map API you’re using. Here’s an example of a .geo.json file that diagrams the state of Arkansas:\n\narkansas.geo.json 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"type\" : \"FeatureCollection\" , \"features\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Feature\" , \"id\" : \"USA-AR\" , \"properties\" : { \"fips\" : \"05\" , \"name\" : \"Arkansas\" } , \"geometry\" : { \"type\" : \"Polygon\" , \"coordinates\" : [ [ [ - 94.473842 , 36.501861 ] , [ - 90.152536 , 36.496384 ] , . . . ] ] } } ] }\n\nNow you’re probably thinking “That’s cool, but what good does this do me?” While Google can’t specifically highlight plots of land on its own, it does have support for loading .geo.json files into your map and styling them however you want. This means that we can accomplish what we wanted to earlier: coloring in states, countries, or anything really. Here’s how we could include this arkansas.geo.json file into our existing map from above:\n\nmap.html 1 map . data . loadGeoJson ( './arkansas.geo.json' ) ;\n\nAnd that’s it! This will insert the data from our .geo.json file into our map’s data – you probably won’t notice anything though because we don’t have any fill color. Let’s add some highlighting to this data:\n\nmap.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 // Overlay Styles map . data . setStyle ( { fillColor : '#2687bf' , fillOpacity : . 3 , strokeWeight : 0 } ) ;\n\nPerfect, now our map will specifically color in the state of Arkansas with a translucent blue. And that’s about all there is to it – now you can create Google Maps that highlight any plot of land you want. To see an example of everything we’ve discussed here, check out my demo down below.\n\nWhere to get GeoJSON files?\n\nYou may be left with a question right about now: “Where am I supposed to find the GeoJSON files I need?” And that’s a good question. Luckily, an awesome developer gathered GeoJSON files for every single country in the world, and if you’re wanting to map out the USA, he even gathered GeoJSON files for every single state AND its cities, all inside of a public GitHub repo.\n\nCheck it out here: https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json\n\nLive Demo\n\nCheck out my demo of using GeoJSON with the Google Maps API.\n\nThe source code is freely available too.",

  "latent_28265": "Across the Southeast, families are caught in an economic trap they can’t escape, and Chattanooga now finds itself at a turning point. Do we gloss over our toxic secret? Or do we prove, as we have before, that nothing is impossible when a divided city truly unites?\n\nN some mornings the line begins forming as early as 2 a.m. Some ride wheelchairs paid for by Medicare for miles on bumpy city sidewalks, past condo construction and $30-a-plate restaurants. Some beg neighbors for pocket change so they can catch a bus. Some drive their cars on fumes, wondering if they will have enough gas to get home. Some walk, sometimes for hours. And when 8 a.m. arrives and the doors unlock at Metropolitan Ministries on McCallie Avenue, one of the last vestiges of emergency financial help for Chattanoogans teetering on homelessness, 33 people shuffle in to take a number and a seat.\n\n“Just 33,” signs around the building read, reminders of the constant tension between mounting needs and limited resources. Those who don’t make it to the line in time are sent home. Try another day, volunteers say.

We can help with power bills from the 15th to the end of the month. There are food vouchers, but you can’t get a voucher if you get cash assistance. You can only choose one.” “You matter,” she says at one point in her speech. “Does anyone want to pray?” she asks, almost always finding a volunteer. Those gathered bow their heads. “Thank you for waking us up in the morning,” someone prays. “Thank you for getting us here.” Horne tries not to draw attention to those who open their eyes and can’t hide the tears running down their cheeks.\n\n‘That didn’t stop them.’\n\nThere is a reasonwhy Chattanooga is called the renaissance city of the South. It was the comeback kid. The underdog. The American dream. No one thought Chattanooga would be a tourism magnet after Walter Cronkite told the entire country on the nightly news that Chattanooga was the dirtiest city in the nation. When Coca-Cola multimillionaire Jack Lupton promised his freshwater Tennessee Aquarium would be the cornerstone of a new downtown people laughed. “Jack’s fish tank,” they called it. Others doubted the city could compete for Volkswagen and Amazon or build and expand the fastest Internet in the Western Hemisphere to stake a claim in America’s emerging technology sector. But those with ambition and money ignored the critics, and two decades later that transformational energy has a name: “The Chattanooga Way.” Even the president of the United States knows the shorthand of Chattanooga’s narrative. It was just an old railroad town, Barack Obama said during a speech in January of last year. “That didn’t stop them.” Yet, in the last few years — as national research has shed new light on poverty and on how states and cities stifle or support the upward mobility of disadvantaged children — local stakeholders fear the shine on the city’s success story is slowly wearing off. “We have to be honest that there are people left out of the growing prosperity,” said Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke at a downtown forum on diversity last fall. “Yes, even in the best town ever.” The ranks of white, black and Hispanic poor and near poor have swollen as more middle-class families unhelped by the region’s economic recovery slip into poverty or hover near it and as the children of the poor and middle class continue to be knocked down by obstacles to bettering their lives. POVERTY: A STORM ON THE HORIZON Poverty rates have increased among all segments of society as stagnant wages, rising costs, falling civic engagement, persistent economic segregation, consistently unsuccessful educational intervention and the growing decoupling of marriage from childrearing continue to shape the futures of children and families. Source: U.S. Census Bureau and Social Explorer Research also shows that the city is now counted among the country’s top 10 markets for income inequality with 21 low-income households for every one above $200,000 a year, much worse than the U.S. ratio of 8-to-1. Economists predict job growth and a dip in poverty rates in the immediate future, but the city’s changing population and divergent earnings may threaten growth in the long run, they warn. Thanks to a shaky economy and a slow but steady retreat from marriage — now considered a crisis among white and Hispanic families, as well as black — the share of children born into isolated and unstable environments has been on the rise. It’s a demographic shift that matters because social scientists and early childhood development experts can now say with confidence that many of those children will experience poverty, struggle to escape it and potentially remain stuck in an underclass that will swell and cement if Chattanoogans’ stagnant wages continue to shrink the middle class and nudge many more toward financial instability. Many wonder why so many have remained poor all throughout the nation’s War on Poverty. The answer, according to a decade of economic research, is this: Beginning a century ago, navigating out of poverty became a lot harder. SHARE OF ADULTS LIVING IN MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IS FALLING % of adults in each income tier Note: Adults are assigned to income tiers based on their size-adjusted household income in the calendar year prior to the survey year. Figures may not add to 100% due to rounding.\n\nSource: Pew Research Center analysis of the Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplements Since then, mobility rates across America have stalled and remained relatively unchanged, despite a larger safety net and a slight narrowing of racial achievement gaps, multiple research projects have shown. The South, in particular, appears to be a dead zone for mobility. In fact, a lifetime in Hamilton County hurts poor and middle-class children, in terms of finding a spouse and earning a livable wage, more than it helps. A study published by Harvard University that used anonymous tax records to map economic mobility across the U.S. showed that almost the entire country — 91 percent of counties — did a better job of creating paths to high earnings for children born at the bottom than Hamilton County. And experts feel they are closer to understanding why so many children remain stifled. While America is often called a land of opportunity, researchers say there are too many differences between regions, states and cities to support that generality. In some Western states, more than 30 percent of poor children climb to a family income of $70,000 per year by age 30 or $100,000 by age 45. In Chattanooga, just 5.9 percent do. And a child from a poor family in Cannon County, Tennessee, would grow up to make 9 percent, or $2,440, more at age 26 than they would if they had grown up in the average American county. In Hamilton County, the opposite is true. A child growing up in a poor family in Hamilton County, would make 9 percent or $2,470 less at age 26. The reasons, according to the 2015 study published by Harvard professors Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren and University of California-Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Patrick Kline, may lie in five measures that many communities widely differ on. * Segregation. “Areas with larger black populations tend to be more segregated by income and race, which could affect both white and black low-income individuals adversely.” * Inequality. “Factors that erode the middle class hamper inter-generational mobility more than the factors that lead to income growth” among the wealthy. * Schools. “Areas with higher test scores (controlled for income levels), lower dropout rates and smaller class sizes have higher rates of upward mobility. In addition, areas with higher local tax rates, which are predominantly used to finance public schools, have higher rates of mobility.” * Social capital. “High upward-mobility areas tend to have higher fractions of religious individuals and greater participation in local civic organizations.” *Family structure. “The strongest predictors of upward mobility are measures of family structure such as the fraction of single parents in the area.” Left unaddressed, these factors undergirding poverty will only hurt Chattanooga as a whole, national researchers and local boosters insist. “Chattanooga is on a risky trajectory,” leaders of a local coalition that includes some of the city’s influential foundations, the Hamilton County Board of Education and the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce wrote last December. “Either we face this challenge or … run the risk of creating two permanent Chattanoogas.” Right now, 41 percent of births in Hamilton County are to single mothers, whose median income, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is between $20,000 and $24,000 a year. Meanwhile, research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculates that a single mother with just one child would have to earn $41,625 a year to pay basic living costs in the county. STAGNANT PAY, RISING RENT In Chattanooga, wages are down, after being adjusted for inflation, yet the cost of housing continues to rise as the city attracts new residents. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, wage and rent data for earlier years were adjusted for inflation by the U.S. Bureau of Labor “Despite Chattanooga’s enormous economic potential, the region currently lacks the workforce required to sustain our success,” according to the coalition’s 2015 report, called “Chattanooga 2.0.” “In the coming years, more than 80 percent of jobs paying a living wage ($35,000) in our area will require a post-secondary certificate or degree, but currently, just 35 percent of students in Hamilton County are likely to attain this required level of education.” The NAACP, neighborhood associations and community activists caution, as well, that persistent achievement chasms between children with resources and children without could easily fuel tensions between races and classes that spill into public conflict that would hurt the city’s image. By the beginning of February, some of this was already surfacing. Activists unexpectedly interrupted the mayor at a lunch gathering in January and at a memorial march in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. because leaders said they wanted to stand in opposition to the city’s local economic policy and police practices, which they believe have worked to further promote racism and classism. But those who see these forces on the horizon also see the beginnings of a convergence, linking scattered groups, at odds in the past, in a fresh approach to economic improvement that blends prescriptions for poverty from the right and the left. Together, these nascent efforts could become strands in a rope that offer a lifeline to struggling children and lift the city toward new levels of prosperity. More than a year of study by the Times Free Press into these community-minded efforts to solve the poverty puzzle reveals there is growing reason for hope.\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nHorne had a doe-eyed optimism when she accepted her first job after college at Metropolitan Ministries in 2014. For one thing, she brought with her an enlightened, 21st century take on poverty. As a Covenant College community-development graduate, she had been shaped by a curriculum that taught a new way of thinking about the poor and posed new solutions as well. Historically, efforts to alleviate poverty focused more on the crisis of the moment, Horne said, recalling her Covenant education. Yet, few offered intensive programs that walked struggling individuals through the steps they needed to take to find stability. Person-to-person mentoring was expensive and inefficient, if considered from a business perspective, and few organizations could drum up the grant support needed to sustain the cost. Still, the approach worked, research showed. Before even meeting Horne, Rebecca Whelchel, the executive director of Metropolitan Ministries, had enlisted the Episcopal charity in the fight for sustainable stability, greatly expanding the temporary crisis relief it had always offered. Whelchel had known for some time that there was no singular solution to any individual’s poverty, and while there were terrific partnerships among agencies, turning those partnerships into launchpads for people to lead more stable and less chaotic lives was cumbersome, due in large part to agencies’ disperate locations, differing hours, differing funding sources and differing expertise. And every variable came to represent a barrier for the poor, she said. Other agencies had begun to see the need for a more holistic model as well. The Partnership for Families, Children and Adults, for example, piloted Building Stable Lives, which used life coaches to help struggling families navigate the complex local system for aid. The program later was adopted and expanded by the United Way of Greater Chattanooga. First Things First, another local nonprofit, began offering more intensive one-on-one guidance through classes such as Work Smart, Live Well and Dads Making a Difference. At Metropolitan Ministries, Whelchel titled Horne’s job “stability navigator.” Volunteers who did client intakes asked those in line if they had ongoing concerns about their housing, their children’s education or their health care, for example, and those who said yes were sent to Horne, who asked them how she could help them execute their long-term plan. Horne opens the day with a group prayer with clients in the Metropolitan Ministries lobby. Known as MetMin, the Episcopal charity was started in 1979 with a core mission of providing immediate emergency assistance with past-due rent, utilities, food vouchers and groceries for seniors. It was a job Horne felt ready for but quickly found daunting enough to make her think economic mobility had become more myth than reality. For most of her life, Horne, who grew up solidly middle class in a Knoxville suburb, had little personal connection to poverty. Her father pastored a Presbyterian church, and she remembers praying for the poor. But aside from mission trips that sent her overseas for service projects and evangelism, she didn’t know much about struggling Americans. When she did eventually meet them in her office at Metropolitan Ministries, heard their stories and met their young children, she was appalled by the adversity they described. Many who stood in line at Metropolitan Ministries were working, doing what America had asked of them, but ends just wouldn’t meet. They made too much money to qualify for government aid and too little to pay their bills. Horne saw single mothers in the Catch 22 of needing to work to provide for their children but having no money or family for child care. Others couldn’t save or get ahead because the lion’s share of their money went to help family members or to secure rides to jobs in the suburbs. Then there were those who were severely mentally ill, who never learned to read and felt they had no option but to make a home in the woods and rely on the companionship of a stray dog. There were still others who were serious about furthering their education but couldn’t pass the new and harder GED or succeed in their first classes at Chattanooga State Community College. Among the “working poor” were those who flipped burgers at McDonald’s or picked feathers off chickens at the Pilgrim’s Pride plant for 40 hours a week but couldn’t manage to keep their electricity on, no matter how careful they were about spending. At the bottom also were those who seemed bent on self-destruction, she said, and, at least from a middle-class point of view, their choices made no sense. Whelchel, who had headed Metropolitan Ministries for nearly a decade, knew the dichotomy well. VIEWS ON POVERTY, THEN AND NOW Western civilization has long debated the causes of poverty. In 1995, during the era of welfare reform, and again in 2014 an NBC News and Wall-Street Journal poll asked Americans what the main driver of poverty was and found a shift in national thinking in the years since the Great Recession. QUESTION: What is the biggest cause of poverty today? Source: NBC News and Wall Street Journal While opinion polls still said that almost half of Americans blamed individuals for their own poverty, Whelchel felt most Americans could say that only because they had never studied the ins and outs of a life in poverty. She hated what she saw as the cliché explanations of poverty, the oversimplifications that reduced poor people to victims or villains. Poverty, she knew, was a complicated foe with roots in racism, classism, family instability, systemic ineptitude, political indifference, individual failure, mental illness, physical disability and the ever-changing economic winds. More importantly, she knew the poor and struggling were more than symptoms of societal ills. They were human beings. But, because they were thought to have nothing of value, they were dehumanized and forced to pay a higher price than everyone else for their errors, she told her staff. Not long after Whelchel hired Horne, a homeless woman came to their building, rambling and lost, spewing racism. The scene left Horne frustrated and slightly sickened. Whelchel, however, was unfazed. “Did you see how blue her eyes were?” she asked Horne, focusing on the positive rather than the ugliness the woman’s hardships had brought upon her that day. It was a moment Horne returned to time after time throughout her rough-and-tumble entry into the world of social work and case management. The poor made bad decisions like everyone else, but she also learned their decisions weren’t made in a vacuum. Poverty imparted certain outlooks and weaknesses easily misunderstood by people on the outside looking in, she said. Running late for an appointment could mean that a person didn’t care about rules and lacked concern for other people’s time, or it could mean they didn’t have access to a car and the bus had run late. Teaching herself to consider their points of view became important when clients tested her patience, she said. Last summer, Horne and Mark Williams, a caseworker at the Chattanooga Community Kitchen, grew close to a homeless man named Jimmy. A longtime member of the street community, Jimmy was known for a toothless grin until Horne found someone willing to help him purchase dentures. Horne, left, and Rebecca Whelchel, right, talk with client Terrol Johnson, who says he was wrongfully evicted from Patten Towers, in Horne’s office in December 2015. Horne arranged for MetMin’s attorney to look into Johnson’s eviction. For months, Horne and Williams worked to help Jimmy find stable housing and heard nothing but “no” until Williams secured a spot for him in the Community Kitchen’s permanent housing program. But neither could find him to give him the news. It worried Horne, because Jimmy had cried the last time she talked with him on the phone. A man had mugged and beaten him under a downtown bridge, sending him to the hospital. He told Horne he was tired and thought about giving up. Days later, Williams called Horne to tell her Jimmy’s body had been found, surrounded by empty liquor bottles in a homeless camp built behind a convenience store on Main Street. He is never going to sleep in a bed, she thought while she sat alone in her office sobbing. When no one claimed his body and Jimmy’s family refused to travel from Connecticut to see him, Horne asked Whelchel if they could hold a public memorial in his honor. “We put all these labels on people — homeless, not homeless,” said Horne, who months later still thinks about Jimmy. “But human to human, he was a person who added to the world, [and] there is not going to be another person like him again. Most people have advocates who tell them their life matters and all the things they should be celebrated for, but Jimmy didn’t.”\n\nThe Growth Machine\n\nMost efforts to improve this city over the past two decades have emphasized improving places, not lifting people. After school desegregation and the decline of manufacturing in the mid- to late-20th century, the city’s population dwindled. “Downtown had — like many other U.S. downtowns — became a ghost town,” wrote David Eichenthal, former head of the Ochs Center for Metropolitan Studies who was tapped in 2008 to write a Brookings Institution case study explaining how the city had been among the few old industrial cities to carve out a new identity. So public and private leaders sought a growth strategy to capture wealth downtown and lure developers, retailers, restaurants and national chains that required affluent customers. Those plans led to more than $1 billion in riverfront redevelopment and resulted in the bustling, modern and walkable downtown being trumpeted today. Earlier adopters of the downtown vision who smartly bought up property with an “if we build it, they will come” certainty, were perfectly poised to benefit from the real estate boom. Some city boosters, such as Eichenthal, warned poverty would eventually threaten such ambitions. As head of the Ochs Center, he published report after report on troubled neighborhoods, youth violence and educational failings in areas that ring the central city. THE CHATTANOOGA HOUSING BURDEN Source: U.S. Census Bureau, wage and rent data for earlier years were adjusted for inflation by the U.S. Bureau of Labor But there was not the effort to unify around the problem of poverty as there had been to unify around downtown’s decline. Nevertheless, modest efforts were made. Nonprofits pumped millions into programs for low-income residents that put them in homes, revitalized blighted neighborhoods, fought crime, trained and incentivized teachers, offered college scholarships and educated residents about marriage and parenting. Two mayors announced back-to-back wars on homelessness and laid out bold visions for addressing the most severe poverty in the city. And at the end of the 20th century, it seemed the investments were paying off. The city population grew, and surveys of residents revealed that negative attitudes about the city had changed, Eichenthal wrote in the Brookings case study. High-paying jobs in technology, insurance and finance flooded in, as well as lower-skilled jobs in tourism. Then, in the summer of 2008, big news broke. A $1 billion Volkswagen plant — the holy grail of automotive manufacturing — would make a home at Enterprise South, once the site of an Army ammunition plant, with suppliers in tow. To many, it was news that signaled Chattanooga had regained the economic prowess that once led to the nickname “Dynamo of Dixie.” Even when the Great Recession hit, many Chattanooga leaders thought the city was well positioned to weather the worst downturn in generations. But the opportunities many expected to trickle down largely did not, statistics reveal. The Earnings Shakedown The number of households in poverty is growing within Chattanooga's city limits and across the metro area while the number of households near the top of the earnings ladder continues to shrink. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, amounts in 2014 and 1999 inflation-adjusted dollars In the winter of 2009, a year after writing the Brookings case study, Eichenthal tried to explain this to a room full of business leaders at a Rotary Club meeting. The city’s success had been remarkable, he said that day. Of 20 cities in decline across the United States, only Chattanooga had reversed its fortune. There was work left to do, he urged. “To continue our city’s unprecedented turnaround, we need to pay attention to some numbers that frame our challenge and that, if left untended to, will make this singular success a passing one,” he warned. One in five Chattanoogans lived in poverty, he explained, and their lives were marked by struggle, pain, hunger and early death. The city needed to unify again, he said, for a far more daunting task. “Ten years ago, the challenge before this city and its leaders was, could this singular turnaround be sustained? And it was,” he said that day. “Today, the question is, can all of us continue to work together to build a city — a community — where we can take on the tough challenges that I have discussed today and succeed.” Those who remember being in the audience say Eichenthal finished to a standing ovation and cheers. Years went by, however, before many saw the writing on the wall. By 2016, one in four Chattanoogans were in poverty.\n\nThe Politics of Poverty",
  "latent_28479": "Rapidly advancing technologies are opening up astonishing sources of oil and gas all over the world. We are entering a new era of fossil fuels that is reshaping global economics and politics—and the planet.\n\n(PHOTO: CHRISTOPH MORLINGHAUS)\n\nOIL SEEPING TO THE SURFACE of the lazy Kern River, just north of Bakersfield, California, first caught James Elwood’s attention in 1899. The state was in the midst of an oil boom, and Elwood wanted in on the action. He rounded up a few relatives, got some picks and shovels, chose a patch of sun-baked earth near the river seep, and started digging.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nForty-odd feet down, they switched to an auger, and punched down another couple of dozen feet. Oil—trapped in the stone’s pores for millions of years—began oozing into the crude well.\n\nThe strike made the front page of the local newspaper, and brought other prospectors rushing to the Kern River. Within a year, 130 wells had been dug. Drillers pumped the black muck to the surface and hauled it away in barrels borne on mule carts. By 1904, more than 47,000 barrels per day were flowing forth, nearly matching the production of the entire state of Texas.\n\nKern River oil is particularly thick and viscous, with a consistency like molasses, which means it doesn’t flow easily. Analysts at the time predicted that the difficulty in extracting it meant they could get at only about 10 percent of the total that lay underground. By the early 1940s, oilmen had hauled 278 million barrels out of the field, but production was in steep decline; the most accessible oil was gone. Kern River seemed close to being effectively tapped out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nPumpjacks in the Kern River oil field, where fossil fuels have been continuously extracted for over a century. (PHOTO: CHRISTOPH MORLINGHAUS)\n\nIn the 1950s, however, several major oil companies active in the field tried some new ideas. They started dropping “bottom-hole heaters” into the wells, devices that use hot water or electricity to warm the oil, making it flow more easily. A few years later, engineers figured out how to inject steam into the underground crude. The results were spectacular. Within a few years, Kern River was producing more oil than ever. By 2007 the field had yielded some two billion barrels, making it one of the biggest in American history.\n\nThe story of Kern River reflects our entire history with oil: every time we think we’re starting to run out of it, new technologies arise that find us more. The widely circulated fears of a few years ago that we were approaching “peak oil” have turned out to be completely wrong. From the Arctic to Africa, nanoengineered materials, underwater robots, side-scanning 3-D sonar, specially engineered lubricants, and myriad other advances are opening up titanic new supplies of fossil fuels, many of them in unexpected places—Brazil, Australia, and, perhaps most significantly, North America. “Contrary to what most people believe,” declares a recent study from the Harvard Kennedy School, “oil supply capacity is growing worldwide at such an unprecedented level that it might outpace consumption.”\n\nFOR CENTURIES, THE EVER-SHIFTING MAP of where energy comes from has defined much of the character of our world. When people used whale oil for indoor lighting, Nantucket was a bustling center of commerce. Coal drove the rise of places like Newcastle upon Tyne in England and Centralia in Pennsylvania—and then powered the industrial and geographic expansion of the United States. Oil helped fund the creation of Texas and California. Since then, fossil fuels have shaped the development of countries around the world, especially in the Middle East.\n\nThe energy debate we aren't having (but should be)\n\nAir Boomtown: Why the skies over Williston, North Dakota, are dark with Gulfstreams and Dassault Falcons\n\nThe nation’s largest natural gas producer discusses the ‘ocean’ of untapped product available in North America.\n\nRight now, the map of who sells and who buys oil and natural gas is being radically redrawn. Just a few years ago, imported oil made up nearly two-thirds of the United States’ annual consumption; now it’s less than half. Within a decade, the U.S. is expected to overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to regain its title as the world’s top energy producer. Countries that have never had an energy industry worth mentioning are on the brink of becoming major players, while established fossil fuel powerhouses are facing challenges to their dominance. We are witnessing a shift that heralds major new opportunities—and dangers—for individual nations, international politics and economics, and the planet.\n\nOil is perhaps the only commodity used, in one way or another, by almost everyone on earth. We depend on it for much more than just gasoline. Oil and natural gas provide the raw materials for asphalt, plastics, and chemicals and fertilizers without which modern agriculture would collapse. To say that we’re “addicted” to oil, as though it were a bad habit we could kick through force of will, is to drastically understate the degree of our dependence. In short: no petroleum, no modern civilization.\n\nLittle surprise, then, that practically since we started using the stuff, we have fretted that we were running out of it. In 1922, a federal commission predicted that “production of oil cannot long maintain its present rate.” In 1977, President Jimmy Carter declared that world oil production would peak by 1985.\n\nIt turns out, though, that the problem has never been exactly about supply; it’s always been about our ability to profitably tap that supply. We human beings have consumed, over our entire history, about a trillion barrels of oil. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there is still seven to eight times that much left in the ground. The oil that’s left is just more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to get to. But that sets the invisible hand of the market into motion. Every time known reserves start looking tight, the price goes up, which incentivizes investment in research and development, which yields more sophisticated technologies, which unearth new supplies—often in places we’d scarcely even thought to look before.\n\nON THE VAST CONCRETE PLAIN OF THE SHIPYARD at Angra dos Reis, Brazil, workers on bicycles scurry among warehouses, cranes, and machine shops. A bright yellow gantry 18 stories tall, luminous against a leaden gray sky, grinds along steel tracks. The hills surrounding the port are swathed in green jungle foliage. But down here by the water, it’s a purely industrial scene, machines working on an incomprehensibly vast scale.\n\nFrom a slipway jutting into the Atlantic, Amit Tomar climbs six flights of scaffolding to the deck of the Cidade de São Paulo, a red and black ship measuring 1,000 feet in length—the size of a keeled-over skyscraper. On this June day, it is ascramble with workers tightening bolts and welding pipes. Tomar, a trim native of India with a bright smile and brisk manner, is the São Paulo’s second-in-command. The workers are readying the ship for what will likely be its final mission.\n\nThe São Paulo took to the water in 1992 as an oil tanker—basically just a gigantic bucket with a motor attached—ferrying crude from port to port. Now Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company, is just about finished converting the ship to a floating industrial plant. Soon, the $1.2 billion craft will be towed out and anchored at a spot nearly 200 miles from shore. A battery of pipes along the ship’s sides will pull 120,000 barrels of crude per day from beneath more than three miles of ocean, rock, and solid salt.\n\nThe floating fossil-fuel factory Cidade de São Paolo headed for deepwater (PHOTO: PETROBRAS NEWS AGENCY)\n\nOnce anchored, the São Paulo will take two days to reach by supply ship. Between shifts, the 60-odd crew members will have little to do besides hang around their Spartan dorms and a windowless recreation room equipped with some dark vinyl couches, a few board games, a TV, and a PlayStation 3.\n\nTomar has spent as long as 11 months at sea in such conditions. This job should be easy by comparison—six weeks at a stretch on the ship and then six weeks off. “That way we get a business-class ticket to go home,” he says. That’s a nice perk, but it’s still a pretty brutal commute. Why travel all the way from India to Brazil for a job? Tomar’s answer is straightforward: “Because of money.”\n\nThere is a lot of that to be made here these days. Long a marginal player in the world energy market, Brazil is on track to become one of the world’s top fossil fuel producers. There are billions of barrels of oil deep beneath its seas—oil that couldn’t even be found, let alone accessed, until recently. There’s so much down there that when the first major field was tapped, then-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared it proved that “God is Brazilian.”\n\nIf fossil fuel strikes are a way to judge God’s citizenship, the Good Lord must carry several passports. Huge subsea gas fields have been discovered in recent years off the coasts of Tanzania, Mozambique, and other impoverished countries in Africa and South America. Oil companies are sniffing around for more from Cuba to the U.S. Atlantic coast to the South China Sea, which is believed to hold as much as 200 billion barrels of oil.\n\nOil companies have been drilling in shallow waters for decades, but only in recent years have they been able to get to serious depths. In 1992 there was just one well in the Gulf of Mexico deeper than 5,000 feet; by 2008 there were 465. Just three years after the Deepwater Horizon blowout, drilling in the gulf is back in full swing, supplying nearly a quarter of all U.S. oil and still growing. Around the world, deepwater oil production has quadrupled in the last decade, bringing millions of barrels a day to the market.\n\nFormer Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is happy to get his hands dirty with the nation’s new petroleum (PHOTO: FELIPE DANA/AP/CORBIS)\n\nYou can see the impact of all this in many parts of Brazil, but perhaps nowhere more than in Rio de Janeiro. As we crest an overpass over downtown, my taxi driver points out a palatial hotel undergoing renovations. “Eike!” he says with a grin. That would be speedboat-racing, Playboy model–marrying Eike Batista, who has in the last few years gone from being a merely wealthy mining entrepreneur to the seventh spot on Forbes’s list of the world’s wealthiest people, thanks mainly to his OGX Petróleo e Gás, Brazil’s biggest private oil company. Even after a spate of recent business reversals, he’s still worth an estimated $13 billion. Renovating Rio’s historic Hotel Gloria is one of his hobby projects.\n\nThe northern end of Rio, far from the famous beaches of Copacabana, is all factories and shipyards, thrumming with men and machines servicing the oil industry. Drilling platforms in for repairs hulk along the shoreline. A little ways inland is a sprawling airport-sized building that, with its curvilinear lines, tubular corridors, and off-white palette, looks like a cross between a Dubai shopping mall and a set from Logan’s Run. This is the new $700 million headquarters of CENPES, the research arm of Petrobras. The center officially opened in 2010, but still isn’t quite finished on this day last summer. The top floor, open on all sides to allow in breezes and a view of the bay, is meant for relaxed meetings and thinking, but it still lacks furniture. Once complete, the complex will house more than 100 labs and some 4,000 employees.\n\nBrazil has operated shallow offshore wells since the 1970s. But it was only in 2006 that exploratory drills first hit the massive “presalt” reservoirs—so named because they lie underneath a thick band of salt left behind by an evaporated prehistoric ocean.\n\nPetrobras found the hydrocarbons beneath the presalt thanks to a series of breakthroughs in seismic sensing. That process involves sending ships out to sea towing miles-long sensor-equipped cables and air guns that blast out sound pulses. Those pulses reverberate through the seabed and bounce back to the cables’ sensors, providing images of the various layers of rock down below. For years this technique yielded only a two-dimensional picture. But in the 1990s, geophysicists figured out how to send the outbound signals from different angles at the same time and reassemble the results into a three-dimensional picture. In the subsequent decades computer power and software got good enough to understand all that data.\n\nBut salt adds extra complications. It distorts the signals that bounce back, forcing Petrobras’ engineers to develop new algorithms to compensate. It took Petrobras more than two years to analyze the information from their first 3-D seismic surveys of the presalt fields to figure out what was down there.\n\nNow, the company estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil just in the fields discovered so far. The total amount under the salt could be three times that much, a reserve rivaling Libya’s.\n\nImproving those seismic-sensing techniques is one of CENPES’ core tasks. But finding oil is only the first challenge. Bringing it up is also a fantastically complex process. Each step requires intensive research and custom-built hardware. When you drive a drill deep into the earth, for instance, the earth resists. The drill’s path has to be lubricated. Cuttings have to be pushed back up the borehole to the surface. To do all that, the drills shoot out viscous fluids called “mud.” Most muds are water based, but that can be a problem when dealing with the presalt: water could dissolve the surrounding salt and collapse the wellbore. So CENPES has a 20-person team working on custom mud. “We’re always trying to find ways to drill faster,” says Rosana Lomba, the cheery chemical engineer who heads the team. “Time is money—much money.” The steel countertops of her white-walled lab are covered with blenderlike machines that test and measure various fluids. Her staff spend their days tweaking formulas—a little barium sulfate to increase density here, a little xanthan gum to boost viscosity there—to find the optimum combinations for each oil field’s particular geology.\n\nThe presalt is too complicated and expensive for any outfit to handle alone. Most fields are being tapped by consortia of companies. Accordingly, Brazil is rolling out the red carpet to encourage private companies to partner up with Petrobras. Not far from the cenpes facility, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro oversees a huge new technology park devoted mainly to energy research. In one corner is the LabOceano, an 82-foot-deep indoor pool—the world’s deepest ocean simulator. Why so deep? “Because Brazil’s oil is so deep,” says executive director Paulo de Tarso Themistocles Esperança. The $30 million pool’s wave and wind generators test how boats will cope with storms and currents, and make sure they’ll stay connected to equipment on the seafloor. In fact, a six-foot model of a São Paulo–style production ship floats on the pool’s surface. But apparently there are no storms forecast for today; instead, a hard-hatted worker paddles by in a rubber dinghy, dwarfing the model like something from a Monty Python cartoon.\n\nElsewhere around the park are a scattering of construction sites. The world’s biggest oil services companies—Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes—are building their own research centers. These are the outfits the major oil companies—including Petrobras—hire to build and operate the drilling and production machinery. One of the biggest is U.S.–based FMC Technologies, which has a factory on the outskirts of Rio where 1,600 workers crank out control modules and multivalved wellheads. FMC plans to expand this factory into a neighboring lot, doubling its size.\n\nFMC also has a facility in the technology park, so new that you can count the oil stains on the parking lot’s white bricks. Inside one of the angular, modernist buildings is a photo that stretches from floor to ceiling. It shows nothing but a sunlit, open sea. Across the bottom are the words Our Vision. “The current scheme of operations is 50 years old,” says Paulo Couto, a vice president of technology. “You put a floating city in the middle of the ocean, and then you pump out the oil just like you do on land. You have to provide power, housing, sewerage, food, helicopters, and equipment. It’s expensive and difficult. Helicopters crash. Boats sink. There are hurricanes and accidents.” It’s also inefficient. The crude has to be pulled up all the way to the surface, and the intermingled natural gas, water, and sand have to be separated out and disposed of. FMC wants to do all of that on the seafloor instead. “Our task is to put the city on the bottom of the ocean,” Couto says. Divers wouldn’t survive a minute at such depths, so everything will have to be run remotely, using undersea robots to position and repair equipment. It sounds audacious. Then again, just last year FMC installed a 500-ton underwater oil and gas separator, the first of its kind, atop one of Brazil’s subsea fields. “We are not far from this vision,” says Couto, “maybe 15 years.”\n\nDrawing oil from under the ocean, of course, is staggeringly expensive. Drilling a single well can cost as much as $100 million. It only makes sense to do that in a world where oil fetches at least $50 a barrel. As recently as 2002, it was only $20 a barrel.\n\nBut prices have risen dramatically in the last decade. They have been averaging well above $80 a barrel for the last couple of years. That’s partly due to ever-increasing demand from developing nations and partly due to political factors (such as fears that Iran’s nuclear ambitions could cause serious turmoil in the Persian Gulf). But the price rise is also partly due to another kind of technology: computer algorithms that enable quantitative hedge funds to place thousands of ultrafast buy and sell orders, a practice known as high-frequency trading, which came into widespread use with oil futures in the middle of the last decade. No less an authority than Rex Tillerson, head of ExxonMobil, told Congress in 2011 that such speculation is a key reason why the price of a barrel of oil has stayed so high.\n\nSUSPENDED FROM A PLATFORM several stories above the North Dakota prairie, a roaring, mud-stained, 1,500-horsepower motor spins a steel rod as thick as a softball bat in an endless pirouette. The rod continues down through about 30 feet of metal housing and then into the ground. Below the earth, the drill extends for a distance almost twice as long as the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nInside an adjoining control room, a fleshy operator whose hard hat identifies him as Chuck reclines in a chair surrounded by seven swing-mounted monitors, looking like the king of all video gamers as he tracks the drill’s progress. It goes about two miles straight down, then turns sideways for another mile. It’s now chewing its way, at 110 feet per hour, through a second horizontal mile of solid rock. The purpose: preparing all that rock to be hydraulically fractured—a process better known as fracking.\n\nFracking is about as popular with the general public as puppy kicking, but it’s very big business. It’s producing so much natural gas from shale fields in Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere that the commodity’s price has cratered, dropping from over $10 per thousand cubic feet five years ago to about $3.25 today.\n\nFracking can also produce oil, which is the main target in North Dakota. As many as 200 new wells are being drilled every month in the state to exploit the Bakken formation, a 25,000-square-mile subterranean swath extending into Montana and Canada that may contain hundreds of billions of barrels.\n\nEnergy companies have known for decades that shale rock formations, such as the Bakken, hold huge amounts of hydrocarbons. The problem was getting them out. In conventional oil- or gas-bearing rock, the hydrocarbon molecules flow through pores in the stone into a well like seawater seeping into a hole dug on a sandy beach. But shale formations are so dense that the oil and gas can’t flow through them.\n\nRock’s permeability is measured in a unit called the darcy. Lance Langford, a thickset Texan who heads the Bakken operations of Statoil, Norway’s national energy company, tells me that the typical rock the company deals with in its home country is around one darcy. Statoil now owns hundreds of wells in North Dakota. Here, the “perm” of the Bakken’s oil-bearing dolomite ranges down into the nanodarcies—literally millions of times less permeable. “It’s like cement,” says Langford. He shows me a sample, a cylinder of deep gray stone the size of my forearm. It’s heavy as a cinder block. When I put my nose up to it, I can smell the sharp meaty tang of hydrocarbons.\n\nA Statoil rig drives a drill into the earth for a distance almost twice as long as the Golden Gate Bridge. (PHOTO: CHRISTOPH MORLINGHAUS)\n\nHalliburton pioneered the use of fracking—pumping pressurized mud into wells to shatter the surrounding rock and release its hydrocarbons—back in 1947. But it was only of limited use in the conventional vertical wells of the day. In 2000, George Mitchell, a Texas energy entrepreneur, refined the technique by using a mixture of water, chemicals, and sand to crack the shale. The sand is used as a “proppant” to keep the cracks open—the pressure of the surrounding rock wants to seal them back up. Today Statoil uses perfectly round, poppy-seed-size gray balls of a man-made, aluminum-based ceramic—2.5 million pounds of it per well, supplied from 40-foot-high silos that stud the wind-scoured prairie. The artificial proppant costs three times as much as sand, but keeps the fractures open longer.\n\nMitchell’s key innovation, though, was marrying fracking to the rapidly developing technology of horizontal drilling. Now, rather than punching just a single hole through a layer of shale formation, drillers could dig a well horizontally along the length of it and expose more of the gas or oil to the well.\n\nThe rest of the industry soon copied the system.\n\nEOG Resources—a company you may remember by its former name, Enron—started fracking the Bakken in 2006. Since then, North Dakota’s annual oil production has nearly quintupled to over half a million barrels a day. Last year, it overtook Alaska to become America’s second biggest oil-producing state. There’s more shale oil already coming online in Texas, and a potential mother lode in California, where—for now—environmental concerns have limited drilling. “The shale/tight oil boom in the United States is not a temporary bubble, but the most important revolution in the oil sector in decades,” says the Kennedy School study.\n\nFracking is creating an even bigger boom in the natural gas industry. American shale gas production totaled 320 billion cubic feet in 2000; in 2011, the number was 7.8 trillion. Domestically produced natural gas now provides 95 percent of all U.S. needs.\n\nAll of this amounts to an economic bonanza, generating hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide (though the areas where the drilling is actually taking place don’t always get the benefits they expect, as Lisa Margonelli explains in \"The Energy Debate We Aren't Having\"). Moreover, it might bring the U.S. closer to the long-held dream of energy independence. The federal Energy Information Administration predicts imports of oil and other energy supplies will drop to 13 percent of total U.S. energy use by 2035, down from 29 percent in 2007.\n\nAnd the fracking boom is only just beginning. There are believed to be oceans of yet-untapped shale gas and oil in Argentina, China, and several countries in Europe.\n\nOUTSIDE HOUSTON'S RELIANT CENTER, a chorus line of 40-foot-tall oil drilling rigs salutes the 80,000 attendees of the 2012 Offshore Technology Conference. Bedecked in primary colors and flags of many nations, the rigs look like a queue of single-minded amusement park rides. The corridors of the convention center, meanwhile, are a mosh pit of engineers in polo shirts pushed up against Nigerians in dashikis, corporate types in power suits, and Arabs in floor-length galabias. The vast exhibit halls are filled with gear from the high tech to the medieval: sophisticated electronic sensors, state-of-the-art data-processing software, and chains with links the size of my head. The male-to-female ratio looks to be about a hundred to one.\n\nAt a lectern in a spacious conference room, Uzi Landau is clearly enjoying himself. The sprightly 69-year-old—a former paratrooper, Israel’s minister of internal security during the second intifada, and presently minister in charge of Israel’s infrastructure—has come to Houston to invite the world’s energy corporations to help Israel become a fossil fuel powerhouse. “We’re an open economy, with an independent legal system,” Landau pitches the crowd. “We approach women with respect. We don’t hang homosexuals. We run things as you run them here in Houston.”\n\nThe fact that Landau is one of the speakers at this conference is a good indicator of the upheaval in the fossil fuel industry, and the impact it is having on geopolitics. An old joke: Moses must have taken a wrong turn by leading his people to the only place in the Middle East without oil. But it turns out the old prophet knew what he was doing after all. Since 2009, two colossal natural gas fields have been discovered under Israeli waters. Combined, they hold trillions of cubic feet of gas worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Production is slated to begin this year. And there is certainly more down there, perhaps much more. “Ladies, gentlemen, this is a revolution as far as Israel is concerned,” Landau says.\n\nThat seems a fair assessment. The balance of petro-power is shifting in the world’s most petro-rich—and politically volatile—region. And that could change all kinds of things in all kinds of ways.\n\nIsrael’s natural gas bounty means the country will not only get richer but also will likely become largely energy independent. Imagine what that could mean. Cheaper electricity could make it easier for Israel to build more desalination plants, easing its chronic water shortages. That increased self-sufficiency could mean Israel would have one less incentive to keep up good relations with its neighbors, especially balky frenemy Egypt, which until recently supplied a good chunk of Israel’s natural gas. Israel’s gas is already winning the country new friends elsewhere: Russia has signed agreements to get in on Israel’s offshore finds. All of this could reduce Israel’s dependence on the U.S., and therefore our political leverage over them.\n\n“Being energy independent would mean Israel could pay even less attention than it already does to international opinion,” says University of California, Los Angeles political scientist Michael Ross, an expert on the impacts of oil on nations’ political cultures. “There is strong evidence that the more oil and gas wealth a country has, the less likely it is to abide by international treaties and play by international rules.”\n\nLandau, of course, is selling the best-case scenario, in which Israeli gas promotes peace. Israel could export gas to the Palestinian territories and to Jordan and other nearby countries, which are already looking to switch to cheaper, cleaner natural gas for power generation. That could boost regional cooperation and acceptance of Israel. But the new gas fields could as easily make existing conflicts worse. Palestinians could resent having to buy Israeli gas, especially since there is also a gas field off the Gaza coast that they cannot develop. Lebanon is already shouting that some of the Mediterranean gas fields are theirs, and Hezbollah has threatened to attack Israeli offshore facilities.\n\nThe new world oil economy could bring dramatic changes to the entire Middle East. The Persian Gulf States still have unmatched resources—Saudi Arabia alone holds one-fifth of all the world’s known oil reserves—but we don’t need them like we used to. American imports from the gulf have plummeted in recent years; our top two fossil fuel providers are now Canada and Mexico. That’s partly because of increased U.S. production, and also because of a surge in imports of another recently unlocked resource—the oil sands of northern Alberta. Meanwhile, all the new oil and gas coming online worldwide will likely bring prices down. That could mean a serious cash crunch for the kings and emirs who have long depended on government handouts to keep their citizens from demanding greater freedoms, Arab Spring–style.\n\nIn fact, the new world of fossil fuels poses an uncertain future for all the major nations that dominate the current market—including Russia, Venezuela, and Iran. “There are big challenges ahead for any country that is dependent on oil,” says Citigroup managing director Ed Morse, who recently coauthored a major report on the implications of North America’s fossil fuel boom subtitled North America, the New Middle East? (pdf) “They could lead to all kinds of internal upheavals.”\n\nThe handful of new players entering the global fossil fuel scene—Mozambique, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea—are wild cards. The new wealth could lift their people out of poverty—or they could succumb to the famous “oil curse” and see the money siphoned off by corrupt elites and sparking internal conflict.\n\nOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT could happen. “In this industry people are consistently wrong with their predictions,” says Ross. “In the 1970s, everyone thought prices would be high forever and OPEC would be the world’s power broker. That all fell apart. Then in the 1990s, prices fell and everyone thought they would stay low.” So much for that.\n\nThe energy industry is affected by so many complex, interconnected factors that it’s as impossible to predict long term as the weather. Tensions in any number of places in the Middle East could explode. China could slip into a recession and see its energy consumption plummet. Another major accident in the Gulf of Mexico could shut down deepwater production in the U.S.\n\nBut one thing we do know: there are plenty of fossil fuels left. And sooner or later we’ll get to them. Human beings are not going to stop driving or using plastic. The mushrooming middle classes in China, India, and elsewhere want their cars and air conditioners, too. Petroleum consumption in China alone has doubled in the past decade, making it the world’s second largest consumer behind the U.S. In the next 20 years, barring unforeseen economic calamity, world energy demand is expected to increase by anywhere from a third to a half—and most of the increase will be met with oil and natural gas. Wind, solar, and other renewable sources have miles to go before they make up a major part of the world’s energy mix, and they are having a harder time than ever competing now that natural gas is dirt cheap.\n\nWhat’s more, the earth holds other fossil fuels we haven’t even begun to tap. Governments and corporations are researching a number of long-shot energy sources, from a not-fully cooked type of oil called kerogen to methane hydrates in the ice of Alaska.\n\nWhich brings us to the biggest unknown of all: what this new era means for our rapidly warming planet. More hydrocarbons burned on the ground means more carbon in the atmosphere, which means nastier storms, a melted Arctic, rising seas, emerging diseases, and the rest of the dismal, all-too-familiar litany.\n\nEven industry execs acknowledge that. “There’s enough oil and gas out there to last us right through to the end of the next century, without much doubt,” says David Eyton, head of research and technology at BP. The real problem, Eyton says, is that “we are running out of the carbon-carrying capacity of the atmosphere.”\n\nSo are we doomed to a future of ever-rising temperatures? Maybe. But maybe not. It’s not all bad news: in the developed world, greenhouse gas emissions may be on track to stabilize, thanks to growing efficiency and a shift toward cleaner fuels. In the U.S., energy-related carbon emissions have fallen from a peak in 2005, and are projected to rise only slightly over the next ten years. And cleaner-burning natural gas is starting to replace oil and gasoline in some industries and vehicle fleets.\n\n“We live in a world where things happen more quickly than we expect,” points out Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. Maybe we’ll figure out a means to innovate our way out of climate change, or at least slow its progress enough that we can adapt to its impacts. If there’s one thing our history with fossil fuels shows, it’s that we are unbelievably good at adapting, at finding new ways to overcome problems once thought impossible to solve.\n\nTODAY, PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE KERN RIVER oil field has been taken over by Chevron. It’s an eerie, postapocalyptic-looking place, 16 square miles that looks like it was scorched to the ground and then occupied by a mindless army of horsehead pumpjacks. They’re a motley horde, different sizes and colors and vintages, some standing still, others dipping their heads toward the earth, drawing up some 80,000 barrels of oil every day.\n\nBeneath the ground, natural gas–powered generators pump steam through a lattice of pipes into wells fitted with sensors that wirelessly transmit data on pressure, flow rates, and other crucial information to a control center, where technicians monitor it all with the help of 3-D seismic models. All of this makes it far more expensive to pull oil out of Kern River; the amount of energy that must be expended to bring up a barrel of oil has increased dramatically since the introduction of underground heating methods, according to a recent Stanford University study. But today the demand is there, and so is the supply. Chevron geologists estimate there are still 627 million barrels of oil underground.\n\nOn a small shoulder of land overlooking the actual river—the banks of which are the only swatch of green anywhere in sight—stands a whitewashed monument marking the spot where James Elwood first struck oil over a century ago. That well was plugged in 1995. But on either side of it, not 20 feet away, two yellow-headed pumpjacks are pulling up oil from deep below the ground, bobbing steadily up and down like they’re never going to stop.",

  "latent_28577": "My Twitter AMA answers / LCS Aftermath\n\nWow. Time really flies. A year ago in Sep 6th 2015, I played my last LCS game in the promotional match against Team Imagine. Had T8 won the tiebreaker for 7th place against C9, C9 would not have been able to go through that magical Gauntlet run to World, or in worse case, even get relegated (RIP Impact). The year 2015 was hands down the best and most memorable year of my life all thanks to many people & redditors supporting my decision. I just wanted to take some time to reflect and answer any question you guys might have had. Here it goes.\n\nHere are the questions that I felt many would be curious in:\n\nHow are you doing at school?\n\nMy school weekday schedule goes like this\n\n5:00AM wake up, get dressed, eat, light exercise\n\n6:00AM-6:30AM Drive to school\n\n6:30AM-8AM study at a small break-out room at school\n\n8AM-3PM go through classes\n\n3-8PM study till traffic is gone around 8PM.\n\nAfter I went through LCS, I had less distraction in mind which enabled me to focus on academics.\n\nI'm doing quite well grade-wise and also mentally. What I like about professional school is that you only focus on subjects that are practical and useful in your profession. It's quite entertaining for me to learn about nutrition, drug, and biology.\n\nDo you regret leaving right as the influx of VC$ was increasing player salaries? What do you think of the current LCS situation going on between Riot and the orgs?How much would it have taken for you to stay?\n\nIn 2015, the many of LCS player salary was close to minimum stipend given by Riot. I received $12,500 Spring '15 and $13,500 Summer '15 with every other utility/rent/food paid for by the organization. Many other bottom half LCS probably just paid same or little bit over that salary in 2015; hence, where the Sven's 5.5 Fucking K dude came out of. Currently in the LCS, although there is large gap between organizations I'd say most pros are promised at least 50K+ ranging up to 180K in NA. So salary-wise there was 100-200% increase in salary as soon as all the VC came during the winter of '15. Although it would have been nice to have had these kind of numbers as my salary, the current salary is hyper inflated compared to what revenues organizations can create given current Riot's restriction. Hypothetically, if I were offered 250k+ salary, it would definitely have made my decision to leave LCS much harder. But realistically, nobody is going to pay that much for some crap 8th place top laner :3.\n\nIf you had been offered the top lane spot on a more successful team (still love team 8), would you have taken it?\n\nI loved my teammates and the organization. We worked together from the very start of the team in a crappy house in CA, eating hotdogs (that prob cost something like 30cents per one). I probably would've stayed with the Team8, knowing I only had a year to play on the LCS stage. In the off-season between Spring '15 and Summer '15, I was in talk of buyout from WinterFox and PaiN gaming. lol.\n\nDo you feel that, as someone who has stepped away from LCS, it was something that you would recommend to someone else?\n\nIf that recommendation is to those at least Master/Challenger currently, sure why not. I really would not recommend someone lower than diamond 3 to actually give up all other responsibilities to become a League pro. Maybe look onto a newer game like OverWatch but League Pro scene is already saturated and will not have many open chances for new comers who will take a year or more to even catch up to knowledge/skill of current pros.\n\nHow were your teammates?\n\nSlooshi feels like a younger brother I never really had, mischievous, fun, friendly.\n\nDodo feels like an older brother I do not talk to regularly but was always around me as a roommate and a teammate. Awkwardly, we started off speaking English to one another when we met although we both speak Korean more comfortably, so if we meet a korean person together, we speak Korean to that other person but English to one another. It gets pretty awk... lol\n\nMaple is a self-less but emotional younger cousin that I liked to tease. He was the type of player who would give every single wave we ask for. Once slooshi was asking for the red buff as Xerath from him while he was killing it and he offers to give as a caitlyn lol. This character of his really defined T8 as Top centric team with me getting more resources as a naturally shot caller. (We never really went into a game saying let's get cali fed. It just turned out like that with Maple).\n\nPorp is like a dorky college friend who would always talk about conspiracies and illuminaties. He usually had different ideas about the game but was usually accomodating when it comes to team decision. We lost contact with him after T8. Hope he is alive and well with his twin brother in Canada.\n\nNien was one of the harder working who strived to be the best. He was open to criticism and also had more conservative and smart approach to the game.\n\nGoldenglue made me feel like I'm in the twitchchat everytime I turn left (he was sitting next to me) because he looked like Vaultboy. Cordial and fun to be around. He doesn't hesitate to make an official announcement that he fcked up when he messes up in game.\n\nBest Top Laner you played against?\n\nImpact was the best top laner back in 2015 but somehow he never really stood out on stage or in game. I'm finally happy to see him at the apex of his skill, showing how good he is. #TopDie\n\nWhat do you miss the most from when you were a pro?\n\nWaking up everyday knowing that the only thing I had in mind was League of Legends. I never really worried or thought about anything outside of League for a year as pro. More importantly, I miss the audience, stage, and fans who always supported me with kind words regardless of how shitty the outcome was.\n\nThank you for reading and best of luck to you guys for your future endeavors!! :)\n\nThree more years to go to become Doctor of Pharmacy.

  "latent_28599": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThe 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Monday that a Wisconsin law requiring abortion providers to gain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals is unconstitutional.\n\nThe law that was struck down is known as a TRAP law—short for “targeted regulation of abortion providers.” According to the Guttmacher Institute, Wisconsin is one of 11 states that have required similar admitting privileges. (Courts have blocked these requirements in six of those states.) The law is particularly effective in conservative regions where hospitals are less likely to grant those privileges to abortion providers. The law’s supporters say the law ensures continuity of care if complications arise from the procedure. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that less than one half of 1 percent of all abortions involve major complications.\n\nThe 2-to-1 decision comes at a time when the constitutionality of TRAP laws are in question nationally. Just over a week ago, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Texas’ “HB 2,” which decreased the state’s number of abortion clinics from 41 to 18 by implementing a host of TRAP laws. The ruling, due next year, will be the most notable reproductive rights ruling since Roe v. Wade.\n\nJudge Richard Posner, writing for the 7th Circuit majority, stated that the regulation qualifies as an “undue burden” and that the medical grounds for such a requirement is “nonexistent.” Posner also had some words for abortion foes: “Opponents of abortion reveal their true objectives when they procure legislation limited to a medical procedure— abortion—that rarely produces a medical emergency.”\n\nPosner—nominated by President Ronald Reagan—is known for his tart legal arguments, as we’ve noted previously. This case is no exception:",

  "latent_28716": "Beerfest (2006)\n\n“Prepare for the ultimate chug of war”\n\nDirected by Jay Chandrasekhar\n\nStarring Jay Chandrasekhar\n\nKevin Heffernan\n\nSteve Lemme\n\nPaul Soter\n\nErik Stolhanske\n\nJürgen Prochnow\n\nA lazy afternoon, raining outside and with not much on, I decided to choose a movie that had some beer related theme, so I picked the first one that came up on the googley, Beerfest\n\nThese kind of movies, “low brow comedies”, are always hit and miss. I had enjoyed “Dude, Where’s My Car?” (Even with that knob Ashton Kutcher in it) for example, but found “Euro Trip” horrendous.\n\nSo I don’t have high hopes for this movie. I am sure it will tick all the stereotype boxes as it is set in Europe in and around the time of the Oktoberfest in Germany. Lets guess there will be a lot of lederhosen and funny German names.\n\nBut let’s wait and see, to the movie……..\n\n“Bring on the beer, they’ve got the nuts”, the “hilarious” tagline on the movie poster.\n\nThe basic premise of the movie is that two brothers (Wolfhouses) travel to Munich for Oktoberfest, to spread the ashes of their believed beer drinking grandfather, only to stumble upon a secret beer competition described as a “Fight Club” with beer games. The secret beer fest is run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen (Jurgen Prochnow, of Das Boot fame), who the brothers discover is a distant relative. The baron insinuates that the brothers grandfather was a thieving stable boy who stole a famous Bavarian beer recipe, and their grandmother was nothing but a prostitute. After making an ass of themselves at the beer competition, swearing revenge and honour they return to the USA to set up an American team to do battle with all those crazy Europeans at the next beerfest.\n\nThe motley crew that is assembled is an unlikely bunch, we have a male prostitute named Barry (Jay Chandrasekhar), a man mountain called Landfill (Kevin Heffernan) and a Jewish lab nerd with a Phd in beer, Fink (Steve Lemme), and the two Wolfhouses brothers, Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd (Erik Stolhanske). The five team members, are known as the “Broken Lizard,” comedy writing group, who have made a few similar movies of this ilk in the past. A lot of the movie is focused on This Magnificent five training hard for this fest, and those sneaky Germans trying to recover the stolen recipe. The movie ends with the ultimate battle of beer games between the Americans and the “krauts”, all rounded off in the “Das Boot” (Boot of beer) challenge!\n\nOf course with Jurgen Prochnow we get a lot of Das Boot references, and Donald Sutherland guests at the start, as the Wolfhouses grandfather who drinks himself to death, while Willie Nelson also makes a silly pot related cameo in the end.\n\nThe movie scored a low enough 41% on the Rotten Tomatoes site, with an average rating of 5/10, but it did make a small profit at the box office taking just over $19 million in the US, from a budget of $17,500,000, thus cornering the frat boy beer swilling market for that year!\n\nSo is the movie any good?\n\nI have to be honest I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did. The story is good for what it is, and I didn’t have to use up too many of my precious brain cells figuring out any plot lines here, but all the characters are pretty damn funny, and the movie is a good laugh. I really don’t get why it has got mostly negative reviews as for me, a drinker who likes the craic, there were definite moments in the movie that I could relate to, and some of the beer references were spot on.\n\nThe opening scene is a cracker. A can of beer cracked open, a bottle filled, the can chucked on ground. Classy, with the added on advisory to not to try and copy any of the drinking stunts at home, “Dont drink this much! If you attempt to drink this much, you will die!”\n\nOverall, the characters are quite likable, and Yes I was actually rooting for the American beer drinking team (Go USA!). Most of the gang are drunk all the time, and most scenes are set in bars or drinking parties, so whats not to like? Inebriation all around: lots of falling down, hangovers, vomiting, beer conquests, beer games, beer fights, and tits, and lots of them.\n\nThe acting is pretty good too from all involved, with Kevin Heffernan and Jay Chandrasekhar putting in star performances.\n\nThe Germans (the “krauts”) are portrayed as angry, all the time, which is always funny, that and the way they use English: “It was ze greatest beer in all ze world!” I am sorry but that never gets tiring! (and I am currently learning German!)\n\nOf course some scenes are silly. There is one scene with a frog and wanking, which is beyond moronic, and Landfill’s brother joining the gang just makes no sense at all.\n\nFound the “different stages of drink” (drink, fight, singing, hangover, drink again) was brilliantly done, and the training tool on how to drink like the Germans was amusing, but the highlight of the movie for me was Barry’s conquest after a night on the town. Hilarious. And he didn’t give a shit! Just the way I like it!\n\nA movie called BeerFest, well its not Hamlet, (actually that would be a good tagline!), you know exactly what you are going to get…..people guzzling vast quantities of beer, getting wasted, acting the maggot, and with a bit of nudity and puking thrown in, yeah that’s all good for me.\n\nIts stupid, but its fun stupid, plus I was drinking when I watched it!

  "latent_29041": "While many in the St. Louis area are talking about Valdimir Tarasenko and Jaden Schwartz about being the future of the St. Louis Blues, their success will depend on the players around them.\n\nFor Vladimir Tarasenko success will depend on how quickly he will be able to adapt. His entire career has been spent in Russia playing a different kind of game on larger ice. If Tarasenko is able to adapt to the more physical place with less space, he should be a star quickly, but his play will still depend on the players around him. Andy McDonald and Alex Steen will be playing with the young prospect and will make sure that he is given every opportunity to make the most of his career. Steen and McDonald’s speed and hockey intelligence will be key to helping Tarasenko take off this year. With people talking about Calder possibilities, Tarasenko is often overlooked due to the promise of two to three other players, but don’t be surprised to hear more and more about Tarasenko in the coming weeks and months. I would expect Tarasenko to put up decent numbers this season, but expect a total of somewhere near to 30 points if he can stay healthy. A point-per-game player in the KHL, Tarasenko will still need time to adapt to the North American culture and the NHL game. Look to next season for Tarasenko to have a huge breakout season.\n\nJaden Schwartz has been playing in Peoria during the lockout and it seems to have paid off quite a bit. While many weren’t sure if Schwartz would be able to crack the St. Louis Blues lineup, Schwartz came to camp and surprised Coach Hitchcock with his play. Hitchcock has Jaden Schwartz on a line with Patrik Berglund and Chris Stewart, so it appears that Schwartz will be asked to be the finesse on that line while Berglund and Stewart use their bodies to open up opportunities on the ice. Although Schwartz made the starting lineup out of camp, the St. Louis Blues were forced to place Chris Porter on waivers to send him back down to Peoria. So, while we wait until official news comes that Porter cleared waivers, the St. Louis Blues have reassigned Jaden Schwartz to Peoria, per Norm Sanders:\n\nBlues assigned Schwartz to PEO on Friday waiting for Porter to clear waivers. if Porter clears today Schwartz is back on roster #stlblues — Norm Sanders (@NormSanders) January 19, 2013\n\nHowever, news just came in at 11am that Chris Porter has cleared waivers, so he will be in the lineup for the St. Louis Blues tonight!\n\nFor now, Blues fans, we will have to wait to see what these two great prospects will be able to do, we can only say one thing:\n\nLET’S GO BLUES!\n\n-Alex Hodschayan",

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 5 years old\n\nState coroner’s original order upheld after constable refuses to give evidence at inquest into death of Elijah Holcombe\n\nA New South Wales police officer who shot dead a mentally ill young man and then refused to testify at his inquest must now give evidence after he lost an appeal.\n\nEarlier this year, Senior Constable Andrew Rich refused to enter the witness box at the Sydney inquest into the death of 24-year-old Elijah Holcombe.\n\nRich shot Holcombe dead in a laneway at Armidale in northern NSW on 2 June 2, 2009, after Holcombe allegedly threatened him with a bread knife.\n\nHolcombe, who suffered from paranoid delusions and was afraid of police, had not committed any crime and had checked himself out of hospital earlier that morning.\n\nThe inquest has heard Rich chased after Holcombe and fired his weapon within seconds of ordering Holcombe to put the knife down.\n\nRich's assertion that he shot Holcombe in self-defence was bolstered by a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) last year not to charge him over the shooting.\n\nWhen an inquest into Holcombe's death resumed before NSW state coroner Mary Jerram in March this year, however, Rich refused to give evidence.\n\nHe cited several reasons, including that the Commissioner of Police might take action against him, that he might face civil liability over Holcombe's death or the DPP might use his evidence to pursue a case against him.\n\nJerram ordered Rich to give evidence, saying the shooting of a mentally ill young man was \"sadly, not an isolated incident\".\n\n\"Questions arise inevitably of whether police are being sufficiently trained in and made aware of the discrete needs of mentally ill persons and methods of dealing with them,\" Jerram said in her judgment last April.\n\n\"Was Senior Constable Rich aware that Elijah had not been scheduled under the Mental Health Act and had left the hospital voluntarily?\n\n\"Did Senior Constable Rich believe that he had a right ... to detain Elijah and return him to the hospital?\n\n\"If not, why did he chase after Elijah?\n\n\"These are significant issues which require further exploration.\"\n\nRich appealed against the coroner's decision in the Supreme Court, which dismissed his case in July.\n\nHe then took his case to the Court of Appeal but in a judgment handed down on Monday, the three-judge panel found Jerram had properly considered the question of risk from Rich's potential evidence.\n\nThey dismissed the constable's appeal and the inquest into Holcombe's death is expected to resume next year.",

  "latent_29714": "This is the final part of an eight-part series of articles, The Prudes’ Progress, about non-objectifying, woman-identified sexuality based on ideas of equality and whole-personhood, in the tradition of lesbian feminism. For the first article in the series, which includes a table of contents, please click here. The articles don’t have to be read in order and contain many backwards and forwards links so you can follow them in whatever way is most useful for you.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEvery feminist work should be prepared to answer the question, “What contribution does this make towards a broad-based, international movement for the ending of sexist oppression?” (credit to bell hooks’ Feminist Theory: from margin to center for fixing this question in my mind). I have four justifications for this piece:\n\nThe first is that politically-minded sexual and emotional joy can be a powerful source of energy within feminist movement. For a movement to be Self-sustaining it must also replenish us. Feminist desire can both heal and motivate us within the feminist struggle, and so it contributes to feminist movement.\n\nThe second is that sexual misery, degradation and violence are not just the forces we’re opposing, they are realities in our lives and living with them can leave us exhausted and unable to join in feminist organising. In writing up this Progress I’ve aimed not only to reveal some aspects of how sexual degradation functions, but to chart a positive movement away from it. To the extent that we can free our lives from sexual degradation, we’re also freer to participate more fully in a broader movement.\n\nThe third is one I’ve stated throughout but I’ll repeat it here: The Prudes’ Progress naturally brings us into conflict with the forces of woman-hating, because while an isolated few individual women may be allowed to discover feminist desire under the current system, women as a class are not. Our collective Progress will inevitably create very concrete encounters with many of the structures we need to dismantle. If we were travelling individually, each of us would certainly skip over some of these encounters, as her privileges gave her a “free pass”. But Progressing together means that we are all bound to fight for all of us. We’ll still miss many of the issues, but this way we’ll catch more than we otherwise would. And so it makes our feminism wiser.\n\nThe fourth is that some women will encounter too many barriers to continue the Progress right now. This is likely to be more the case the more and more powerful forms of oppression a woman faces in her life. It may be that the situations of many women just don’t allow for this Progress. If that’s the case, we have to know that and, when we list the ways in which classist and sexist oppression, or racist and sexist oppression intersect and create new oppressions, we have to be able to include, “and they make it difficult or impossible to realise feminist desire!”. But despite the fact that women first mapped the paths decades ago, the route of the Progress is so covered over right now that I think very few women know either way whether this Progress is possible for them, and how systems of oppression affect that. And so it makes our understanding of sexist and other forms of oppression wider.\n\nTo sum up, every stage of this Prudes’ Progress has been about closing distance and re-membering the erotic. After orienting ourselves, this was done most generally in the form of Self-love and the love of others’ Selves, more specifically with regard to general mechanisms of objectification as we look to treat all women as subjects, more specifically still with regard to the love of dominance which lingers as we contemplate and undo our remaining fetishes and then most precisely when it comes to creating spaces of safety and then within them Kindling friendship and feminist desire between Progressing Prudes.\n\nThe task of re-membering feminist desire is to re-verse the ways our Selves are covered over by femininity, pornotypes and fetishes and held apart by distance, to bring those Selves closer and create the possibility for a more genuine encounter. To become, in Mary Daly’s words from Pure Lust , “women-touching women”.\n\nI want to end this piece with two longer quotes which I wasn’t able to integrate elsewhere in the text. The first is from Rebecca Whisnant, an anti-pornography feminist, and the second is from Audre Lorde, who I’ve quoted extensively elsewhere in this piece.\n\nTo open up the space for new thinking and experimentation, we need to detox, to get out of the path of the porn culture’s cynical, manipulative, and hateful messages. To start thinking our own thoughts and dreaming our own dreams, first we have to get away from the bastards who are shouting at us through megaphones. Second, we need to draw on our own experiences of love and sex as joy and communion (and encourage others to draw on theirs). As radical feminists have long emphasized, patriarchy constructs our sexuality very profoundly, and even the most enlightened among us are not immune to that construction. But the construction, for most people at least, does not go “all the way down.” Despite everything, many people do have experiences of mutual and egalitarian sexuality – or at least hints or glimmers of it – and that’s really good news. We need to encourage people to tap into these experiences, hints, and glimmers – to remember what they know from their own lives, that no pimp or corporation sold to them or ever could, and to want more of it. As we continue to tell people what sexual freedom isn’t, we should also encourage them to think deeply and creatively about what it is. What would real sexual freedom look and feel like – the kind that everyone can have, instead of the kind that amounts to freedom for some at others’ expense? We need to richly imagine, and encourage others to richly imagine, another world: one in which no woman or girl is ever called “slut,” “prude,” “bitch,” “cunt,” or “dyke”; in which no woman, man, or child ever has to fear rape or suffer its damage to their spirits; in which men do not control their own and other men’s behavior by the threat of being seen and treated as women; and in which lesbian [sic: bisexual women’s love for women is also reduced this way] love and connection is not reduced to a pornographic fetish for men. In this world, every woman and girl sees her own body as beautiful, no man or boy is made to see his as a weapon, and people take part in sexual activity only when (and only because) they expect to enjoy it and to be honored and fulfilled therein. It can be painful to think in this way, because we become more acutely aware of just how far away we are from this better world. But the third wave has one thing right: desire can be, or can become, a form of power. We need to use the power of our desire for this world – our desire to bring it into being for ourselves and for our children and our grandchildren – to unite us and to animate our thinking and strategizing about how to take our culture back from the pornographers.\n\nRebecca Whisnant, Contemporary Feminism in a Porn Culture\n\nThe erotic cannot be felt secondhand. As a Black lesbian feminist, I have a particular feeling, knowledge, and understanding for those sisters with whom I have danced hard, played, or even fought. This deep participation has often been the forerunner for joint concerted actions not possible before. But this erotic charge is not easily shared by women who continue to operate under an exclusively european-american male tradition. I know it was not available to me when I was trying to adapt my consciousness to this mode of living and sensation. Only now, I find more and more women-identified women brave enough to risk sharing the erotic’s electrical charge without having to look away, and without distorting the enormously powerful and creative nature of that exchange. Recognizing the power of the erotic within our lives can give us the energy to pursue genuine change within our world, rather than merely settling for a shift of characters in the same weary drama. For not only do we touch our most profoundly creative source, but we do that which is female and self-affirming in the face of a racist, patriarchal and anti-erotic society.\n\nAudre Lorde, Sister Outsider, Uses of the Erotic (Quality Paperback Book Club collected edition, 1993), p59\n\nAppendix: A Bibliography of Feminist Desire (Dis-covering Women’s Words)\n\nNot all the books and articles referenced here are about feminist desire, but all of them are either quoted in the piece or otherwise relevant. I don’t endorse every part of every resource mentioned here, in particular some parts of Daly’s Gyn/Ecology , particularly where it covers transsexuality and non-Anglo/American patriarchy. Conspicuously absent from the list is Daly’s Pure Lust . Reading and incorporating Daly’s insights on this subject was too large a task for this series, so Pure Lust , my copy of which only arrived late in writing this, is waiting on my shelf as a treat for once this series is published. I expect it to heavily inform my future thoughts, wellbeing and practice on my next spiral movement around the Prudes’ Progress.\n\nSo, sister, perhaps I’ll see you there.\n\nBooks and Journal Articles\n\nLinda Bacon, Health At Every Size (BenBella Books, 2010)\n\n(BenBella Books, 2010) Sandra Lee Bartky, Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression (Routledge, 1990)\n\n(Routledge, 1990) Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape (Simon & Schuster, 1975)\n\n(Simon & Schuster, 1975) Patricia Hill Collins, Black Feminist Thought (Second Edition) (Routledge, 2000)\n\n(Routledge, 2000) Mary Daly, Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism (The Women’s Press, 1979)\n\n(The Women’s Press, 1979) Angela Y Davis, Women, Culture and Politics (The Women’s Press, 1990)\n\n(The Women’s Press, 1990) Andrea Dworkin, Woman Hating (Plume, 1974)\n\n(Plume, 1974) Andrea Dworkin, Right-Wing Women (Perigee Books, 1983)\n\n(Perigee Books, 1983) Andrea Dworkin, Intercourse (Arrow Books, 1988)\n\n(Arrow Books, 1988) Shiri Eisner, Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution (Seal Press, 2013) (not yet generally available as of this series’ publication)\n\n(Seal Press, 2013) (not yet generally available as of this series’ publication) Sarah J.

  "latent_29735": "In a recent interview with George Stephanopoulos, Congressman Paul Ryan said that he had a basic philosophical difference with the Democrats: he believes that rights come from God while they think rights come from the government. Setting aside the question of whether this distinction is fair, I think it captures the source of the visceral rage of Teavangelicals who have made Paul Ryan their hero. They have defined their battlefield as a contest between Christianity and secular humanism, God vs. government. Government support programs for the poor have to be wasteful, enabling, and unfair, or else God would lose His relevance. While I understand this fear, it’s very problematic from a Biblical perspective.\n\nGod cares immensely whether or not our society takes care of its most vulnerable members and whether it provides a means for kids growing up in disadvantage to have an equal opportunity to succeed. If all people are indeed “created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, ” then any politician who fears God should create laws that respect what God desires for the widows and orphans He loves. I have seen a lot of hysteria being posted by Christians online in reaction to the health care ruling and election year politics. I wanted to share several reasons I don’t see any Christian basis for being offended by the “socialism” so many Christians express their outrage about.\n\n1) We’re supposed to be saved from meritocracy\n\nThe most fundamental concept of evangelical Christianity is the doctrine of justification by faith. Our salvation is not something we can earn, but only receive as a gift. Ephesians 2:8-9 provides the best summary of this concept: “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith —and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast.” We are supposed to be transformed by the gift of God’s grace; it’s supposed to start a chain reaction of grace in how we treat other people. God forgives our trespasses so that we will forgive those who trespass against us. Jesus’ message in the parable of the unmerciful servant in Matthew 18:21-35 is that receiving mercy from God and refusing to show mercy to others means rejecting God’s mercy.\n\nWhen I truly experience the complete deliverance of Christ, I come to see every aspect of my life as a gift. Having a job is a gift; being able to pay my bills is a gift; having the knowledge and skills to acquire a job is a gift. If I am mistreated, that too is a gift for the sake of my spiritual refinement. Living under grace means being liberated from meritocracy in which I think in terms of what I deserve or earn. God’s grace is supposed to set me free from a slavish devotion to making sure that I’m always treated fairly and raising a fuss if I suspect anyone of receiving a benefit they didn’t earn.\n\nPeople who get incensed about having to pay taxes for programs that help poor people who “don’t deserve help” reveal that they are still slaves to the meritocracy Jesus died to save them from. As Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 4:7, “What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?” Everything we have is a gift from God. Nothing is our property; we are only stewards of God’s property. It is reasonable to have genuine stewardship concerns about how the government spends God’s money, but any argument based on meritocracy itself has no place in Christian discourse.\n\n2) God can use the government to accomplish His purposes\n\nA lot of Teavangelicals make the argument that they have no problem helping the poor; they just want it to happen through their local megachurch and not the government. But according to the Bible, God doesn’t have a problem using government to take care of the people He wants to provide for. Paul explains in Romans 13:6, “The authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give to everyone what you owe them.” God has always worked through people and processes who don’t acknowledge His sovereignty, even a brutal pagan government like the Roman Empire. God is not in competition with any government; God rules over all governments.\n\nWhen we get bent out of shape about our taxes being involuntary unlike the church offering plate and distributing our money in ways that we cannot personally oversee, then our concern is about our individual sovereignty and not God’s. What right do we have to tell God He can’t bless a single mother who’s been crying out to Him for help through the WIC or SNAP food assistance programs because we want to be the ones who hand her a bag of groceries? It is indeed a greater blessing to participate in hands-on, relational missions than to just write a check for somebody else to do the work, but God is not beholden to our need for “the right hand to know what the left hand is doing” (Matthew 6:3) as He decides how to provide for His widows and orphans.\n\n3) The market is no less vulnerable to idolatry and corruption than the state\n\nOur Cold War legacy is the only explanation I can find for the way that Americans see the market as “Christian” and the state as “atheist.” There is nothing inherently Christian about capitalism, though when capitalism works well, it’s because Christian values have restrained capitalists from abandoning themselves completely to greed. This restraint hasn’t seemed to take place recently, at least not in the financial sector. In 2008, we learned that if people can get away with calling lies “financial instruments, ” then they will do so to make money. It baffles me why Teavangelicals continue to maintain that the market always knows best, but then consider any “government official” to be suspicious at best and utterly diabolical at worst.\n\nSeveral members of my congregation work for government agencies. Some really enjoy their jobs and seem to have an opportunity to be effective; others are getting crushed by the pressure to produce results that fit into political “talking points” rather than dealing honestly with whatever is in front of them. I can understand the rationale for believing that a for-profit corporation will be more attentive to troubleshooting its productivity. But this is different than trusting the free market itself to behave like “nature” and provide the basis for a nation’s social equilibrium on its own.\n\nSince Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species, Western culture has been caught in a fierce debate over what counts as “natural.” Christians affirm that nature is God’s creation and that its equilibrium and order exist because God made nature that way. According to the Christian perspective, the created order was shattered when the primordial humanity represented by Adam and Eve deviated from God’s perfect equilibrium to act according to their self-interest for the first time. In contrast, the Darwinian perspective affirms not merely that life developed over the course of billions of years but that there has been no creator overseeing the development of life. Self-interest, rather than being a rebellion against God’s equilibrium, is the basis for natural equilibrium in the doctrine of survival of the fittest.\n\nThe free market is the space created in the human community by billions of acts of self-interest. Every time a person is restrained from acting in self-interest whether by government regulations or their own internal moral reservations, they are “corrupting” the purity of the market. It makes sense to embrace the market as “natural” if we have accepted the Darwinian vision for life and understand rational self-interest as the highest moral virtue, in accordance with the teachings of Paul Ryan’s favorite atheist philosopher Ayn Rand. Trusting the self-interest of millions of investors to “naturally” come up with a just solution for people without health insurance, for example, means subscribing to Darwin’s understanding of nature instead of Genesis. To say that the market needs no regulation is no less bold a claim than saying that the world doesn’t need God.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlease recognize what I have said and haven’t said. There are legitimate arguments to be made against Obamacare and any number of other political issues. But we misrepresent Christ when our arguments are based on meritocracy or the assumption that the free market is “Christian” while government-based solutions are “secular humanist.” I would much rather see solutions for poverty emerge on a local grassroots level through authentic community-building relationships. As a Christian pastor, I would much rather see people provided for both materially and spiritually as one package in the kingdom of God. But regarding those aspects of human need like health care and housing that require greater resources than even large megachurches can muster, I don’t see why Christians should fight tooth and nail to prevent God from using our secular government to provide for these needs.\n\n—-\n\nMorgan Guyton is the associate pastor of Burke United Methodist Church in Burke, Virginia, and a Christian who continues to seek God’s liberation from the prison of self-justification Jesus died to help him overcome.

(Martin Ruetschi/Keystone via AP file)\n\nLONDON (AP) — Ferdy Kuebler, who came back from injury and the interruption of World War II to win the 1950 Tour de France, has died. He was 97.\n\nThe Swiss won an epic battle with French rider Louison Bobet in the 1950 race, and became world champion the following year.\n\nAndre Haefliger, the chief reporter at Swiss magazine Schweizer Illustrierte, said from Kuebler’s home in Switzerland on Friday that he could confirm the death on behalf of Kuebler’s widow, Christina. Kuebler died Thursday at a Zurich hospital. He had been suffering from a cold.\n\nSwitzerland’s national cycling association, Swiss Cycling, paid tribute to Kuebler and offered its condolences to his family. “We are taking leave of one of the greatest cycling legends of our time,” it wrote on its website.\n\nFor many, his biggest achievement was winning the Fleche Wallonne and Liege-Bastogne-Liege races, then held on successive days, in both 1951 and 1952.\n\nIn an era of marathon races on poor roads, Kuebler also won the 1953 Bordeaux-to-Paris after 570 kilometers (356 miles) and more than 14 hours in the saddle.\n\nBorn July 24, 1919, into a poverty-stricken family near Zurich, Kuebler knew as a child that he wanted to be a professional cyclist.\n\nForced as a teenager to find work to support his family, he got a job delivering bread by bicycle.\n\n“I had to climb the mountain up to four times a day. That was how I trained for my career. I told myself: one day you will be a cyclist,” Kuebler said in a 2003 television documentary.\n\nLater, as a Zurich office worker, Kuebler cycled the 100-kilometer (63-mile) round trip from home.\n\nWorld War II broke out as he was starting to make his name as a cyclist. Kuebler was drafted into the Swiss army.\n\n“I lost five or six of my best years,” he said.\n\nAn accident in 1946 that hospitalized him for two months almost ended his postwar career.\n\nHe came back in 1947 and started his first Tour, aged 28. He won the first stage, becoming the first post-war wearer of the famed yellow jersey.\n\nIn 1950, third-placed Kuebler took over the race lead when Italy’s team of riders withdrew, accusing spectators of assaulting them.\n\nHe finished the 4,773 kilometers (2,983 miles) 9 minutes, 30 seconds ahead of Belgium’s Stan Ockers, with Bobet third.\n\nKuebler chose not to race another Tour until 1954. He finished second, behind Bobet.\n\nAfter retiring at age 38, Kuebler trained as a ski instructor and worked on the Swiss slopes for 25 winters. In summer he did publicity for the Tour de Suisse and traveled with the race as an official for 35 years.\n\nKuebler said there was never any other career for him except cycling.\n\n“I always said if I came back to earth — which I hope will happen — I would be a cyclist again,” he said.",

Cavusoglu says a \"deep state\" in Germany is working to prevent Turkish leaders from campaigning to get Turks living in Germany to vote 'yes' in an upcoming referendum to increase the president's powers. Cavusoglu made the comments Friday, a day after local authorities in southwest Germany withdrew a permission for the Turkish justice minister to use a venue for a political rally. (AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Tensions flared between Ankara and Berlin on Friday over the cancellation of two Turkish Cabinet members’ rallies in Germany, and the ongoing detention in Turkey of a German newspaper reporter.\n\nDelivering a speech in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan alleged the Die Welt newspaper journalist was both a German spy and a “representative” of the outlawed Kurdish rebel group, PKK.\n\nErdogan lashed out at Germany and accused Berlin of harboring him for a month at the German Consulate in Istanbul before agreeing to hand him over to authorities.\n\n“They need to be put on trial for aiding and abetting terrorism,” Erdogan said.\n\nAn upcoming referendum to increase the Turkish president’s powers has been another flash point. Earlier Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke out against Germany over the canceled rallies, saying forces within the German state were working to prevent Turkish leaders from campaigning there for a “yes” vote.\n\nGerman Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer responded that the federal government had nothing to do with the cancellations, and suggested Turkish officials voicing their irritation in the press was in “nobody’s interest” and simply “pouring oil onto the fire.”\n\nThe German and Turkish foreign ministers appeared to tone down the rhetoric later in the day after a telephone conversation during which Cavusoglu relayed Turkey’s “unease” over the cancellation of the Turkish justice and economy ministers’ campaign programs, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nIt said the two ministers agreed to meet on March 8 in Germany. Gabriel’s office called it a “constructive and engaged” conversation.\n\nErdogan however, re-escalated tensions hours later, saying Turkey would continue to criticize Germany.\n\n“They are telling us, ‘Why are you whipping up the issue?’” Erdogan said. “Just you wait, we have only just started. We are going to expose all that you have done in several international meetings.”\n\nGermany’s Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, dismissed Erdogan’s claim that Yucel is a spy as “absurd.”\n\nRelations already were strained between the two countries over Germany’s criticism of Erdogan’s crackdown following a failed coup as a flow of Turkish diplomats and soldiers sought asylum in Germany.\n\nGermany has suggested it may not extradite suspects wanted by Turkey in cases it considers politically motivated, which has prompted Erdogan to accuse Germany of having “become a shelter” for terrorists and for having no regard for other countries’ national security issues.\n\nThe growing rift has potential security implications.\n\nGermany has reconnaissance aircraft deployed at a NATO base in Turkey as part of the alliance’s fight against the Islamic State group. The European Union is also relying on Turkey to uphold a deal to stem the flow of migrants into Europe.\n\nThe Turkish leaders’ comments came the day after local authorities in southwestern Germany withdrew permission for the Turkish justice minister to use a venue for a political rally for Turks living in Germany, citing insufficient space.\n\nThe justice minister, Bekir Bozdag, canceled a meeting with his German counterpart in protest, while Turkey summoned the German ambassador seeking an explanation.\n\nRecalling previous incidents, including one last year when Erdogan was also blocked from addressing Turkish citizens, Cavusoglu said: “This has become a systematic practice of the German deep state.”\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, said the federal government was not involved in canceling Bozdag’s engagement in Gaggenau, or a separate rally in Cologne planned for Saturday with Turkey’s economy minister.\n\nCity officials said they canceled that event because organizers had misled them about its purpose, saying they were initially told it would be a theater performance.\n\nDemmer reiterated that the government has no plans to prevent Turkish officials from speaking to the 1.4 million Turkish voters in Germany. She said Germany wants to lead by example on issues of freedom of speech and opinion, but that “we respect the decisions that were taken” in Cologne and Gaggenau.\n\nDespite the cancellations, Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said he would travel to Germany on Sunday to speak at different events in the Cologne area and, if necessary, meet Turkish citizens face-to-face.\n\n“It is our duty to go to battle; victory belongs to Allah,” the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Zeybekci as saying.\n\nMunicipal officials in Leverkusen, where Zeybekci was to address a cultural association gathering, and Frechen, where he was to give opening greetings at a concert, said they had no plans to stop his appearances, Germany’s dpa news agency reported.\n\nOther German media later reported that the operator of the hall in Frechen had canceled the event.\n\nGerman officials have expressed concern about the Die Welt newspaper journalist.

  "latent_30071": "Note: this story is cross-posted at AlterNet.\n\nThe official 2012 Republican Party platform is a far-right fever dream, a compilation of pouting, posturing, and policies to meet just about every demand from the overlapping Religious Right, Tea Party, corporate, and neo-conservative wings of the GOP. If moderates have any influence in today’s Republican Party, you wouldn’t know it by reading the platform. Efforts by a few delegates to insert language favoring civil unions, comprehensive sex education, and voting rights for the District of Columbia, for example, were all shot down. Making the rounds of right-wing pre-convention events on Sunday, Rep. Michele Bachmann gushed about the platform’s right-wing tilt, telling fired-up Tea Partiers that “the Tea Party has been all over that platform.”\n\nGiven the Republican Party’s hard lurch to the right, which intensified after the election of Barack Obama, the “most conservative ever” platform is not terribly surprising. But it still didn’t just happen on its own. Here are some of the people we can thank on the domestic policy front.\n\n1. Bob McDonnell. As platform committee chair, McDonnell made it clear he was not in the mood for any amendments to the draft language calling for a “Human Life Amendment” to the U.S. Constitution and legal recognition that the “unborn” are covered by the Fourteenth Amendment – “personhood” by another name. McDonnell is in many ways the ideal right-wing governor: he ran as a fiscal conservative and governs like the Religious Right activist he has been since he laid out his own political platform in the guise of a master’s thesis at Pat Robertson’s Regent University.\n\nWashington Post noted, “During his 14 years in the General Assembly, McDonnell pursued at least 10 of the policy goals he laid out in that research paper, including abortion restrictions, covenant marriage, school vouchers and tax policies to favor his view of the traditional family. In 2001, he voted against a resolution in support of ending wage discrimination between men and women.” As governor, McDonnell signed the kind of mandatory ultrasound law that is praised in this year’s platform. When his name was floated as a potential V.P. pick, Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood His thesis argued that feminists and working women were detrimental to the family, and that public policy should favor married couples over “cohabitators, homosexuals, or fornicators.” When running for governor, McDonnell disavowed his thesis, but as a state legislator he pushed hard to turn those positions into policy.

Perkins . Perkins heads the Family Research Council, whose Values Voter Summit is the Religious Right’s most important annual conference, at which movement activists rub shoulders with Republican officials and candidates. Perkins bragged in an email to his supporters how much influence he and his friend David Barton (see below) had on the platform. Perkins was an active member of the platform committee, proposing language to oppose school-based health clinics that provide referrals for contraception or abortion, and arguing for the strongest possible anti-marriage equality language. Perkins also introduced an amendment to the platform calling on the District of Columbia government to loosen its gun laws, which Perkins says still do not comply with recent Supreme Court rulings.\n\nThe media tends to treat Perkins, a telegenic former state legislator, as a reasonable voice of the Religious Right, but his record and his group’s positions prove otherwise. Perkins has been aggressively exploiting the recent shooting at FRC headquarters to divert attention from the group’s extremism by claiming that the Southern Poverty Law Center was irresponsible in calling FRC a hate group. Unfortunately for Perkins, the group’s record of promoting hatred toward LGBT people is well documented. Perkins has even complained that the press and President Obama were being too hard on Uganda’s infamous “kill the gays” bill, which he described as an attempt to “uphold moral conduct.” It’s worth remembering that Perkins ran a 1996 campaign for Louisiana Senate candidate Woody Jenkins that paid $82,600 to David Duke for the Klan leader’s mailing list; the campaign was fined by the FEC for trying to cover it up.\n\n3. David Barton . Texas Republican activist and disgraced Christian-nation “historian” Barton has had a tough year, but Tampa has been good to him. He was perhaps the most vocal member of the platform committee, and was a featured speaker at Sunday’s pre-convention “prayer rally.” During the platform committee’s final deliberations, Barton couldn’t seem to hear his own voice often enough. He was the know-it-all nitpicker, piping up with various language changes, such as deleting a reference to the family as the “school of democracy” because families are not democracies. He thought it was too passive to call Obamacare an “erosion of” the Constitution and thought it should be changed to an “attack on” the founding document. He called for stronger anti-public education language and asserted that large school districts employ one administrator for every teacher. He backed anti-abortion language, tossing out the claim that 127 medical studies over five decades say that abortion hurts women.

Progressives have been documenting Barton’s lies for years, but more recently conservative evangelical scholars have also been hammering his claims about American history. The critical chorus got so loud that Christian publishing powerhouse Thomas Nelson pulled Barton’s most recent book – which, ironically, purports to correct “lies” about Thomas Jefferson – from the shelves. Of course, Barton has had plenty of practice at this sort of thing, from producing bogus documentaries designed to turn African Americans against the Democratic Party to pushing his religious and political ideology into Texas textbooks . Barton’s right-wing friends like Glenn Beck have rallied around him. And nothing seems to tarnish Barton with the GOP allies for whom he has proven politically useful over the years.\n\n4. Kris Kobach . Kris Kobach wants to be your president one day; until now, he has gotten as far as Kansas Secretary of State. He may be best known as the brains behind Arizona’s “show me your papers” law, and he successfully pushed for anti-immigrant language in the platform, including a call for the federal government to deny funds to universities that allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition – a plank that puts Kobach and the platform at odds with Kansas law. Immigration is not Kobach’s only issue. He is an energizing force behind the Republican Party’s massive push for voter suppression laws around the country, and he led the effort to get language inserted into the platform calling on states to pass laws requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration.

He also pushed language aimed at the supposed threat to the Constitution and laws of the US from “ Sharia law”; getting this language into the platform puts the GOP in position of endorsing a ludicrous far-right conspiracy theory. Kobach hopes that will give activists a tool for pressuring more states to pass their own anti-Sharia laws. In the platform committee, he backed Perkins’ efforts to maintain the strongest language against marriage equality. Even an amendment to the marriage section saying that everyone should be treated “equally under the law” as long as they are not hurting anyone else, was shot down by Kobach. Kobach also claims he won support for a provision to oppose any effort to limit how many bullets can go into a gun’s magazine.\n\n5. James Bopp .

James Bopp is a Republican lawyer and delegate from Indiana whose client list is a Who’s Who of right-wing organizations, including National Right to Life and the National Organization for Marriage, which he has represented in its efforts to keep political donors secret. As legal advisor to Citizens United, Bopp has led legal attacks on campaign finance laws and played a huge role in bringing us the world of unlimited right-wing cash flooding our elections. Bopp chaired this year’s platform subcommittee on “restoring constitutional government,” which helps explain its strong anti-campaign finance reform language.\n\nBopp is also an annoyingly petty partisan, having introduced a resolution in the Republican National Committee in 2009 urging the Democratic Party to change its name to the “Democrat Socialist Party.” In this year’s platform committee, Bopp successfully pushed for the removal of language suggesting that residents of the District of Columbia might deserve some representation in Congress short of statehood. His sneering comments , and his gloating fist – pump when the committee approved his resolution, have not won him any friends among DC residents – not that he cares. He also spoke out against a young delegate’s proposal that the party recognize civil unions, which Bopp denounced as “counterfeit marriage.” In spite of all these efforts, Bopp has been at the forefront of Romney campaign platform spin, arguing in the media that the platform language on abortion is not really a “no-exceptions” ban, in spite of its call for a Human Life Amendment and laws giving Fourteenth Amendment protections to the “unborn.”\n\n6. Dick Armey . Former Republican insider Dick Armey now runs FreedomWorks, the . Former Republican insider Dick Armey now runs FreedomWorks, the Koch – backed , corporate – funded , Murdoch – promoted Tea Party astroturfing group – or, in their words, a “grassroots service center.” Armey has been a major force behind this year’s victories of Tea Party Senate challengers like Ted Cruz in Texas and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, both of whom knocked off “establishment” candidates – FreedomWorks also backed Rand Paul in Kentucky and Mike Lee in Utah in 2010. As Alternet’s Adele Stan has reported , FreedomWorks’s goal is to build a cadre of far-right senators to create a “power center around Jim DeMint,” the Senate’s reigning Tea Party-Religious Right hero.\n\nTo put Armey’s stamp on the platform, FreedomWorks created a “Freedom Platform” project, which enlisted Tea Party leaders to come up with proposed platform planks and encouraged activists to vote for them online. Then FreedomWorks pushed the party to include these planks in the official platform:\n\n● Repeal Obamacare; Pursue Patient-Centered Care\n\n● Stop the Tax Hikes\n\n● Reverse Obama’s Spending Increases\n\n● Scrap the Code; Replace It with a Flat Tax\n\n● Pass a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n● Reject Cap and Trade\n\n● Rein in the EPA\n\n● Unleash America’s Vast Energy Potential\n\n● Eliminate the Department of Education\n\n● Reduce the Bloated Federal Workforce\n\n● Curtail Excessive Federal Regulation\n\n● Audit the Fed\n\nAn Ohio Tea Party Group, The Ohio Liberty Coalition, celebrated that 10 of 12 made it to the draft – everything but the flat tax and eliminating the Department of Education. But FreedomWorks gave itself a more generous score, arguing for an 11.5 out of 12. FreedomWorks vice president Dean Clancy said that the platform’s call for a “flatter” tax “opens the door to a Flat Tax” and said that they considered the education section of the platform a “partial victory” because it includes “a very strong endorsement of school choice, including vouchers.”\n\nHonorable mention: Mitt Romney. This is his year, his party, and his platform. The entire Republican primary was essentially an exercise in Romney moving to the right to try to overcome resistance to his nomination from activists who distrusted his ideological authenticity. The last thing the Romney campaign wanted was a fight with the base, like the one that happened in San Diego in 1996, when Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition delighted in publicly humiliating nominee Robert Dole over his suggestion that the GOP might temper its anti-abortion stance. Romney signaled his intention to avoid a similar conflict when he named Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell to chair the platform committee.\n\nKeeping Everybody Happy",

  "latent_30166": "DPA, Landov\n\nJan Assmann has been described as the world's leading Egyptologist—a characterization that few these days would dare to dispute. A 74-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Heidelberg and honorary professor at the University of Konstanz, Assmann has held guest professorships at Yale, the University of Chicago, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, in Paris.\n\nIn addition to his specialized work as an Egyptologist, Assmann has staked a more general claim to distinction as a leading theorist of cultural history as a result of his pathbreaking work on \"mnemo­history\"—a concept he has developed over the past three decades with his wife, Aleida Assmann, and other researchers.\n\nIn his recent volume, Cultural Memory and Early Civilization: Writing, Remembrance, and Political Imagination (Cambridge University Press, 2011), Assmann recapitulates a number of his most important findings. Building on the work of previous theorists of cultural memory as an approach to historical understanding (such as the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs), Assmann's notion of mnemohistory suggests that, from a cultural point of view, the way history is remembered is more important than—to quote the German historian Leopold von Ranke—\"the way it really was.\"\n\nThis insight is particularly valid in the case of ancient history. Here, whereas reliable archaeological or textual evidence is often sketchy, imaginative commentaries abound, in many cases composed several centuries after the fact. It is generally accepted that, after a period of 40 years, generational memory begins to fade. At this point, \"collective memory\" cedes to \"cultural memory\" as a type of imaginative reinvention of tradition.\n\nAs Assmann explains his methodology in Cultural Memory and Early Civilization: \"Even if sometimes the debate over history, memory, and mnemotechnics may appear abstract and academic, it seems to me to nevertheless lie at the very heart of current discourse. Everything points to the fact that the concept of memory constitutes the basis for a new paradigm of cultural studies that will shed light on all the interconnected fields of art and literature, politics and sociology, religion and law.\"\n\nAssmann points out that questions of historical remembrance are frequently the object of contentious cultural negotiations and disputes. Often, such struggles go far toward determining the cultural self-understanding of a given society or social group. To take one example that resurfaces often in Assmann's work: At various points in European cultural history, the memory of ancient Egypt, as the \"other\" of the West, has assumed a pivotal function. Thus in both the Old Testament and early Christianity, Egypt was hyperbolically constructed as a \"negative totem.\" For the ancient Jews, it became the symbol of worldly corruption (\"the fleshpots of Egypt\") and soulless idolatry. Among Christians, it became one of the essential sites of paganism—a past from which believers needed to free themselves in order to accede to the promised land of salvation.\n\nAssmann's approach systematically neglects ancient Judaism's robust moral inclinations toward tolerance and neighborly love.\n\nConversely, Assmann shows in Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (Harvard University Press, 1997) that during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment—two highly secularizing eras, in which emancipation from ecclesiastical dogma became a major rallying cry—ancient Egypt's historical value was positively reconfigured, both as the ultimate fount of biblical monotheism and as providing an evidentiary historical basis for Spinoza's heretical pantheism. (As Spinoza famously claimed, Deus sive natura: God and nature are the same.) This historiographical reassessment represented a conscious attempt to ruin the sacred truths by demonstrating that Western monotheism had its origins in pagan practices and rituals. It was an image that was constructed in contrast with Christendom, where, with the Inquisition and the religious wars, religious dogma had culminated in intolerance, persecution, and armed conflagrations of biblical proportion. (It is estimated that during the Thirty Years' War, one-third of the population of Europe either died or was displaced.) Thus, by degrees, biblical Egyptophobia ultimately gave way to Egyptophilia—a tendency that crested with Napoleon's Egyptian expedition (1798-1801) and the French Orientalist Jean-François Champollion's (1790-1832) decipherment of hieroglyphics, which became the basis for modern Egyptology.\n\nAssmann shows that, in the work of the 17th-century English Hebraist John Spencer, the 18th-century English polemicist and freethinker John Toland, and the 18th-century English cleric and critic William Warburton, the figure of Moses played a pivotal role in the early Enlightenment's secularizing discourse on Egypt. It was during this period that the enduring cultural trope of \"Moses the Egyptian\" was born. To reconceive Moses as an Egyptian was a way of deflating the theological pretensions of biblical monotheism. The hope was that, by demonstrating that Western monotheism had its origins in the nature-centered religion of ancient Egypt, one might be able to defuse Christianity's eschatological, sectarian zealotry—which, in the eyes of its critics, had had such catastrophic historical and political consequences.\n\nNot only does the idea of \"Moses the Egyptian\" furnish the title of Assmann's 1997 monograph. It also alludes to the title of a highly contentious essay by Freud (\"If Moses was an Egyptian ...\") that was published a few months before Freud's death, in 1939, as part of Moses and Monotheism. Freud claimed, on the basis of some rather threadbare textual and historical evidence, that the historical Moses was in fact a disaffected Egyptian priest who imposed monotheism on the Jews once it had been banned in ancient Egypt following the reign of Akhenaten. Unsurprisingly, Freud's iconoclastic study—which, to the dismay of fellow Jews, appeared as the tide of European anti-Semitism reached its zenith—plays a pivotal role in Assmann's investigations of Western mnemohistorical discourse on Egypt.\n\nIn his more recent work, Assmann has taken the corrosive spirit of early modern Bible criticism a step further. In The Price of Monotheism (Stanford University Press, 2010) and related studies, Assmann ignited an international controversy by claiming that the Old Testament, by discriminating between true and false religion, was responsible for ushering in unprecedented levels of historical violence. Provocatively, he has designated this fateful cultural caesura—whose origins lie in the sacred texts of ancient Judaism and which Assmann describes as a world-historical transition from \"cult to book\"—as the \"Mosaic distinction.\" It is a perspective we must transcend, he contends, if the world is to surmount the theologically authorized violence and hatred that have been responsible for so much bloodshed and misfortune. \"We cannot change history, but we can change the myths into which history is continuously transformed through collective memory,\" writes Assmann in Of God and Gods (University of Wisconsin Press, 2008). \"This is the road that should be taken. Monotheism itself pushes us to go beyond the logic of exclusivity and the language of violence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssmann argues that biblical monotheism, as codified by the Pentateuch, disrupted the political and cultural stability of the ancient world by introducing the concept of \"religious exclusivity\": that is, by claiming, as no belief system had previously, that its God was the one true God, and that, correspondingly, all other gods were false. By introducing the idea of the \"one true God,\" Assmann suggests that monotheism upended one of the basic precepts of ancient polytheism: the principle of \"divine translatability.\" This notion meant that, in ancient Mesopotamia, the various competing deities and idols possessed a fundamental equivalence. This equivalence provided the basis for a constructive modus vivendi among the major empires and polities that predominated in the ancient world.\n\nAssmann readily admits that the ancient Middle East was hardly an unending expanse of peaceable kingdoms. However, he suggests that before monotheism's emergence, the rivalries and conflicts at issue were predominantly political rather than religious in nature. For this reason, they could be more readily contained. Monotheism raised the stakes of these skirmishes to fever pitch. According to Assmann, with monotheism's advent, it became next to impossible to separate narrowly political disagreements from religious disputes about \"ultimate ends\" (Max Weber) or \"comprehensive doctrines\" (John Rawls). According to the new logic of \"religious exclusivity,\" political opponents to be conquered were turned into theological \"foes\" to be decimated.\n\nWhat Assmann essentially describes in his writings is an improbable and presumptuous theory of historico-theological \"blowback.\"\n\nBy introducing the \"Mosaic distinction,\" Assmann argues, the Old Testament established the foundations of religious intolerance, as epitomized by the theological watchwords: \"No other gods!\" \"No god but God!\" Thereafter, the pre-monotheistic deities were denigrated as \"idols.\" As Assmann explains: Ancient Judaism \"sharply distinguishes itself from the religions of its environment by demanding that its One God be worshiped to the exclusion of all others, by banning the production of images, and by making divine favor depend less on sacrificial offerings and rites than on the righteous conduct of the individual and the observance of god-given, scripturally fixed laws.\"\n\nThese measures and techniques infused monotheistic religious practice with a new stringency—an element of fideistic absolutism—that differed qualitatively from the more diffuse cult practices of its polytheistic predecessors. Moreover, by introducing the idea of a transcendent and omnipotent deity, monotheism was guilty of estranging its adherents from the natural world—a tendency that stood in marked contrast with the world-affirming and life-enhancing orientation of pagan belief systems. In Of God and Gods, Assmann goes so far as to suggest that the \"religion of the book\" was proto-totalitarian. \"The Torah with its commandments and prohibitions ... served as a script for leading one's life, running one's business, performing the rituals, ruling the community, in short regulating every aspect of individual and collective existence,\" he argues. \"This was a new phenomenon in the history of writing as well as that of religion and civilization generally. Never before had writing served such comprehensive functions.\"\n\nAt the risk of lapsing into what, by his own admission, might be viewed as anti-Jewish stereotypes and polemics, Assmann invokes several chilling, if familiar, instances of mass slaughter from the Old Testament as confirmation of his thesis concerning the inherent relationship between \"exclusive monotheism\" and predatory violence. To be sure, many of these episodes were directed inward: expressions of divine retribution aimed at the errant Jews themselves for their egregious lapses in faith. Assmann cites the tale of the golden calf (Exodus 32: 27-28), in which 3,000 Israelites meet their death. At Baal Pe'or (Numbers 25), where Hebrew men are discovered fraternizing with Midianite women and worshiping their idols, only the pre-emptive execution of 24,000 wayward Hebrews can forestall even greater divine fury. Lastly, Assmann cites the Lord's draconian recommendation in Deuteronomy that, in their impending conquest of the Canaanite lands, the Jews must \"let no breathing creature live.\"\n\nIn all of these instances, the logic of \"No god but God!\" establishes what Assmann characterizes as a cultural semantics of religious intolerance, culminating in the herem ban: a biblical version of jihad in which no living creature shall be left alive.\n\nOf course, there is no archaeological evidence to support the claim that any of these alleged divinely mandated bloodlettings actually occurred. Instead, it is commonly acknowledged that they were conceived by the anonymous biblical authors as cautionary tales to illustrate the risks of straying from the basic precepts of the Old Testament's austere ethical injunctions. One of Assmann's methodological failings is that he jumps too quickly from considerations of \"textuality\" or \"mnemohistory\" to questions of actuality. Fortunately, not everything one finds in a text is automatically translated into historical practice.\n\nAssmann's disparaging construction of ancient Judaism has been harshly criticized by Old Testament scholars. He consistently denigrates biblical monotheism as a \"secondary\" or \"counter religion,\" thereby impugning its originality by claiming that its doctrines were parasitically dependent on their opposition to ancient pagan practices.\n\nAssmann has also been accused of providing an overly sanguine and harmonious portrait of interstate relations among the proponents of ancient polytheism—Babylon, Assyria, and so forth. However, in the ancient world, the Israelites were not the only group who, in times of warfare, invoked the dreaded herem, or ban on conquered peoples. Since the discovery almost 150 years ago of the Moabite stone, dating from the ninth century BC, we know that other nations in the ancient Middle East engaged in similar practices—as the Moabites apparently did against Israel. Another discomfiting aspect of Assmann's veneration of ancient paganism is that, since the 1980s, a similar orientation has predominated among the advocates of the European New Right, whose hate-filled texts have often provided the script for and fed the intolerance of the Europe's far-right political parties. (For a good example, see Alain de Benoist's On Being a Pagan.)\n\nA major failing of Assmann's approach is that it systematically neglects ancient Judaism's robust moral inclinations toward tolerance and neighborly love. Numerous prescriptions in the Old Testament, known as the Noachide Laws, stress the importance of providing hospitality and succor to strangers. As we read in Leviticus (19:33-34): \"When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as your self, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.\" Thus, contra Assmann, lurid tales of plunder, bloodlust, and divine retribution fail to tell the whole story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of astute critics have also pointed out that, from a social-evolutionary perspective, biblical monotheism represents a significant ethical breakthrough, providing a normative basis for the idea of universal human brotherhood—a characterization diametrically opposed to the \"exclusionary\" mentality that Assmann considers predominant. Historically, the Exodus parable, which Assmann judges the ur-text of exclusionary monotheism, has served as a foundational narrative of political emancipation: humanity's deliverance from the injustices of bondage and oppression.\n\nAssmann censures monotheism's ostensible \"world alienation\"—its embrace of a transcendent, invisible God who dwells outside of, rather than within, the world. But that divine barrier, in fact, underwrites the ethical distinction between justice and injustice, what is and what should be, mere life versus life led according to principle. This perspective conveys the idea that the moral life is something that must be achieved by a demanding process of existential reorientation and conversion. It \"alienates\" men and women not from the world as such, but from the world conceived as a locus of oppression and injustice. That was the reality that the Israelites were forced to confront during their 400 years of bondage in ancient Egypt.\n\nThus as the journalist Thomas Assheuer has pointed out in discussing Assmann's work: \"The appeal to a just God was the answer to an experience of violence and suffering that can no longer be compensated by myth.\" Assmann downplays the significance of divine transcendence as an ethical breakthrough and neglects the coercive power of myth as an ideological consecration of fate—that is, a justification of mere life, however needlessly unjust it may be.\n\nWhereas ancient polytheism sanctified the injustices of fate—humanity's entrapment in the world as it is—the Mosaic religion protested against that condition and its moral inadequacies. The covenant at Sinai represents the promise of an elevated life: a moral life. Henceforth, secular powers that fail to measure up to the standards and precepts of the Ten Commandments stand exposed for their ethical deficiencies.\n\nMoreover, the seemingly harsh Deuteronomic injunction—that, in the lands they are about to conquer, the Israelites must \"let no breathing creature live\"—is deceptive, since in subsequent passages we find the Jews living peacefully among the Canaanites and other local tribes. As Michael Walzer shows in In God's Shadow: Politics in the Hebrew Bible (Yale University Press, 2012), on both philological and textual grounds, the Old Testament is inherently susceptible to a plurality of readings. \"Given the different rulers—judges, kings, and priests—and the arguments over kingship,\" Walzer writes, \"there can't be anything like an authoritative political constitution in the Hebrew Bible. ... In the end, there are no authoritative readings.\" Assmann, conversely, serves up a peculiarly reductive and disapproving interpretation of biblical monotheism—a portrait that is distinctly at odds with his professions of solidarity with \"postmodern pluralism,\" which he regards as a desirable, 21st-century epistemological corollary to the spirit of ancient polytheism.\n\nAssmann's argument is often scattershot and filled with qualifications—so many that if one took all of them at face value, there would remain virtually nothing of substance. But upon closer scrutiny, what Assmann essentially describes in his writings is an improbable and presumptuous theory of historico-theological \"blowback.\" In his view, it was the ancient Hebrews who, by virtue of the \"Mosaic distinction\" and the cultural semantics of intolerance they unleashed, conceived the notion of holy war: a divinely ordained doctrine of total annihilation. Tragically, it was the same cultural semantics of intolerance that, at a later point, returned to smite the Jews themselves in the most prodigious and far-reaching instance of mass murder ever recorded: the Holocaust.\n\nIn other words: What one sows, one reaps. In Assmann's view, ultimately it was not the Germans who were responsible for the Holocaust. It was the Jews themselves who were responsible, by virtue of having conceived and implemented a doctrine of \"religious exclusivity\" whose ultimate historical repercussions could in biblical times only dimly be perceived. Thereby, Assmann effectively recycles the shopworn canard that it is the Jews themselves who are responsible for anti-Semitism.\n\nIt is in that vein that, in Moses the Egyptian, Assmann praises Freud's strategy in Moses and Monotheism of asking \"'how the Jew came to attract this undying hatred.'\"\n\nIn this way, Assmann seeks to refute Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's controversial thesis in Hitler's Willing Executioners (Knopf, 1996) that it was a specifically German variant of \"eliminationist anti-Semitism\" that was responsible for the Holocaust. Yet Assmann goes to the opposite extreme, effectively exculpating the actual perpetrators by suggesting that their motives were irrelevant. Instead, the historical key to anti-Semitism is to be found in the Old Testament, as interpreted by Assmann.\n\nIn Moses the Egyptian, Assmann clarifies the biographical motivations subtending his investigations by informing us, \"It is in a rather personal attempt to 'come to terms with'\" the German past \"that I embark on the writing of this study about Moses the Egyptian.\" He continues: \"The present text reflects my situation as a German Egyptologist writing 50 years after the catastrophe which Freud saw approaching, knowing the full extent of the genocide which was still unthinkable in Freud's time.\"\n\nHere, one might plausibly inquire: What contribution might an Egyptologist be able to make toward understanding the Holocaust, an event that postdates Assmann's area of scholarly expertise by some 3,500 years? We find the answer to this question a few lines later, when Assmann grandiosely informs us that, by re-examining the cultural \"confrontation of [ancient] Egypt and Israel,\" he seeks to furnish \"a historical analysis of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nBut the term anti-Semitism is a relatively recent coinage. It first appeared in Wilhelm Marr's prejudice-laden 1879 study, The Victory of Judaism Over Germany. Among historians, the term has been conceptually serviceable for distinguishing the ideology of modern racial anti-Judaism from anti-Judaism's more traditional, religious strains. To restate these facts is merely to underline what should be obvious: The analytical and historical value of seeking to account for modern anti-Semitism via recourse to the biblical antagonism between Israel and Egypt is manifestly limited. It is at this point, moreover, that one runs up against the analytical and conceptual limits of \"mnemohistory\" as a method of historical explanation.\n\nBut there is another essential component of Assmann's highly speculative theological \"blowback\" thesis that falls beneath the threshold of sense. The Holocaust cannot be conceived as a modern instance of \"religious exclusivity\"—this time, perpetrated against the Jews rather than by them—since, as is well known, the Nazis openly disavowed monotheism (Christianity as well as Judaism) in favor of neo-paganism. The ideology of the master race was predicated on the doctrine of Aryan racial superiority, which provided the Nazis with their right to dominate supposedly inferior racial groupings. Thus, in point of fact, Europe's Jews were victimized by the recrudescence of the herem ban as practiced by ancient pagans, for which we now have corroborating archaeological evidence. If this insight holds, it stands Assmann's argument on its head: It was paganism's return, rather than its eclipse at the hands of biblical monotheism, that helps to explain the destruction of European Jewry at the hands of the swastika-bearing Nazis. In this case, too, Assmann seems to be scratching where it doesn't itch.\n\nUnder the cover of solving the historical riddle of anti-Semitism by tracing it back to the \"Mosaic distinction\"—and thus insinuating that European Jewry was ultimately the victim of a brand of theological intolerance that the ancient Hebrews had themselves introduced—Assmann has merely added fuel to the flames.",

A tradition she’s passed on to her 14 year old son, whose dream car is a Shelby GT500.\n\nJanz got her first car at the age of 15 from her step dad, a red ’66 coupe. Unfortunately soon after Janz’s mom said it was “too much car for a girl” and the car was sold. 21 years later Janz found herself reunited with her love, a red ’05 Mustang GT. She was drawn to the revived classic body style. She managed to hold on to this one for a little longer than the first. But after a year with the car her teenage daughter totaled it, leaving Janz with the haunting question “was my mother right?”\n\nNow Janz is waiting for her next chance to get acquainted with a Mustang again. Although she has yet to decide if it will be a pre ’70 or the new body style. Until then she is lucky enough to have buddies like Trevor Welch. He is the owner of the ’66 Mustang in the photos. Janz was doing a pin up shoot and needed a car. She remembers thinking “I want a classic and it must be a mustang”.

  "latent_30606": "A couple of weeks ago at E3, we got the chance to sit down with Michael-Christopher Koji Fox and ask him about his humble beginnings. Mentions of Las Vegas, cults, Predator references, and 80’s music make up the rest of what is one of the most fun (and longest) interviews we’ve ever done!\n\nRead on for a look at how the members of the localization team behind Final Fantasy XIV do what they do in this special edition of The Lore Train!\n\nGE: How did you get started at Square Enix? We know that you’ve been involved with Final Fantasy XI for some time. What was the path you took to get to this point?\n\nMCKF: I’ve loved games forever and I wanted to get into the game industry. Back when I was in high school, getting into the game industry meant programming and making games. So I took a programming class in 10th grade and… I sucked at it. The final project was to get into a group of four people and make a game. We made a game on the mac about going to Las Vegas. One guy made poker, one made roulette, one made blackjack… and I made the game that when you ran out of money you could go to the park and rob the old lady. You just had an old women waking from the right side of the screen to the left and you were in the top of a tree. There was a little cursor moving back and forth on the bottom of the screen and you had to press the space bar and stop it right underneath her in order to jump down on her and get her, and if you missed, you got caught by the cops and hung. Death penalty for trying to rob a woman and yeah, we got a B and I knew I wasn’t cut out for making games so I kind of gave up.\n\nI really loved Japan and I was taking Japanese classes in high school at that time and I really wanted to continue. So I thought OK, maybe I can get over to Japan. What can I do when I get over there? Well OK, Japanese people all learn English so if I can be an English teacher, I’ll have a job in Japan. So I came over to Japan and I entered a Japanese university and studied for four years, got my teaching license and government certification and became the first American person ever to get his teaching license and teaching certification in the northern island of Hokkaido. I taught there for 3 years in a junior high school. I was also the basketball coach, the kids sucked at basketball but they were great kids. I think they sucked at basketball because I was a sucky coach. I loved doing it, but in the back of my head the whole time, it wasn’t really what I wanted to do. I would come home from work and play Final Fantasy. I came home from work and got into the Final Fantasy XI beta and I was playing beta and then the original release and it was what got me through those hard days. I really loved FFXI. I was actually online looking for FFXI hints on how to complete quests and went to the Square Enix page thinking that there might be something there and I saw that they were hiring for localization. It was just immediate… localization! Oh yeah! Why didn’t I think of this ten years ago! So I applied and I got in. I think one of the main reasons I got in was because I was in the right place at the right time because they were looking for someone to translate Final Fantasy XI for the English version. There was so much text so they were hiring new people to come in. Because I had already been playing they said “oh wow you don’t need any familiarization! you can start today!” So my second day I was translating support desk text.\n\nSince then, I’ve worked for so many years on FFXI and I’ve loved it. I’ve had really good relationships with the development team and Tanaka-san. Even though I stepped away from FFXI for a little bit and worked on Dirge of Cerberus and also Code Age Commanders which was only released in Japan. It was going to be released in America and then they decided not to release it so I translated this whole game and it never got released. I also helped out with Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life As A King and did a bunch of little projects. However, my heart was always with Final Fantasy and I actually returned to FFXI and helped with the beginnings of Wings of the Goddess. Just around that time is when Rapture project, or Final Fantasy XIV, started up and because Tanaka-san was working on that and I was working with him for so long he asked me if I’d like to be lead localization on that project. So I was in from the ground floor there and that flowed over into when Yoshida-san took over with his new vision. The localization vision was still the same, we still wanted to have the highest quality product, it doesn’t matter who the Director is, we know that maintaining the lore is something that localization has a really big hand in. If translators change, even if the Japanese writers are the same, things can get different and then you’re alienating this whole user base that’s expecting one thing but then they’re getting something else so I’m sticking with it and having just as much fun as I was having on 1.0 and FFXI.\n\nGE: In version 1.0, you had the chance to make your own quest. Can you tell us what that was like and if you’ve been able to do that for A Realm Reborn\n\nMCKF: I’ve had a bunch of quest ideas for a long time. There were plans to release some of them earlier, but we had the change of the guard and a lot of craziness happened and we were scrambling to get this new storyline up and have it completed. The main thing was to get the storyline complete and have something in place to explain what was going to happen to the world and tie it into 2.0. And they were like “yeah…. you know that quest we said we would let you do? Maybe in the next patch.” and then the next patch was “yeah about that quest.. maybe in the next patch.”\n\nFinally towards the end there, the idea of the cults, the Lambs of Dalamud started appearing in other quests and so they said “hey you wrote that quest about the cults! Can we use that here?” So it finally fit into their story and they allowed me to bring it in. I think it worked really well. The point there being… it being a JRPG in the sense that it’s an RPG made by Japanese developers and with them it’s about bonding together and having fun and being with your friends and it’s usually a lot of lighter subjects. I know there are a lot of dark subjects in Final Fantasy XI, a lot of dark things happened, but me personally, while I like that, I like my dark fantasy as well. I like it the grittiness and people dying and people getting tricked and things like that, and I saw we didn’t have a lot of those in 1.0 where you would go in thinking one thing and them BOOM you’d be betrayed. So I wanted to put something in to make players go “oooooh! you! nooooo!”\n\nWhen you think about it, the world is coming to an end. If that really happened the crazies would be coming out! There’s enough crazy people in the world now with it not coming to an end… if it got out that the world is going to end soon.. man! So I wanted to get that across because how would the people of Eorzea go crazy? So I’m thinking okay, you have this giant thing coming down and no one knows what it is, so of course you are going to have people that have theories and people that will worship it because people will worship anything if it’s grand and far away, so why not have this group of people that worship this thing but they think it’s something else and then it turns into a blood fest. It was fun seeing the players reaction to that and even some people on the dev team thought it was pretty good. Hopefully I’ll get more chances to do that with 2.0. There have been talks about me getting in there a little more. Right now it’s mainly about getting the game done and they have their ideas. Yoshida has his plans about what he wants to do, so we’ve been building up those quests for a long time now. We have hundreds of quests to explain the 2.0 story. Once that is told, we’ll have expansions and with those we’ll get a little more in there. They’ve told me they want to do some more stuff but until then I’ll chill, but I have a lots of good ideas, I’m looking forward to it!\n\nGE: How do you approach writing dialogue for a character? How do you come up with the way they talk and phrase things?\n\nMCKF: The greatest thing about being with the development team and being in japan – and not just an outsourced translator that’s a couple thousand miles away from the team that gets files via a middle man that knows nothing about the game – being actually there…. I sit right next to the main planner. When we get new quests or a new character I can just go right to them and say “what type of character is this? What happened to him before the quest? What happens to him after?” that way I can figure out who the character is and base a characterization off of that.\n\nBack in Final Fantasy XI, characterization was really based on race. The Elvaan would speak very proper, and the Tarutaru would use alliteration and use “taru” at the end of all of their words and the Mithra would roll their ‘r’s and it was like that around all of Vana’diel, and they all spoke the same way. This time we went something with more city-state and region based. When you look at the US, yeah everyone speaks English and there are a lot of races in America, but it’s not only speech based on race, but what area you’re from. People in New York will speak similarly, people in Texas will use different types of words or inflection no matter what race they are because they’re living in that area. We do have racial ticks, so the Elezen will do speak a little more in the proper English and the Lalafell will be a little more cuter, but its more based on the city that they live in. So in Gridania where’s its all laid back and cool, there’s a tendency to speak in that proper English, be more calm and relaxed and not use as much slang. In Ul’dah, because it’s a city of commerce you have different classes like upper, middle and lower. So in Ul’dah there’s a big range. You’re going to get the lower class with their broken English and a lot of slang, whereas the upper class will be speaking like they’re looking down upon you. In Limsa Lominsa, it’s a town based on Piracy. There are ship builders, pirates, and sailors, so we give it the feeling that the whole city is like that. That’s why there are Lalafell in Limsa Lominsa that say “you aren’t worth an ounce of piss!” No matter how cute you are, even if you’re a Lalafell, if you’re living around pirates, that piracy is going to rub off on you, so that’s what we wanted to do there, to give the town a feel, and the people living in that town to be a reflection of the type of town it was.\n\nGE: Is all of that reflected in the different localizations of the game as well?\n\nMCKF: This is interesting, because I think, and again, I’m sure some people will disagree with me, but because we have so many people around the world speaking English, there are a lot more types of dialects and so many more words. There are a lot of different ways to get something across in English. Whereas with Japanese, because it’s a language mostly used in Japan, by Japanese people, there aren’t as many ways to have fun with the language as there are in English. So while I’m not saying that there are no characterizations in Japanese, I don’t believe that as much can be done. Good writers in Japanese can find ways, and there are subtle differences, but I think we can have more fun in English and if we can do that I don’t want to have five or six types of characterizations, I want to have lots of them because I think its more fun for the players if they know that the characters are going to speak in a weird type of way or this one is going to speak in a more proper type of way. It makes it fun because it makes the characters stick out more. So I think we have a little more fun than the Japanese version does, but that’s not to say that the Japanese version is boring and doesn’t have any characterization. The French and German teams do what they do. I think the German team likes to follow the English and have as much fun as we do, and I think the French team enjoys following the Japanese. Why they do that? You’d have to ask them, I don’t want to answer for them. It’s not really set in stone either because they like to go back and forth. We are given a lot of freedom.\n\nGE: Do the French and German teams have access to your English translations by the time that they are localizing so they can work off both the Japanese and the English?\n\nMCKF: Actually, because we’re all doing this simultaneously, they might not have the access. They can all translate from Japanese. I think we must have the best people in the business because not only do they have their own native languages, and are translating from Japanese, but each one of them is fluent in English. All of our communication is done in English so they have three languages, they’re like diplomat level people translating games for Square Enix. They’re translating huge amounts of text, hundreds of thousands of characters within a small amount of time and getting this high quality, I love it.\n\nTo answer your question, we all translate at the same time, but we all translate what we want to first. We get our chunk of text and then do what we want to do. So if there’s something that I do first, they can look off the English and Japanese and then go off which one they want or maybe get inspiration from both. They might translate theirs from Japanese but then once the English is done maybe they’ll go back and brush it up. Because the French and German teams are looking at our text, they’ll give a lot of feedback too so they can give us ideas as well. It’s a really close knit team. A lot of games that are outsourced have little communication. Our team is all together, with the Development team. We can make sure things are consistent, we know what’s going on, we know why a dev member wrote a certain character this way and what his motivation is and what he wants us to convey – or what she wants us to convey because a lot of our writers are female. The game industry is very male driven, except for our writing team. Our writing team has a lot of female writers, it’s not that there aren’t any male writers, but compared to the other departments the writing team has a really good balance.\n\nGE: There are a lot of pop culture references in the game. There are F.A.T.Es like Breaking Bud or Clever Girls where you fight some raptors. Do you have a favorite reference or references in A Realm Reborn that you can tell us about?\n\nMCKF: Oh man… well you know our favorite one: Ifrit Bleeds, We Can Kill It. That one was from Steven Reinhart, he just stood up from his booth one day and said “guys come here!” and he’s like “Ifrit bleeds we can kill it!” and we were all “oh my god! ahhh!” We have fun with those. A lot of people say “oh you’re ruining my immersion, there are no 80’s in Eorzea” and right, there aren’t and that’s why you won’t see stuff like that in quest dialogue. But quest titles… you gotta let us have some fun there. Sometimes when I’m writing a quest, I’ll get the title right away. When you’re doing levequests and F.A.T.Es where you’re doing hundreds of them I usually do the quests first and then give the titles later. And I’ll know that “okay today is a title day” so the night before I’ll listen to some 80’s or 90’s music or I’ll flip on some TV or go through IMDB and look through some movies I watched when I was younger or hit reddit and see what’s trending and check some memes out and see if I can use some of those. All of us on the team love games and we love fantasy, but we also love pop culture from around the world and we know that our users love it to so we want to try and put that stuff in.\n\nI just did a bunch of F.A.T.Es, we have around 150 coming in beta 3. There is a F.A.T.E where you fight Old Six Arms, which was one of the roaming NMs from 1.0. I named it (I Just) Died In Six Arms Tonight off of the Cutting Crew song (I Just) Died In Your Arms Tonight. I’m pretty proud of that one, but I’m sure there are some people that will be like “uggggggggggh”. There are a ton of those, it’s pretty much just inspiration. Every single person on the team loves those, so it’s not like we have one guy that’s like “I’m never going to do those puns” everyone is like “what pun can I put in next?!”. Hopefully we won’t get to the point where we’re over doing it, I don’t think we’re ever going to put it into quest text, but for titles I’m going to have as much fun as I can.\n\nGE: Well there was that levequest that talked about Sephiroth…\n\n(Special thanks to @Peter5tewart for the above image!)\n\nMCKF: (laughs) That’s fan service! Yoshi-P is bringing back characters from former Final Fantasy games into the world… so… okay, I’m not going to say one hundred percent but, you’re not going to see Sephiroth appearing in the main scenario, let’s put it that way.\n\nGE: Not main scenario but maybe in a quest….?\n\nMCKF: Can’t get that from me. You can’t get that from me!\n\nGE: So I’m guessing that the titles for all of those quests then are differnet in Japanese?\n\nMCKF: Yeah, and we get the OK from Yoshida-san and the quest team. With the Japanese, and the thing is, in 1.0 and the beginnings of beta, they didn’t have any fun with their quest titles. They’re pretty straight forward, especially levequests. If you had a levequest to make leather bags for a guy in Bentbranch it’s probably called like Bentbranch crafting: leather bags! And it’s like… wow really? Their whole thing was that because they were repeatable and not part of the story then just make them systematic. So I said well that’s not a good reason, if you can make them part of the story then why not do it? By giving it a cool title and maybe… why does this person need 100 leather bags? There has to be a reason! So maybe a Qiqirn came and stole all the bags we were supposed to ship to the Sunsilk in Ul’dah so we need bags now or we’ll lose our contract! It’s still the same thing, but now you have a reason why and you have “oh Qiqirns steal things!” and “oh we have business dealings with people in Ul’dah!”.\n\nWhat I want the players to know, it’s not the localization team going “oh here’s that Japanese, lets ignore that and do our own thing.” because that’s not what we do. The Japanese that’s there is great, we have great writers and this great director that goes over everything to make sure it’s high quality. What we’re doing is taking a great product and making it even greater for the western market. There are a lot of things in Japanese that don’t get across language wise, there are a lot of things when they make their pop culture reference where if we make the same reference, no one in the west is going to know it and it’ll alienate a big part of the audience that’s not familiar with Japanese culture. So to make something that is not alien too, that you can feel like you’re part of the world without any kind of language or cultural barriers, we want to remove those and get across more than the text is there, but get across the experience. When the Japanese writers write their text, maybe they want the player to feel sad here, or laugh here or feel angry and want to go fight something, so if the words we choose, even if they’re a direct translation, don’t make the player feel those emotions then we’ve failed as localizers.\n\nWe want to make sure that we get across not only the word message, but the emotional message as well. It’s not like we’re changing things for the sake of changing it, and whenever we make any major changes we always get the green light from the development team, the writers, the lore planners and from Yoshida-san as well. I can tell you right now, the Chocobo that fights alongside you, in Japanese it’s referred to as your “buddy”. We didn’t’ want to go with your buddy in English because guess what else gets to be a buddy? Magitek Armor. Is your Magitek Armor really your buddy? So going to him and saying “we want to go with a different word is this OK? We want to call it a companion because it can be your companion, Chocobos and Magitek can be your companion, if we add anything in the future, we don’t know what’s going to come, but say a human comes in there, that could be a companion- it fits better in English.” and he said “OK that’s cool” and he allowed that. Sometimes we’ll go to him and ask to change stuff and he says “No, I want you to use this term instead because I want this term to be the same for everyone” and we have to respect that. He understands that different markets have different needs and English in Japan is different from English in the rest of the world. Japanese people maybe know a couple hundred thousand words, and what’s cool in English to Japanese people is not always the coolest word to Japanese people or British people or Australian people and so he understands that and allows us a lot of freedom.",

  "latent_30847": "Alberta's decision to shield postsecondary institutions from some of the impact of the collapse in oil prices was welcomed by university leaders, who said a modest 4-per-cent trim to their budgets showed that Premier Jim Prentice understands the importance of higher education to the province's economic future.\n\n\"Given where Alberta is and the fiscal situation, I think the Premier and his team have done a remarkable job of navigating the province in a very tough time, and laying down a plan of how Alberta might finally not be subject to the roller coaster of oil and gas revenues,\" said Indira Samarasekera, the president of the University of Alberta.\n\nThe budget signalled that an overhaul of how the province funds postsecondary institutions is now up for discussion. In Alberta, government money accounts for a higher percentage of university revenue than in other provinces, and student tuition fees for less.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOver the next five years, the province will examine and possibly change that funding structure, the budget said. Student associations have been concerned that the province could be moving toward removing the inflation cap on tuition increases.\n\n\"We have to worry about students, particularly about students from a lower socio-economic background. There are other ways in which revenue can be generated,\" Dr. Samarasekera said, adding that continuing education and increased alumni fundraising could be ways to increase money without placing too much of a burden on students.\n\nIn spite of its large public investment, a recent nation-wide study found that Alberta trails other provinces in some educational outcomes, including research and student debt.\n\n\"What the right numbers are for Alberta is going to take a lot of dialogue to ensure that we get the balance right and that we have the ability to deliver stable, predictable funding,\" said Elizabeth Cannon, the president of the University of Calgary.\n\nOil at $50 a barrel is proving to be a massive budgetary headache for the Prentice government. For universities and colleges, however, it is an opportunity to show their value to the province's economy.\n\n\"This is the moment in which Alberta has to face the future. … We cannot plan budgets based on the price of oil. I've always said that resource revenue belongs to generations of Albertans and we have no right to spend it now. The opportunity is to invest that revenue where Alberta might have a long term future,\" Dr. Samarasekera said.\n\nThe universities' presidents had been bracing for worse news. Even as operating budgets will be reduced by 1.4 per cent this year and 2.7 the next, the decrease is not as steep as the almost 7-per-cent trim that was imposed two years ago under Alison Redford. In 2013, the province slashed budgets while maintaining the inflation cap on tuition fees.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"We felt that two years ago that was not fair to the system, and not fair to the province. I think our Premier understands education, research and development and how important that will be for Alberta's quality of life,\" said Dr. Cannon.\n\nMaking sure that student access is maintained will be key to how the system develops in the future, she added. The budget includes increased funding for grants, particularly for low-income, aboriginal and apprentices.\n\nLate last year, postsecondaries already gained some flexibility when the province allowed 25 programs, including nursing, pharmacy, law and business to increase fees from 10 to over 50 per cent.",

REUTERS/Tim Shaffer\n\nConservative upstart Christine O’Donnell’s defeat of nine-term U.S. Representative Michael Castle in a Senate primary ended the career of one of the last Republican moderates in Congress and set off a round of Democratic celebrations.\n\nThe loss by Castle, who had been expected to cruise to victory in the November 2 election, bolstered Democratic efforts to keep the Senate seat long held by Vice President Joe Biden and made it tougher for Republicans to pick up the 10 Democratic seats they need for a Senate majority.\n\nRepublicans are still expected to turn voter worries about the economy and President Barack Obama’s leadership into big gains in November that could give them control of the House and perhaps even the Senate, once considered a longshot.\n\nO’Donnell’s win was the biggest in a string of upsets of establishment Republicans this year by loosely organized Tea Party candidates driven by anger at government in Washington and at Obama’s ambitious agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday, O’Donnell bickered on Fox News with prominent Republican Karl Rove and complained of “Republican cannibalism” after attacks on her from the party establishment.\n\n“I didn’t count on the establishment to win the primary, I’m not counting on them to win the general,” she said. “They obviously don’t see what’s going on in the country this year.”\n\nRove, the architect of President George W. Bush’s two White House wins, responded with a litany of allegations about her campaign debts, tax liens and personal background that he said would make it tough for her to win in November.\n\nA TEA PARTY MOOD\n\nThe Tea Party’s platform of limited government, lower spending and opposition to Obama could have a big impact on the Republican approach on the budget and taxes in the next Congress, and has proven a good match with the public mood.\n\n“I’m not all torn up this morning,” Republican strategist Jim Dyke said. “The mood of the country has not changed from yesterday, and that’s an overwhelming opposition to the policies President Obama and Democrats have put in place.”\n\nPolls show Tea Party candidates doing well in states like Nevada, Kentucky and Colorado. Republican Marco Rubio is confounding predictions by leading a three-way Florida Senate race against a strong independent and a Democratic rival, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nThe Delaware and New York results bolstered Democratic arguments the Republican Party has been taken over by extremists, giving them hope moderates and independent voters who are sour on Democrats will not find Republicans to be a suitable alternative in November.\n\n“Democrats are making a big mistake if they deride Tea Party candidates as extremists when the top issues they are talking about are lower deficits and spending,” Republican strategist Kevin Madden said.\n\nBut Democrats said Republicans had proven they did not have room for anyone who does not conform to their narrow agenda.\n\n“I think the message is moderates are not welcome. Moderates keep out,” Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine said on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nThe contest in Delaware highlighted the final day of primaries before November, with voters in seven states choosing nominees for the Senate, House of Representatives and governor’s races.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIn New Hampshire’s Republican Senate primary, former state attorney general Kelly Ayotte, who had been endorsed by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, narrowly beat Tea Party-backed lawyer Ovide Lamontagne.

(WBFF-TV)\n\nBaltimore police came under criticism on Monday after footage surfaced of a white officer pulling an 18-year-old black teen out of his doorway on Saturday while apparently disregarding the lack of a search warrant.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported that authorities opted not to pursue disorderly conduct charges against Tionne Jones, who is seen in the video telling an unidentified black officer he cannot enter the home without a search warrant.\n\nThe officer repeatedly asks to speak to the homeowner, later identified as Jones’ mother, India Epps. But Jones tells him that he lives there and that she is working. The argument continues until the unidentified white officer pulls up to the home and walks to the door without speaking to anyone.\n\n“This is my house,” Jones says.\n\n“That don’t matter,” the officer replies before grabbing him.\n\nPolice said in a statement that the encounter began after an officer spotted another teen — Antonio McLaurin, who filmed the encounter — trying to enter the home through both the back door and a window. McLaurin lives in the home with Jones and Epps.\n\n“We have received calls from the community about issues surrounding activity in this home,” the statement read.\n\nHowever, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union defended Jones’ refusal as being legitimate.\n\n“If they don’t want police in their house, then they shouldn’t let the police in their house, and they shouldn’t let the police intimidate them into letting them into their house,” ACLU attorney David Rocah said. “What’s troubling with this video is the people seem to be exercising their rights, and the arrest seems to be for them exercising their rights.”\n\nEpps told WBFF-TV that while Jones was released the day after the incident, watching the video was heartbreaking for her.\n\n“I was rattled. I was startled,” she said. “And, although we see this daily, it’s almost as though police brutality is becoming the norm.”\n\nMcLaurin’s mother, retired police officer Tawanda McLaurin, was also upset by the video, saying that she “treated people as humans” while serving with the department.\n\n“He said to me, ‘This could have been another Freddie Gray incident,'” she said. “You know, as a retired officer, how that made me feel?”\n\nTuesday will mark one year to the day since the death of Freddie Gray following his arrest, an incident that sparked protests within the city.\n\nWatch WBFF’s report, as aired on Sunday, below.",

  "latent_31812": "CANCUN, Mexico -- The bodyguards linger in the steakhouse foyer, conspicuous with their handguns in lumpy fanny packs. The bulletproof SUV sits in quick-getaway position outside.\n\nAnd now Lydia Cacho Ribeiro's cellphone rings.\n\n\"Yes, I got in okay,\" Cacho says from an out-of-the-way table. \"I'm fine.\"\n\nCacho sets the phone down, a weary smile forming beneath high cheekbones and dark, deep-set eyes.\n\n\"He was worried,\" she says of her longtime partner, the prominent Mexican editor and columnist Jorge Zepeda Patterson. \"This is my life.\"\n\nA crusade against pedophiles has made Cacho, who will be in Washington tomorrow and Tuesday to be honored by Amnesty International, one of Mexico's most celebrated and imperiled journalists. She is a target in a country where at least 17 journalists have been killed in the past five years and that trailed only Iraq in media deaths during 2006. Do-gooders and victims want to meet her, want to share their stories. Bad guys -- well, they want her in a coffin.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Cacho published a searing exposé of the child abuse and pornography rings flourishing amid the $500-a-night resorts and sugar-white beaches of Cancun. Her book \"The Demons of Eden: The Power That Protects Child Pornography\" chronicles in cringe-inducing detail the alleged habits of wealthy men whose sexual tastes run to 4-year-old girls.\n\nBut her book was just a middling seller, and her fight against child abusers was getting little attention until one afternoon in mid-December 2005 -- the afternoon the cops showed up.\n\nOn that day, seven months after her book was published, Cacho says, police officers from the far-off state of Puebla shoved her into a van outside the women's center she runs on a crumbling side street well removed from Cancun's gaudy hotel strip. They drove her 950 miles across Mexico, she says, jamming gun barrels into her face and taunting her for 20 hours with threats that she would be drowned, raped or murdered. The police have disputed her version of events, saying she was treated well.\n\nCacho found herself in police custody because Mexico's \"Denim King,\" the textile magnate Kamel Nacif, had accused her of defamation, which at the time was a criminal offense under Mexican law. (Inspired by Cacho's case, the Mexican Congress recently passed a law decriminalizing defamation.) Cacho had written that Nacif used his influence to protect a suspected child molester, Cancun hotel owner Jean Succar Kuri, and that one of Succar's alleged victims was certain Nacif also abused underage girls.\n\nCacho's arrest set off a furious chain reaction. She had triggered her car alarm as she was being taken into custody, a predetermined signal to alert her staff to trouble. Friends suspected that the men in uniform were only posing as police. E-mails and phone calls zinged from Cancun to Mexico City, and from there to international human rights groups. While Cacho, who was recovering from pneumonia, tried unsuccessfully to persuade her captors to stop for medicine, her friends were panicking and demanding answers.\n\n\"There was so much fear,\" recalled Lucero Saldaña, then a Mexican senator. \"We were thinking there might have been an attempt on her life, that she might have been kidnapped.\"",

The vigilantes in particular rebuked the Muslim girl for mingling with her classmates and forced her to summon her father by calling him on his mobile phone. While the group hit the boys, the girl was pushed around aggressively.\n\nMeanwhile the self appointed vigilantes who had surrounded the group continued to assault them and even recorded the entire incident on their mobile phones. “The vigilantes even acted against the advice of the elders and their own community members who had arrived at the scene to rescue the youngsters. Moreover, facing pressure from the vigilantes and public humiliation the father of the Muslim girl who reached the spot, unwillingly hit her,” State President of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) Muneer Katipalla said.\n\nAlerted by the locals, the Bajpe police reached the spot and rounded up the entire group. Apparently the police officials, who found the video recording in few mobile devices of the attackers, seized and deleted the video - as they felt it could act as a incitement for communal violence.\n\nThe police also verified the background of the victims and confirmed that most of them knew each other from their school days and had passed out from a nearby Pre-university College together. They were currently pursuing degrees and diplomas at different institutions. The police cited the encounter of the teenage girls with the boys as purely coincidental.\n\nMeanwhile though police questioned the assaulter, owing to local persistence and absence of a complaint from the victim, the police said that they did not register any case. \"We have taken the details of all the youngsters involved in the matter and have warned them. We have also warned them that if we come across any upload or transmission of the assault incident online, we will definitely registered an FIR against them,\" a police official said.\n\nStory provided by www.storyinfinity.com (Subs and Scribes Media Ventures).",
  "latent_31849": "The major international airport of the Netherlands will begin using full-body scanners on passengers flying to the United States to prevent a recurrence of the security breach that allowed a would-be bomber to smuggle explosives onto a flight to Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day, the Dutch authorities said Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Dutch officials said they would deploy the scanners “immediately,” a spokesman for the country’s counterterrorism office said that only 7 of the 15 full-body scanners at the airport, Schiphol, were ready for use. The rest are to be deployed within three weeks after receiving software upgrades.\n\nThe interior minister, Guusje ter Horst, said the United States had previously not wanted Amsterdam to use the full-body scanners, which look through clothing and show the outlines of the body, because of privacy concerns. But Ms. ter Horst said there was now agreement with Washington that “all possible measures will be used on flights to the U.S.”\n\nJudith Sluiter, spokeswoman for the Dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism, said Sunday that the “Dutch authorities have not been given permission to use them on passengers for U.S.-bound flights.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut by Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, Ms. Napolitano had called the Dutch justice minister to urge that the machines be put into use. Homeland Security Department officials also disputed that they had ever prohibited the Dutch from using the machines for America-bound passengers. About 40 full-body scanners are used in airports across the United States, but passengers can choose to be patted down as an alternative.",

  "latent_32016": "Graduate student Dana Simmons looks at an image she took of a brain cell.\n\n\"I grew up training as a ballet dancer and I always wondered how people can make such precise movements, especially while jumping or rotating in the air.\"\n\nDana Simmons, a graduate student in Neurobiology at the University of Chicago, became interested in neuroscience through her experiences with ballet.\n\n\"In ballet you have very complex movements. When you jump in the air you need to know where the ground is without looking at it,\" said Simmons. \"I've always been interested in the cerebellum because it plays a big role in balance, posture, and learning new movements.\"\n\nSimmons' research focuses on how autism affects the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for motor learning, posture, and balance.\n\n\"Generally, people think of autism as a social disorder, but a lot of patients also have motor symptoms,\" said Simmons. \"It is an often overlooked symptom, and that's why we look at the cerebellum.\"\n\nSimmons makes adjustments to the microscope she uses to examine signaling in brain cells.\n\nSimmons' work in the lab of Christian Hansel, PhD, professor of in the Department of Neurobiology, focuses on understanding how the patterns of communication differ for the brain cells (neurons) in an autistic versus non-autistic brain, using a genetic mouse model. Looking at neurons under the microscope, she measures the electrical currents to see if the learning and memory processes are altered. Simmons injects fluorescent dye into the cell and uses lasers to visually track the currents.\n\n\"Normally, when we take an image of a cell, we have the lasers on but not the background light. One day, I accidentally left the background light on and got all this extra color,\" said Simmons. \"I thought – wow, this is art!\"\n\nMotivated by the artistic nature of her research, Simmons participated in the Bridge Residency program from the SciArt Center in New York, a program designed to have arts and sciences collaborate and create something that encompasses both. Partnered with Richelle Gribble, a California-based artist interested in art related to networks and interconnectivity, Simmons got to explore the artistic side of her science.\n\n\"I began looking at the images of the neurons more carefully and started looking for other patterns in nature that resemble this 'tree-like structure,' like river tributaries, blood vessel networks, antlers.\"\n\nSimmons and Gribble created an illustrated book, called The Trees Inside Our Brain, to explain the science behind Simmons' research and included a scientific myth-busting section – Do we only use 10% of our brain? Is my brain full? Because of this work, Simmons will be presented with the New England BioLabs Passion in Science Award in the Arts and Creativity Category on November 3rd.\n\nSimmons' science-art has found a home locally on the walls of the newly dedicated Grossman Institute for Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology, and Human Behavior and nationally as a page in Thermo Fisher Scientific's scientific coloring book, inspiring people with her work.\n\nAccording to Simmons, exploring the artistic aspects of her research has enhanced her graduate school experience.\n\n\"I'm really interested in using science-art to improve science literacy. There can be a lot of resistance to science,\" said Simmons. \"If I have really striking images, I hope that I can bring people in, encourage curiosity, and spark their interest.\"\n\nTo see and learn more about Simmons' art visit http://www.dana-simmons.com/",
  "latent_32021": "Submitted by Charles Hugh-Smith of OfTwoMinds blog,\n\nIf conventional labor and finance capital have lost their scarcity value, then the era in which financialization reaped big profits is ending.\n\nWhy is wealth/income inequality soaring? The easy answer is of course the infinite greed of Wall Street fat-cats and the politicos they buy/own.\n\nBut greed can't be the only factor, for greed is hardly unknown in the bottom 90% as it is in the top .1%. The only difference between the guy who took out a liar loan to buy a house he couldn't afford so he could flip it for a fat profit and the mortgage broker who instructed him on how to scam the system and the crooked banker dumping toxic mortgage-backed securities on the Widows and Orphans Fund of Norway is the scale of the scam.\n\nThe difference isn't greed, it's the ability to avoid the consequences or have the taxpayers eat the losses, i.e. moral hazard. The bottom 90%er with the liar loan mortgage and the flip-this-house strategy eventually suffered the consequences when Housing Bubble 1.0 blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nMoral hazard describes the difference between decisions made by those with skin in the game, i.e. those who will absorb the losses from their bets that go south, and those who've transferred the risks and losses to others.\n\nThe too-big-to-fail banks that bought political protection simply shifted the losses to taxpayers. Then the Federal Reserve helpfully paid banks for deposits at the Fed while reducing the amount banks had to pay on depositors' savings to bear-zero, effectively rewarding the banks with free money for ripping off the taxpayers.\n\nAmerica's financialized cartel-state system institutionalizes moral hazard. This is one cause of rising inequality, as the super-wealthy are immunized by their purchase of political influence.\n\nThe top .1%'s share of the pie has been rising in the era of financialization and institutionalized moral hazard, everyone else's share has declined:\n\nBut that may not be enough to describe the decades of stagnation in incomes of the bottom 90%.\n\nThe U.S. economy (along with the global economy) is undergoing a sea change equivalent to an industrial revolution, only this time it isn't just industrial, it's digital.\n\nWhat's scarce is changing, and since profits flow to what's scarce, that's upending the whole chain of value creation. As Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee, and Michael Spence explain in their 2014 article New World Order: Labor, Capital, and Ideas in the Power Law Economy, the gains from the digital economy follow a power law distribution: the few at the top reap the majority of the gains while the dregs are distributed to the majority below.\n\nThis is akin to the Pareto Distribution, something I have mentioned here many times over the years. This is also known as the 80/20 rule, as the top 20% typically gather 80% of whatever economic unit is being measured: land, sales, etc.\n\nThe 80/20 rule distills down to the 64/4 rule, as 80% of 80 is 64 and 20% of 20 is 4: the top 4% reap 64% of the gains.\n\nWe can see that the top 10% in the U.S. own 74% of the wealth--a rough approximation of the Pareto Distribution:\n\nSpence et al.: Machines are substituting for more types of human labor than ever before. As they replicate themselves, they are also creating more capital. This means that the real winners of the future will not be the providers of cheap labor or the owners of ordinary capital, both of whom will be increasingly squeezed by automation. Fortune will instead favor a third group: those who can innovate and create new products, services, and business models.\n\nThe distribution of income for this creative class typically takes the form of a power law, with a small number of winners capturing most of the rewards and a long tail consisting of the rest of the participants. So in the future, ideas will be the real scarce inputs in the world -- scarcer than both labor and capital -- and the few who provide good ideas will reap huge rewards.\n\nHigher education is one example of the declining scarcity value of old models of labor and capital. When college degrees were scarce, college graduates commanded a high scarcity value. Now that tens of millions of people have degrees, the scarcity value is falling dramatically.\n\nIn response, people have worked their way up the academic food chain, earning masters degrees and PhDs. But now many of these higher degrees are also over-abundant, and the scarcity value of MBAs, etc. is declining.\n\nThese realities will have major impacts. If conventional labor and finance capital have lost their scarcity value, then the era in which financialization reaped big profits is ending.\n\nIf labor has little scarcity value, and productive ideas are what's now scarce, then what has leverage isn't a college degree--it's the ability to move across multiple fields of knowledge, learning new skills and seeking out new collaborations--the attributes of what I call mobile creatives, a new class I describe in my book Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy.\n\nWe can't wait around hoping the Power Elites relinquish their lock on monetary and political power: we have to individually seek out what's scarce in the emerging economy and learn the skills and make the connections to move up the value creation scale on our own power.",

  "latent_32717": "Prime Minister Stephen Harper has privately fumed to his inner circle that under the leadership of Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, the Supreme Court of Canada has become a “sociology seminar” that emasculates the power of Parliament, according to a new book.\n\nThe biography, titled Stephen Harper, provides a thorough account of Harper’s personal life and political career.\n\nIt explores his legendary temper and mood swings while also chronicling how Harper turned the once-divided conservative movement into a political success story that allowed him to win three elections, govern for a decade, and change the country.\n\nThe book, written by Globe and Mail journalist John Ibbitson, was originally set for publication in September. But with the early call of the Oct. 19 election, it is now available Tuesday as an e-book and hard copies will be in stores Aug. 18.\n\nAmong the issues covered in the book is Harper’s distrust of the courts and legal community — and his unprecedented public criticism last year of McLachlin, which critics said was an effort to intimidate the court.\n\n“The nadir of Stephen Harper’s prime ministership came not during the Senate expenses scandal, but in the spring of 2014, when he got himself into a very public dust-up with Beverley McLachlin,” writes Ibbitson.\n\nHarper alleged that McLachlin tried to interfere in the appointment of Federal Court Judge Marc Nadon to the top court — an allegation she denied and which drew broad support from the legal community.\n\nIbbitson writes that Harper’s criticism of the chief justice set a “dangerous precedent” and now ranks as one of his “most discreditable acts” as prime minister.\n\n“Not only did he lose the fight; he tarnished his reputation and damaged what should be the sacrosanct separation of powers between executive and judiciary.”\n\nIn his book, Ibbitson writes of how Harper’s distrust of judges stems from a long-standing concern over judicial activism in the wake of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe book reveals that once Harper took power in 2006, he grew increasingly frustrated with how the court’s rulings were overturning his legislative policies, and how it had established itself as the “unofficial opposition” to his government.\n\n“Harper has repeatedly complained to his inner circle that, under Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, the Court has become a sociology seminar, with the judges/professors able to turn their theories into laws, and Parliament unable to stop them,” according to the book.\n\nIbbitson writes that Conservatives lamented the advent of the Charter in the 1980s, fearing that courts would override Parliament.\n\nThe top court “obliged their worst fears” with rulings that have limited police powers, struck down the abortion law, and extended civil rights to gays and lesbians.\n\n“For Stephen Harper, this was simply another way in which liberal urban elites in Toronto and Ottawa and Montreal imposed their agenda on the rest of the country.”\n\nIbbitson writes that while Liberal governments accepted judicial activism, Harper was furious.\n\n“Harper had seethed against the smug, stifling certainty of these elites all his adult life. That is why, once he came to power, he set out to radically reform the justice system.”\n\nUnder the Conservative government’s law-and-order agenda, Harper moved to transform the justice system with mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving guns, drugs and sexual assaults, and with new rules that gave convicts less credit for time served before their conviction.\n\nBut the court has imposed limits on some of Harper’s tough-on-crime laws.\n\nThe “breaking point” came with Harper’s appointment of Nadon, who had a record of “judicial deference.”\n\nA legal challenge to Nadon’s eligibility — he was not a member of the Quebec bar and was being appointed to a constitutionally protected spot for a Quebecer — found its way right to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court ruled in March 2014 that Nadon was ineligible.\n\n“Harper was furious with the ruling. The Court had set itself up as the unofficial opposition to his prime ministership.”\n\nThe book says Harper was “convinced” McLachlin had meddled in Nadon’s selection process.\n\n“Staff talked the prime minister down from launching a full, public assault on the impartiality of the Court, but he still went pretty far.”\n\nHarper’s office released a statement saying the prime minister had refused to take a call from McLachlin about the appointment because it would be “inadvisable and inappropriate.”\n\nMcLachlin insisted it was customary for her to be consulted, that she only wanted the government to be aware of eligibility issues, and she had never expressed her own opinions about possible appointees.\n\nmkennedy@ottawacitizen.com\n\ntwitter.com/Mark_Kennedy_"
